We once again condemn unreservedly the actions of the Russian Government in violating Ukraine's sovereignty and internationally recognised borders, its attacks against Ukrainian people, property and infrastructure, and its initiation of a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.  The invasion of Ukraine and the military assault we have witnessed are a criminal affront to the civilised world and a threat to the peace and security of people everywhere.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish people have been appalled at the heartbreaking scenes of civilians being killed, being injured and fleeing their homes for their lives.

Any attempt by Putin or his regime to justify his actions as a response to NATO are without foundation and are merely a means of distraction from his own culpability.  It is his military aggression that is bringing death and destruction to Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  The international community has an obligation through diplomacy, support for Ukraine and strong sanctions against the Russian Federation to bring about a peaceful resolution to stop this horrific war and to see all Russian forces leave Ukraine.

Now, as a member of the United Nations Security Council, we must do everything we can to end this unjust war and force complete Russian military withdrawal.<\/p> <p> Will the Taoiseach outline how he intends to intensify sanctions in order to ensure a Russian withdrawal and the right of Ukraine to a peaceful future as a sovereign independent state?

No one in this House or anywhere else should be under any illusions about the seriousness of the situation Europe and the world faces right now, this afternoon.  Vladimir Putin, who is a bully and a thug, has unleashed an unprovoked and unjustifiable war on the people of Ukraine, committing war crimes in the process, as we are witnessing.  As President Zelenskiy said most movingly to the European Parliament this morning, every day now in Ukraine is someone's last day.  I was very struck both by the contribution he made there and, indeed, to the European Heads of State last Thursday at the European Council, when he said to us it might be the last day he would speak to us because he is number one on the list, along with his family.<\/p>  <p>  It is difficult to comprehend.  A week ago, it would have been unimaginable to see what we are witnessing now: a 40-mile-long convoy of Russian troops and heavy military equipment grinding their way towards Kyiv, where children and their families take shelter in the underground.  Just hours ago, Liberty Square in Kharkiv was devastated by a missile strike.  As President Zelenskiy said, it is a city where there are up to 20 universities and the area is frequented by thousands of young students in the full expression of freedom of choice, expression and so forth.  Residential neighbourhoods in cities all over Ukraine, where ordinary, decent people were going about their normal lives, are today facing barrages of illegal cluster munitions, which we, well over a decade ago, worked as a country to ban in an international treaty.  Caithimid deireadh a chur leis an gcogadh seo.  Caithfidh Vladimir Putin deireadh a chur leis an bhfor&eacute;igean agus leis na hionsaithe uaf&aacute;sacha ar leana&iacute; na h&Uacute;cr&aacute;ine agus ar theaghlaigh &eacute;ags&uacute;la ar fud na h&Uacute;cr&aacute;ine because what we are witnessing is scarcely believable but it is very real for the people of Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Our response, I agree, must, therefore, be unprecedented and it has been unprecedented.  Over the past ten years, and certainly since 2014, I have been arguing and debating in this House about the consistent violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity by Russia.  Now it has reached an appalling stage in terms of an all-out assault on Ukraine and the Ukrainian people and territory.  Before leaving for Brussels last week for the emergency European Council, I said I wanted to see the most comprehensive and widest set of sanctions deployed by the European Union.  That has happened in respect of the sanctions that have now been put in place by the EU, along with the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan and others.  I have been very heartened by the unprecedented commitment to humanitarian care and support for Ukrainians.  I believe the European Union genuinely has responded with absolute solidarity with Ukraine and with absolute speed in its response in terms of the unprecedented scale of sanctions that have been deployed, in particular, the sanctions against the Central Bank of Russia in terms of it not being in a position to access its European and foreign reserves, Russian banks being locked out of the SWIFT mechanism, the listing of key individuals who are part of the coterie of leadership around Vladimir Putin and much more in terms of the industrial base of Russia.<\/p> <p>It is an extraordinary package of sanctions that people did not believe would happen.  Ireland did not hesitate to facilitate the deployment of the European peace facility and &euro;500 million to assist people in Ukraine, Ireland's support being in terms of non-lethal weapons.<\/p> <p> The biggest challenge facing the country is that we must be very, very generous in the refugee crisis that will undoubtedly flow as a result of this war.  It will be beyond anything we have comprehended before.  I have said to my colleagues in government and the Departments that we must put to one side what we might have considered to be the norms in responding in a humanitarian way to the plight of the Ukrainian people.  The Secretary General of my Department is convening with other Secretaries General and Government Ministers to make sure we scale up the response in the context of the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding before our eyes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100004#B00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646143800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Nobody is under any illusion but that Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation are the aggressors in this scenario and they have brazenly breached international law.

We need to see an intensification of this package of sanctions.  Vladimir Putin, and all others who might choose to violate international law and brutalise people, need to understand that the international community can and will put our foot down.  I support the Taoiseach&rsquo;s call for generosity towards those fleeing war and conflict.  We must extend the most generous of Irish receptions to those people and families.

Furthermore, financial transactions with many Russian banks and companies have been prohibited.  That means it is very difficult for Russia to sell exports and to buy imports on international markets, which will be significant.  European Union banks are prohibited from accepting deposits over a certain amount from Russian individuals and, as I said, the European assets of the Central Bank of Russia have been frozen, restricting its ability to prop up the value of the Russian rouble.  Many Russian banks are excluded from the SWIFT payment network and that will hamper Russia&rsquo;s ability to trade with the outside world, particularly the major global economies.  The sanctions are already having an effect, with the Russian rouble crashing to record lows on foreign exchange markets.  Russian purchasing power in international markets has also dropped and inflation in Russia is likely to rise significantly.  The Central Bank of Russia has been forced to hike interest rates from 9% to 20% to prop up the currency.  Interest rates at these levels, if sustained, will severely damage the Russian economy.  Russia&rsquo;s stockmarkets are shut and there are signs of increased stress in the Russian banking system, with media reports of long queues at ATMs.  Some analysts have predicted that the stress on the system could lead to a run on Russian banks.<\/p>  <p>  We have to be in for the long haul, which is a phrase that was used consistently last Thursday evening.

It is clear Kyiv will soon be under siege with massive invading armies surrounding the city.  The people of Kyiv, who are watching this on satellite images as a convoy approaches must be experiencing unimaginable fear.<\/p><p>Ireland is a neutral country but, as has been said before and as I will say again, this does not mean we are neutral on the invasion of Ukraine, which is a sovereign country and nor does it mean we cannot act.  I welcome the Government's lifting of visa restrictions and donation of humanitarian relief which have been announced in recent days.  However, we have been slow to act against the Russians in the past.<\/p><p>It has long been reported, including by John Mooney, that the Russian Embassy in Dublin is being used as a base for espionage operations across Europe.  This was confirmed when the Government used legislation to block a proposed expansion of the embassy, on security grounds in 2020.  Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, suggested that Russian diplomats or some operatives who are in Ireland and may not be diplomats could be expelled in coming days.

I have no doubt that the vast majority of Russian people do not support this war.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the diplomatic issue, first, anything we do should be in consort with our European partners.  European strength and unity of purpose are very important in respect of responding to Russia.  That has been a hallmark, so far, of the European Union's response, working with the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and other countries that hold up democratic and universal principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and freedom of speech and movement.  Those are fundamental values.  We share those values with other countries.  Those countries are uniting in opposing what the Russian leadership is doing.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the ambassadorial issue and diplomatic channels, no country is proposing the expulsion of any ambassador so far.<\/p> <p>Our view is that it is important from a practical point of view in looking after our citizens either in Russia or Ukraine that we keep all channels open right now.  We have a limited presence in the embassy in Moscow with six individuals all told.  They have a fundamental function to look after Irish citizens in Russia and also to articulate our views and keep abreast of what is happening within that jurisdiction and different jurisdictions.  I am very conscious of that.<\/p> <p> While I understand fully the revulsion and anger towards how the Russian ambassador has spoken on this war, nonetheless, we have to keep cool heads, hold our nerve and keep the fundamentals in front of us all the time in terms of looking after Irish citizens, in particular.<\/p> <p> On the IFSC, entities in the financial services sector in Ireland are within scope of the sanction measures agreed unanimously by the 27 EU member states.  All natural and legal persons in the State are obliged to comply with the European Union sanctions.  A breach of financial sanctions is a criminal offence.  Accounts, funds or other assets must be frozen without delay so that they cannot be made available directly or indirectly to the sanctioned person, entity or body.  The sanctions include a prohibition on the listing and provision of services on EU trading venues, including Euronext Dublin, which was formerly the Irish Stock Exchange, in relation to shares of Russian state-owned entities.<\/p> <p> The Central Bank of Ireland has undertaken an initial review of any links between the approximately 3,000 Irish domiciled special purpose entities and Russian entities.  Some 34 of these 3,000 entities have a Russian sponsor, meaning that they were established on behalf of a Russian company.  The total assets of these special purpose entities is approximately &euro;36 billion, largely comprised of loans to Russian companies.  Of these 34 entities, three have been identified as being directly linked to individuals or financial institutions covered in the 23 February round of EU sanctions.  Work is ongoing in respect of the subsequent sanction rounds.<\/p> <p> With regard to authorised investment funds, the Central Bank has advised that total Russian assets held at 31 December 2021 are estimated at &euro;11.4 billion or 0.3% of the total Irish fund assets of &euro;3.8 trillion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100006#D00300","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646144400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100007#E00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1646144400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>That 0.3% of the total Irish fund assets of &euro;3.8 trillion is evenly split between equities and bonds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100007#E00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1646144400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100007#E00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1646144400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I will finish for completeness and transparency.

Julia Marciniak, who is originally from Poland, and Lenka Laiermanova, who is originally from the Czech Republic, were found to have been sacked by the Ivy restaurant on Dawson Street for trade union activity.  These two experienced waitresses joined the newly opened Ivy restaurant in 2018.  They found that customer tips were being taken by management and were being used to make up the difference between their contracted wages and the minimum wage.  After Lenka contacted me through my constituency office, I arranged for her and for a group of her fellow workers to meet the trade union Unite, which they joined.  It sought negotiation rights with the Ivy, which were rejected.<\/p><p>It is quite rare for an unfair dismissal case over trade union activity to be won in the Labour Court and the case has a wider significance.  That significance is that while the Unfair Dismissals Act only kicks in after one year of work with a specific employer, there are exceptions to this, one of which is trade union activity.  However, that one-year rule gives some employers and managers a licence to dismiss workers on a whim.  As Julia said to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, &ldquo;if you ask about your breaks, you can be dismissed.  See ya!&rdquo;  Both Julia and Lenka, as well as Unite&rsquo;s regional secretary, Brendan Ogle, have called for the Act to be amended to give all workers protection against unfair dismissal from day one of their employment.<\/p><p>The other aspect of this is that there is no penalty under the Act for employers that are found to have unfairly dismissed staff.  All the Labour Court can do is make an employer pay for loss of earnings for up to two years after an unfair dismissal.  As both Julia and Lenka found work and new jobs very quickly, the compensation to be paid by the Ivy is quite limited.  There should be penalties against employers that are found to have unfairly dismissed workers.<\/p><p>Finally, will the Taoiseach join me in congratulating Julia and Lenka and their trade union, Unite, on this victory over a very exploitive, bullying employer, as well as encouraging all workers who are suffering low pay, who are being bullied by employers and managers and are being denied their rights under labour law to join a union and to stand up for themselves and their workmates?

On the specifics of the case, the Deputy is saying that the tips were essentially being retained or kept or were being used part of wages, which is an absolutely unacceptable practice.  There is separate work being done by the Government in relation to that.

That needs to be absolutely clarified and in the context of the legislation going through the House, the T&aacute;naiste is anxious to clarify that and make it as transparent and simplified as possible in respect of the reality on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of amendments to the Unfair Dismissals Act, a balance has to be struck between competing rights, practical issues with employment and so forth.  Again, that is a matter we keep under constant review.

There are currently 3,521 people on approved housing lists waiting for housing in Tiobraid &Aacute;rann.  Rents in the county were on average 7.7% higher in the final three months of 2020 than they had been one year previously.  The national average listed rent is now &euro;908, up 61% from its lowest point.  The property rental crisis is now at its worst point in more than a decade, with so limited a supply of housing.  Tipperary County Council - agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leo si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag obair air seo - is meeting its Rebuilding Ireland targets for 2021 and is expected to exceed its targets this year, but that is simply not sufficient to meet the demand.<\/p> <p>Tipperary County Council delivered 840 units between 2018 and 2021 and aims to meet its new-build target of 230 units between now and the year end.  Unfortunately, these targets will go nowhere near to address the acute problem that is there.<\/p> <p> My office and, indeed, many other offices are inundated with people desperately seeking housing.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na daoine ag obair i m&rsquo;oifig f&eacute;in freisin.  People are desperate.  These are families who are currently living in homes where the landlord is selling up and they cannot find alternative accommodation, applicants approved for housing but who cannot find accommodation under the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, returning Irish emigrants who cannot find accommodation in their local areas to rent or buy and young couples - this is a big bone of contention - who have sites but who are being refused planning permission and cannot find accommodation to rent or buy either.<\/p> <p> There is also a serious disconnect in respect of the current income limits to qualify for social housing in Tiobraid &Aacute;rann.  The Tipperary County Council cap is &euro;25,000 for a single person and &euro;27,500 for an average family of two adults and two children - a figure that has not been reviewed since 2011.  I am calling on the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the Taoiseach and the Cabinet to review this immediately.  It is causing a considerable problem, especially when we see that an average four-bedroom house in the county costs approximately &euro;2,100 per month to rent, meaning that a family with an income of &euro;28,000 is expected to pay 51% of their income on rent without any assistance.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin uaf&aacute;sach ar fad.  In the face of the significant increase in rent in the county and across the country, as well as the considerable increases in the cost of living, these limits are wholly inappropriate and need to be reviewed urgently.  I reiterate I am calling on the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and on the Government as a whole, to act here.  We keep talking and having aspirations and good intentions but they are not being delivered.  People cannot afford or they cannot get HAP.  There are people sleeping in tents beside the River Suir in the beautiful Cluain Meala and I meet them on the street.  I am sure other Deputies also do so in all the counties.  The policies that the Government has, with not cutting timber and the insulation costs as a result of oil prices and carbon taxes, are driving up the cost of building.  We are in a perfect storm.  We need action and we need it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100009#G00400","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646145300,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  The issues concerning housing in Tipperary are ones that are reflected across the entire country.  The only response to it is a sustainable comprehensive one, which is what the Government has provided in the form of Housing for All.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All provides a comprehensive set of measures and targets with financial backing to increase housing supply.  That is the most fundamental thing we can do in relation to the housing situation, which is difficult and challenging for many people, particularly the scarcity of supply.<\/p>  <p>  Basically, Housing for All is committing to the creation on average of 33,000 homes per annum over the lifetime of the plan.  We have had setbacks with Covid-19 in 2020 and 2021, in terms of the lockdowns which slowed down construction in housing, but there has been a very significant rebound since then, with 31,000 commencements in the year to January 2022, which is a 48.4% increase year on year.  That is the highest rolling 12-month total since comparable data were first published.  Construction of 1,861 homes commenced in January 2022.  That figure is up 35% on January 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 20,400 houses were completed in 2021, while the number of apartments completed increased by over 30% for the year.  Progress is being made and we have got to make much, much more.  It really is about supply on the house construction side, and then a variety of offers to people including affordable housing, in terms of the local authorities supporting affordable housing with State backing, social housing, of which we want to construct up to 10,000 annual with the approved social housing bodies and the local authorities, cost rental, which will be increasingly more significant as an option for people and we want to develop a critical mass of supply on the cost rental front, as well as giving supports to help to buy through the shared equity scheme to young first-time buyers.  Last year, approximately 46,000 homes were purchased, with over 30% of these being bought by first-time buyers.<\/p> <p>Approximately 40,000 planning permissions were granted up to quarter 3 in 2021.<\/p> <p> HAP is a huge provision from the State.  At the end of quarter 3 in 2021, over 97,500 HAP tenancies had been set up since the scheme commenced.  This comprises more than 62,000 households actively in receipt of HAP support and over 33,400 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme.  Budget 2022 allocated &euro;585 million in Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme.  That will enable a further projected 14,000 households to be supported, in addition to the supports to existing recipients.<\/p> <p> There are facilities whereby each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment of up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100010#H00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646145600,"counter":34,"content":"<p>In my considered opinion, HAP has been an unmitigated disaster.

The need for this panel is a direct consequences of the opaque method by which the Government appointed the Secretary General to the Department of Health last year and the Government party leaders&rsquo; decision to attach an arbitrary 40% pay increase to that position.

He proposes the establishment of an external review panel to make recommendations to strengthen the recruitment processes of senior public service posts and the process for determining the terms and conditions of employment.  To ensure transparency and objectivity in the process, it is proposed that the panel will consist of three members from different relevant backgrounds with secretarial support to be provided by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are currently examining the issues and will recommend terms of reference, scope of the review and potential membership of the review panel.<\/p>  <p>  This Oireachtas, in previous iterations, already passed financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  The process of unwinding the financial emergency legislation commenced under the Lansdowne Road agreement between unions and employers and the State, which covered the period 2016 to 2018, with the remainder of the process largely completed under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  The final elements of pay restoration have continued under Building Momentum, a new public service agreement for 2021 to 2022.  Salary rebates up to &euro;150,000, which account for 99% of the public service, have been fully restored.  Section 20 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 states that the Minister, by order, shall provide for completion of pay restoration to public servants paid an annual basic salary of more than &euro;150,000 by 1 July 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the consideration now being given to an external review to examine the processes and procedures around the recruitment of senior public servants, as well as the process for pay determination at senior levels, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is currently examining potential options around how and when this final element of restoration will be implemented.

In the first instance, I support NESC's work with regard to the shared island unit and the work it has done in terms of greater potential for cross-Border co-operation projects, particularly in respect of health, which has been one of the more effective cross-Border areas over a long time and, in particular, in respect of paediatric health and cardiovascular health in paediatrics.  The one cardiac surgical centre on the island enjoyed political support across the island irrespective of political background.<\/p>  <p>  That scope and potential also exists for mental health.  The shared island unit stands ready to financially support any cross-Border project that is developed by respective mental health agencies, North or South.  I would be very keen to progress that whether it is in a variety of areas under the mental health umbrella or otherwise.  That is something we will continue to work practically towards realising.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of Deputy Barry's points on climate change, I accept the conclusions of the IPCC report but we need to start matching the rhetoric with reality.  Any time the Government proposes anything, it gets opposed.  In his contribution, the Deputy said he wants data centres banned, retrofit spread more widely and carbon tax abolished.  I simply do not know how he is going to do all that.<\/p>  <p>  We will be including council tenants and council houses will be retrofitted.  There is a separate programme for that and a programme under the retrofit scheme for low-income families in respect of energy efficiency.  An unprecedented allocation of funding has been provided under the retrofit programme.  In fact, we aim to do in ten years what we did in the last 20 years.  We want to double the numbers we did since the year 2000 over the next ten years.  We also will be providing substantial grants to people to insulate attics and walls and so forth and then to do a deeper retrofit.<\/p>  <p>  The resources we are providing are extraordinary but they have to be raised for the scheme to be sustainable over the ten-year period.  That is why we put the carbon tax into law, which gets attacked all the time.  Whatever measure we bring in to deal with climate gets attacked or undermined, which leads me to believe that people want to keep delaying dealing with climate change.  That is the biggest danger we face in this country and all over the world.  People want to keep delaying the action that is necessary and that will involve a bit of pain and readjustment.  People want to keep on delaying it; we can no longer do so.  People may attack our targets and say they are not ambitious enough, but God knows they are quite ambitious, and they will be very challenging over the next five years.<\/p>  <p>  Whatever chance we have, however, we need co-operation and everybody on board because they are extraordinarily challenging.  All sectors will have to play their part in respect of climate change.  The NESC has pointed all this out in its reports.  Likewise, the most recent report is quite depressing in terms of where the world is heading in respect of climate change and biodiversity.  We must make very strong efforts around biodiversity.<\/p>  <p>  I was in Fota Wildlife Park at the weekend to meet the executives there in terms of their plans.  The work they are doing in biodiversity is quite extraordinary-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100019#T00500","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1646149800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Tell Coillte to stop selling the forests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100019#T00600","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1646149800,"counter":220,"content":"<p>-----and quite effective in terms of European wild bison, for example.

We need to be funding organisations like Fota Wildlife Park, Dublin Zoo and those which are involved in global interbreeding, breeding programmes around wildlife and protecting endangered species.  That is what we need to be doing more of but we need resources to do that.  We need a re-engineering of our economy towards the green economy and also the decarbonised economy.<\/p>  <p>  We have to change how data centres are developed in terms of back-up generation but also in terms of renewables being used by those who wish to construct them, and offsetting technologies being deployed by such companies.  We have, therefore, a twin-track approach on the economy, which incorporates digitalisation.  Digital transformation will happen but all that has to be borne along with the green economy.  NESC has reported on all those issues.<\/p> <p> Deputy Devlin raised a key point.  He summed it up when he said that we have to do things differently this time in respect of the human trauma and crisis that will emerge as a result of the appalling assault on the Ukrainian people.  The Deputy referred to families in his constituency who would gladly house people.  We will need that in addition to what the State can do order to deal with the sheer numbers that could come into the EU and, by extension, Ireland.  We have to play our part as an EU member state in sharing the burden and by being generous and open.  We have to talk to our educational partners and stakeholders to facilitate children to attend our schools.  There is also the social protection aspect.<\/p> <p> Deputy O'Connor raised a matter that I will ask NESC about.  He made a very good point about long-term renters in Ireland, as well as what are the correct policy frameworks to deal with them.  NESC has done some work on this already.  I will ask NESC about a more comprehensive approach to that issue.  I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s interest in it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the Housing Commission, which earlier announced details of the referendum sub-committee that will examine the complex constitutional issues around housing rights.  The Housing Commission will propose appropriate wording to the Government for a referendum on this matter.  The sub-committee is being chaired by Dr. Ailbhe O'Neill, who is a barrister with extensive practical experience in constitutional law, a former adviser to two referendum commissions and a member of the school of law at Trinity College Dublin.  She is joined on the sub-committee by Sorcha Edwards, secretary general of Housing Europe, Pat Doyle, CEO of the Peter McVerry Trust, and Patricia King, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  In addition to these four members of the Housing Commission, the sub-committee has been supplemented by external members, including Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, the former Chief Justice and a former referendum commissioner, Gerard Whyte, professor of law at Trinity College Dublin, Rosalind Dixon, professor of law at the University of New South Wales, and Madeline MacKenzie, parliamentary counsel in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Parliamentary Counsel Office.  I am sure that the Deputies will agree that that is a very strong sub-committee.  It will focus on this very important issue, in respect of which there is a commitment in the programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100019#T00700","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Programmes","time":1646150400,"counter":222,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100020#U00150"},{"type":"question","time":1646150400,"counter":223,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[7687\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100020#U00200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he is planning to update his Department's Strategy Statement 2021-2023.","asker":"1478","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1646150400,"counter":224,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[7690\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100020#U00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he is planning to update his Department's Strategy Statement 2021-2023.","asker":"1628","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1646150400,"counter":225,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[9279\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100020#U00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the progress of the implementation of the Strategy Statement 2021 of his Department.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1646150400,"counter":226,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[10110\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100020#U00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he is planning to update his Department's Strategy Statement 2021-2023.","asker":"1522","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1646150400,"counter":227,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[11354\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100020#U00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he is planning to update his Department's Strategy Statement 2021-2023.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1646150400,"counter":228,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[11429\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100020#U00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will provide a report on the implementation of the Strategy Statement 2021-2023 of his Department.","asker":"1481","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1646150400,"counter":229,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[11430\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100020#U00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will provide a report on the implementation of his Department's Strategy Statement 2021-2023.","asker":"1572","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1646150400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Sorry for standing up at the wrong time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100020#U00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1646150400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>The Deputy is as enthusiastic as ever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100020#U01000","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1646150400,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Eager.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100020#U01100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1646150400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>The Deputy is eager and he always has been.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100020#U01200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1646150400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>The real Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100020#U01300","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1646150400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>We will switch it around.

One issue I observe is the vulnerability of Europe.  The European Union cherishes democracy, social systems, education, open and free trade and so on.  All of that is now vulnerable.  Given the scale of Putin's forces on the European Continent, be it naval, the air force or the more than 150,000 troops with missiles and every type of advanced weapon, can we honestly say it will not go beyond Ukraine?  Talk to people in Estonia, the other Baltic countries or Poland.  They do not see NATO as a warmonger.  I said this in response to the Deputy last week.  The grandmother of the Prime Minster of Estonia was deported to Siberia when Stalin took over after the Nazis.  Her mother was six months old at the time.

In the early hours of the morning, Russian forces began a large-scale assault on the sovereign nation of Ukraine, involving invasion by land, sea and air.  Russia mounted this invasion from multiple fronts, including Ukraine's northern border with Belarus.  Russia, a country of 17 million sq km &ndash; and with the added utilisation of Belarus's territory - tried to suddenly overwhelm its neighbour of 604,000 sq km in the middle of the night.  The previous evening, the D&aacute;il had heard statements on the security situation in Europe.  The solidarity with Ukraine, expressed in the presence of the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland, was widespread and sincere across this House.  The message from this House was unwavering: Ireland supports Ukraine.  That evening &ndash; not even a week ago - we were clear in our condemnation of President Putin's decision to recognise the non-Government controlled areas in the Ukrainian oblasts of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent entities, and we were, of course, deeply concerned by Russia's military build-up and aggressive stance towards Ukraine.  That was only six days ago. <\/p><p>Less than a week later, we gather again, united in horror at the outrageous and naked aggression which we have seen from Russia against its neighbour. Through its decision to launch an invasion, violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, the Russian Federation has brought war to European soil.  It has flagrantly violating the UN Charter and the core principles of international law.  Its actions have horrified and disgusted the world.<\/p><p>I have been asked questions in recent days about Ireland's military neutrality - we heard some of them again today - and the impact on our neutrality by some of our responses to the Ukraine crisis.  Ireland is militarily neutral, that is, we are not a member of a military alliance.  Let me say clearly, however, that we are not, and will never be, politically neutral in the face of the bombardment of cities, the targeting of civilian infrastructure, and attempts to lay siege to a city of 3 million men, women and children - people who have never asked for war and who wish only to live in a democratic, peaceful, stable and free country and make their own sovereign decisions about their foreign and security policy.<\/p><p>Like all of us in this House, I have been deeply impressed by the resolve shown by the Ukrainian people and government.  As we speak, the capital, Kyiv, and the second largest city, Kharkiv, remain in Ukrainian hands despite intensive attacks against both.  The dignity and heroism of so many ordinary Ukrainians has been simply extraordinary.  The leadership shown by President Zelenskiy and Foreign Minister Kuleba has been exemplary.<\/p><p>In response to Ukraine's application for EU membership, I say that Ireland is a strong supporter of Ukraine's European aspiration and making that happen as soon as possible.  Ukraine has shown extraordinary determination to uphold the values of the EU.  We have seen a heroic effort over the past number of days to defend not only Ukraine, but a value system and a way of life that they want to pursue.  Ukrainians in their thousands are willing to lay down their lives to protect that dream.<\/p><p>I devoted some time in my statement on Wednesday last to the EU response.  In my 24 years in politics, I have never seen EU member states as unified and with as much resolve as I have seen on this issue.  In the space of five days, we have imposed three packages of unprecedented sanctions against Russia; hitting the web of companies, financial institutions, state institutions and agencies, oligarchs, government members and media interests that surround President Putin and enable the corruption and violence that we have seen on such naked display in the past week.<\/p><p>These actions include: the closure of EU airspace to all Russian aircraft; freezing the assets of the Russian Central Bank in the EU; expelling key Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, SWIFT, system; sanctioning more than 500 individual oligarchs, Government Ministers, senior army and security officials and heads of state institutions; extending sanctions on Belarus for its role in allowing its territory to be used for Russian aggression; and sanctioning key figures and Russian media outlets that are disseminating disinformation across the EU.  EU leaders said in December that further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine would result in massive cost for Russia, and this is exactly what has happened.<\/p><p>Ireland will continue to play its part in these collective efforts.  We have been at the forefront of EU efforts and, indeed, sometimes ahead; taking a decision in principle to ban Russian aircraft from our airspace in advance of the collective EU agreement to do so, and calling early for an exclusion of key Russian financial institutions and banks from SWIFT.<\/p> <p>Each package of sanctions has been designed to add an additional layer of pressure on the Russian - and Belarusian - Governments and to cripple their ability to finance their illegal and unconscionable actions.  Ireland will support any further proposals that we believe will be effective in stymying Russia's war efforts.  The news coming out of Russia since Thursday shows that these wide-ranging sanctions are having an undeniable effect.  The value of the ruble has crashed, which will impact Russia's continued ability to conduct this war.  The effect of asset freezes and travel bans will be felt immediately by individuals who have been sanctioned, including those close to President Putin, who influence his decisions and provide him with support.<\/p> <p> Sanctions are not cost-free for Ireland or for the other countries joining this unprecedented global effort.  We are in ongoing contact with Irish companies to support them in mitigating some of the impacts on them and we will continue work at Government level to ensure we are ready for any countermeasures that Russia might impose on the EU, which we can expect to be potentially severe.  No one is being hurt as much as the innocent Ukrainians citizens, fleeing for refuge, whose cities are under siege and whose civilian infrastructure is being targeted.<\/p> <p> I welcome the statement of the International Criminal Court prosecutor, Karim Khan, that he will open an investigation into the situation in Ukraine.  He stated unambiguously last night that there is a reasonable basis to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Ukraine.  Ireland, as always, will stand firmly and unambiguously behind the International Criminal Court and defend its independence and impartiality.  Alarmingly, we have also seen reported use of cluster munitions or bombs in an urban residential area in Ukraine's second largest city, which Ireland strongly condemns.  The use of indiscriminate and disproportionate weapons cannot be tolerated and is a clear violation of international humanitarian law.<\/p> <p> We must do everything we can to reach and to support Ukrainian people.  My Department announced late last week a fresh &euro;10 million in humanitarian funding for Ukraine.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, has confirmed that we have suspended all visa requirements for Ukrainian citizens seeking to enter Ireland, for their first 90 days.  Two days ago, along with my EU colleagues, we agreed a package of &euro;500 million in military assistance for the Ukrainian military through the European Peace Facility, EPF, so that people can defend themselves.  In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, Ireland will pay our share of those efforts in full.  Our proportion, which is likely to be approximately &euro;10 million, will be used exclusively for the provision of non-lethal support.  The latter component will include supplies such as personal protective equipment, medical kits and fuel, all urgently needed and being sought by Ukrainians.  Two fellow EU member states, Austria and Malta, have taken a similar approach.<\/p> <p> Ireland has also led the response at UN level.  After Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution last Friday condemning the offensive against Ukraine and calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities and urgent dialogue, Ireland moved quickly to ensure that an urgent session of the General Assembly was convened.  The Russian Federation's use of the veto at the Security Council was a reprehensible attempt to excuse its own military aggression against another sovereign state.  It must not and will not prevent the international community from responding to Russia's blatant breaches of international law, nor will it deter us from holding Russia accountable for its actions.  We hope and expect that a majority of the members of the UN General Assembly will support a clear and robust resolution to condemn this outright violation of the UN charter.  We will bring this issue back into the Security Council chamber and are pushing today for the adoption of a resolution calling for safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all in need in Ukraine.<\/p> <p> I will not go into the details here on the consular issues on which my Department continues to lead.  I will just say that my officials are in ongoing contact with the Irish citizens remaining in Ukraine - the number fluctuates daily, but today stands at just under 80.  We are also in contact with families in surrogacy arrangements in Ukraine and Members will understand that I do not want to make any comment on that publicly, given the extreme sensitivity of the situation that applies to a number of families, some here and some in Poland, waiting for news of their newborn children.  I want to make clear that our strong advice is against all travel to Ukraine for any reason.  I understand the strength of feeling among Ukrainian and Irish citizens alike and some have been in contact with my Department, looking for information on how to join the military efforts to defend Ukraine.  I must make clear again - the situation in Ukraine is extremely volatile and dangerous and Irish citizens and residents should not travel under any circumstances.<\/p> <p> This motion, which I am laying before the House, articulates the support from every political party and every Deputy here for Ukraine.  Last week, Leinster House, along with many other civic buildings in Ireland, lit up in the colours of the Ukrainian flag, blue and yellow, to show solidarity.  It is now time for us in the D&aacute;il to formally record solidarity with Ukraine, by agreeing this motion.  In the course of our debates on the security situation in Europe, there have been some differences of emphasis and some differences of view expressed on international matters, as is normal in a healthy democracy.  As a fundamental principle, there has been widespread support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.  I know we can reiterate that collectively today.  The text of this motion is straightforward in its support for Ukraine and I urge all Deputies to support it.<\/p> <p> The date, 24 February 2022, was a dark day for Ukraine, for Russia, for Belarus, and for the whole world.  President Putin's announcement represents a dangerous and irresponsible escalation in tensions, and considerably heightens the risk of catastrophic miscalculation.  There can be no justification for threatening the use of nuclear weapons.  I have called for Russia to immediately revoke the order to place nuclear weapons on high-alert status, and I urge maximum restraint and de-escalation.<\/p> <p> As I close, I want to speak directly to any Russian people in Ireland or elsewhere, who are watching or listening to this debate.  We know that many Russian people do not want this war.  Many have been deeply courageous in protesting against military aggression.  We know that the people of Belarus are not represented by the aggressive actions of the Belarusian Government either.  There is still time.  Enormous damage and destruction has been done.  The loss of human life, which is mounting as we speak, is beyond shocking.  The UNHCR estimates that 500,000 Ukrainians have already fled to neighbouring countries, four in particular.  However, there is still time to pull back, and to choose a path of reason, restraint and diplomacy.  In this motion, the D&aacute;il calls on Russia to withdraw its military immediately.  This can be done at any moment.  What has happened will not be forgotten, but we can still work towards peace and resolution, and that is an aspiration everybody in this House should support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100022#W01700","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646152200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Could we return to the practice of distributing the speeches of Ministers?

The events of the past week have rightly caused anger and disgust across our Continent and across the world.  Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a sovereign state, is unprovoked, illegal, a blatant disregard of international law and, most importantly, it shows a blatant disregard for the sanctity of human life.  It is the act of an autocratic and dangerous bully with no regard for any interests but his own.  It is important to say that this is Putin's war.  As the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, outlined, we know there are many Russian people who are as horrified by what he is doing as we are.<\/p> <p> The images from Ukraine are truly horrifying &ndash; images of families fleeing their homes for safety, images of bombs ripping through cities and towns, images of doctors fighting in vain to save the life of a six-year-old girl still wearing her pyjamas.  Those doctors were right to demand that the images of that dying girl be shown to Vladimir Putin.  Nothing so encapsulated the horror of war.<\/p> <p> We must be clear: nobody is responsible for this war but Vladimir Putin and those who surround him in a discredited and morally bankrupt regime.  They are responsible for the death and destruction being visited upon a proud country whose only desire is freedom, the freedom to choose their own path, something we in this House recognise.<\/p> <p> In Ukraine right now, we see the best of the human spirit in President Zelenskiy and his people, fighting for that freedom and the right to manage their own destiny.  We see it in the members of the Ukrainian community here returning to help their country at its time of need.  We should be proud that they desire to be part of the European Union, our Union of free nations working together for mutual benefit, a Union, as we know, in which smaller nations and larger nations share peace and prosperity equally.<\/p> <p> That imposes on us here in Ireland and in the European Union a responsibility to do all we can to help Ukraine and its people.  This morning, I briefed the Cabinet on discussions I have been having with EU Justice and Home Affairs colleagues on what we can do, as well as the potential implications of the invasion of Ukraine.  These include the need to be vigilant against potential security issues as well as cyber threats.<\/p> <p> For many of us, the discussion focused on how we can assist the Ukrainian people.  Here in Ireland, we have already lifted visa requirements to allow Ukrainian people who want to seek safety here to do so as quickly and easily as possible.  Prior to the lifting of the visa requirement for Ukraine nationals, the Department of Justice, in co-operation with the Department of Foreign Affairs, was working to ensure that it assisted Irish citizens and their family members in Ukraine speedily and with flexibility.  This included applications for non-EEA family members of Irish citizens which were processed swiftly and humanely, with no backlog of applications.  Family reunification visas for the family members of Irish nationals were granted in eight out of eight completed applications made over the days before the invasion.  As the Minister, Deputy Coveney, outlined, we have also worked to help many families expecting babies through surrogacy in Ukraine who found themselves, and still find themselves, in unimaginable situations, and we will continue to support them.<\/p> <p> Since I introduced the visa waiver on Friday, 25 February, a total of 143 Ukrainians had arrived in the State up to 6 p.m. yesterday.  However, it should be noted that many of those who travelled were already resident in the State and had travelled back to the State for reasons other than escaping the conflict in Ukraine.  We will, of course, keep the situation under review as events transpire.<\/p> <p> However, that is an emergency measure and we must do more.  We will act in co-operation with our colleagues across the EU.  I will meet colleagues again on Thursday and it is likely that we will activate the EU's temporary protection directive.  This is designed to provide a co-ordinated response to a mass influx of displaced persons to standardise the giving of temporary protection across EU member states and to ensure that all member states play their part.  This measure has not previously been used by the EU but the view is that it would be the right mechanism to help those leaving Ukraine.<\/p> <p> As I said, the Government is clear that Ireland will play is part in assisting Ukraine and its people, and has a clear record of helping those in need.  In recent months, Ireland has opened the Afghan admission programme to help family members of the Afghan community here from Afghanistan.  This programme was the only one of its kind in Europe.  Through the Irish refugee protection programme, Ireland has also offered refugee protection to more than 500 Afghan nationals, as well as meeting ongoing commitments in relation to Syrian refugees.  Previous Governments also introduced the Syrian humanitarian admissions programme, which offered temporary Irish residence to vulnerable persons who are present in Syria.<\/p> <p> It is not possible at this point to be precise about numbers of Ukrainian people who will come here under this directive but it is likely to be significant.  The numbers fleeing Ukraine are growing daily, with more than 650,000 estimated to have fled the country and significant numbers of displaced persons locating themselves in neighbouring territories.  More than 280,000 had fled to Poland alone by last Saturday.  I have no doubt that the Irish people will welcome and shelter all of those who come here and seek our help.  As a people, we have never been found wanting, and we will certainly not be found wanting now.<\/p> <p> The activation of the temporary protection directive would involve creating a simplified protection route to process the numbers of people who could come to Ireland.  The Department of Justice has already started work on this.  Rather than being required to apply for international protection, those arriving would instead access a simplified process to receive temporary residency permission for one year initially, which may be extended for further periods, potentially up to three years.  The permission would provide an immediate right of access to the labour market, housing, social welfare, healthcare, education, training and other supports.  This will not remove the right of those persons to apply for international protection, which they will, of course, be allowed to do as well.<\/p> <p> Whatever the method used to provide refuge, there are implications for a number of Government Departments and agencies including: the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as the State would be required to ensure that persons eligible for temporary protection have access to suitable accommodation where needed on arrival; the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and local authorities as the State would be required to ensure those arriving have access to suitable longer-term accommodation or be supported to obtain such accommodation; the Department of Social Protection as those received in Ireland would have entitlement to social welfare supports; the Department of Education as children must have access to education; the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for access to further and higher education, and to vocational training; and, of course, the Department of Health and the HSE as many, if not all, arriving would be entitled to access healthcare.<\/p> <p> Given the potential implications for a wide range of Departments, the Department of the Taoiseach is convening interdepartmental meetings in the coming days to further assess the implications of the activation of a temporary protection measure.  This includes the potentially significant resource and staffing implications, and to seek to develop an approach to support Thursday's discussions at the Justice and Home Affairs Council.<\/p> <p> The EU and the West generally have been fully united in their strength and resolve in responding to Putin's aggression and to supporting the Ukrainian people.  It is important that that message of unity and solidarity goes out from this House today too, and I have no doubt it will.  From our perspective in government, we are also taking action possible to help Ukraine and its people.  I know we will have the support of the House and the Irish people in doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100023#X00500","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646152800,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Ar dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom mo dhl&uacute;thph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht, agus dl&uacute;thph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht Shinn F&eacute;in, a l&eacute;iri&uacute; le mhuintir na h&Uacute;cr&aacute;ine.

N&iacute; thugann gn&iacute;omhartha na R&uacute;ise ach b&aacute;s agus scrios do th&iacute;r br&oacute;d&uacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  I want to start by again extending my solidarity, and the solidarity of all of us in Sinn F&eacute;in, with the people of Ukraine.  All of us who value freedom, sovereignty and the right to self-determination of free peoples can only look on in horror at the actions of the Russian Federation and its leader, Vladimir Putin, in embarking on the type of invasion that we have not seen in Europe for decades.  Ireland, more than most, knows and understands the impact of occupation and imperialist aggression, and we stand with Ukraine as they face down the tyranny of empire.<\/p>  <p>  The actions of Russia bring nothing but death and destruction to a proud country.  They are acts that we have regrettably witnessed around the world in modern times - in Iraq, in Afghanistan and in Palestine.  They are acts that have no place in the 21st century, period, irrespective of who the aggressor is.<\/p>  <p>  The Charter of the United Nations, the cornerstone of modern international law, prohibits the &ldquo;use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State&rdquo;.  That must be our starting point and our end point.  It must be the goal of the international community, through diplomacy, to bring about a peaceful resolution and to stop this war, and all wars.<\/p>  <p>  James Connolly wrote: &ldquo;There are no humane methods of warfare, there is no such thing as civilized warfare; all warfare is inhuman; all warfare is barbaric; the first blast of the bugles of war ever sounds for the time being the funeral knell of human progress.&rdquo;<\/p> <p>He was not wrong.  However, there is a way out of this.  I believe that, as with any conflict, the way out of this is through politics and through dialogue.  By dint of our military neutrality, our history of conflict resolution, and our seat on the UN Security Council, particularly as the only European member of the Security Council that is not also a member of NATO, Ireland is uniquely placed in Europe to put the case for an intensification of efforts to find a peaceful pathway forward.<\/p> <p> As a militarily neutral country and a country committed to the rule of law, to the success of multilateralism, to democracy and to dialogue, I believe we can play a proactive role in the response of the international community at large.  We must step up our supports for those in need of humanitarian aid and our support for those displaced by this conflict.  I have no doubt that we will play our full part in accommodating those fleeing Ukraine, as part of a comprehensive Europe-wide, and indeed global response.<\/p> <p> I also hope that Ukrainian membership of the EU can be expedited in line with the motion passed overwhelmingly today by the European Parliament.<\/p> <p> I want to acknowledge the very many people in Russia who do not want this war.  We send them our solidarity as they bravely protest the unjust actions of their leaders.  We should acknowledge that this is not an easy thing - in fact, it is a most courageous thing to do in a country that has a dismal human rights record.<\/p> <p> It is ordinary people also who will feel the heavy impact of economic sanctions, even when they are correctly targeted predominantly at Russian oligarchs and big business.  Those sanctions are, I believe, an absolutely necessary part of the diplomatic effort to make the Russian leadership realise the futility of their actions in invading Ukraine.  Vladimir Putin can, even at this late juncture, accept that his actions are entirely unjust, that they are contrary to international law and that he can end this barbarism.<\/p> <p> As we move forward from here, there is an onus and a responsibility on us to renew and step up our proud efforts as a State to advance the cause of international nuclear disarmament.  Indeed, it should be remembered that Ireland was the first country to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1968.  Statements and events of recent days serve to remind us that we are never more than minutes away from a chain reaction of missile strikes that threaten the very existence of humankind.  For that reason, all nuclear weapons held by all actors must be put beyond use and new measures put in place to ensure that they can never be produced again.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, let me state again that we here in Ireland stand with the global community and oppose and condemn Russia&rsquo;s actions and that we support Ukraine&rsquo;s right to territorial integrity and its internationally recognised borders.  We recognise above all else the rights of Ukrainian women, men and children to their safety and to their homeland.  There can be no tolerance for the type of aggression we have seen by a very large, very powerful state against its smaller neighbour.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; s&eacute; sin go hioml&aacute;n do-ghlactha d&uacute;inn i Sinn F&eacute;in, do bhaill an T&iacute; seo, agus don phobal idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.

I, therefore, commend and support the motion before us this afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100024#Y00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646153400,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Today, as they have been for the last week, our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Ukraine as an aggressive, brutal invasion of their territory takes place and the missiles continue to fall.  From the outset, I completely and utterly condemn the actions by the Russian Federation.  I want to send a message of solidarity to the many Ukrainian people who have come to Ireland to find a new home.  We share their pain at what is happening in their homeland.<\/p>  <p>  Hour by hour, we have witnessed incredible courage and sacrifice by the Ukrainian people in the face of increasingly overwhelming odds as the Russian war machine gears up to escalate the conflict.  We have also witnessed many Ukrainian nationals whose sense of duty led them to leave the safety of Ireland and put themselves in harms way to defend their native land.  I salute their courage.<\/p>  <p>  The arrogance, disdain and dismissiveness of Vladimir Putin towards the sovereign rights of the people of Ukraine is an affront to the UN charter, democracy, decency and international law.  Russian aggression has brought such widespread resolve among democratic nations that there is an appetite to eat the cost of sanctions against Russia whatever that cost may turn out to be.<\/p>  <p>  Russia has attacked a sovereign state.  It has brought war to Europe for the first time since the Second World War.  It has performed an unthinkable act.  More than half a million Ukrainian refugees have attempted to flee the Russian invasion.  Some will unfortunately have to make their way to our shores for their protection as they flee from this aggression but I have no doubt that the Irish nation will welcome them with open arms.  I also want to commend the efforts of the Irish diplomatic staff and NGO personnel working on the ground in very trying circumstances.  Will the Minister update the House on their safety and well-being at this difficult time?  A dire humanitarian crisis is developing.  It is imperative that we do everything in our power to contribute to the wider humanitarian effort.  This should also include the opening of a humanitarian corridor to allow full access for NGOs into Ukraine itself.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that Putin&rsquo;s actions represent a threat to the rules-based international order.  The Russian assault on Ukraine represents a pivot point in history.  The ripple effects of the attack and the international response will impact on geopolitical and economic affairs for some time to come.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistent from the outset of this crisis in our adherence to the principles inherent in the United Nations Resolution 68\/262 adopted by the General Assembly on 27 March 2014 on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.  This UN resolution specifically calls on all states to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state and to settle their international disputes by peaceful means.  I add my voice to the calls urging Russia to withdraw its military forces and to return to discussions within the Normandy format.<\/p>  <p>  I have repeatedly called for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements endorsed by the Security Council in UN Security Council Resolution 2202 in 2015 and do so again here today.  We believe that efforts must remain focused to establish this resolution as reality.<\/p>  <p>  The democratic nations of the world are united in their outrage against Russian aggression.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the continuing imposition of sanctions against Russia as part of an international response designed to bring an end to Russian aggression.  Every possible effort must be expended to bring an end to the conflict.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, this conflict is set to get worse, if the current trend continues.  The likelihood is the Russians will get more ruthless.  There are going to be many more people killed in the coming days and we cannot just sit down and accept that politics has failed.  To do so will be to be forced to observe even more unspeakable suffering.<\/p> <p> We in Ireland, along with the wider international community, have a moral obligation to the people of Ukraine to bring every diplomatic pressure to bear on Russia and pursue every avenue to bring this crisis to an end.  If we do not, we will be talking of Ukraine in the same breath as Syria, Lebanon or Yemen, to name but a few.  Here in Ireland, Sinn F&eacute;in for close to two years has been pushing to close off access to section 110 funds for use by the Russian war machine and oligarchs.  My colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, has raised this issue in the D&aacute;il on several occasions.  She did so first with the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, and then, more importantly, with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell followed this up a letter to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, about the issue.  Unfortunately, no response was forthcoming.  The Government has refused to address the connection of the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, to Russia and that is totally unacceptable.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Coveney will be able to inform the House as to whether the sanctions imposed by the EU will finally address this and cut off the &euro;118 billion in funds that has been washed through the IFSC.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in has called for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Yury Filatov.  The Government has offered a rationale for its decision to demur on this for the time being.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has himself talked of the importance of Ireland acting in unison with our European partners.  Ireland is a member of the United Nations Security Council.  It secured election to that position predominantly through the votes of many of the non-aligned nations of the world.  We sit on the UN Security Council through the gift of non-aligned nations.  They look to us to provide leadership, act in the interests of, and to be the dissenting voice to power of the less powerful.  Hence, for Ireland to act unilaterally in expelling the Russian Ambassador would not be the act of a lone nation.  It would be the action of a nation that has been tasked with providing leadership and example to those nations who have tasked our State with giving voice to the countries who remain outside the power blocs of the various military alliances.  When Ireland acts alone, takes a moral stand, and pursues mechanisms designed to exercise diplomatic action in the pursuit of ending violence, our country sends a powerful message.  Ireland needs to provide leadership and to provide an example to those non-aligned countries who have placed our country on the UN Security Council.  It is our non-aligned status that provides us with the global footprint and soft power beyond anything we could hope to achieve by waiting to follow the examples of alliances.<\/p> <p> We can never give up on our attempts to achieve a peaceful solution to any conflict and in this instance, I believe the UN still has a massive role to play in this.  We will continue to call for de-escalation, for dialogue and for the UN to have a greater say in attempts to bring about an end to the conflict.  I am aware talks are again due to take place this Wednesday between Ukraine and Russia.  There must be an immediate ceasefire, the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops and the territorial integrity of Ukraine must be fully respected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100025#Z00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646154000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Deputy Brady cannot call for dialogue and then in the same breath call on us to expel the Russian ambassador.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100026#AA00200","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1646154000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>We absolutely can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100026#AA00300","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1646154000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>It is completely contradictory.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100026#AA00400","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1646154000,"counter":316,"content":"<p>It is called leadership, Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100026#AA00500","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1646154000,"counter":317,"content":"<p>It is completely contradictory and he knows that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100026#AA00600","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1646154000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Absolutely not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100026#AA00700","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1646154000,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Bogaimid ar aghaidh go dt&iacute; an P&aacute;irt&iacute; an Lucht Oibre agus an Teachta Howlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100026#AA00800","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1646154000,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The Labour Party strongly and warmly welcomes this resolution.  I thank the Government for responding to last week's request from our leader, Deputy Kelly, for this motion in order that the House could act together and the voice of elected representatives of the people could be very clearly heard.<\/p>  <p>  The last six days have been among the most momentous and frightening in Europe since the end of the Second World War.  The settlement we Europeans thought existed, one that underpinned peace on our Continent, has been fundamentally undermined and attacked.  This D&aacute;il must be clear and united in our response.  We previously heard in statements some few comments beginning with: \"Putin is evil but what about ...\"  There is no space now for whataboutery.  The single and clear issue before the House is the invasion of a member state of the UN, which is a sovereign and independent state, by a neighbour with the objective or removing its democratic administration and making it a vassal state.  When we spoke about these issues last week I said President Putin's aims are stated clearly.  He has not hidden what he intends to do.  He wants the restoration of a super-Russian state that reabsorbs into its territory the now-independent former Soviet republics.  The views, wishes, hopes and expectations of the citizens of those states are of no interest to Vladimir Putin.<\/p>  <p>  We are watching the news as it unfolds on an hourly basis and today may be a critical one in the conduct of this war of aggression.  As we have all seen, hundreds of tanks are within kilometres of the centre of Kyiv.  Rockets have landed in the centre of Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv.  It is alleged, and I believe it, that cluster bombs, which are banned in many countries, have been deployed against civilian targets.  The humanitarian consequences of these actions are horrific and wholly unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  We have stated repeatedly we stand with the people of Ukraine.  In his presentation via video link to the European Parliament earlier, however, the Ukrainian President, Mr. Zelenskiy, gave a real challenge to all of us when he said: \"Prove that you are with us\".  What then can we do?  What more can we do?  I have a number of suggestions.  I am sorry the Minister for Justice has left as I wanted her to hear my direct appeal to her, like the one I made earlier to the Taoiseach.  I call for the immediate enactment - and I mean this week - of the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill 2020, the so-called Magnitsky Act, which is on the Order Paper of this D&aacute;il and has passed Second Stage.  It aims to expand our existing proceeds of crime legislation, namely, the one that created the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, to take and seize ill-gotten gains and to put the onus of responsibility on those who are holding those gains to explain where they got them and to prove they are legitimate.  In the Bill I have proposed we wanted to define certain conduct occurring outside the State, in places like Ukraine and places like Israel, as criminal conduct if that conduct constitutes or is connected with a gross abuse of human rights.  Under the Bill, conduct is stated to constitute \"a gross human rights abuse if ... it is carried out by, or at the instigation or with the consent or acquiescence of ... public official[s]\".<\/p> <p>We need to ensure that the pals of Putin who have stashed money all over the world, probably including in this jurisdiction, can have that removed from them.  That is the most damaging thing we can do to them.  I believe that the Bill has all-party support and a strong move we could make would be to provide time in the House this week to pass its remaining Stages and make it law.<\/p> <p> We could also accept refugees from Ukraine.  I welcome the Minister for Justice's comment that the temporary protection measure that she outlined is in place, but the numbers she mentioned are tiny so far.  Today, the United Nations stated that 660,000 people had left Ukraine for fear of their lives and well-being.  The visa requirement to get to Ireland has been removed but we must be more proactive than that.  We are on the periphery and our European neighbours are taking in massive numbers of people and are desperately struggling to provide them with accommodation, food and the basics of living.  We need to plan - almost on a war footing - for the reception of refugees and for welcoming not only families of Ukrainian nationals resident in Ireland, but many more who need shelter from the ongoing conflict.  We need to have clear and unambiguous plans funded and set out.<\/p> <p> Yesterday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed an application for EU membership.  It is his and his people's declaration that they look towards Europe for their future.  It was a massive political statement.  We must respond in kind.  We must agree to declare Ukraine an EU candidate country, which I understand was the majority decision of the European Parliament in the past 24 hours.<\/p> <p> An investigation into potential war crimes has been opened by the International Criminal Court.  Let all aggressors take note &ndash; there must be a complete and exhaustive examination of their actions in Ukraine.  We must tell them clearly now that anyone involved in the war crimes being perpetrated against the innocent people of Ukraine will be held to account.  Even if it takes years to do it, we will follow it up.  The world community is clear and united in that regard.  Hopefully, this will have some impact on reducing the enthusiasm of some of the Putinistas for their ongoing vicious campaign of oppression.<\/p> <p> Yesterday, I had the task and great honour of moving a resolution of solidarity with Ukraine at the plenary session of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in London.  Needless to say, it was carried unanimously by representatives of democratic parliaments on all these islands, representing England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.  We sent our support to the people of Ukraine and our fellow parliamentarians in the Ukrainian Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada.  Democracy is often spoken about in all of our assemblies but it is under specific and brutal assault today on our Continent.<\/p> <p> It is unclear how this invasion will end, although we already know that nothing will be the same after the attack.  All of us in this House and all the people we represent fear for the Ukrainian people in these dark hours.  We admire their courage and strength, their resolution and their bravery.  We watch in amazement and admiration their courage, as well as the courage of those Russian men and women who have taken to the streets in cities across Russia demanding peace and the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine.<\/p> <p> Russia will take its own course but we &ndash; people who are committed to the rule of law and democracy &ndash; cannot tolerate a return to a Europe that we thought we had put behind us in previous decades and centuries where aggression, conflict and subjugation existed.  Our determined and clear resolve as a Parliament must be to stand with Europe, stand with Ukraine and give a clear message to the valiant people of that benighted country in their hour of great need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100026#AA00900","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646154600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Lahart and Devlin.<\/p><p>The decision to invade Ukraine is President Putin's war of choice.  His analysis of Russian-Ukrainian relations, published last July, is in effect his war manifesto.  In that document, he rejects the concept of Ukrainian independence and Ukrainian sovereignty.  In that paper, he asserts his belief that the people of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are one people and should share one geographical and political space.  He talks about Ukrainians, Russians and Belarusians as being one family, yet now we see that he has turned his guns on his Ukrainian brothers and sisters.<\/p><p>Four weeks ago, the Russian ambassador, Mr. Yury Filatov, speaking before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, which I chair, said that any invasion of Ukraine would be insane.  He repeated the same statement on national television.  Last week, his President, Mr. Putin, gave the order to invade Ukraine.  Does the ambassador in Dublin now believe that President Putin is insane?<\/p><p>The invasion of Ukraine is the latest in a very long line of Russian and Putin aggression.  Look at Chechnya, Georgia, Moldova, Crimea, Syria, Kazakhstan and Belarus.  Under his leadership, assassinations, poisonings and oppression of dissent also became his <i>modus operandi<\/i>.  Cyberattacks originating in Russia and interference in elections and the internal politics of many countries have been other common features of Russian aggression.  The failure of the Russian political and military elites to restrain him and the failure of the international community to realise the danger he posed emboldened him further.  Indeed, President Putin perceived the West as weak and decadent.<\/p><p>In Ukraine, however, President Putin has miscalculated.  He has overreached.  The international response has been impressive on many fronts and is becoming more effective day by day.  Ukrainian resistance is stronger than President Putin had anticipated.  Opposition to the war is growing within Russia and will grow even further in the days and weeks ahead.<\/p><p>There is now a clear choice facing the Russian military, political, business and diplomatic establishment - stay with him or remove him from office.  If they stay with him, some like President Putin will find themselves, as Deputy Howlin has rightly said, before the International Criminal Court answering for war crimes in Ukraine.  I support the gathering of evidence now towards a case against Mr. Putin and his henchmen in the International Criminal Court.<\/p><p>The invasion of Ukraine has been a rude wake-up for many countries in Europe, none more so than Germany.  Many believed that trade with Russia would change Russian politics.  What has happened instead is that much of Europe has become dependent on Russian gas and Russian dirty money, which has corrupted business and, in some cases, politics in some European countries.  There is a danger that change through trade works both ways.  Indeed, there have been suggestions of Russian dirty money in Ireland, which need to be assessed and analysed by the Government, which I support on a daily basis.<\/p><p>Ireland's geographical location has protected this country in many ways.  It is interesting to compare Ireland's relationship with the UK during 100 years of independence and Russia's relationship with Ukraine's 30 years of independence.<\/p> <p>We in Ireland also have been sheltered from external threats by the NATO umbrella.  To a large extent, we have enjoyed the luxury of being bystanders as regards security and defence.  This approach is no longer a credible option.  Ireland's well-being and prosperity is dependent upon the European Union and our positive and strong relations with other western countries, in particular the United States of America.  What is worth having is worth defending.  As a country we must now be prepared to shoulder a fair share of the burden of European defence and security.  The European Union and the United States of America have been strong supporters of Ireland and of the Irish peace process.  The European Union in particular, but also the United States of America, have had our back and continue to do so in the crisis relating to the withdrawal of our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, from the European Union.  <\/p> <p> Now is the time for Ireland to look at where it stands on the issue of European security and defence.  We recently and coincidentally had the publication of a very wide-ranging and long-awaited independent report on the future of our Defence Forces.  It also presents us with an opportunity to answer many of the serious questions that are now being posed on the streets of Ireland as to where we stand and how stand our Defence Forces.  These are questions that this D&aacute;il must return to on a regular basis.  They are questions that we need to address.  In the meantime, I strongly support this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100027#BB00200","speaker":"1589","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646155200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I do not agree with much of the sentiment just expressed and nor would I like to see the situation exploited to that end.  I know many of my colleagues would agree with that.  It is important to make the point that not so long ago, in the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea, a number of Members of the European Parliament representing parties opposite, whom I will not name because I do not want to politicise the particular debate, criticised the European Union for being overly confrontational towards Russia.  They now have to own that and to respond to it in the current context.<\/p>  <p>  I am fairly clear in my own mind as to what Ireland needs to do.  We are militarily neutral.  As has been stated here, we are a small neutral country on the periphery of Europe.  There are a number of issues that need to be addressed in regard to the Russian ambassador.  He lied to an Oireachtas committee.  He more than likely has lied to the Minister and the Government.  He lied to the nation last week.  All of that is in regard to this issue.  I presume he lied, as did his officials, to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council when the Russian embassy sought to significantly expand its premises and facility on Orwell Road.  That is a very valuable lesson for us, particularly in regard to espionage, our data centres and our cybersecurity. <\/p>  <p>  While I accept the T&aacute;naiste's comments earlier today with regard to the importance of maintaining diplomatic connections, relations and channels, particularly in the interests of protecting Irish citizens both in Ukraine and in Russia, he will understand that the impulse in regard to the call for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador and the initiative arose out of a sense of powerlessness and anger in the face of Russian actions.  We can certainly expel the bulk of the Russian team at the embassy, particularly its spying team, listeners and that section of its diplomatic corps.  I also think the Taoiseach needs to call in the ambassador soon and give him a dressing down, not least in regard to the lies he told the Government and the people of this country.  <\/p>  <p>  Enough on that.  I will move now to what we can do as a militarily neutral country with a very proud record in regard to humanitarian support and relief of other countries.  I hear a lot of words here today.  I know they are incredibly well-meaning but on occasions like this I cannot help but be reminded of the scene in the \"Life of Brian\" when the committee gets together and there are proposers, seconders, alternative motions and further motions and the crisis has passed before they get out of the meeting room and no solid action has been taken.  What does a militarily neutral country do?  We got our lead today from Adi Roche that we need to send money and support.  Clearly, we cannot send ships but we can send shiploads of relief supplies.  The Government must not just support NGOs in doing this, it must lead on it.  We cannot send soldiers but we can send volunteers to assist with refugees.  Again, the Government must lead on this and not just depend solely on NGOs to lead on it.  The Government needs to facilitate it.  We cannot send tanks and trucks but we can send truckloads of supplies, comfort, food and humanitarian aid.  The Government needs to lead and facilitate this.  We cannot send warplanes but we can send aeroplanes to transport those refugees to safety and to our shores.  The Government must lead and facilitate in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  Let us accept our conscious decision in regard to military neutrality, but take control of what we can take control of.  Let us use the power that we have, which is tremendous human power and good will, and put it to good effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100028#CC00200","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1646155200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I concur and support much of what has been said by my colleague, Deputy Lahart.  Like all Deputies across this House, the Irish people and almost everyone around the world, have been shocked and truly appalled by the illegal war of aggression being waged by Russia and now Belarus on the people of Ukraine.  The war is a clear breach of the United Nations Charter.  It is causing untold suffering for the people of Ukraine and it is creating a human catastrophe in Europe.  Over 650,000 Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes, families have been split, people have lost everything.  We are hearing stories of men in particular being asked to remain, choosing fighting over their families.  It churns the stomach of the Irish people that this could happen again on the Continent of Europe when we thought we were living in a time of peace.<\/p>  <p>  Russia&rsquo;s prosecution of the war has been appalling.  The use of cluster munitions and other weapons on an indiscriminate basis against residential areas constitute war crimes.  These crimes must be investigated.  I support the calls of other Deputies in that regard.  The international community and particularly the European Union cannot stand idly by while a democratic state with a rich cultural and social history is snuffed out. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome multilateral sanctions against the Russian regime by the EU and other nations.  I welcome commitments today by several party leaders across the House with regard to the need to facilitate Ukraine&rsquo;s membership of the EU.  Efforts earlier today by some Irish MEPs to frustrate the process for reasons known only to them were bizarre and shameful.  On a practical basis, Ireland should do everything it can to assist the people of Ukraine in their hour of need.  I welcome the lifting of visa requirements for Ukrainians coming to Ireland, the establishment of a relief fund and plans to support Ukrainians fleeing to Ireland in a special refugee programme.  Efforts by individuals and groups across Ireland should also be acknowledged. <\/p>  <p>  It would be remiss not to recognise those brave Russian citizens who have come out to protest the illegal war against their neighbours in Ukraine.  Like all of us, they are disgusted.  I support this motion.  It demonstrates the resolve of this House and the Irish people.  Even at this late stage, like all Members of the House, I would like to see Russia and Belarus do the right thing.  They can and should do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100028#CC00300","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1646155200,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I welcome the motion.  Our thoughts are with all those who are so terribly affected and impacted.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, rightly criticised the actions of the Putin regime as unacceptable and illegal.<\/p> <p>He stated that we need to be part of the response to that.  I agree.  Of course, how we respond is what matters.  We are citizens of a neutral country which often punches way above its weight in international affairs.  It is great to see the EU solidarity on this matter but, of course, accountability starts at home.  It is about what we can do in the here and now and what changes we can effect.  It is no secret that the IFSC is a major offshore financial centre for people linked to Putin.  Gazprom, Rosneft and VTP in the state sector and major oligarch-controlled entities such as Alfa-Bank, EuroChem and Rusal are but a few of the companies involved.  They all have special purpose vehicles located in the IFSC.  They have no employees, offices or fixed assets and they pay no tax.  Nevertheless, between 2005 and 2017, those shell companies funnelled &euro;118 billion from the IFSC to Russia.  Many of the companies that received those funds had been accused of serious wrongdoing.  For example, Credit Bank of Moscow required a major bailout.  Approximately 50% of its loans were to its management.  Promsvyazbank had to be nationalised and its former owners were accused of being the ones buying their own debt.  A quick look through some of the prospectuses for their bonds listed on the Irish Stock Exchange are striking.  The section which lists risks includes reference to the fact that the measures implemented to prevent it from being used as a conduit for money laundering or terrorist financing may not be completely effective.<\/p> <p> We know that following the imposition of sanctions in 2016 and 2017, some IFSC-based companies managed to raise finance on behalf of companies under those sanctions, as was well covered in the media over the past four years.  Yet nothing happened.  I have been raising this matter with the Government since 2020.  In September 2020, I raised the matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, who said it would be a matter for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to address.  I heard nothing thereafter.  Shortly after I raised the matter with the Minister of State, one shell company connected to the now sanctioned bank Sovcombank issued a bond for &euro;300 million.  Its prospectus, listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, mentions risks from the sanctions imposed by foreign governments, including sanctions against Russian individuals and legal entities.<\/p> <p> In March 2021, the now sanctioned bank Alfa-Bank issued a bond of &euro;1.2 billion.  It also noted risks from economic sanctions.  I raised this matter with the Minister for Finance when he was before the Joint Committee on Finance two months later and he told me he was not in a position to give an answer, which is understandable, but that he would write to me.  He did not do so.  I then wrote to him at the end of that month but I never received a reply.  I am sorry, but that is not good enough.<\/p> <p> We need to be a part of the response.  I welcome what is being done and what has been done.  We absolutely do need to be a part of the response.  However, we need to ensure the IFSC is not used for the purposes of sanction-busting.  Are we going to continue to allow anonymous company ownership which uses legal trustees because these non-transparent structures create significant risks of abuse?

Are we going to introduce any kind of accountability to that small network of professional services, including legal and accountancy firms that service them?  These are the primary beneficiaries of these Russian-connected shell companies.  These things have been brought to light in the context of the invasion of Ukraine.  We need to consider whether a cost-benefit analysis can be done around the use of section 110 tax concessions, which allow these companies, and many others, to operate largely tax free.  With the current reforms in the international tax regime, a tax concession for non-residents such as this seems completely out of step.<\/p>  <p>  We are more than happy to work with the Minister.

The attacks on civilians, the use of rockets and bombs on civilian targets, the brutal murder of children, the use of cluster bombs and the war crimes that are happening need to be condemned by all of us in the strongest possible terms.  It is important that we stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and, indeed, the people in Russia who have been bravely protesting against this war.  We must also support the Ukrainian community in Ireland and everybody in eastern Europe and Asia who lives with the constant threat of Russian aggression.<\/p><p>This is not just an attack the Ukrainian people; it is also an attack on democracy, international law and a rules-based international system - things which we all hold dear.  It is also an attack on the system which has a simple tenet that countries cannot take by force the territory of other countries.  It is important that we all stand in unity against that.<\/p><p>It is also important that we do what we can, as other Deputies have stated.  We must focus on what can be done to support the people of Ukraine.  While it is welcome that the Russian war crimes that are being committed will be investigated by the International Criminal Court, there is a need for urgent action now.  This is no time for half measures.  I support the calls that have been made by Deputies from different parties across this House for the immediate expulsion of the Russian ambassador.  I have heard and appreciate the reasons that have been given for not doing that.  If we expel the ambassador, we can expect a reciprocal move and the expulsion of our ambassador from Russia.  However, that would not necessarily mean that all diplomatic ties and presences would have to be removed as part of that.<\/p><p>All Irish-domiciled Russian assets need to be frozen and seized immediately and all forms of trade with Russia should be ceased immediately.  The harshest possible economic sanctions are needed.  According to Eoin Burke-Kennedy, a credible commentator writing in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, the sanctions were carefully crafted to avoid major economic fallout.  That is a very serious charge he has made.  He has stated that economic self-interest is inhibiting the level of the sanctions going through.  Other commentators have said that the expulsion of only some of the Russian banks from the SWIFT system does not go far enough.<\/p><p>At this point, we need to end all business and trade with Russia.  Everyone doing business with Russia, including those buying oil or gas, holding investments, engaged in commercial arrangements or sitting on boards, is contributing to Putin's war chest.  Anyone involved in that is fuelling the invasion of Ukraine.  Pension funds and companies should divest now.  Members of boards should resign.  It all needs to stop now.  That signal needs to come clearly from everybody who stands against the invasion.<\/p><p>Some &euro;34 billion is held by Russian-linked shell companies registered with the IFSC.  Between 2005 and 2017, according to research by Cillian Doyle and Jim Stewart, &euro;118 billion was funnelled through the IFSC by Russian entities through so-called section 110 trusts.  There must be no more sheltering of Russian money through the IFSC.<\/p><p>We can also be strong in our support the people of Ukraine through our humanitarian response.  We should have the strongest possible humanitarian response to support everybody who is fleeing from war and the civilian population remaining in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>Food supplies will be of critical importance because it will be a matter of only days before food runs out in some areas.

That is important.  The visa waiver is another important move.  It was deeply frustrating to members of the Ukrainian community in Ireland, however, that it came only with the outbreak of war and the invasion of their country.  A number of them were pleading with the Government to make it easier for people, including their family members, to come to Ireland before war broke out, while there were still flights coming here from Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  People need certainty in terms of what will happen next.  I welcome the indication from the Minister for Justice that Ukrainian citizens will be able to work and contribute fully to Irish society when they come here.  Very significant resources will have to put in place to provide shelter and other supports.  I welcome the comments by the Taoiseach earlier indicating that the scale of the response will be unprecedented and on a level not contemplated before.  That certainly is needed.  Last Thursday, the T&aacute;naiste gave a commitment to provide practical assistance to people fleeing from Ukraine.  We need more information on what that practical assistance will be.  Ireland can and should be organising flights out of eastern Poland for people who want to come here, especially those looking to be reunited with their families who are living here, whether they are Ukrainian citizens, Irish citizens or otherwise.

Russia's attack is totally unjustified and Ireland and the EU are right to demonstrate steadfast support for Ukrainians' rights to sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Peace has been shattered and the horror of war and war crimes have been visited on Europe once again.  This has resulted in unprecedented solidarity on the part of the EU in support of the Ukrainian people.  I welcome that.  Despite a little hesitation by a few member states late last week, the EU has since adopted the most comprehensive package of sanctions ever in the case of Russia.  I am proud that Ireland supported this extensive package from the outset, including the exclusion of key Russian banks from SWIFT.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the D&aacute;il should carefully consider the implications of the agreement last weekend by EU foreign ministers in respect of the European peace facility.  This is a significant shift for the Union, or a watershed moment, as the President of the European Commission described it.  The European peace facility is a new EU programme, agreed last year, on security and defence.  Given our traditional peacekeeping role and long-standing policy that no Irish funds shall be spent on weapons, it is right that Ireland abstained constructively on the lethal weapons package and supported the non-lethal weapons proposals.  Ukraine certainly is an exceptional case but there must be ongoing scrutiny of the European peace facility by the Oireachtas and clear guidelines on its future use in another context.<\/p>  <p>  What are we to do about the calls for a breaking off of diplomatic relations with Russia and the expulsion of its ambassador to Ireland?  Irish people are horrified by the lies Yuri Filatov has told in recent weeks, culminating in his outrageous interview with David McCullagh on RT&Eacute;'s \"Six One News\" last Friday.  In these circumstances, I had no hesitation in saying at the weekend that this man is not welcome in Ireland.  I hear what the Government is saying about the value of keeping diplomatic channels open between Dublin and Moscow but I am not sure about that.  We certainly should expel a number of Russian diplomats and so-called operatives in the coming days.  I am glad the expulsion of the ambassador is still under consideration, having regard to the ongoing work on co-ordinated action at EU level.  I look forward to receiving the Minister's advice on this ongoing situation in due course.<\/p>  <p>  We have a humanitarian crisis on our EU borders.  It is heart-breaking to view the emotional scenes at the borders of Poland, Moldova, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, where families are being broken up and women and children try desperately to reach the security barriers.  Millions of Ukrainians are being displaced.  We need to put in place special refugee programmes here in Ireland, in conjunction with the EU, to assist Ukrainians fleeing this war.  I welcome the measures in this regard announced by the Minister for Justice earlier in the House.  We must show full solidarity with the people of Ukraine at this very difficult time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100030#EE00400","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1646156400,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his statement.  More than half a million people, most of them women and children, have already fled Ukraine.  It is the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War.  In this age of social media, we are watching the horror unfold on our devices.  I was especially concerned to hear 19-year-old Rachel from Carlow, a medical student in Ukraine, tell her experience today.  We need the Minister's assistance to get her home.  I have emailed him and the Taoiseach on this matter and I have more information to give them.   We need to get Rachel home.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that Ireland is waiving visa requirements for Ukrainians fleeing the war.  This has been a vital comfort to the Ukrainian community here in Ireland, including for families in Carlow and Kilkenny.  We must ask the good people in our communities to express their solidarity by offering, if they are in a position to do so, to take in Ukrainian refugees as part of the EU's humanitarian response to the conflict.  These same communities, including those in Carlow and Kilkenny, have already set up donation stations to help.  There is a huge amount of goodwill within communities, with a large number of stations established to raise funding and collect food and clothing.<\/p> <p>One has to congratulate communities for the efforts they are making and it is important that we recognise the work they do and we are helping.  Our State facilities will not be enough and we need to accept this.  This is a war effort and while we are neutral, we are human and we should do everything we can to help those displaced by this.<\/p> <p> The invasion by Russia on innocent people in Ukraine is horrific.  I appreciate that we must keep diplomatic channels open and that we are a small country but can we not lead the EU in expelling the Russian ambassador from our country and support other countries in taking the same action?  This aggression by Russia will cause untold hardship and tragedy for the Government and people of Ukraine, who have shown remarkable resilience and resolve.  I admire Mr. Zelenskiy, who has shown such leadership to his people.  A father himself, he does what he does for his family and country.  I was moved by his appeal to the European Union today and I know I am not alone.  We must not leave them alone out there and we all recognise that.  The people of Ukraine are our family and we must answer his call for help by offering them the humanitarian support they will need.  I want to applaud the Department of Foreign Affairs for its support of those members of Irish Families Through Surrogacy with children just born in Ukraine.  They are our families too.  The help we give will be vital now.  I know the Minister is working hard on this but we need to give every support we can.  What is happening in Ukraine is horrific.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100030#EE00500","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646157000,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I am delighted to see this motion coming through the House and being brought by the Government.  I am speaking in support of it, as are my party and the Government.  I have long raised questions in this Chamber and elsewhere as to the actions of certain states, particularly Russia.  It is not so long ago that I was engaging with the Minister on the Russian elections, the treatment of Alexei Navalny and other opponents, and what I saw as an attack on democracy that played out in Russia.  We saw similar activity in Belarus, where we have sympathy for the exiled opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who has Irish connections.  In Poland, Hungary and other places we have seen attacks on democracy,the rule of law, academic freedom, media freedom and freedom of expression.  All the norms that western liberal democracy might have come to take for granted in the past 20 or 30 years have been eroded and attacked.  Perhaps the final frontier of conventional military warfare was then engaged in recent days, much to the horror of all in this Chamber I hope and certainly of myself and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am a member.<\/p>  <p>  I heard Deputy Flanagan speak earlier and I have been corresponding with him in recent days as well about the position of the Russian ambassador.  I note the Government&rsquo;s position on that and I realise there are complications but I want to say, and I have said this in the committee, when the ambassador came before us he misled the committee to put it mildly.  He laughed off our concerns and described them as a James Bond conspiracy.  He spoke about the idea of Russia invading Ukraine as being insane.  I asked him how insane it was when Crimea was invaded six years previously and they have gone back and done the same thing again.  It is abhorrent that such contempt was shown to the committee, the D&aacute;il and Irish sovereignty.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak to the issue of Irish sovereignty on a related point and again I recently raised this in the committee and in other media.  Our concept of neutrality is outdated.  We have a sacred cow and it is a traditional idea that we would shy away from any conflict or confrontation.  I appreciate that provides us with something of a position as an honest broker but it is also outdated in a world where warfare does not always come with tanks crossing our borders.  Warfare comes with marine presence in our exclusive economic zone; a cyberattack on our national health system; interference with data lines, communications and transmissions, be those under the sea or in data centres scattered across the country; interference with our economic interests and by threatening and jeopardising investment in the country; and by disrupting elections and the free expression of people at the ballot box, be that through referendums or elections.  All of those factors play into the new and modern hybrid warfare and I am convinced we have been subject to that by Russia and others who have sought to interfere in many ways.  Why do they do that?  They do that because it is in their economic and political interests.  Anything that can disrupt a western state is positive for certain countries that are outside of that alliance.  It is as easily and simply done as interfering with social media and running reverse algorithms, as has been done repeatedly and this has been well-documented in votes such as Brexit and the 2016 US elections.  I firmly believe this has happened on many occasions here also and I do not see it as being particularly contested that this has happened.  It is time to think long and hard about our position, about how we defend ourselves and about how we recognise the forms of attack that can come into being.  I suggest that the State has been already subjected to this.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to some of the contributions from around the House earlier and there were some good contributions from all sides.  I noticed a preponderance from the Sinn F&eacute;in benches to throw the ball back at the Government about various accounts and mechanisms in the IFSC and how various different investments could be frozen or moved on.  The EU is doing all of that and more and we are doing that as part of the EU.  I would say to Sinn F&eacute;in that it is easy to suggest that something that can be done and the Government has already spoken about the complexity of some of these matters.  It is complex to take on board the difficult financial tapestry of the IFSC; various funds and cross funds and legislation may be proposed that can tackle that.  Perhaps that is a good thing and perhaps something should be done but it cannot happen overnight.  What can happen overnight is a vote and Sinn F&eacute;in representatives in Europe have already spoken about their actions and votes.  In fact, its MEP rejected a call from across Europe to safeguard Ukraine&rsquo;s position, respect its borders and vindicate its independence before Christmas.  It is disappointing for representatives of the same party to come into this House, having refused the opportunity and being among a small minority that did so in the European Parliament in December, and throw the ball back at the Government about various complex financial manoeuvres that they know full well cannot be taken overnight.  There is hypocrisy in that, albeit I welcome their late conversion to the pattern.  There may have been ideological alignment with previous regimes in Russia and that may be at the heart of that.<\/p>  <p>  In any event, I commend the motion and I am delighted to support it.  We need to take seriously the notion of modern hybrid warfare.  The war that has been conducted is being conducted in cyberspace, social media and traditional media as much as it has been conducted on the ground in Ukraine.  Who is winning is a function of who one is following, not necessarily of the facts on the ground.  The facts on the ground are debated and I would not take for granted that Ukraine&rsquo;s position is so strong.  Russia made significant progress and that is of concern to us all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100031#FF00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1646157000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I welcome this motion.  Last week we debated the issue of Ukraine in the House and none of us could have imagined that within 24 hours we would see tanks crossing the border and rolling into Ukraine.  It is a despicable and sinister act by a determined dictator in Russia, Vladimir Putin.  The last time we were here we discussed the notion that &ldquo;Might is right&rdquo; and he is pushing that to its limits.  While conflict across Europe was something we had hoped we would never see again, we have to recognise that for the past hundreds of years conflict around the globe has been always happening as long as people have thought that greed made it appropriate to conquer and subdue others, take over countries and take wealth and pull that away.  The essence of that is the notion of imperialism and that is what Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation are about; it is an imperialist state which is flexing its muscles.  Our hearts go out to the people who are losing their lives, the families who are fleeing and the hundreds of thousands who are trying to cross the border into Poland and other countries to try to get to safety.  Our heart and spirit are also with the people of Ukraine, so many of whom are resisting and putting up a strong fight against Russia.  Yet, we see a 17 km long convoy of people travelling towards Kyiv, which poses difficulty and which will cause problems for all of the people there if the bombardment of Kyiv is as strong as that would suggest.<\/p>  <p>  I take the points that many Members have made about the Russian ambassador and his performance in the committee last week.  In effect, he lied to the committee and the people of Ireland as to the intentions of Russia and of course people are angry about that.  I also take the Minister&rsquo;s point that we have to be careful not to break off diplomatic relations.  However, we are all aware that in every conflict in the world there are always back channels and ways of getting things done and sorting out things.  Publicly, we have to make a stand and that stand could be clearly made in Ireland.  The Russian ambassador's performance and what he did here fly in the face of the common decency one would expect from a diplomat coming to represent a country.<\/p> <p>For such a diplomat to come to a neutral country, such as Ireland, and behave in that way, laugh off the prospect of an invasion and describe it as insane and for it to happen the very next day, calls into question his credibility.  If the Russian ambassador's credibility is in question, it would be appropriate to call him in and expel him and other Russian diplomats from Ireland at this time.<\/p> <p> I appreciate the Minister will say that could have the effect of us losing our embassy in Moscow.  However, we have to recognise that we have a crisis situation here.  It is an absolute crisis for millions of people in Ukraine and people throughout Europe who are terrified of what will happen when this goes all the way.  There is always the possibility that this can change.  However, if the Russians continue on the track on which they are going and conquer and hold Ukraine, as many imperialists have found in the past, it is sometimes easier to conquer a country than it is to hold it and I am sure the Russians will have that same experience.<\/p> <p> However, we hope we can have a solution here to turn this around.  Certainly, what we have seen happen in Moscow and in other cities throughout Russia where ordinary Russians have gone out to protest and to say this is wrong and to call for a different way forward gives heart that, perhaps, there can be a change.  Yet, we know that people can be so easily led in the wrong way.  Many Russians are certainly being led in the wrong way by Vladimir Putin and by what he is doing and the wrong and negative direction in which he is taking the Russian people.  It flies in the face of good international relations we have built up for so long.<\/p> <p> The United Nations has a key role to play.  We need to use our position on the UN Security Council to maximum benefit.  It is true to say we have quite a unique space there as a neutral country and we should use it to the maximum.  In that context, I offer our full support to any diplomatic efforts that have been made by the Minister, other diplomats, his Department and the Government, because we are all in this together.  We all recognise that what has happened here has been absolutely tyranny for the people of Ukraine and Europe.  We need to put every effort into trying to resolve this.<\/p> <p> We must also offer as much humanitarian support as possible.  People in Ireland, as ever, are more generous than anyone could ever imagine.  In every village and town throughout the country, we see people put their hands in their pockets and talk about having collections and assisting and welcoming people from Ukraine to Ireland, as we have always done.  Ireland as the country of welcomes is certainly something we need to bring to the fore at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100031#FF00300","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646157600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo insert the following after &quot;good offices to search for a peaceful settlement&quot;<br \/><br \/>&quot;&mdash; further calls for Ireland to provide increased humanitarian aid for the people of Ukraine and for Ireland to offer refuge for all people fleeing the war;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; further condemns the arrests and persecution of anti-war protestors by President Putin and the Russian state; salutes the bravery of the growing anti-war protests in Russia; and calls for support across the world for further mobilisation of anti-war movements in Russia and worldwide as the best hope for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and avoidance of the risk of war between major powers;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; further notes the risk of nuclear conflict out of Ukraine and calls on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to de-escalate its military presence and withdraw battle groups and missiles in Eastern Europe; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; further reaffirms that Ireland is a militarily neutral State, that it will maintain a policy of non-membership of military alliances, that it will not participate in any war or armed conflict nor aid foreign powers in any way in preparation for, or in the conduct of, war or armed conflict, including through the mechanism of the European Union, without prior assent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot; <\/blockquote>  <p>The situation developing in Ukraine is both horrendous and quite terrifying.  The assault by Putin and his forces on Ukraine is barbaric, foul and obscene and must be condemned.  It comes from a regime that has a long and brutal history of warmongering and despotism, whether it is suppressing dissent towards the regime by the Russian population or the bloody wars in Chechnya, Georgia and Moldova.<\/p><p>I was at the United States Embassy protesting last night.  I recalled the fact that in 1999, I stood outside that same embassy with very few people, it should be said, protesting against the Russian slaughter in Chechnya which claimed the lives of 50,000 to 80,000 people, but was little remarked on in the western world at the time.  It is vitally important we extend our solidarity to the Ukrainian people whose suffering is unspeakable.  We must do absolutely everything to extend humanitarian assistance, solidarity and support to Ukrainian people and defend, absolutely, their right to resist this brutal invasion of their country.<\/p><p>We believe the Government's motion is one sided because it does not, as our amendment does, allude to hope in this rather dark and grim situation - the Russian anti-war movement of ordinary Russians that has exploded on to the streets.  It proves that huge numbers of Russians do not stand behind Putin and oppose everything he is doing.  We must do absolutely nothing to undermine that movement of opposition to Mr. Putin but, rather, do everything we can to support and nurture that heroic resistance.<\/p><p>Most important, we must not pour petrol on this dangerous fire which could be inflamed to the terrifying, unthinkable point of the use of nuclear weapons, or deliberate or accidental catastrophes at nuclear power plants in that area.  It is critical we warn against any escalation.  As a neutral country, we have to be proactive in arguing against forces that wish to escalate this situation or seek to use it encourage militarisation, war and arms expenditure as a solution to the terrifying and dangerous situation we are witnessing in Ukraine.  That is why we think it is critically important to mention NATO.<\/p><p>That is not to excuse Putin's behaviour.  However, it was absolutely inevitable after the eastward expansion of NATO and the act of recruiting countries into a nuclear military alliance with a bloody history in Afghanistan and a history of bombing in Libya and whose major powers have been and are, as we speak, guilty of engaging in warmongering around the world.  They are not the allies of the Ukrainian people and, most certainly, should not be the allies of this country, as a neutral country.<\/p><p>Our job should be to argue against warmongering; involvement in military alliances, the arms industry and military expenditure and to urge peace and dialogue as the way to settle conflicts.

It is a disgusting slur designed to silence opponents of war in order to further the plans on display in this debate today to undermine Ireland's neutrality.

While Mr. Tony Blair rolled out the red carpet for Putin during that war, the socialist left opposed it.  Who spoke out against Putin's jailing of Pussy Riot and the repression of LGBTQ activists?  It was the left.  Who is on the streets in Russia in protest against the war right now?  A Putin ally in the Duma has called them Trotskyists and left scum.  Of course, it is much broader than the organised left.<\/p> <p>I want to be very clear.  It is not pro-Putin to say we do not want an escalation and to point out the dangers of a spiral towards an all-out war between nuclear powers, or to say we are against sanctions that are already having a devastating effect on the lives of Russian people.

It is for the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian people alone to decide their own future, with a right to self-determination for minorities.<\/p>  <p>  I condemn this invasion.  The Putin regime is murderous.  It employs force at home to enforce its dictatorial rule over its own people and force abroad to advance it imperialist objectives, namely, its lust for power and profit.  Russian troops must be withdrawn back to their barracks in Russia and out of Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  I oppose those in the ruling classes in the West who would exploit this crisis to advance their imperialist and militarist objectives.  This includes the German Government, which plans to immediately treble its spending on arms.  It also includes the US political and military establishment, which plays the lead role in NATO and which killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqi people in a war for oil.<\/p>  <p>  I also oppose the agenda of this Irish Government, which seeks to align its foreign policy more closely with NATO.

I note that 1 million Russian people have signed petitions again the war.  Petitions will not stop Putin, of course, but 1 million people in the streets of Russia will represent not only a massive challenge to the war itself, but quite possibly, the beginning of the end of the Putin regime.  Protests and strikes on the streets of Russia marked the beginning of the end of the First World War, tsarist rule and capitalism in that country.  I hope that historical example can be repeated.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I call on workers and young people in this country to take inspiration from the heroism of ordinary Ukrainians and follow the example of the Russian anti-war movement, and take to the streets here in massive numbers to say \"No\" to this war and build an anti-war movement.

In the few brief minutes I have before I share time with colleagues, I will hit on three points because we can have a discussion on so many different aspects that require attention.<\/p>  <p>  The first call I will make is for the Irish Government, in particular, to work with European partners directly on addressing the very real disinformation campaign that is being used by the Russian Government to undermine the efforts of the government in Ukraine to protect its people and, indeed, the efforts of many people in Russia to access the truth.<\/p>  <p>  That measures have been taken on Sputnik today to ban Russia from the airwaves in the EU is welcome.  Much more can be done by social media companies in particular, however.  It was easy enough for them to ban Donald Trump's Twitter account and yet they are not being half as proactive when it comes to tackling the propaganda from Putin sympathisers across social media.  The fact that so many of these social media companies are headquartered in Ireland behoves us to lead in the European Union to take a much stronger line.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate the response from the Government to calls from many Deputies on this side of the House and, indeed, the other side, to expel the Russian ambassador and all 31 of his diplomats currently working in the Russian Embassy in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown.  I fundamentally repeat that call, however.  The Russian ambassador simply cannot be welcome in this State while Russia continues its illegal and bloody invasion of Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  I have a particular concern about the continuing presence of not one but two defence attach&eacute;s in the Russian Embassy in this State, an embassy which has previously had diplomats expelled from on suspicion of espionage.  The British Government only has one defence attach&eacute;.  We have much more work dealing with the British on defence matters due to the memorandum of understanding as well as historic reasons and yet the Russians have two attach&eacute;s.  It is a very suspicious approach to take.<\/p>  <p>  Unlike others, I fundamentally support and agree with every word spoken by and comment made by my party colleague, Deputy Flanagan, earlier in this debate.  He is right; rather than taking advantage, he is talking about a realistic concern that many of us in this country - a majority, in fact, if one looks at opinion polling - have with regard to our security and defence capabilities.  The fact that this country was the victim of a vicious cyberattack in August, by all accounts due to non-government operators with the protection of the Russian Government should be telling for all of us that we cannot simply continue to defend ourselves alone.<\/p>  <p>  The final point I will make is that the decision taken by the Irish Government to only partially support the European package for the Ukrainian Government earlier this week was a complete and utter cop out.  There is nothing stopping the Irish Government supporting the funding of the supply of lethal weapons to the Ukrainian army and people, every man and woman.  If we were in Ukraine today, all the men sitting in this House would be called up to defend the country.  That is what they are facing.  They cannot defend it with lights, flags, solidarity and all the nice things that are worthy.  What they really need is Javelin missiles and our support to ensure they can defend their homes and children.  We have all seen the horrific images.  Putin is now attacking civilian facilities and using cluster bombs.

Three packages have been announced in just the last few days, which include removing air access, removing banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT, system, sanctions against key individuals, sanctions against Belarus and limiting the propaganda power of Russia's puppet media.  Every one of these sanctions is a two-edged sword.  They will impact Russian interests but will also have an impact on Irish and EU interests.  However, we take them because we deem them to be necessary and justified.  I believe there is more we can do as a country to express our solidarity with Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, we expelled Russian diplomats following the poisoning incident in the UK.  The events of this week, when the Russian ambassador used our airwaves to spread lies and disinformation, and Russia invaded a sovereign nation and is targeting civilians in what could amount to war crimes, are incidents that I believe are at least comparable with the 2018 incident in the UK and, in reality, are far more grave.<\/p>  <p>  It is, therefore, time that we moved to expel their diplomats from Ireland again.  Like other sanctions, it will have consequences, but we should not be shy about taking the right decision.  Diplomacy is the formalised communication between nations, including the ultimate communication to sever that relationship.  It is ultimately a call for our Government.  In my view, however, all EU countries should expel Russian diplomats.  That is without prejudice to the EU as a block maintaining a diplomatic relationship that may be required to build a peaceful solution.<\/p>  <p>  In the very short time remaining, I must mention the triple lock mechanism, which I supported, that guarantees our military neutrality and multilateral approach to foreign policy.  However, it also hands Russia, China, Great Britain or the United States a veto on this State taking any military action, even on this island, because they are permanent members of the UN Security Council.  This D&aacute;il must ask itself whether we believe our sovereignty is best served by the interests of those nations.<\/p> <p>This is a question that is increasingly relevant, but which today's debate does not allow us to fully discuss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100033#HH00400","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646158800,"counter":359,"content":"<p>Just a few weeks ago, we would have scarcely have believed that we would find ourselves in a 1930s moment and yet here we are.  A dictator has moved beyond threatening his neighbour.  Putin has rained total devastation and indiscriminate slaughter down on Ukraine.  He has gambled with the peace and stability of Europe, of his own country and of the world.<\/p><p>In 1936, &Eacute;amon de Valera addressed the United Nations in Geneva.  He lamented the unwillingness and the incapacity of the League of Nations to defend Ethiopia.  He said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tLet us face the fact that every nation may when the test comes have many good reasons for shirking the terrible responsibility of entering upon a war.  Let us face the fact that not one of the fifty nations represented here is prepared to face war to preserve the principles of the League in the present dispute.  <\/blockquote>  <p>We speak of solidarity with Ukraine.  Hundreds of thousands across Europe are expressing solidarity in the only way they can.  They are taking to the streets.  They are active across social media.  They are making themselves heard.  As parliamentarians and as governments, the threshold for solidarity is much higher.  It is not enough for us to say that we support Ukraine.  We have influence.  We have power.  We can help Ukraine by our actions, or we can condemn it by our inaction.  We must give the people of Ukraine every chance of survival.  We have seen how they are standing up for democracy, for their right to self-govern and for their right to self-defence in the face of a man who is intent on destroying democracies and intent on maximising destruction on his neighbour.  <\/p><p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, spoke earlier of how impressed he was with the speed at which governments acted when it became clear that all-out war was imminent.  We have seen urgency and unity across the governments of Europe.  Positions that were long-held by states and by political parties shifted dramatically in a matter of days.  We have shown that governments need not be stagnant and slow moving.  They can be agile and responsive when people need it most.  We have seen immeasurable courage from the men and women of Ukraine.  The world is watching with awe as they face down the tanks of a military superpower.  We have seen political courage across the European Union as leaders and Ministers faced up to what was happening.  They saw it for what it was, namely, a war of aggression against a sovereign nation, a 1930s moment.  The sacred cows of non-intervention and neutrality have been shaken.<\/p><p>This responsiveness from the political establishment in Europe has given Ukraine a chance against the odds.  In my party, which is a pan-European party, we have always taken a firm stance against militarisation.  Our fundamental philosophy is to oppose it, but it has been recognised that we do not have the luxury of not being involved.  As Europeans, we are involved and across Europe we are facing up to that.  <\/p><p>Ireland must grapple with the same dilemma.  We are on the edge of Europe, but are we going to stand on the side-lines?  We must have the courage and resolve that we are seeing in the Ukraine and that we are seeing across Europe.Whether we like it or not, we are part of this 1930s moment.  This is a fight for democracy, for sovereign integrity and, possibly, for civilisation.

It is important that in this House we assess ourselves when it comes to deciding how we respond to the threat posed by Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s unlawful and brutal invasion of Ukraine.  We need to know what our capacities are and what our limitations are.<\/p>  <p>  The first thing we all need to acknowledge is that we are not a military power.  We do not have the type of military power that would have any impact on this invasion.  Even if we did, we could not use it, because of our long-standing policy of neutrality.  However, we need to look at where we are powerful and where we are significant.  This comes under two headings.  First, as a member of the European Union, we are very effective.  That is why I support the Government in what it has done by being part of the imposition of swingeing sanctions on the Putin regime, which I think will be effective.<\/p>  <p>  Second, and more important, we are an independent, sovereign State.  We are a State that has a proud record of standing up to aggression and of standing up for justice.  We need to emphasise that more.  We also need to recognise that when it comes to foreign policy, it is not a delegated function.  It is a competence that remains within the member state under the European treaties.  That is why I find it so hard to understand that a country that is as proud of Ireland is prepared to associate itself diplomatically with a regime that is at present committing war crimes.  We know that it is committing war crimes.  The Government says that it is committing war crimes and yet we are prepared to go along with this practice of permitting diplomatic relations between Ireland and Vladimir Putin's Russia.  We should call an end to it.  We should close our embassy in Moscow.  We should bring our diplomats home.  We should tell the Russian ambassador and his colleagues in the embassy, which is on the appropriately named Orwell Road, to depart, to get their bags and baggage and to leave this country.<\/p>  <p>  As to the reasons we do not do that, two reasons have been given.  First, we want to keep diplomacy open so that we can talk.  This is where self-awareness is important.  We are delusional if we think Vladimir Putin or his regime is going to listen to Ireland.  They have no interest in listing to Ireland.  The second reason we do not do it is that we are told it is important to ensure that a decision is made collectively by the European Union.  Foreign policy, as I said, is a competency of this country.  We should stand up proudly and we should lead the way diplomatically by saying that we want to get rid of the Russian ambassador from this country.<\/p>  <p>  If we look back at what has happened in Europe, we can see that different reasons and different decisions are being made by member states within the European Union.  That has happened already.  Some of them are participating militarily.  Others, such as us, are not.  It is not correct to say that we have to act collectively as a European Union.  By doing so, we are undermining our strength as an independent country.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100034#JJ00300","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1646158800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I commend this motion.  Like many Members here, it is vital that we give our solidarity to the Ukrainian people.  T&aacute;im an-s&aacute;sta a labhairt faoi saoirse na h&Uacute;cr&aacute;ine, and against the disgraceful Russian onslaught and the war crimes of Vladimir Putin and his army.  We have all seen the scenes.  Some Ukrainian people have made their lives in Ireland, in places like Dundalk.  They have seen what we have seen.  It is a lot more real for them.  We can only commend the courage of those who have returned to fight a foreign invader and to defend their homeland.  It is one of the things those I have spoken to locally bring up and commend. <\/p>  <p>  It is necessary that we play our part.  Everyone has spoken about financial sanctions.  There is a need to cut off the supply chain and to cut off the moneys to ensure that the war economy cannot operate.  I heard the Russian term &ldquo;bunt\" earlier today, which refers to an uprising from the ground up.  It is the idea that one can overthrow a Russian leader.<\/p>  <p>  The big thing required is the courage and the bravery of the Ukrainian people.  What is also necessary is that things are made difficult for the Russian economy and for Vladimir Putin and that a determination might be made by others.  We have seen the bravery of people who have been protesting on the street.  Even some of the people who call him \"boss\" might think that the boss has gone too far and that it might be time for him to go because nobody knows where exactly he is intent on going at this point in time.  However, we all accept that it is somewhere very dangerous.<\/p>  <p>  We probably all expected that the Russian invasion would have had greater military success.  However, down to the defence put up by the Ukrainians, that has not been the case.  Our big fear is an escalation.  We are hearing of further attacks and of a probable escalation in various cities and towns around Ukraine at this point in time.  The future is incredibly scary.<\/p>  <p>  Brendan Murphy was in contact with both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and me.  I spoke to him a couple of days ago.  He was very worried.  He had to stop his journey with his family.  They were under attack and they were obviously under really terrible conditions.  I think he is under slightly better conditions now and is closer to the border.  He sent me a message to say that between the Irish and the Ukrainians, they are being minded.<\/p> <p>I believe he is in contact with departmental officials and the work that is being done in that regard is, of course, utterly commendable.<\/p> <p> I might highlight a couple of things he mentioned in a message he sent to me within the past half an hour.  He stated that where he lived, the war is hard, with missile tanks and many Russians and Belarusians - these are his words, not mine - being wiped out.  He went on to state Putin's 60 km military column is being broken up, and described the conflict as a bitter war, with ordinary people stopping and disarming the invaders.  Missiles are a big problem, he wrote, because they are impersonal and kill anyone who is not strong.  All of this is ominous and none of it is good.<\/p> <p> Nevertheless, there also has been a response locally in towns such as Dundalk, where St. Patrick's GFC, for example, has been carrying out collections for Ukraine.  Many people will say that what is needed is money for the likes of UNICEF and the Red Cross and there is a difficulty in respect of medicines.  I and many others have been contacted by people who have pointed out there is a fear in respect of insulin supplies, given there may be only two or three days' worth of them in Ukraine.  Moreover, there is a lack of supply even in countries such as Poland.  People are looking into organising a collection here but that would need to be facilitated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and whoever else because it would not be possible to deliver these sorts of material by truck.  It would need to be co-ordinated and I would like to think work could be done in that regard.<\/p> <p> We all stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and I fully support the motion.  We have to do whatever we can to ensure the response will hurt in Russia and that it hurts Vladimir Putin's regime in order that we can see an end to the conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100034#JJ00400","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646159400,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Berry and T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.<\/p>  <p> I welcome the proposal to allow Ukrainian citizens to come to Europe and be a part of the communities as though they were EU citizens.  Many Ukrainians already live among us and, indeed, play a big part in our day-to-day lives through work, sport and many of our social circles.  Since March last, there has been a call on the Departments of Transport and Enterprise, Trade and Employment to allow Ukrainian heavy goods vehicle, HGV, drivers to come to Ireland on work permits.  I have been told this has not been progressed because the Road Safety Authority, RSA, maintains that the Ukrainian driving licence is not recognised by Ireland as compatible.  As I have pointed out previously, a number of EU countries accept the Ukrainian HGV licence as compatible with the EU licence, including Italy and Portugal to name but two.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State that no further stress or hardship be placed on those who choose Ireland as the land of the free, as they flee the atrocities being visited on them and their loved ones.  Given all requirements have been lifted for visa qualification, can he ensure there is agreement on this issue from the RSA, not lame excuses arguing that the personnel in the area are no longer in the position?  It is quite an outrageous response.  Will the Minister of State please ensure measures can be put in place to satisfy the safety requirements and insist in the easement of accessing jobs for the people who may come here?  This would be a stitch in time that would save nine, and it is a measure that can be considered now in preparation.  It would allow those who wish to avail of Ireland as a means to getting their lives back on track to do so, and it might in some way distract them from the awfulness of what is happening by allowing them to avail of work and rebuild their lives here or when they return to Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I condemn the actions of President Putin.  There have been many calls during this debate, but no words befit the cruel actions being taken against the Ukrainian people that we see minute by minute on our social media feeds.  Words are cheap; actions speak louder than words.  Pictures of the beautiful children such as Polina will be etched on our minds forever.  Every possible action must be taken to end this horror at the earliest possible opportunity.

Watching the ominous pictures of columns of military vehicles heading towards Kyiv is deeply chilling and Ireland should, obviously, do everything it can to help the people of Ukraine.  I refer to everything in economic, financial and diplomatic terms to deploy pressure on Russia.  I welcome much of what the Government has done and I do not want this debate to be unnecessarily fractious but some critique in the Government's approach is warranted.<\/p>  <p>  The Ukrainian ambassador has asked Ireland to isolate Russia and that means sending home Russia's diplomatic mission to this State.  The Government is refusing to do that, which is a big mistake.  I have never seen a Government refuse to do what so many of its own Deputies have asked it to do.  It is unprecedented.  It is strange also that the Government is lauding itself, on the one hand, for being ahead of the rest of the European Union with regard to preventing flights from flying over Ireland's airspace, yet it is saying it cannot move until the rest of Europe does when it comes to sending the Russian ambassador home.  Ireland is refusing to exert its own sovereignty to support Ukrainian sovereignty.  It does not make sense.  Moreover, what is the Government going to do if a Russian aeroplane flies over Irish airspace?  Two Russian aeroplanes flew over Irish airspace in 2012 and we were powerless to do anything about it.  Will the Government scramble the Government jet to see whether it could stop it?<\/p>  <p>  I asked an important question earlier of the Taoiseach and he refused to answer it.  It relates to the Russian mission in Ireland and, allegedly, a number of spies who exist within it.  Is it the case that they exist?  The Minister of State might answer that in his concluding remarks.  It has been further alleged that Russia poses a significant threat to this State.  Is that the case, in his estimation?  When the Taoiseach was asked this question, he stated he was a realist when it comes to spies, which was an admission that they exist in this country and are doing damage to our interests.  That alone should be good reason for this country to send home the Russian embassy staff.<\/p>  <p>  Russian companies have sanctions against them and some of the companies are linked to firms that operate in the IFSC.  Firms in Ireland have been raising billions of euro and lending that money to Russian banks, which have been lending it to firms that have sanctions against them.  We cannot turn a blind eye to that if we want the impact of those sanctions to stick.  What will the Government do to ensure this country does not allow for the bypassing of sanctions?<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has not nearly exhausted the potential for humanitarian aid to Ukraine.  I find it strange that we have only touched the tip of the iceberg of what is necessary in humanitarian aid, yet Fine Gael Deputies are demanding that Ireland pursue lethal force.  This would do damage to Ireland&rsquo;s potential in the future to be seen as a strong, honest broker that can reach out to different factions and look for peaceful resolution.  We have a name internationally as a peaceful, honest broker.  We should not do damage to that by getting involved in the delivery of lethal force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100035#KK00300","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1646159400,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I wholeheartedly approve of and endorse the motion.  As the House will be aware, I have been raising concerns about the Ukraine situation in recent months.  Unfortunately, those concerns were well founded and now we are in a very dodgy place whereby Europe is once again at war, for the first time in the 21st century from the point of view of a land war.<\/p>  <p>  I utterly condemn the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, that is, not only the fact it is happening but also the manner in which it is being done.  We should not forget the bogus peace talks that were engaged in at the very start, where not only was time wasted from a European point of view but Mr. Putin used that time to pre-position his troops before he launched his attack.  We should never forget that.  Moreover, the conduct of the Russian ambassador is beneath contempt and should certainly be remembered.  He came to this Parliament twice in the past 12 months and lied through his teeth.  Nevertheless, that was good because we saw his true colours and every time that he said an attack was not going to happen, we knew instantly that it would, which certainly helped from a preparation point of view.<\/p>  <p>  The targeting of civilians in Ukraine is outrageous, as are the use of cluster munitions and the completely unacceptable escalation of the nuclear alert status from the baseline.  While I absolutely condemn the activities of the Russian Federation, I commend the conduct of the Ukrainian Administration and would like to see it continue.<\/p> <p>First, we have to remember the reason Ukraine is in this situation is that in 1994, it voluntarily agreed to hand over all its nuclear weapons.  Under the Budapest Memorandum, they gave Russia all their nuclear warheads in return for what they thought were security guarantees.  Ukraine utterly honoured its part of the agreement whereas we can see the Russian Federation utterly ignored its part.<\/p> <p> We should also remember that if you compare the two presidents, President Zelenskiy of Ukraine and President Putin of Russia, you can see a completely different approach.  One President is at home with his people and easy and comfortable in their presence and the other President sits at the end of a long table utterly afraid of his own shadow, basically, afraid of a few Covid bugs, not the hard man that we have been told he was in the past.<\/p> <p> I also welcome the response of the international community.  The sanctions regime is comprehensive and it was swift.  Ireland played a significant part from that point of view - the fact that there are financial sanctions, a travel ban and all the odds and sods that go with it - but the public displays of solidarity are important as well.  The lighting up of the buildings is absolutely essential.  It really motivates the Ukrainian people and demotivates those Russian soldiers who have access to the Internet.<\/p> <p> Most importantly, I very much approve of the upgrade of Ukraine's accession to the European Union.  It is now being classed as an accession candidate.  That political embrace is hugely important because President Putin - I should say \"Mr. Putin\" - basically thought by his actions he would be able to remobilise the old Soviet Union.  The reality is that he remobilised an entirely different union, the European Union, and it reminds us to go back to first principles in relation to why this Union exists in the first place.<\/p> <p> As for the Irish response, I welcome the extra &euro;10 million.  From a humanitarian point of view, Ireland was fast out of the blocks in that regard.  Humanitarian organisations are getting an extra &euro;10 million.  I also welcome the &euro;9.5 million through the European peace facility.  It is definitely unprecedented, from Ireland's point of view.<\/p> <p> I totally accept the coalition situation where there is a programme for Government.  It is a non-judicable programme.  It is only a political agreement but it should be honoured because it was voted on by the grassroots of the three constituent parties.  However, there are alternative pathways available in relation to the provision of lethal weapons.  That situation will develop over the next few days or weeks.  I suspect that the Government may have to amend its position in that regard.<\/p> <p> We can do more.  First, in respect of the Russian Embassy, I have listened to the counterarguments over the past few days as to whether the Russian ambassador should go home or should stay.  I propose a compromise.  At the very least, the Russian ambassador should be banned from attending the parliamentary precincts here.  He is no longer welcome in the Leinster House campus.  He lied to the Parliament and he lied to the people.  If Leinster House is the people's house, then he should be banned from here.  If the Minister wishes to have negotiations with the Russian ambassador, he can bring him to Iveagh House and carpet him there, and I hope the language of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will be neither parliamentary nor diplomatic in that regard.  That is what I would suggest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100035#KK00400","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646160000,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100036#LL00150","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1646160000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>Second, we have a no-fly zone for Russian aircraft over the country at present.

The Russian forces have thermobaric munitions in Ukraine at present.

I was appointed by the Ceann Comhairle as the convenor of the Irish-Russian parliamentary group.  We had a discussion following the invasion of Ukraine at the weekend and the Ceann Comhairle decided, in conjunction with the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, that the Irish-Russian parliament group would be dissolved yesterday.  The Ceann Comhairle issued a statement, which quoted me, that it was being done in full support of and solidarity with the Ukrainian Parliament and the Ukrainian people.  That job has been done, effectively and well.  Following the Russian invasion, the Ceann Comhairle's act of solidarity has been the right and appropriate one to make.  It reflects the views right around the country that that should be the case.<\/p>  <p>  This day, millions of despairing Ukrainians are fleeing for their very lives from their family homes - men to bear arms to do battle for freedom against the Russian invader and women and children to undertake arduous and desperate journeys seeking sanctuary and a safe haven in western Europe, and looking to places such as Ireland where they will find a place of safety.<\/p>  <p>  Cities all over Ukraine are daily under appalling cruise missile and artillery assault while combat-hardened Russian troops and battle tanks creep closer each day to the centre of cities such as Kyiv and threaten the innocent men, women and children who may still reside there.  Brave and determined patriotic Ukrainian soldiers are fighting resolutely and with superhuman effort to resist the invader but there is no doubt but that the dark fog of war that is swirling around in Ukraine emanates solely from the decision of one man, the Kremlin dictator, safe in his gilded palace in Moscow, as Deputy Berry said, at his long table away from and afraid of everybody.<\/p>  <p>  We in this country and, indeed, the EU and the free world call for Russia to end its military aggression in the Ukraine and we demand an immediate ceasefire.  I have no doubt but that Ireland, as a member of the United Nations Security Council, is working unceasingly for a peaceful resolution of this crisis and we are ready, willing and able to assist in that manner.<\/p>  <p>  I salute the unquenchable spirit of the Ukrainian people, as all of us do, led as they are in their resistance by the resolute and brave democratically-elected President Zelenskiy.  He is a man for all seasons.  He is somebody who shines out and gives all of us who believe in democracy a shining light to follow and to support.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish people have responded to this crisis with great generosity.  Every town and village is organising practical support, help and assistance and we are ready, willing and able to assist refugees who may come here.<\/p>  <p>  We hear today of a 60-km long Russian military convoy approaching Kyiv which has the capacity to pulverise and raze that proud city to the ground and massacre many of its remaining inhabitants.  Please God, they will not succeed in this objective.  The truth, the fundamental truth, the universal truth is that good must prevail over evil and might is not right.  I believe that the blue and yellow national flag of Ukraine will never be replaced on the flagpoles of Ukraine by the flags of temporary imposters from aggressive military occupiers.  The only other flag that should be welcome alongside their national emblem of Ukraine will, I believe, be the blue flag with the gold stars of our united European Union.  We in the European Union and Ireland must now earn our place on that flagpole by our continued determined unequivocal support for Ukrainian membership of the European Union, and, indeed, expand further our Union to further interested nations.<\/p>  <p>  We must also, as an island on the edge of Europe, play our full part in ensuring the safe defence of the European Union into the future and have a full national debate, and an informed debate, on how this can best be done.

I welcome the ongoing talks with the EU to allow Ukrainians to stay and work here for up to three years.  It is our moral duty to support these people and their families whose worlds have been so violently turned upside down.  I would welcome an update from the Minister on plans to treat Ukrainian citizens the same as EU citizens and to extend to them the right to work and social protection.  That must be done soon, given the indefinite nature of this crisis.<\/p> <p> I welcome the confirmation from the Minister for Justice today that work has started on activating the temporary protection directive.  A number of people have raised the matter of documentation with me.  I urge the Minister to take a compassionate approach to the current travel requirements and documentation such as passports.  Like many, I have been horrified by reports of white people being prioritised to leave Ukraine, while people of colour are held back at Ukrainian borders.  I want to put that on the record of the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p> We all feel very helpless watching what is going on.  The first question many people ask is what they can do to help.  Lots of people have contacted my office to ask about that.  People have offered to welcome Ukrainian people into their own homes.  I would be interested to know if we will have a system set up to allow people to register their interest to host Ukrainians coming to Ireland.  Over the weekend there were countless people and organisations arranging collections of supplies and support for Ukraine, including transition year students in Griffeen Community College.  I understand the advice is that continuing to send these supplies may clog up transport channels.  For those looking to help, the easiest way to do this is through financial donations.  Some 60,000 Irish people have already donated more than &euro;1.3 million to the Irish Red Cross Ukraine crisis appeal.  I urge people to please do so if they can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100036#LL00400","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646160600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>We are now witnessing a war of aggression in Europe, something we believed was consigned to our history books.  The bravery and heroism of Ukrainian soldiers, its President and its people is profound.  We in Ireland must do everything we can to protect and support Ukraine and its people.  The Ukrainian people and their Government did not seek this war with Russia, instead this conflict has been thrust upon them by a man detached from the reality of the modern world.  The Ukrainian people did not invade Russia.  The Ukrainian people did not ship separatists to Donbas or Crimea.  The Ukrainian people did not use cluster bombs on apartment blocks.  The Ukrainian people did not target hospitals, killing countless innocent children.  Vladimir Putin did.  He has taken the course that has been chosen by history's worst monsters.  He is a tyrant, whose fear and ideological crusade of greed and conquest will reduce the Russian Federation to a pariah state, without access to international investment, support, or sympathy.<\/p><p>A simultaneous war of disinformation is raging in Russia itself, which is why the international community must reach past the Kremlin and speak directly to the Russian people through any means possible.  I applaud the steps that are being taken to do this online but we must do more.  Ukrainian citizens can come to Ireland without the burden of normal processes.  We will support them with housing, healthcare, education and, most importantly, family reunification.<\/p><p>We do not yet know where this war will lead us.  Putin is intent on redrawing the map of Europe and the restoration of some imagined idea of Russian empire.  It was around this time eight years ago in 2014 that Ukrainian civilians, that is, normal people - mothers, fathers, teachers, bus drivers, nurses and shop workers - took to the streets and to Maidan Square in Kyiv in what became known as the Revolution of Dignity.  They protested a Government seeking to prevent their country moving towards the European Union.  I have visited Ukraine twice in recent years and on behalf of the Oireachtas, I observed its free and fair elections.  Ukraine has the right to self-determination and to determine its own foreign policy.<\/p><p>Ignoring evil will not stop evil.  I commend Russian citizens who have had the courage to protest this war in Russian cities, knowing a despotic dictator such as Putin would have them arrested, which he did.  Today, we see again the dignity of the people of Ukraine and their rightful President, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.  We must support their efforts to become an EU member state as quickly as possible.  The international community must continue to roll out crippling sanctions, including in hard-to-reach places, like legally complex investment vehicles right here in Ireland.  We must seize the aggressors' wealth immediately.

It will cost between &euro;100 million and &euro;200 million.  That needs to happen as a matter of urgency.  There is great frustration among the public as well as the body politic at the behaviour of the Russian ambassador to Ireland.

As a citizen of a country that understands the impact of occupation and imperialist aggression, I offer whatever support I can to these people.<\/p>  <p>  I also add my full condemnation of the actions of the Russian President.  We debated in this House previously that Ireland must use its seat on the United Nations Security Council more robustly.  We must now do whatever we can to stop this war and ensure the rights of the Ukrainian people to a peaceful future as a sovereign independent state.<\/p>  <p>  As a militarily neutral state, Ireland has played a widely recognised role in peacekeeping and in the battle against nuclear proliferation.  The Russian President's actions must be roundly condemned.  No country should be subjected to the kind of military aggression and destruction that has been brought to the people of Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  I also extend my solidarity to those ordinary citizens of Russia who are brave enough to protest against this war imposed by President Putin and have been arrested in their thousands.  We must make every effort as a country to sanction Russia here in this State.  We need to make our position very clear by expelling the Russian ambassador and ending the practices within the International Financial Services Centre that facilitated the &euro;118 billion being funnelled from this State to Russia's oligarchs.  We must use every democratic process available to us to impose sanctions and to bring a speedy and peaceful resolution to stop this war.<\/p>  <p>We must redouble our diplomatic efforts while simultaneously supporting Ukrainian people and sanctions against the regimes that are now in place.  Democracy, international law, human rights and peace are what we must focus on.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Government's decision to contribute to Ukraine via the purchase of protective equipment.  Our neutral status puts us in a unique position to work with others to end the war which is causing so much suffering to the people across Ukraine.  The EU must act with sanctions on such a scale that there can be no doubt that we will not stand by and allow Putin to continue his imperialist ambitions in Ukraine.<\/p> <p> I would like to make a comment in response to Deputy Richmond.  The most recent poll, which was discussed last night on the Claire Byrne show, shows very clearly that the vast majority of people - in fact, 76% of the 1,000 people who were polled - want Ireland to maintain its neutral status, and that must be heard.<\/p> <p> To conclude, let me reiterate my condemnation of the actions of Russia and my solidarity to the Ukrainian people and to all those countries which are suffering at the hands of oppressors, like the Palestinian people at the hands of Israel.

We have heard and seen so much in the past few days about Ukraine and the terrible way its people are being treated in their own country by Russia, a move sanctioned by the Russian Government but which may not be supported by the majority of its Russian people.  In the past few days, we have heard some politicians in this country make wild statements about expelling the Russian ambassador.  This might sound like a popular move but common sense must prevail here and doors must remain open so the mad actions of Russia will be condemned at the highest levels in this country.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland must focus most of our efforts on something we can do, and this is to make the Ukrainians who come here welcome and comfortable in Ireland.  From what I can gather, no accommodation provision has been made for anyone coming from Ukraine to Ireland.  This is typical - all talk but little or no action.  I spoke to the Ukrainian community in west Cork over the weekend in Bandon, Skibbereen, Clonakilty and Bantry.  Many of them told me they are living in one-bed apartments and are expecting family to arrive here.  In some cases, five to ten adults and children will arrive on a 90-day visa and all are expected to cram into a one-bed apartment.  This is not good enough and the Government must act quickly.<\/p>  <p>  We may ask what is the solution.  What about our lovely community centres and parish halls across the country?  While this is not the perfect solution, surely it is better than putting ten people in a one-bed apartment.  At least they will be treated with some respect and dignity if the State were to work with local communities to provide these excellent facilities with a little financial aid.<\/p>  <p>  In the past few days, I have seen what I always knew was in this country - an outpouring of love and kindness as a Ukraine family were reunited yesterday in Dublin Airport and last night in Ballydehob, after a nightmare journey.  It started in Kyiv last Friday morning when they went to their local hospital with their five and a half year-old son, who has leukaemia, to be met at the hospital by the medical team, who gave the boy&rsquo;s mother and father the boy&rsquo;s medical records and told them to flee the country immediately.  This started an incredible 77-hour journey, ending in Ballydehob last night.  I would like to thank the Department of Foreign Affairs for its co-operation, the staff in my office, who followed every minute of the highly dangerous journey for the family, night and day, and the family themselves for being brave enough to get out and seek immediate medical attention for Leonid in this country.  This journey for Yana, Sergei, Svetlana and, last but certainly not least, the real hero, Leonid, a five-year-old child who is now in the wonderful care of medical professionals in this country, must have looked like an impossible journey.  To leave behind their country, their home and their loved ones must be a heartache beyond words.  No matter how Victoria, David and Sasha show kindness in Ballydehob, the hearts and minds of that family who came from Ukraine must be in Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to thank the doctor, nurses and staff in the Mizen Medical Practice in Schull for the wonderful care shown to Leonid, who was to undergo a bone marrow transplant in Ukraine on 10 March.  I would also like to pay tribute to other medical professionals in Cork, Dublin and Belfast who have put out the hand of love to these people through me since their arrival in Ireland yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  There are many other people out there who are in our thoughts.  Eugene O'Sullivan from Bantry is out in Ukraine at the moment and I was in contact with him over the weekend, and there are many more.

We welcome those who are seeking refuge here in Ireland and those who have already arrived here safely, especially one girl I know of who arrived in Killarney late last night after travelling from the very first moment of the attack all the way to the Hungarian border, where she was met by her Killarney boyfriend.  Her mother is following now.  She had been in the car as well but the girl's grandmother got sick and was not able to make the journey, so her mother was not able to come any further.<\/p>  <p>  We are asking what we can do.

If there is no use for it, and I do not see that there is at the present time, I ask that we send it out there to them.

Over the past week, what we have seen unfolding before our eyes are acts of violence and cruelty, and an attack on the most fundamental principles of sovereignty, self-determination and democracy.  Few of us every expected to see scenes like this unfold in our lifetime and on our continent.  We have also seen the resolve of Ukrainian citizens, in Ukraine and abroad, standing up against Russian aggression and this existential threat against their country.  As others have stated, our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine.  We stand with them in this hour of need.<\/p>  <p>  This is a moment for European solidarity, not just in words but in actions too.  The Irish public has been rightly horrified by events in Ukraine.  As the Taoiseach said earlier, the Government must be generous in its response to the crisis.  That is what the Irish public want to see.  People have already begun to arrive from Ukraine, including a small number who have claimed international protection.  In the coming days, we expect to see, for the first time in 15 years, unaccompanied minors from Ukraine arriving into Ireland and seeking international protection.  We are potentially facing into a level of displacement not seen within Europe since the Second World War.  Collective solidarity across the EU is the best response to this crisis.  In this collective response, Ireland will not be found wanting.<\/p>  <p>  This is a moment of international crisis.  Our country may be asked to make a collective national effort to provide sanctuary for civilians.  If that happens, all of Government and every community in this country must rise to that challenge and do our part to help all those from Ukraine who seek refuge here, whether in the short term or for longer.  That is the character of Irish people and what our people expect us as their political leaders.  We have a strong track record in this area in recent years.  In responding to the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan, we offered humanitarian visas to more than 500 vulnerable individuals through the Irish refugee protection programme.  We are also continue to meet our ongoing commitments to support Syrian refugees who are integrating into communities across the country.

The Government wishes to support as many people as possible.

Many Ukrainians may wish to remain close to the border with Ukraine in order to enable them to return home as soon as possible, if that becomes feasible.

This work will allow us identify the type and the scale of the resources needed to ensure that Ireland is a position to respond in a comprehensive and compassionate manner to those fleeing the crisis in Ukraine.

When I realised that I could not give a monosyllabic answer to a very straightforward question, it encapsulated the magnitude of the event we are discussing today.  I rise in support of the Government motion in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and in condemnation of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  It is a breach of international law.  It is a monumental failure of politics, which is the stock-in-trade of what we do.  We have to accept that internationally, as politicians, we have failed.  It is inconceivable that having seen the devastation of a world war on European soil and European citizens in living memory that we could be on the cusp of that again.  That is why we must recognise that this is a watershed moment.  History has a habit of repeating itself.  We know the consequences of appeasement in the 1930s.  Appeasement of Putin to date has led us to this situation.<\/p>  <p>  Words matter.  I welcome the apparent consensus.  It is broadly nuanced in certain circumstances and belated from other quarters within this House.  Nevertheless, I welcome the broad consensus of the contributions to this debate.  However the genesis of this problem goes back at least to 2014 and the invasion of Crimea by Russia.  On that occasion, unfortunately, many within this House and others who have flown this nest and gone elsewhere failed the test in that appeasement of Putin's Russia on those occasions.  The voting record of members of the European Parliament then and subsequently, even as recently as December, is a travesty of appeasement of a brutal regime that breaches international law and has led us to where we are today.<\/p>  <p>  As I say, words matter in politics.  They are the stock-in-trade of our profession.  Unfortunately, many have failed the test.  I welcome the international coalition that has been amassed.  I acknowledge in particular the role played by the Government and the support it has received in the House and from the people at large for the actions taken.  The stock-in-trade of the Putin regime has included breaches of international law, suppression of dissent and poisoning.  The list is endless.  We should have no truck with that.  There should be no equivocation in respect of lawlessness.<\/p>  <p>  Last week I attended the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, parliamentary assembly meeting in Vienna.  I took the opportunity on Thursday to express the solidarity of this Parliament and the Irish people with the Ukrainian people.<\/p> <p>One of the most telling contributions at that meeting was made by the Ukrainian representative, who said if we think this is going to end in Ukraine, we are making a monumental mistake.  His prediction was if Putin succeeds in Ukraine the next stop is Moldova.  Thereafter, he will continue unfinished business in Georgia and in doing all that he will be destabilising Russian minorities within the European Union's borders and heading for the Baltic states.  In that context, I acknowledge the role we have played in building that consensus and the actions we have taken, while suggesting one or two others.  We could follow the Turks' example in closing the Bosporus.  We could close the Skagerrak.  That would close off a marine avenue for Russian trade that would be significant.  It is something that could be considered by the Heads of Government, the Council of Ministers, etc.  We should also consider another maritime step.  We should not purchase any of the proceeds of the Russian fishing fleet, which I think would be significant.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge I am impinging on Deputy Calleary's time.  What is needed is regime change.  I salute the opposition in Russia.  It is a monumentally brave act to put your head above the parapet in Russia and stand up against Putin's regime.  We need regime change in Russia.  We need to ensure the cyberattacks, poisonings, interference with foreign elections and suppression of civilian and political dissent comes to an end so we can have normal relations.  I acknowledge the calls made by others for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador.  Action should be taken against the Russian diplomatic service in Dublin.  I acquiesce to the judgment of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Government as to who should bear the brunt of that, but it is undoubtedly true the incumbent is a yes-man and an apologist for the Putin regime.  Whether his presence here can continue or not is something that is up for question, but we need to have avenues of communication open.  I am reminded of Kissinger's remarks on America in Europe when we asked who do you call when you want to talk to Europe.  We need somebody to talk to.  There are Irish citizens in Russia.  Russia may well call the shots in Ukraine temporarily in the weeks to come, and we have citizens there also.

As we were doing so, President Putin was making arrangements to cross the border and invade Ukraine.  As we speak, Kyiv is being bombarded with missiles.  Last night, Fergal Keane, who has observed so many of these situations, finished his report with a father touching his son, who was inside a train, through the glass and on the glass.  He said: \"What cannot be held must be let go, until another day\".  That is the reality for families.  They are being split.  They are being torn apart and torn asunder.  Fergal Keane also said he had seen scenes he had never imagined he would see, and he is a war correspondent who, unfortunately, has many years of experience and exposure.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the Government's position on the Russian ambassador, but what about when somebody cannot give a credible answer?  He was challenged last Friday evening on RT&Eacute; that he is an apologist for slaughter.  He had no credible answer to that challenge from David McCullagh.  He said it was a matter for the Irish Government.  We must ask ourselves if is this somebody who has respect for the views of the Irish people and who we can do business with.  I accept the need to keep diplomatic channels open, but is it worth keeping them open when we are not being listened to?<\/p>  <p>  We need to be able to stand up, as a Government and as a country, and say that within the IFSC and within the section 110 trusts, no Russian operations are being financed or facilitated through the existence of said trusts or through the support of work relating to them.  If we cannot do that or clearly say that, then we need to act as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said about the ordinary Russian people.  Many of them are taking brave steps to outline their opposition to all this.  They should be supported and acknowledged.<\/p>  <p>  As a final point, we need to act cohesively.  Last Wednesday night, I traced how, as Deputy Creed said, this has been going on since 2014.  Since then, we have had a relaxation on the part of many institutions, including the EU.  I acknowledge the huge steps taken in the past few days, but they have come too late.  We need the resolution of the past few days to be continued and strengthened.  All of us, as member states and citizens, need to look in the mirror and ask ourselves if we are doing enough.  Are we doing enough, as member states, to cut this off at the head?  Unless we do that and cut every asset, source of finance and source of support off we cannot look at ourselves in the mirror properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100040#PP00200","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1646162400,"counter":395,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an deis a bheith p&aacute;irteach sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht agus &aacute;r ndl&uacute;thph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht a chur in i&uacute;l do mhuintir na h&Uacute;cr&aacute;ine agus a r&aacute; leo go seasaimid leo agus an m&eacute;id taca&iacute;ochta is f&eacute;idir linn a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh, ar chabhair dhaonn&uacute;il &iacute; at&aacute; bunaithe ar an bpr&iacute;omhrud, is &eacute; sin gur t&iacute;r neodrach muid.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to take part in this discussion.  I have a slight few more minutes than I had on the last occasion but my message is exactly the same, notwithstanding the blatant breach of international law by Russia, which went in on the day after I made my speech.  I stood up as a voice for peace and asked for this country to be that voice as well.  That is the role we will have to play and we have no choice about it.  I say to mhuintir na h&Uacute;cr&aacute;ine we stand with you for every possible human help we can give you.  I welcome the package of help offered and the sanctions that have been highlighted.  I would like to see the details of those to discern whether some of the sanctions are self-serving or are they actually serving what they are setting out to do.  I would also like to see the details for helping the people who come here.  I welcome it and also the two &euro;10 million amounts highlighted, although one of them is a matter for discussion on another day.  It is dancing on the top of a needle in the context of lethal and non-lethal weapons, but it is for another day.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to pick up on Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's remarks.  He said that we are a sovereign, independent country.  I totally agree with him on that.  He went on to say we should use that independence in making decisions about expelling diplomats and other things.  I agree with him on that.  We are an independent, sovereign state.  We should reflect on what that means and how we can use it because it does not mean sitting idly by.  I repeat we will not sit idly by in the face of what is going on.  However, we must do that in full knowledge we are a neutral country with a powerful voice.  How do we then use that voice?  We build on the trust and respect we have gained that allowed us to get a seat on the UN Security Council on a temporary basis because people trusted us.  Countries trust us.  We are in serious danger of losing that trust if we go with the vast majority of the call here on the right to move forward to a military alliance.<\/p>  <p>  Ours is a tiny country of approximately 5 million people.  We have experienced much in our lifetimes and we should build on that and use it.  I go forward to what has been mentioned as the hypocrisy of some of our attitudes.  We all got a briefing on Yemen today and I have it here.  When I hear we stand up to the egregious breaking of human rights I fully agree but we do it on a very selective basis.  There have been seven years of war in Yemen and 10,000 is the minimum number of children.  When we look at children, it does not matter which country and which war - I abhor it.  The minimum number of children is 10,000.  The number who have died is 377,000.  Time is running on.  The figures are here and we have done nothing, as a neutral country.  We have stood idly by and watched Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who did not vote for the action against Russia, interestingly enough.  We have stood idly by.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100040#PP00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1646162400,"counter":396,"content":"<p>We have discussed that multiple times at the Security Council, multiple times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100040#PP00400","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1646162400,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I have very little time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100040#PP00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1646162400,"counter":398,"content":"<p>There have been no sanctions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100040#PP00600","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1646162400,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Multiple times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100040#PP00700","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1646162400,"counter":400,"content":"<p>No sanctions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100040#PP00800","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1646162400,"counter":401,"content":"<p>We have stood idly by.

Implicit in that is the absolute right of Ukraine to determine its own future and alliances, including membership of the EU.  I am pleased to see that the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly, with just nine against, to approve EU membership for Ukraine.  The right to self-determination includes Ukraine's right to join NATO if that is the choice of the democratically elected Ukrainian Government.  The first paragraph of this motion references our right as the Irish nation to determine our relationships with other nations.  It is the same for Ukraine and, indeed, the Baltics - the tiny Estonia and the slightly larger Latvia and Lithuania - if they wish to remain members of NATO and not bow to Putin's threats.  Those countries have declared their independence and have democratically elected governments.  That is the beginning, middle and end of it.  If we proclaim our right not to join NATO, then they have an equal right to join or not to join it.<\/p>  <p>  The attack on Ukraine was premeditated and well planned, as Putin amassed his troops on the borders of Ukraine for many months, the details of which are clearly outlined in the European Parliament motion on Ukraine of 15 December.  The invasion of Ukraine is another step in years of Russian action dating back to 1991 and, latterly, to 2014 and Euromaidan &ndash; support for promoting Brexit, interference in US elections, the proliferation of disinformation and cyberattacks linked to Russia, including that on our own HSE.  All of this was done in an effort to destabilise, sow doubt and dissent between countries, weaken our democratic states and undermine our institutions, especially those that promote civil and human rights.  While we strongly pledge our support to Ukraine, it is important to remember that this is not an isolated incident.  It is part of a pattern meant to establish a new world order.  It is a frightening prospect for all of us but a terrifying one for those in Kyiv and other cities.<\/p>  <p>  As I drove from Sligo to Boyle this morning, a distance of just over 40 km, I could not help but think of the 40 km convoy of troops, tanks and missiles bearing down on Kyiv and the shocking despair of those waiting in bunkers and underground and those defending their city.  I am afraid that we may spend many more days, weeks and even months watching our large and small screens as this unfolds in front of us and asking ourselves what we can do as individuals and collectively as a government.  Many of the actions taken by Ireland as part of the EU contribute to a strong response &ndash; closing off money trails to Russian banks, freezing many of the assets of the Russian Central Bank, enforcing no-fly zones, etc. &ndash; but I have a question.  I am not sure that all the loopholes have been closed.  We know that money finds a way to move.  Oil and gas find a way to move and they have to be paid for.  I am genuinely asking whether we have done all that we can.  Where the IFSC and the upwards of &euro;118 billion in dark money moving through Dublin and on to Moscow and elsewhere are concerned, have we done everything that we can?  I am not sure that our hands are clean, and if we are unsure, then now is the time to wash them.<\/p>  <p>  We are not sending military hardware to Ukraine because we are neutral.  I support that position.  We might revisit it but that is for another day.  We have contributed &euro;10 million and will contribute a further &euro;9.5 million.  Many Irish citizens are contributing.  Perhaps the Government might consider the State matching those contributions, whatever they are.<\/p>  <p>  My final point is on our role in the UN.  It is an area where, as a neutral state, we can make our best impact.  I understand that Russia has a veto and has used it.  We must not forget that, when Ireland applied to join the UN in the late 1940s, Russia vetoed our application, so it has form.  As a small peacekeeping country, though, Ireland can play a niche role on the world stage.  Right now, the UN is our theatre.

I have asked my Department and the HSE to identify ways for Ireland to provide medical assistance.  They are responding to a number of urgent requests for medical humanitarian assistance that we have received from the governments of Ukraine and bordering EU member states.  The Government of Ukraine is seeking support, including emergency medical supplies, from Ireland and other EU member states directly through the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism.  The Government of Ireland has offered an initial donation of medical supplies to the Government of Ukraine through this mechanism.  The donation includes 10,000 bio-protection suits, 50,000 medical protective masks and 2,500 litres of disinfectant, all items requested by the Government of Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have attended EU meetings of the Health Security Committee and the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority in recent days and have heard directly from Ukrainian officials, and the deputy minister for health speaking from Kyiv, about the harrowing situation they are facing as they attempt to prepare their health services to receive civilian and military casualties.  We have also heard directly from Ukraine&rsquo;s neighbouring countries, including Poland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from Ukraine and its neighbouring countries have indicated that their needs are rapidly changing and that we can expect further requests for assistance, including medical assistance.

As a nation that values these highly, it is incumbent on us all to make clear our solidarity with Ukraine.  The Government's motion, which I support, states that Ireland is fully committed to the UN principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of states, that Ukraine has the right to ensure the security and defence of its territory, and that Ireland condemns Russian aggression in Ukraine and calls on Russia to withdraw its military.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that some negotiations were attempted between Ukraine and the aggressor states at the border between Belarus and Ukraine.<\/p> <p>It is not clear how impactful these negotiations might be or if the Russian side recognises what it must do at a minimum, that is, withdraw all of its forces from the Ukraine, including Crimea and Donbas, cease to undermine Ukraine's territorial integrity and recognise Ukraine's sovereignty unreservedly.  This, and only this, would adhere to the UN principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of states.  The United Nations Security Council has not been able to appropriately address the Russian and Belarusian violation of UN principles due to Russia's use of its veto. <\/p> <p> I have heard it said many times in this debate and last week as well that Ireland must use its voice at the United Nations Security Council.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to our ambassador, Geraldine Byrne Nason, who gave a very evocative speech a number of weeks ago in which she spoke about Ireland's past.  I refer also to that very evocative photograph of our deputy ambassador, Jim Kelly, who was voting to hold a special session of the General Assembly to counteract the Russian veto at the UN Security Council as best we could.  Our diplomats and our entire team are doing tremendous work at the United Nations.  We are very proud of them.<\/p> <p> Russia cannot prevent it being held accountable for its actions.  That is what we have been working on at the UN Security Council over the past few weeks.  As an Irish team, we have focused on the new humanitarian crisis triggered by Russia's invasion.  This futile and needless act of aggression has compounded the suffering of millions, with hundreds of thousands, perhaps more, internally displaced refugees now in need of humanitarian assistance.  At this moment, in underground bunkers, underground carparks and bomb shelters, there are families, children, women, men, old and young, trying to sleep not only with the physical discomfort but mental torture that must accompany that, which none of us in this House has any experience of.  It must be horrific.  Let us think of those people who at this minute are sheltering in fear, many of them in the underground, it being the only possible safe place they may have because of the aggression of Russia.  <\/p> <p> Let us not forget that Russia's friend in Belarus, the autocratic dictator, President Alexander Lukashenko, is an aggressor as well.  We have spoken many times about the violations of human rights and the oppression of civil society in Belarus.  We have condemned the Lukashenko regime for oppressing its people and jeopardising neighbouring relations with the EU.  President Lukashenko has gone too far now as well.  The military build-up of Russian troops in Belarus at the border with the Ukraine, which was 1,000 km long, took place under the pretext of a joint training exercise between Russia and Belarus.  President Lukashenko has not only given in to and co-operated with this Russian aggressor, he has humiliated his own country by handing over the sovereignty of Belarus to President Vladimir Putin.  On Sunday, when the aggression against Ukraine was ongoing, the Belarusian regime organised a constitutional referendum which lacked any democratic review process.  This was outrageous.  The Belarusian people continue to protest against the internal terror and the recent aggression on Ukraine but their attempts to hold the regime accountable result in detentions and further oppression.<\/p> <p> On the IFSC, I want it to be clear that the IFSC is not a means of evading sanctions, as has been suggested by one or two Deputies on the opposite side of the House.  The proportion of funds in the IFSC that are Russian-connected is tiny.  Let us not forget that the IFSC is responsible for financial services in general and for approximately 50,000 jobs in this country.  Any company or person on the sanctions list will not be able to deal in the IFSC.  The previous sanctions have had an impact in reducing the number of Russian funds in the IFSC.  Any company or person who has been sanctioned cannot deal there.  I have no doubt that following on from the announcement of the sanctions at the weekend there are people in offices around this city tonight working out, as they did yesterday, who they have stop doing business with.  That is happening.  That is what the sanctions are doing.  There will be no escape from those sanctions.  As this is a changing situation, the sanctions are constantly changing.  We have gradually moved forward.  I am very proud of the unity that we have shown around the European table.  I am proud also of the Taoiseach, Deputy Martin, who was to the fore in proposing that the SWIFT system be subject to sanctions and on coming to the conclusion with his fellow leaders after a discussion that there was no way that leaders could leave the European Council and explain that President Putin or Foreign Minister Lavrov were not subject to sanctions so they have been subject to sanctions.<\/p> <p> The bravery of the people of Ukraine and their commitment to democracy has been demonstrated to a previously unfathomable degree.  The resistance towards invasion has been fierce.  We know that the Ukrainian people rightly refuse to cede any inch of their sovereign territory.  There has been a deliberate and orchestrated disinformation campaign but the Ukrainians have been able to address and give information and hope to their people.  We have seen President Zelenskiy do that.  The Government will continue to work at a European level.  We have had two General Affairs Councils, a European Council, two Justice and Home Affairs Councils, two Foreign Affairs Councils and at this minute our diplomats are working on this issue.  There is a huge amount of work going on by the Irish Government at a European Union and among parliamentarians as well. <\/p> <p> I was quite touched when Deputy Creed referred to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in Vienna.  My first visit abroad as a Member of this D&aacute;il was to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in Kyiv.  We were there as democrats with our fellow democrats - not all in the OSCE are democracies - representing our countries, meeting colleagues and having discussions.  It is tragic to think of what is happening there today.  I have no doubt that when this is over, somehow, we will look forward and work with and invest in Ukraine and its democratic future, which I have no doubt will be within the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100041#QQ00500","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646163600,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646163600,"counter":409,"content":"<p>Insofar as a vote has been called, the division is deferred until the weekly division time tomorrow evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100042#RR00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health Waiting Lists: Motion [Private Members]","time":1646163600,"counter":410,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100042#RR00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1646163600,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>notes that:<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

Health waiting lists, as conceded by the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, are dangerously high.  The problem is not only the number of people on waiting lists, but the length of time people are on them.  There are 893,040 people on an acute hospital waiting lists, 731,797 of whom are on active waiting lists.  There are 226,966 people waiting for a diagnostic assessment and 224,631 more people are on primary and community health waiting lists across mental health, disabilities, older persons and many other areas.  That is an astounding 1.34 million on some form of health waiting list.  Ten thousand more people were added to our acute hospital waiting lists in January of this year. <\/p><p>This month, 10,000 people were left on hospital trolleys in corridors across acute hospitals in this State.  In January of this year, 1,100 people over the age of 75 were on a hospital trolley for more than 24 hours in acute hospitals.  In one month, 1,100 people over the age of 75 were left on a hospital trolley for more than 24 hours.  That is astounding.  People are now waiting for GP access sometimes for days, sometimes for weeks.  Out-of-hours services are patchy in some areas and non-existent in others.  All of this, as we know, is adding to the pressure in our acute hospitals.  If people cannot get access to GP services, they are left with little choice but to go to our emergency departments in acute hospitals.<\/p> <p>Dentists are leaving the dental treatment service scheme at a rate of knots.  There are long waiting times for orthodontic treatment and for children waiting for dental treatment under general anaesthetic.  Tens of thousands of children with disabilities are waiting for access to speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and child psychology.  There are long waiting times across the board.  In audiology, children and adults are waiting a long time for hearing tests and hearing aids.  Children are waiting for grommet insertions.  All of these are examples of long waiting times across the system.  We also know that the National Ambulance Service is chronically understaffed and needs to be resourced.  <\/p> <p> The Minister last week published his waiting list strategy.  I pointed out at the time that there was no additional funding beyond that allocated through the budget.  It was a repackaging of measures that were already provided.  The only way to tackle waiting lists is to put capacity into our hospitals.  I acknowledge that additional capacity was put in over the past two years.  I welcome every single additional cent that is put into our health service.  I welcome every additional staff member, consultant, nurse, healthcare assistant and home help worker who is employed in the public service.  I support, welcome and celebrate such additions.  However, the Minister knows as well as I do that we have had decades of underinvestment that mean many hospitals do not have the inpatient beds to admit patients to hospitals in the numbers who need it.  We have a deficiency in community and step-down beds in some areas, which means patients cannot be discharged quickly enough.  The Minister also knows there are problems with surgical theatre capacity and diagnostic capacity, not just in cases of children with scoliosis but right across the board.<\/p> <p> The HSE service plan, which was announced today, refers to more reporting structures and more bureaucracy when what we really need is fewer tiers of management and more accountability.  That is what we need.  We must deliver regional health areas that actually devolve responsibility to those regional health areas and onto the floors of hospitals to make hospital managers more accountable.  We need to take a zero tolerance approach to waits at emergency department.    One of the things this motion calls for is a job guarantee for all health graduates who come through training institutions in this State.  The Minister will accept that we need to train more people.  We need a workforce planning strategy.  We need to recruit more staff and we need to retain them.<\/p> <p> I read the Minister's amendment to the motion, which is almost four pages long.  What we need is less spin and less spoofing.  We need more substance, efficiency and capacity.  Without the changes that are necessary, the Minister will be left with more fake targets and missed targets, as previous Ministers have found out to their cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100042#RR00500","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646164200,"counter":413,"content":"<p>The current number of patients on waiting lists in my constituency is difficult to take in.  A total of 8,866 people are currently on waiting lists for inpatient care in the Galway University Hospitals.  As the Minister knows, there is a story behind every single one of those figures.  There is a person in need and a family who are worried.  Shockingly, more than 2,000 of those people have been waiting for more than 18 months for an appointment.  We have all heard stories of people who are languishing on these waiting lists but it is important to highlight the human cost of these waiting lists and to show that these are not just figures but are real life experiences for thousands of people.  One family contacted me during the summer.  A man who had been waiting since 2019 for treatment was told it would be at least another year before he would be seen as a public patient.  His condition was such that if he waited to get surgery, the disease would spread to other parts of his body and get worse.<\/p>  <p>  For outpatient care in Galway University Hospitals, the figures are even more shocking and staggering.  More than 50,000 patients are waiting for an appointment, more than 30,000 of whom have been waiting for more than six months.

I was invited by the HSE to see at first hand what a modern primary care centre can offer.  Dublin Mid-West has a large population but we do not have a primary healthcare centre.  Work has begun in Clondalkin and only last week we were told that funding is there for design works for a centre in Rowlagh.  Possible locations for centres in Lucan and Adamstown are being explored.  Our area desperately needs such a facility.<\/p>  <p>  One good news story from my visit which might help the Minister was that I had the opportunity to see a heart-screening facility in Tallaght.  GPs can refer patients directly to the primary healthcare centre, which takes considerable pressure off emergency departments.  It is an initiative funded through Sl&aacute;intecare, although the funding provides for only 1.5 staff members.  There needs to be more funding but that initiative shows what can be done if the Government follows the blueprints that are there.  This is a simple thing that Sl&aacute;intecare has funded.  It is working.  More funding would take the pressure off and we would not have the numbers of people on waiting lists that Deputies Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Cullinane mentioned.  That would be one way to help.  If something is working, it is not rocket science to follow it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100043#SS00300","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1646164200,"counter":415,"content":"<p>Hospitals are at breaking point.  Some 1.34 million people are on health waiting lists.  These are not just statistics; these are real people.  Many of them contact their local Deputies, looking for assistance.  It should not have to be that way.  Why should it take a letter from a Deputy before action is taken, even if it is only in limited circumstances?<\/p>  <p>  A man called to my office before Christmas.  He has been on a waiting list for ear, nose and throat treatment in Tullamore for five years.  He received a letter approximately a year ago asking if he still needed to be on the list.  Unless he had died or experienced a miracle, of course he needed to be on the list.  What he has does not go away and we need to be sensitive to people like him.  <\/p>  <p>  That man then received a letter inviting him to attend a private hospital where a consultant told him he would have an MRI within ten days.  We are now ten weeks on and he still has not had the MRI.  We built him up only to knock him back down.  It is simply not good enough.  Behind each and every one of these numbers is someone who is suffering.  Older people are dying while they wait for hospital appointments.  <\/p>  <p>  Many people have told me their children are waiting for appointments to have their tonsils removed.  There are children who are experiencing recurring sore throats, with all the pain that comes with them.  Other children are waiting to get grommets and are being delayed developmentally because hearing problems are not being addressed.  This is not acceptable but at least they are in the system, broken as it is.  People in south County Kildare or Portarlington in County Laois cannot even get a doctor's appointment because there is a massive shortage.  The Government is doing nothing about it.  I have written to the Department and the HSE.  I have asked parliamentary questions and the answers coming back state that these are private businesses and can operate where they like.  That is an absolute cop-out and the Government knows it.  We need GPs and we need them now.  There is far too much hand-wringing and whataboutery.  There is political will on this side of the House to address the shortage of GPs and dentists, and to address the ridiculously long waiting lists.<\/p> <p>I call on the Minister to do the right thing by accepting this motion and acting upon it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100043#SS00400","speaker":"1588","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646164800,"counter":417,"content":"<p>At Letterkenny University Hospital today, there were ten ambulances backed up at the emergency department.  There is an unprecedented crisis in that department in terms of staffing, with morale extremely low.  This is the outcome of a build-up of failures, for far too many years, to invest in beds, nurses and doctors in the hospital.  Letterkenny is the major acute hospital in Donegal and the sixth largest hospital in the State, with more than 23,000 inpatients every year.  However, it is 13th or 14th in the country in terms of funding.  It has been clear for many years that it has not received the budget it requires.  There is a profound crisis of morale among staff.  They go to work every day in what can only be described as heroic circumstances but they are tired of being called heroes.  They need the backing of the State.<\/p>  <p>  That crisis of morale feeds into the waiting list crisis.  In Letterkenny alone, there are 21,500 men, women and children on the waiting lists.  Adding Sligo would probably take that total to 25,000 or 26,000 people on waiting lists out of a population of 160,000, many of them for more than one year or two years.  This crisis has been created out of years of neglect.  In community hospitals in Donegal, one in four beds were cut in the past 15 years.  Community hospital resources are being cut and major hospitals are not being resourced.  The impact of that is what we see today, with ten ambulances backed up at Letterkenny and staff at crisis point.  I ask the Minister again to visit Letterkenny University Hospital as soon as possible, speak to the unions, staff and management and make the intervention that is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100044#TT00200","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1646164800,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, on the work he is doing to highlight the dreadful situation whereby more than 1.3 million people are on waiting lists for some sort of health service.  These people are waiting not for months but for years.  I am inundated with queries from parents of children with disabilities or additional needs who are looking for assessment of needs or early intervention.  The latter is key but it is not being provided.<\/p>  <p>  A parent contacted me recently whose teenaged child has been called for a procedure four times since last April only for it to be cancelled on each occasion.  In fact, on two occasions, he and his mother were at the hospital when they were told the procedure could not go ahead because the previous one had overrun.  A man contacted me who has been in very poor health for three years.  Having had gallstones removed approximately two years ago, he was told he needed his gallbladder removed but has not had a call-back from the hospital and cannot get any information.  He has been left very unwell and with no end in sight.  A woman told me she cannot sleep at night with the pain in her hands from carpal tunnel syndrome.  She needs surgery but has been told she must wait anther four to six months, having already waited four and a half years.  A person contacted me who cannot get a procedure done because there are insufficient anaesthetists in the hospital in question.  Again, there is no date in sight for the procedure.<\/p>  <p>  At Cavan General Hospital, there are almost 6,000 adults and more than 500 children waiting for outpatient appointments.  There are more than 500 adults awaiting inpatient care, 20% of whom have been waiting in excess of 18 months.  A total of 219 children are on the inpatient waiting list, with more than half of them waiting more than a year and 42% more than 18 months.  The staff in the hospital are excellent but they are exhausted and overstretched.  Many healthcare staff are opting to change career or to go abroad, where their pay and conditions are much better.

Today, unfortunately, an incredible 90 people were on trolleys there.  Every day in February, there were 50-plus people on trolleys, which is a record number.  The hospital, unfortunately, has broken records all through last month for having the highest number of patients on trolleys in any hospital in any month since records were established.  The figures are truly shocking.<\/p>  <p>  When the Minister visited the hospital recently, I called him out for not having spoken to the unions there.  They were very disappointed he did not listen to what they had to say, rather than just listening to the management.  I have visited the hospital on a number of occasions, including a recent visit with Deputy Cullinane during which we met senior clinicians, the CEO and others.  It is under huge pressure from the numbers accessing it.  It is the major hospital not just for Limerick but also Clare and north Tipperary, as well as people from north Kerry.<\/p>  <p>  There are multiple reasons for the overcrowding at the hospital.  Deputy Cullinane mentioned the issue of people having difficulties in getting access to GPs, which is something that is becoming increasingly problematic in Limerick city.  In some cases, people are going to hospital when they do not need to because they cannot access a GP.  That needs to be sorted out too.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the promises made in respect of University Hospital Limerick will not be delivered for years, as the Minister well knows.  The new 90-bed unit will, in fact, deliver only 48 beds and there has, as yet, been no full commitment to deliver the facility.  Building has not commenced and some of the actions that need to be taken, such as moving out patients who are recovering but still need care, have not been done.  There are, by and large, no step-down packages for those patients.  Some 8,000 home care hours have been approved and assigned for people in the Limerick area but there are no staff to provide them.  That is another problem.<\/p>  <p>  This situation cannot continue.  It would have been useful for the Minister to have met the unions when he visited the hospital.  I encourage him to do so, even if it is by way of a Zoom meeting.  We need accurate lists, with monthly updates published on the number of patients added to or removed from lists.  This is necessary to ensure an integrated and collaborative healthcare system across primary, community and acute services at a regional level.  We need to know exactly how many people are in hospitals, how many are waiting for treatment and how many cannot access a GP.  We have all had people coming to our constituency offices to ask about children who are waiting many months for appointments with child psychologists for assessments, with no timeframe given.  It is absolutely ridiculous that people have to come to their local Deputy to put in a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health in an effort to access basic health services that are urgently needed.<\/p>  <p>  The longer the Minister awaits to address these issues, the worse the outcome will be.  We need to get our house in order.

Too many people are waiting too long for care in Ireland.  They were waiting too long before the Covid pandemic and they are waiting too long today.  Providing people with timely access to care is a top priority for me and for the Government.  The programme for Government commits to the introduction of universal healthcare, that is, a public health service that provides people with the care they need when they need it.  Despite the challenges posed by Covid, we are delivering on that commitment and considerable progress has been made in modernising Ireland's health services and models of care.<\/p><p>The years 2020 and 2021 saw the two largest increases in the workforce since the HSE was established.  We have also seen the biggest increases in hospital bed numbers, including acute ward and critical care beds.  Last Friday, I launched our 2022 waiting list action plan, which builds on the success of the waiting list initiative in the final three months of last year.  It is part of a new multi-year approach to making sure people can access care when they need it.<\/p> <p>As Deputies opposite have rightly said, hundreds of thousands of adults are waiting too long for care.  About 100,000 children and adolescents are also waiting too long for care.  As I am sure my D&aacute;il colleagues have, I have met and spoken to a lot of patients and families, including a lot of Mums and Dads of children.  We all know these long waits cause enormous distress, pain and discomfort.  We all have a responsibility to do better and that is why I decided to allocate an access to care fund of &euro;350 million and why I established a waiting list task force to ensure delivery.  As I said, the waiting list plan is supported by a dedicated fund for this year of &euro;350 million.  It has been developed with expert input from clinical leaders.  The plan shows how the money will be used.  We are not trying to reset to where we were before the pandemic, because before the pandemic our waiting lists were too long.  We want to improve and transform access to care.  The pandemic resulted in many people, understandably, not coming forward for the care they needed due to concerns about contracting the virus.  Others were unable to access non-urgent care due to the pressures on our hospital system.  As these people come forward, we are seeing and we will see an understandable additional demand on our health service.<br\/><br\/>Projections for this year are that a record 1.5 million patients will be added to active waiting lists this year.  This is well in excess of the underlying capacity of the HSE to meet demand from its core activity.  Without this &euro;350 million access to care fund and the associated plan, the projections I have are that those actively waiting would go up from about 720,000 at the start of this year to over 1 million by the end of the year.  The waiting list plan details how we intend to ensure that 1.7 million people are treated and removed from the waiting lists.  The plan would see about 470,000 people taken off the lists.  This would ensure that the numbers waiting do not increase this from 720,000 to over 1 million this year.  It ensures that the numbers will fall from 720,000 to about 590,000, a fall of about 18% that would represent the lowest waiting list levels in five years.  By the end of this year we aim to have treated or offered treatment to nearly all of the 75,000 patients currently on active inpatient or day case waiting lists.  In other words this includes those scheduled for procedures.  Every patient waiting more than six months for 15 high volume procedures will receive an offer of treatment by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and as the year goes on we will expand that list of 15 procedures.  These 15 procedures currently include: cataracts; cystoscopies; hip replacements; knee replacements; skin lesions; varicose veins; angiograms; tonsillectomies; and more.  Colleagues will be aware that the list is in the waiting list plan.<br\/><br\/>At the same time as ensuring much quicker access for procedures, we have to tackle the long waits for outpatient appointments.  We are all contacted about this by constituents and as we know, some people are waiting years just to see a consultant.  This is not acceptable so what are we doing about it?  The waiting list action plan for this year seeks to ensure that by the end of the year, no one is waiting more than 18 months for an outpatient appointment.  We have to go much further than that and ultimately the Government target is that no one should wait more than 12 weeks for a procedure and that no one should wait more than ten weeks for an outpatient appointment.  However, it will take time and as was rightly said by Deputy Cullinane, there have been decades of underinvestment and years of missed opportunities to get this right.<br\/><br\/>Our work on waiting lists will be complemented by ongoing commitment and investment in building permanent capacity in the public health service to eradicate this gap between ongoing demand and what the HSE is able to supply year on year.  This year the health service will receive &euro;21.7 billion in net funding.  On top of large levels of investment, we are doing everything in our power to make sure that we have even more clinicians on the front line.  We are investing in more beds, equipment and technology, while reforming clinical pathways and providing care closer to the home.  Since the start of 2020, over 12,500 full-time staff have been added to the workforce, as well as thousands of staff who were hired to run the vaccine and testing and tracing programmes.  This is a 10% increase on the 2019 staffing levels.  Substantial investment in the ongoing expansion of the healthcare workforce is in the budget for this year.  As outlined in the programme for Government, the Government fully intends to implement regional health areas, RHAs, which will include reforms to the governance structure, financial management systems and strategic workforce planning across the country.  As Deputies will be aware, at the end of last year I stood down the hospital group boards, which was a clear acknowledgement that the current structures are changing.  I expect to be bringing a memorandum to Government for decision on RHAs in the near future.  A detailed implementation plan is being put together by the Department and the HSE with input from a new RHA advisory group, led by Leo Kearns, and that group has started to meet.<br\/><br\/>Many countries face huge challenges with waiting lists since the pandemic and I have looked at some of the figures in neighbouring jurisdictions.  In Northern Ireland, for example, there are significantly more people <i>per capita <\/i>waiting for an outpatient appointment than there are in the Republic.  When it comes to inpatient and day case procedures, again adjusting for population there are about two and a half times more people waiting in Northern Ireland than there are in the Republic.  The point is that the pandemic and the pressures have hit jurisdictions across the world and we are all having to deal with significant pressure.  The challenges we are facing here are not unique but that is of no comfort to those who are waiting for care.  The waiting list problem has been building for years and I am committed to deploying every resource and idea we can to fix that.  No one has a monopoly of wisdom on how to fix this.  I am interested to hear from Deputies across the House on the kind of initiatives that should be deployed nationally and locally.  I know Deputies will have excellent ideas on the reforms, investment and targeted changes that need to be made in their constituencies..<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100044#TT00600","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646165400,"counter":422,"content":"<p>The Mayo University Hospital waiting list increased by 162% from July 2015 to July 2021.

We have been fighting for Belmullet Community Hospital for years and its closure has the impact of people going to Mayo University Hospital, taking up beds there and trying to get treatment in the acute hospital there.

One of the curious things about the recent crisis in the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Kerry and the ongoing difficulties in University Hospital Kerry has been the excuses about the difficulties faced in terms of recruitment.  Bed needs staff and consultant vacancies are widespread say the Government.  Why would people not come down if there was a salary of &euro;200,000 on offer?<\/p>  <p>  However, the new waiting list plan essentially amounts to repackaging much of the current difficulties, expenditure and measures.  What are we to expect, if the investment and conditions do not improve?  The CAMHS scandal, no more than the difficulties that other consultants face, is as a result of the inadequate resources and team and some consultants not even having an office.  How does the Government expect to attract new consultants down to places such as Kerry when the necessary resources are not in place?<\/p>  <p>  Worse than that, however, is how the Government claims to be trying to address the issues in the public system, tying one hand behind its back.  There may be obstacles to the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, but investment in the public system is the only way to overcome it, such as through directly-employed staff.  What about the salary GPs mentioned in Sl&aacute;intecare?  There should be 200 of them throughout the country.  I have not seen any of them so far.<\/p>  <p>  Local government representatives, however, continue to advocate and back the private system over the public system.  That does not help, either, and will only set up the health system to fail.  The Minister asked about the ideas coming from here.  Elective surgeries were postponed in Kerry for a period of six months.  Most, but not all, of them have only recently come back.  Hip and knee replacements are still outsourced to private hospitals.  The Minister was looking for other ideas.  The orthopaedic ward has not been done.  The colposcopy unit still has not been made.  The plans the five Kerry Deputies saw in a meeting last November 12 months are still on a desk in Dublin awaiting approval.<\/p>  <p>  I saw what the Minister has said about all the new full-time staff being added to the workforce but the difficulty is that experienced nurses are leaving.

Nearly 7,000 of these people are waiting more than six months just to be seen.  I think the Minister will agree this is totally unacceptable and ordinary people are paying the price.  A constituent contacted my office yesterday who was recently in Beaumont Hospital's accident and emergency department.  The constituent spent ten hours waiting to be seen.  When he was seen, he was asked whether he had any health insurance.  When he told them he had not, he was advised to get a loan to go private, which would cost him &euro;7,000.

Almost 30,000 of those had been waiting more than one year for treatment.  To be clear, these people are not waiting for minor treatments.  They are waiting on life-changing and, in some cases, life-saving treatments.  More than 100 people alone are waiting more than one year for cardiothoracic surgery in Cork University Hospital, CUH.  People with heart and lung disease are desperately waiting for surgery to give them a chance at hope.<\/p>  <p>  In the Mercy University Hospital, there are more than 900 people waiting for pain management.  Anyone who suffers from chronic pain will say that without proper pain management, they are not living, but surviving.  We are leaving people on these waiting lists for months and even years to waste their lives away because of the mismanagement by successive Governments of the health service.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has a plan for healthcare in Cork.  We will open a new elective hospital on the northside.  We will not play politics with announcements of dates and locations and we will not break promise after promise on these announcements.

I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on providing the House with the opportunity to address this very important issue.  Any Deputy working in any constituency office is acutely aware of the pressure that is building up now.  The figures set out are truly shocking.   While the Covid pandemic, understandably, dominated the health focus for the past two years, the general level of our health service waiting lists is truly depressing.  I am glad the Minister has acknowledged this and wants to set it right.<\/p> <p>We should, as a collective, see how we can bring easement to our constituents and all those people who are waiting for basic diagnostic appointments and treatment.<\/p> <p> As I said, I know that the Department of Health produces plans.  It likes to produce papers, strategies and targets, and does so very frequently.  An integrated plan, however, to systematically and comprehensively reduce the numbers of people waiting for fundamental and basic diagnoses and treatment requires three basic things, that is, beds, expert staff - above all - and equipment.  I am under no illusion about their being a magic wand.  I know how difficult it is to put all those particular things in place.  Medical specialists are scarce.  They are sought all over the world and bidders for their skills will offer them, certainly in the private sector, salaries well beyond the scope of our public sector.  There are very well-functioning health systems across Europe, however, that actually do not pay even the level of payment we pay here.  We are in competition largely with English-speaking countries, but that is a fact.<\/p> <p> Although pay is, of course, a significant factor, working conditions and work pressures are even greater factors that inhibit us being able to recruit the staff we require and that we can actually now pay for.  In many ways, that is a catch-22 situation.  We need the staff to make tolerable working conditions and we cannot make the working conditions tolerable without the staff.<\/p> <p> We made a commitment collectively that things would change post Covid.  We learned that we needed an integrated acute and community system of healthcare.  We have talked about it for long enough.  The views on how to achieve it were set out by all-party committee of the Houses when everybody involved genuinely put their shoulders to the wheel to produce the Sl&aacute;intecare document.  That needs to be done quickly, however.  The number of people of all ages awaiting appointments to be seen by specialists and of those waiting to be diagnosed is enormous.  It is an enormous challenge to our well-being as a people and in maintaining public confidence in our country's capacity to look after the health needs of our people.  That is not overstating the fact.  If people lose confidence, they think that no change of Government, with all due respect to Sinn F&eacute;in, can make a difference because everybody promises they will do the Devil and all.  That is why we had a concerted effort to have an integrated plan that worked.  In fairness, Deputy Shortall led that and we all bought into it.  It now needs to be resourced and put in place, however, and if there are obstacles to it, let us hear about them and have them removed.<\/p> <p> There is no Deputy in this House who does not constantly deal with people on various waiting lists.  I want to focus on a couple of points.  The lack of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, clinicians has meant that at any given time, more than 3,000 children and young people are on a waiting list to be seen by a specialist.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State will be very aware of the difficulties in our region in the south east.  We might look specifically at children's disability services.  I could pick any one of a dozen or more different focused services.  The model set out by the HSE is to establish children's disability network teams.  Some 91 children's disability networks have been established, each with an assigned children network team.  They were required to provide services for children who need specific services up to the age of 18 years.<\/p> <p> I requested the numbers of children awaiting treatment up to last October from the HSE, which it provided.  There were 9,554 children waiting for psychology services, 14,619 waiting for occupational therapy, 8,166 for physiotherapy, which we hear about repeatedly, and 12,867 waiting for an initial assessment for speech and  language therapy.  Having been assessed, 8,438 children were waiting for initial treatment.  Some 16,838 children were waiting for access to ophthalmology services and 8,457 were waiting for audiology services.  These are individual children with specific requirements that are not being met.  What have we done for this huge number of children, all with legitimate expectations of the State to support them and give them those services?  I am told that since 2019, 285 development posts have been allocated to children's disability services by the HSE.  Under the national service plan, 100 posts were provided in respect of children's disability services in 2019.  I am always careful about language when I ask the HSE something.  I have no idea whether the phrase \"have been allocated\" means that they are actually there or not.  Another 100 posts were allocated in the service plan for 2021.  I do not know what happened to 2020; no figures are mentioned for that.  I am told that 85 posts for services in special schools were approved to mid-2021.  Again, one of the problems when dealing with the HSE and trying to get at the figures and data is transparency.  Posts were allocated and places were approved but there is no guarantee at all that those positions have been filled.  Even if all those 285 positions over three years were filled, the number is wholly inadequate to meet the pent-up demand for those critical services that need to be provided at the appropriate time in a child's life.  If that is missed, it cannot be caught up on later.<\/p> <p> I am not sure if the practice that used to exist still does whereby all monies allocated could be assigned to different functions.  The HSE regarded it as a sort of blancmange of money and if there was a pressure point somewhere else, although the service plan said that X number of posts were going to particular functions, that is not necessarily how it transpired at the end of the of the year.  Therefore, if you like, we vote it, the Department of Health negotiates it but actually the delivery of those might be a matter entirely for the HSE itself.<\/p> <p> As I said at the outset, staff are but one of the essential requirements to address these issues.  The Joint Committee on Health was told that operating theatres in our hospitals are functioning mostly on a nine-to-five basis.  As expensive and valuable as it is, our diagnostic equipment is just not functioning as it should.  In contrast to the private sector, it is often functioning a fraction all the time.  I know this from when I went to have a scan on my knee with a private company.  It was like a conveyor belt working virtually night and day, and certainly seven days a week.  We do not utilise our equipment in the public hospitals in that fashion at all.  Why is that the case?  We need staff to do it but what is the point of providing very expensive equipment if it is not functioning on the same basis that the same type of equipment in the private sector would be expected to function?  Have we no expectation of that in the private sector?<\/p> <p>  Many years ago, I started the very first waiting list initiative that provided what is now a laughably small amount of money - &pound;20 million - to the public hospitals to bid for additional procedures such as hip replacements or whatever needed to be done, and it worked.  That was hijacked into the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which basically privatised public medicine.  We need to ensure that we resource the public service.  In the interim, I suggest that the Minister looks at an old-fashioned waiting list initiative to provide money to get better value out of the infrastructure we paid for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100046#VV00500","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646167200,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Cullinane on the motion he has brought before the House.  It is certainly comprehensive.  It puts in context the scale of the problems that we are dealing with in our health service.  It describes those problems well.  The Minister described the problems well also.  The difference, of course, is that the Minister is in a position to do something about them.  Much of the time we hear commentary from the Minister on the problems in the health service.  What are all looking for is action.  We are looking for action on the basis of a sustainable approach to tackling the nature of the problem.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister&rsquo;s recent announcement of &euro;350 million for a waiting list initiative brought to my mind something that happened more than ten years ago.  The then Minister introduced a waiting list initiative.  Consultants were brought in from outside.  Health system consultants were advising on it.  I gather that some of those people have been brought in again to advise on some of this.  What it boils down to is that the Minister is getting a big pot of money and throwing that money at the health service.  Yes, we will get results from that.  Additional operations will be carried out.  For those people who benefit from that, it will be great.  However, it will not do anything at all to reform the system.  Not only that, this kind of initiative is about buying services, putting them into the National Treatment Purchase Fund, putting a lot of the money into private sector healthcare and putting some of it into what is referred to as overtime for consultants who are already working long hours.  That does not seem to make a lot of sense.  That approach of throwing money at the problem actually delays the kind of reform that is required in order to make our health service function properly.  As a result, what is proposed is very much a stopgap.  While we will get immediate results, once the money stops, the additional operations will stop as well.  The Minister might look back to ten or 12 years and see what the experience was like then, because it was not good.  I see this as a repeat of that.<\/p>  <p>  A statement was made to the effect that the aim is to ensure that nobody is waiting for an outpatient appointment for more than 18 months.  That is pretty shocking.  For somebody with a serious health condition to be told &ldquo;We guarantee that you will not have to wait more than 18 months&rdquo; is just not acceptable.  That is light years away from the kind of waiting time limits that are set out in Sl&aacute;intecare.  The Minister has a clear plan.  The solution to this is to implement the reforms that are contained in that plan.  While he talks about those a lot, he actually is not doing a huge amount about implementing them.  I have to refer to the mistake that was made last year.  It was a very serious mistake and I think we will pay a big price for it.  That was the circumstances that led to the resignations of people who were leading this Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.  The original plan was that the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office would be entirely stand-alone.  It would have its own separate budget.  That was what happened initially.  Of course, the recommendation was that that stand-alone office would be located within the Department of the Taoiseach.  This was so that it would have the clout of the Taoiseach and his Department to ensure that roadblocks were cleared.  That is what happened with the cancer strategy, which was very successful.  Unfortunately, it was not located in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office, but in the Department of Health.  However, we still had confidence that this could deliver.  It was delivering.  It was making substantial progress until things stalled in respect of some key elements of Sl&aacute;intecare.  That, as the Minister knows, resulted in the highly regarded Tom Keane and the equally highly regarded Laura Magahy moving on.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister chose to replace that independent, separate, single-focus office with a board led by the Secretary General of the Department and the chief executive of the HSE.  In my view, that was a serious mistake.  These are two people who have high-profile, high-pressure jobs.  They operate on the basis that they deal with the emergencies that arise on a daily basis.  They have little time to devote to a reform programme.  A reform programme has to be independently, separately driven.  I think we are going to lose out badly as a result of that.  Those two individuals recently appeared before the Joint Committee on Health.  The committee was seeking an update on the reform programme.  Unfortunately, we were disappointed to the extent that the Secretary General, Mr. Watt, indicated that he did not understand one of the central recommendations of Sl&aacute;intecare, namely, the regional plan.  He talked about the community services coming under the remit of the hospital groups.  That was just last September.  The Minister just spoke about standing down hospital groups.  That indicates that there is not a great understanding of what is involved.<\/p>  <p>  It is not just me who is saying this.  It is important that we look at the Department&rsquo;s Sl&aacute;intecare strategic action plan progress report.  That is across the two key programmes in Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is worth going down through the progress report from the Department.  It rates various measures as improving, disimproving or trending same.  The project on enhanced community care and hospital productivity are both disimproving.  This information is based on the last six months of 2021.  A large part of that period was when the Sl&aacute;intecare office ceased to exist and the two leaders to whom I referred earlier left.<\/p>  <p>  The project to streamline care pathways. from prevention to discharge is listed disimproving.  The project to develop elective centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway is an essential part of Sl&aacute;intecare because, as Deputy Howlin just said, we have a lot to learn from the private sector in terms of efficiency and specialisation.  Some of the clinics, such as the Sports Surgery Clinic in Santry and others throughout the country, specialise in particular aspects of healthcare and do not have emergency departments.  It is a kind of conveyor-belt system.  It is highly efficient.  That is why a key element of Sl&aacute;intecare was to recommend three elective-only hospitals.  We learned from the experience in Scotland where it has been very successful.  They took over a private hospital and are building a second one.  That is what we recommended.  The position in that regard is actually disimproving.  Progress should have been made.  We were told that the locations for the three proposed hospitals had been identified and that they were to be announced a number of months ago.  We are still waiting to hear about those locations.  The position has disimproved.<\/p>  <p>  The project to implement a multi-annual waiting lists reduction plan has disimproved.  The project to implement the eHealth programme has also disimproved.  What I am referring to are the Department's grades in respect of these different measures.  The project to remove private care from public hospitals and implement the Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract is disimproving.  In addition, the project to develop policy proposal and options for achieving universal eligibility across hospitals and community settings is disimproving.  Several other areas have remained the same.  Progress was not being made at all in the latter half of 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister needs to take responsibility for all of this.  It would seem that Sl&aacute;intecare has stalled.  In spite of the claims he made earlier, the Department is bearing out what I am saying in its progress report.  The overriding issue that the Minister has to now deal with is the recruitment issue, particularly of consultants.  None of the plans that the Minister has set out in the waiting list initiative will work unless he recruits consultants.  He needs to implement the Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract.  Last October, he said he wanted that done within a matter of weeks.  We are still waiting for it to happen.  The Minister needs to appoint a new chair for those talks because the previous chair moved on to other duties last month.<\/p> <p>We still have not appointed someone to replace that chairperson.<\/p> <p> The Minister talked about the need to find out why we cannot recruit consultants.  I refer him to the hospital doctor retention and motivation project funded by the Health Research Board, HRB, which is almost complete.  Will he please read that research?  I will send him the reference.  The project sets out clearly the reasons we cannot attract Irish-trained consultants back home.  Unless we crack that nut, we will not make any progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100048#XX00100","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646167800,"counter":431,"content":"<p>T&aacute;imid bu&iacute;och do Shinn F&eacute;in as an r&uacute;n seo a thabhairt agus beimid ag tac&uacute; leis.  We thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward the motion, which we will support.  Ireland's health service is an underfunded shambles by design, held together by the superhuman efforts of undervalued and underpaid health workers who have been pushed to their limit.  Every aspect of healthcare is beset by large waiting lists, and the Sinn F&eacute;in motion sets out the overall numbers clearly.  We should remind ourselves that every one of those numbers represents somebody who needs care.  These people are waiting for treatment that would be life changing were they to receive it.  Some people, such as the 649 children awaiting orthopaedic surgery who were highlighted recently, are waiting so long that their condition may become inoperable, and often they are condemned to live a life unnecessarily blighted by illness and pain.  The spina bifida paediatric advocacy group has reported that 56 children have been waiting between one and four years for orthopaedic surgery to correct the condition, which can cause paralysis of the legs, often accompanied by hydrocephalus, or water on the brain.We all heard recently of large waiting lists for CAMHS and how understaffing leads to the inappropriate medicating of children.<\/p><p>Earlier today, some of our members attended the Patients Deserve Better campaign, which was launched to advocate for the provision of additional neurological nurses to deal with what was described at the launch as a critical resource issue.  The campaign set out why the Government needs to recruit an additional 100 neurological nurses to bring the national number to the recommended figure of 142.  Apparently, 800,000 people - a shockingly high number - in Ireland live with neurological conditions.  They are people with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, epilepsy and other, less serious conditions.  The campaigners outlined how close to 24,000 people are on the public waiting list for neurological outpatient care, 8,600 of whom have been waiting for more than 18 months.  Recruitment of additional neurological nurses is required to reduce the current waiting lists.  According to the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, Dublin alone needs 57 additional nurses.  St. James's Hospital, for example, has four neurological nurses and needs 14, a shortfall of ten; Tallaght hospital has 3.5 nurses and needs 20, a shortfall of almost 17.  We fully support the Patients Deserve Better campaign and call on the Government to urgently recruit the additional 100 neurological nurses who are needed.  Neurological nurses play a crucial clinical role in providing advice, counselling and educational support.  A speaker at the launch indicated how one neurological nurse in her hospital is not available for public patients.<\/p><p>This brings me to one my main points, regarding the question of public ownership of our healthcare system.  The Minister did not use the word &quot;Sl&aacute;intecare&quot; once.  It is as though the strategy has gone out of circulation and into the history books.  One of the main problems facing our public health service relates to the existence, in a large way, of private practice in public hospitals, and of so many private hospitals and services.  At every turn, public moneys are drained off by private interests, and this is central to the dysfunction and lack of resources facing the HSE and the public healthcare system.  We saw it starkly during the height of the Covid crisis, when millions of euro was paid out to take the private hospital capacity into public control, but as soon as we were out of the woods, it was handed right back, leaving us short by millions of euro that had been put into the private healthcare system.<\/p><p>We have a very low hospital bed number <i>per capita <\/i>by international standards, as well as a very low number of ICU beds.  The lack of capacity in our public healthcare system is one of the main reasons we have such enormous waiting lists, as are detailed in the motion.  The Irish Hospital Consultants Association has called for 6,000 additional public hospital beds and 4,500 community step-down and rehabilitation beds to alleviate pressure on the system.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation recently stated that the health service is rapidly returning to the bad old days of overcrowding in every aspect.  Those who can afford to do so avail of private hospitals to access the care they need, while those who are dependent on the public service continue to join the waiting lists and wait ever longer.  I am reminded of the famous Joan Baez song, recorded in the 1960s and giving voice to poor communities in the US, in which she sang, &quot;If living were a thing that money could buy, you know the rich would live and the poor would die&rdquo;.  In our healthcare system, that often happens, but there is no doubt poorer people suffer more.<\/p><p>We believe it is time for private hospitals to be taken into public ownership to add to the capacity we urgently need in the public healthcare system. If evidence were needed of a lack of commitment to even grappling with that problem, it is to be found in the future of the national children's hospital and the proposed new national maternity hospital.  The former is being built with more than a dozen private suites, allowing private medicine to flourish within the hospital, while the latter is being built in the ownership of a private company.  That is why I intend to move the amendment People Before Profit has tabled, wherein we call on the Government to take all hospital capacity and private organisations currently delivering healthcare and social care into public ownership as part of a single-tier national health service.  This, coupled with the removal of private practice from public hospitals, would give us that single-tier, entirely public system, free at the point of need, at the core of a new national health service, which we so badly need.<\/p><p>Glaoimid ar an Rialtas gach ospid&eacute;al pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach a chur faoi &uacute;in&eacute;ireacht phoibl&iacute;.<\/p><p>I hereby move the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100049#YY00200","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1646167800,"counter":432,"content":"<p>The Deputy may not move an amendment until the Minister's amendment has been disposed of.

There are 95 children awaiting these appointments in County Roscommon.  On speech and language waiting lists, 971 children were awaiting initial assessment in County Galway at the end of January, with an average waiting time of six months, and 119 children in County Roscommon are awaiting initial assessment.  With regard to the waiting lists for occupational therapy, 103 children in County Roscommon have been awaiting assessment for up to 18 months.  In County Galway, there are 384 children on that waiting list.<\/p>  <p>  The waiting lists in the two counties were appalling even before Covid-19.  In March 2020, the Galway-Roscommon autism spectrum disorder service had one child on its waiting list for intervention support for six years, with a further 54 children waiting four years for that intervention support.  In fact, a total of 361 children were on that waiting list, not including 81 referrals.  It was so chaotic in HSE West that it committed in March 2020 to reconfiguring the Galway-Roscommon autism service, which parents had been complaining about for years.  It might have seemed that Covid-19 would provide the ideal opportunity for this reconfiguration to take place.  Instead, those staff were sent to answer phones in contact tracing centres.<\/p> <p>In September 2020, I highlighted the issue of staff in HSE West being redeployed to do contact tracing on the floor of the House.  I raised the matter with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and tabled a Topical Issue matter on it to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, which was answered by the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan.  On each occasion, shoulders were shrugged and we just moved along.  Throughout 2020, nothing was done, either for the children in question or on the reconfiguration.  We had to wait until 11 October 2021 for the Galway-Roscommon service to be reconfigured and to become operational and until 10 January of this year for the same to happen in County Mayo.  We should have started to see progress on foot of that but that did not happen.<\/p> <p> We are now moving to the new progressing disability services national reconfiguration and I do not see any progress.  The children's disability network teams have been established.  More than 200 staff have been configured into nine children's disability network teams across HSE West but that reconfiguration, as I say, is still ongoing.  Today, the HSE cannot say when children who have been referred to the expert service can expect to start receiving appointments.<\/p> <p> So frustrated was I with this reconfiguration after reconfiguration that I sought a briefing from HSE West last December, which, it was promised, would take place in January but we did not get one.  When we sought it again last month we were told we would get a briefing early this month.  None has been held as of yet and we still do not know what is going on.<\/p> <p> The difficulty is children are being let down as a result of this.  For example, John, who is three years of age and has autism and an early developmental delay, was referred to the Roscommon early intervention service in June 2020.  He has still not been seen 18 months later.  That is not progression.<\/p> <p> What is really frustrating is that, as bad and all as it was, and we had a lot of complaints about the service across Galway-Roscommon, the Roscommon early intervention service was excellent.  People were proud of it and it was responsive.  That service has been washed into the broader mass now and children are being left high and dry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100049#YY00400","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646168400,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this motion and giving me the opportunity to speak.<\/p><p>Despite all of the billions of euro spent year after year on the health service, the waiting list problem is getting worse.  In a speech on the Appropriation Bill in December last, I highlighted the degree to which our spending on health has increased over the past six years.  In 2016, it stood at &euro;13.6 billion and in 2021, it was &euro;21.7 billion, an increase of &euro;8.1 billion in the period.  I will ask the same question I asked in December.  What do we really have to show for it?  We have waiting lists getting longer, a crisis in the GP sector, orthodontic waiting lists that are off the charts, mental health services that are still understaffed and many other issues.  The recent <i>Business Post<\/i>coverage should also serve as an eye-opener to the horror of the waste that exists in the HSE.  The health service is not being underfunded but funding is clearly not being used in the most efficient and effective way.<\/p><p>When it comes to agonising stories of waiting lists, I am sure every Deputy in the House has received a plea from a person on a waiting list asking if anything can be done to shorten his or her waiting time.  In many cases, these are people with serious health issues who are often in serious and debilitating pain.<\/p><p>Some of the stories I have heard from constituents would create a sense of anger at the ordeal many of them are forced to endure when faced with illness.  Only three months ago, the <i>Wexford People<\/i>newspaper carried the story of a woman who lodged an official complaint with the HSE after being told she would have to wait 15 months to explore a heart issue.  This was not a 15-month wait for a complex operation but to be fitted with a heart monitor.  It is 15 months of worry, anguish, anxiety and stress.<\/p><p>This time last year, it was reported that waiting lists in Wexford General Hospital had increased by 69% from January 2020 to January 2021.  Wexford has been impacted hard by Covid-19.  There was an obsession about Covid to the detriment of those who needed timely treatment for other issues.  We do not yet have the true figures for the increased waiting times for the year from January 2021 to date.<\/p><p>The old saying, &quot;A stitch in time saves nine&quot;, is apt when it comes to the importance of reducing and getting rid of waiting lists.  People waiting for important treatment may develop other problems as a consequence of not receiving timely treatment for their initial ailment.  From a health service point of view, surely it is more efficient to provide the first stitch when it is needed and not months, or even years, later.<\/p><p>The 2022 waiting list action plan aims to reduce the numbers on waiting lists from 720,000 to 587,000 but we need to focus efforts on prevention.  Prevention starts by identifying how a country with a population of 5 million has ended up with 720,000 people on waiting lists.<\/p><p>We have two main issues, namely, human resources and physical resources.  From a physical resources point of view, we obviously have a limited number of specialist theatres and limited equipment and space within the hospitals but from a human resources point of view, it is a clear case of too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  There are umpteen positions currently advertised in the health service and I have almost lost count of the number of times I have raised issues with staffing levels in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in County Wexford.  At the same time, we are constantly hearing about general understaffing within the health service.<\/p><p>With both of these resourcing issues, how have we suddenly arrived at a position where the Government can reduce waiting lists by 130,000 over the next ten months with current resources?  If this is achievable, how did we end up with so many people on these waiting lists in the first place?  I read with interest a few days ago an article in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>under the headline &quot;&euro;350m plan to tackle waiting lists as hospital theatres lie &lsquo;idle&rsquo; after 5pm despite surgeons willing to operate&quot;.  I am sure the vast majority of the 720,000 people on waiting lists would take an appointment at any time of the day or night to help solve their problem.<\/p><p>If this plan is successful in gradually reducing waiting lists, we need to ensure we do not return to this position in the next ten or 15 years.  I hope the plan is successful and brings faster treatments for the thousands of people who badly need them.  If not, it might be time to look at the top-heavy chiefs in the system, consider cancelling some of the wellness conference trips and get to work on dealing with the crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100050#ZZ00200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1646168400,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to speak on this motion and I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling it.  We have had a waiting list crisis in this country for as many years as I have been in the D&aacute;il and long before that.  The stress this is causing staff in hospitals is beyond words.  I see at first hand the crisis in accident and emergency in Cork University Hospital, CUH, when I visit.  I often wonder how staff work in such conditions.  Much of the pressure could be avoided if facilities in hospitals, such as Bantry General Hospital and Mallow General Hospital, were up to standard.<\/p>  <p>  Consider what happened in Bantry hospital last summer when we went for up to three weeks without a consultant.  That was down to incompetence because the issue was flagged well in advance.  There is not a chance that would have been allowed to happen in the capital but the person in management in the HSE who thought the people of west Cork would sit on our hands and accept being treated like second-class citizens was wrong.  Management played games with people's lives but thanks to the great people of Bantry and its surrounds who protested on the streets after waiting weeks for the doors to be opened, consultants were then found and Bantry was back in business a few days later.  Let me assure the people of Bantry hospital catchment area, from Dursey Island, Sheep's Head and Mizen Head to Bandon and Innishannon and down to Clonakilty and Kinsale, I will keep this and every Government on their toes every day while I am elected to represent them to provide the best service they can possibly give to Bantry General Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Bantry hospital has top staff who deserve to be provided with the best facilities, similar to those in other hospitals.<\/p> <p>So help me God, if we do not.  Simply put, there will be hell to pay.  To help alleviate pressure in CUH, the Minister must invest in Bantry General Hospital and deliver an endoscopy unit, a physiotherapy unit, a cataract theatre and a five-day working surgery unit.  The people of west Cork deserve no less.<\/p> <p> Investment must be made in hospitals like Bantry.  In 2017, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, arrived in Bantry and announced with great fanfare that the endoscopy unit was to be built but five years on, in 2022, not a sod has been turned on the project.  If it was built on announcements by politicians, we would have had an endoscopy unit in every town and village in west Cork.  It is nearly embarrassing to hear year after year that this endoscopy unit will be built.  We should be in a situation where an announcement in 2017 means completion no later than 2019.  This would see better services on the ground and stop politicians falling over each other announcing something announced five years previously.<\/p> <p> Waiting lists are shocking in this country.  Like other Members, I have people queuing in my clinics pleading to get them an appointment.  From what I see, the queues are getting bigger.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I have taken 84 buses to Kingsbridge Private Hospital in Belfast so people in their 70s, 80s and 90s could get urgent cataract surgery, a 25-minute procedure.  The Government showed no respect to the people of west Cork, Cork city and Kerry.  It left them on a waiting list for five or six years and if they were unlucky, let them go blind.<\/p> <p> Where is the money going?  It is time to come clean.  The top brass in the HSE are getting better than a couple's wages in most homes in expenses alone and there is no accountability.  It is astonishing.  They get a top-up bonus of another &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000 whenever they want.  What has the Minister done any different to his predecessor, Deputy Harris, in whom I tabled a vote of no confidence due to his handling of the health crisis at that time, which toppled the Government?  He will be lucky if the same is not done with him.  Due to Covid and now the war in Ukraine, the eye will be off the ball in this country.  While the eye is off the ball, people will suffer.  We must change our model of hospital care.  We must look at the private hospital model.  They are open and working the full seven days and nights of the week.  We cannot be in a situation that a hospital almost closes down on a Friday evening until Monday morning.  We cannot have people waiting for surgery that cannot have it as the clock strikes five in the evening.  We must look at the private model in hospitals such as the Kingsbridge in Belfast and probably plenty of others that operate on a 24-7 basis.  That way, things will get done.<\/p> <p> While I have the floor, I wish to raise Clonakilty Community Hospital.  Perhaps the Minister will have an opportunity to inform me when the funding will be made available to bring the hospital up to HIQA standards.  We have been told year in, year out that the hospital is not up to standard.  It is a beautiful hospital, but it is still not up to the standard set by a previous Government.  I do not have anything negative to say about hospitals like the ones in Schull and Bandon.  They are fabulous community hospitals, and Clonakilty deserves the same as other hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100050#ZZ00300","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646169000,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing this debate to the floor of the D&aacute;il tonight, as it is very important and urgent.  The HSE system is failing many sick and vulnerable people all over the country, young and old.  Starting with older people in University Hospital Kerry in Tralee where people have been waiting on trolleys for anything up to two or three days in recent months.  I refer to people over 80 years, including some who are 90.  These men and women have given their lives to rearing families and working all their lives for their families, their communities and their country.  They have got us to where we are today, and they are being badly let down.<\/p>  <p>  We do not have enough GPs.  Young and old who develop medical problems have to wait for as much as a week before they can be seen by a GP.  This is not good enough.  Patients have to wait months for MRIs, scans or X-rays.  That is not acceptable.  In the case of cancer, the disease may have progressed to another stage, making a successful outcome less achievable.  Why can we not ensure that machines are kept working 24-7, like in the North of Ireland, for instance?<\/p>  <p>  I thank the nurses, doctors and all the front-line staff who worked so hard, especially in the past two years with the coronavirus.  They worked in terrible conditions and had to contend with staff shortages and expose themselves to contracting the virus.<\/p>  <p>  We see what has happened with the CAMHS debacle in south Kerry where the HSE has failed to hire a senior consultant psychiatrist since 2016 and senior management failed to monitor what was going on for five years and the interventions meted out have permanently damaged the health of many.  This is criminal.  There is an urgent need to recruit psychologists to deal with children at an early age to prevent their mental health being damaged.<\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe that abolishing the regional health boards was a major mistake, since the boards ensured that accountability was provided by departmental officials to elected members and senior consultants and doctors who ensured that a respectable level of service was in place for the sick and vulnerable.  The Taoiseach has added to his CV that he is proud of getting rid of the regional health boards.  He needs to look at that again.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that Deputy Michael Collins from west Cork and I have successfully operated a cross-Border system for people who would have had to wait for three or four years to get their cataract removed and the same for hips and knees.  To date, 84 buses have travelled to the North with the 84th bus going last Friday.  One of the first patients on the first bus told me that his grandfather's cataract was removed in St. Catherine's Hospital in Tralee in 1986.  That proves that it is backwards that we are going and not improving.  The Minister must listen to that.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has totally let down boys and girls affected by scoliosis and spina bifida whose little spines are going out of shape more each day.  The Taoiseach said he allocated &euro;5.2 million, yet those who cannot afford to go abroad are still waiting and getting worse each day.  That is not good enough.  The Taoiseach will not say who is responsible, but Cappagh Hospital says it has consultants available to carry out the procedures.<\/p>  <p>  I will give one example about the regional health boards that are so important.  In 1986, the Department of Health proposed that six of the district hospitals in the Southern Health Board region would be closed.  It was hell-bent on doing it, but lo and behold, wherever he is today, he is dead, but Jackie Healy-Rae was chairman of the Southern Health Board and he and the other elected members stopped the health board and the then Minister, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, from doing that at the time.  We have a new hospital in Kenmare today that is stretched to the limit, but we do not have all the beds open there.  We need to open the beds.  At least when elected people were responsible for deciding what was needed in an area, whether it was community care, a district hospital, if a public health nurse or doctor was needed or whatever else, those matters were dealt with in a progressive manner at the time.  Now, there is no accountability at all from the HSE for what it is doing.  It is a monster that has gone out of control, not the staff, doctors or nurses working in it, but the management.  They are out of order.  They are responsible to no one.  We must give them as much as they want, be it &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000 a year, but the people are suffering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100051#AAA00200","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1646169000,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I support the motion.  I congratulate Sinn F&eacute;in on bringing it forward on the basis that it clearly outlines the scale of the ongoing and increasing crisis in the public healthcare system.  It also clearly identifies the fault lines in the latest announcement of yet anther plan to tackle waiting lists.<\/p> <p> We have to ask why we have these outrageous waiting lists in the first place.  To my mind, the answer is very simple.  It is a two-tier service which offers access to those who have private health insurance, and not just access to private healthcare facilities but also to our public hospitals.  Those who are above the limit for a medical card or do not have the means for private insurance are left in limbo.  I note that this latest plan will have only a limited, if any, effect on the lists.  Of the &euro;350 million budgeted, &euro;200 million will be used for the National Treatment Purchase Fund or, in other words, almost 50% of the money provided by the State will be spent in private medical facilities.  As long as we maintain the two-tier system, with chronic underfunding of the public sector patched up with occasional sticking plasters from the private sector, we will have an ongoing waiting list crisis.  I agree with the spirit of the amendment from People Before Profit but, of course, to move from what we have now to a single-tier service will be a transition that needs to be well planned, properly funded and resourced and carried out over time.<\/p> <p> I also attended a webinar today organised by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, NAI.  It dealt specifically with the crisis in the Dublin hospitals, which have 28 neurological nurses when they need 85.  That is a shortfall of 57 nurses to care for the people in Dublin South-Central who are living with a neurological condition.  St. James's Hospital needs 14 and it only has four, so it is short ten nurses, and similar numbers were given for hospitals all over the city.  There are 23,979 people waiting for neurological outpatient appointments, with 8,601 waiting more than 18 months.<\/p> <p> It is said that neurological nurses make clinics 40% more efficient.  Increasing the number of these nurses would ensure that people with neurological conditions have improved access to healthcare supports and would reduce the time they are waiting for appointments.  Patients who have access to nurses have reported improved psychological well-being and an improved sense of involvement in their care, and they are more prepared for tests and investigations.  Their knowledge of their condition and related issues increases and they have more confidence to self-manage their condition.  To have more neurological nurses will also ensure that patients get quicker access to outpatient appointments, thereby reducing waiting lists and ensuring that any deterioration in the patient's health status can be mitigated.  This will also ensure that additional hospital resources can be focused on those who need it.  The NAI will be coming back again with regard to national waiting lists and what is needed at national level.<\/p> <p> I was contacted by a constituent who attends the long Covid clinic in St. James's Hospital, which has been advised it will lose its occupational therapist for long Covid care.  I contacted the hospital to ask whether this was the case because the occupational therapist there has provided a fantastic service to people with long Covid in regard to their limbs, fatigue and so on.  The reply was that, in the past month, St. James's Hospital has received confirmation from T. J. Dunford, primary care, national community operations, of permanent funding resourcing for the post-acute Covid clinic programme, and occupational therapy, OT, has not been resourced.  It awaits confirmation of permanent resourcing for the long Covid clinic and this is expected imminently.  There are concerns that OT was not included in the HSE&rsquo;s draft long Covid model of care in June 2021, although this may change in the final version.  I want a commitment from the Minister that this will be changed in the final version in the second quarter of the year.  OT is an integral part of any therapy in regard to long Covid services.<\/p> <p> My final point concerns Sl&aacute;intecare, which is not perfect and does not deal with section 38 and section 39 bodies, which means the State is fully funding what are in reality private hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare groups.  Sl&aacute;intecare would be a good start in reforming the system and that is why I want to refer to the situation in regard to the new national maternity hospital.  For me, this is a crunch issue.  A private healthcare group, St. Vincent's, is demanding an operating licence for a &euro;1 billion new hospital to be built by the State and fully funded and operated by the State.  I cannot think of any other country where this could even be contemplated, yet it is becoming increasingly clear that the Government will possibly cave in and agree to the demands of St. Vincent's Holdings and, behind it, the Sisters of Charity, the Vatican and the Irish Catholic bishops.  If this happens, it will be the death knell of any meaningful reform of healthcare, the killing off of Sl&aacute;intecare and goodbye to any vision of a single-tier public health service funded by the State and controlled by the State, that is secular and provides all services allowed by the law and free for all at the point of use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100051#AAA00300","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646169600,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for the opportunity to speak to some of the key issues and to address some of the points made in the course of this debate.  The 2022 waiting list action plan is delivering targeted investment of &euro;350 million to get many more people treated as quickly as possible.  At the same time, we are reforming and investing in our public health service to eradicate the gap between demand and permanent capacity.  As the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, said earlier, we are not trying to reset to where we were before the pandemic, when our waiting lists were unacceptably high.  We want to improve and transform access to elective care.<\/p>  <p>  I am particularly pleased the plan provides for a dedicated &euro;5.5 million to significantly reduce the number of children and young people under 18 waiting to avail of these vital services.  This will build on the &euro;4 million initiative that I launched last August to tackle these challenging waiting lists, which has since enabled more than 1,600 young people to avail of the primary care psychology service and access necessary supports.<\/p>  <p>  The additional investment will enhance the capacity of primary care psychology services, placing them on a more sustainable footing over the longer term.  This investment will allow recruitment of additional psychologists, psychology assistants and counsellors to provide supports to those who need them most, as early as possible.  I have set a target of a further 3,300 children and young people to be seen by the service and removed from the waiting list as these new staff come onboard during 2022.  I was also very pleased to secure the allocation under the plan of a further &euro;1.3 million for counselling in primary care and &euro;9.1 million to support priority community areas, including child and adolescent mental health services, autism and other areas.<\/p>  <p>  All of the 45 actions outlined in our waiting list action plan will make a huge difference.  We plan to bring the number of patients on active waiting lists to its lowest point in five years.  We will also introduce maximum waiting time targets to ensure that many people who have already been waiting too long will finally receive their hospital procedure or initial assessment by the end of the year.  We had 75,000 patients on active inpatient and day case waiting lists at the end of 2021.  We aim to have treated all, or almost all, of those patients by the end of 2022.<\/p>  <p>  While our targets are ambitious, we need to be honest about what is achievable in the coming months.  Our waiting list crisis has been building up for very many years and there are no instant fixes.  Our waiting lists are unacceptable but we will overcome this challenge too, and deliver immediate and long-lasting improvements for our healthcare professionals and patients of the future.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the concerns raised around recruitment but we must be ambitious, and I will not apologise for that.  We have funded the recruitment of 10,000 staff this year but it is a challenging recruitment environment.  As the HSE chief executive outlined recently, it will be doing everything it can to achieve that.  He also outlined that the HSE had 675 net recruits in January of this year, which is a good start.  To ensure ambitious recruitment targets are being achieved to the greatest extent possible in 2022, the HSE has adopted various measures.  This includes expanding international recruitment frameworks with specified targeted recruitment approaches; broadening domestic recruitment markets by working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, education bodies and training boards; and improving the efficiency of the recruitment process by greater use of technology.<\/p> <p>All units within our Department are now responsible for driving universal healthcare and Sl&aacute;intecare reform while individual members of the Department&rsquo;s management board at deputy secretary and assistant secretary level are directly pushing the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021-2023.  They are in turn reporting progress to the programme board.   <\/p> <p> I would like to highlight some other progress made in 2021 that is continuing at pace.  In December last year, the Government approved our national elective ambulatory care strategy which will change the way in which scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists.  The development of scheduled procedure or outpatient capacity will be provided through dedicated, stand-alone elective hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin.  These elective hospitals will provide coverage for 60% to 70% of the overall population, catering for up to 940,000 procedures annually, including 180,000 in Cork and 175,000 in Galway.  <\/p> <p> These new facilities will be of a size and scale to implement an elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on a national basis.  This means that the new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and in doing so will operate to cover as wide a catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas.  Subject to approval processes under the public spending code, detailed plans for these could be brought to Government before the end of June.<\/p> <p> We are continuing to invest in new care pathways, new technologies and new ways of working.  Our National Ambulance Service provides a good example.  It successfully continued the development and implementation of alternative care pathways in 2021 with the aim of hospital avoidance and an improved use of healthcare resources.  The total number of patients treated by these alternative care pathways was over 18,000 with 44% treated at home or in the community.<\/p> <p> There has also been significant investment in enhancing community care and capacity to affect the shift from a hospital-centric model of care to delivering more care in the community.  Approximately 20.46 million hours of home support were delivered in 2021 with over 55,000 people in receipt of the service by end December.  This is about 2.9 million, or 17%, more hours compared with 2020 with increased funding maintained for 2022.  I accept this is not without challenges around putting care services in place but we will continue to do our absolute best to encourage more healthcare workers into the sector.  <\/p> <p> The GP chronic disease management programme recently received a prestigious United Nations award for developing a structured illness and preventive care programme in general practice.  Over 85% of GPs are registered with the programme which delivered close to 220,000 consultations in 2021.  The GP direct access to diagnostics scheme resulted in over 138,000 radiology tests being accessed by GPs in the community with another 17,000 undertaken in January 2022 alone.  <\/p> <p> We have very many challenges in respect of access to healthcare.  Sometimes, I fear we lose sight of some of the very real progress that is being made.  This can be demoralising for staff.  The last two years have seen record increases in staffing and bed numbers.  This was no mean feat during a pandemic. The last two years have been very difficult for those working in healthcare.  No group of workers has felt the burden of the pandemic more than our health and social care professionals.  In spite of enormous challenges, our healthcare workers responded with determination and distinction.  Our waiting lists are a challenge, and a big one, but we will overcome this challenge too and make long-lasting improvements for our healthcare workers and patients of the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100052#BBB00200","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646170200,"counter":443,"content":"<p>When I spoke about hospital waiting lists in the D&aacute;il in 2018 they were the longest on record with 707,000 patients waiting for treatment.  Deputy Harris was the Minister for Health then.  He stated that reduced waiting times for patients was a key priority for himself and the Government.  He gave reasons the lists were so long and outlined a series of measures to reduce them over time.  However, four years later there are 879,000 individuals on waiting lists of which 96,000 are children.  Some 40,600 were added to the hospital waiting lists in the past year.  Throughout 2021, 114 people were added to hospital waiting lists each day.  Some public hospitals had 100% increases in outpatient and inpatient waiting lists.  This was despite the fact that one in five hospital consultant posts remain vacant or are filled on a temporary basis according to the Irish Hospital Consultants Association.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; an rud seo ag cur br&uacute; m&oacute;r ar an gc&oacute;ras sl&aacute;inte.  Many patients have also had their appointments cancelled.  Those left waiting long periods for treatment are often left in pain as their conditions get worse.  Their well-being and mental health deteriorates with the stress of not knowing when they will have their appointment and receive care.  The Euro Health Consumer Index, EHCI, questions why some countries have no or minimal waiting lists in healthcare.  They have achieved their goal by introducing an integrated national real time e-referral system.  The EHCI asks an important question, that is, if countries with limited means can achieve a virtual absence of waiting lists, what excuse can there be for countries such as Ireland to keep having waiting list problems.  In my constituency work in Dublin North-West I have found many cases of people being effectively turned away from hospitals because of a lack of bed capacity or as a consequence of a lack of hospital resources, particularly around staffing.  This has been exacerbated during the pandemic.  Last year, the Government committed itself to implementing a monthly annual plan to reduce waiting lists in hospitals.  Where are we with this?  When will we see the results of this commitment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100053#CCC00200","speaker":"1470"},{"type":"speech","time":1646170200,"counter":444,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom an r&uacute;n seo a mholadh chuig an D&aacute;il.

Some 893,000 of those are on hospital waiting lists.  It is an absolute scandal that has been decades in the making.  It is the result of mismanagement, incompetence and a lack of political will to address the gross inequalities that lie at the heart of Ireland's health service.  This inequality is illustrated by the undeniable fact that access to healthcare is often determined by one's wealth and where one lives.  Week after week, I speak to people waiting for essential treatment for themselves or their children who have been blatantly told that if they can go private the care that they need will be provided virtually immediately.<\/p>  <p>  Those dependant on the public system tell me, and they will tell the Government if it will listen, that geography can determine the level of care they receive.  All too many of the problems that we face originate in the failure to deliver proper working primary care services.  In County Monaghan the decisions by previous Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments to remove services from Monaghan hospital continue to have serious negative repercussions.  Emergency services were withdrawn from Monaghan and resulted in drastic overcrowding at Cavan and Drogheda hospitals.  A minor injuries unit, MIU, was eventually established.  It is a great service that should serve to ease pressure on both GP and emergency departments.  However, the MIU only operates Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., in contrast with most other minor injury units which operate seven days a week, 8 a.m. until 8 p.m.  On top of that, for non-GP referrals there is now a fee of &euro;75 for patients to attend.  The result of this is that the numbers attending the MIU are falling while the demands on GPs and on emergency departments are ever growing.  It is as if the Government is trying to make a bad situation worse.  The Minister asked for practical solutions that can help ease the crisis in our health services.  Here is one: open all minor injury units, and specifically Monaghan, to seven days a week with long-hour services and remove the fees associated with MIU presentations.<\/p> <p>Governments refused to listen when we warned them of the consequences of withdrawing services from Monaghan Hospital.  I sincerely hope the Minister and Minister of State will listen now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100053#CCC00300","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646170800,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I am proud of the wonderful staff we have in our health services.  Over recent months, as they battled through Covid, we all gave them a clap on the back and commended their heroics, and rightly so.  I have met many of them and can tell the Minister they are hungry for change in healthcare.  They want things to be different.  They want the tools to do the job.  They do not want any more claps on the back from politicians.  They want us to do our job, which is to provide the resources to the public system to enable them to give better treatment to patients.  They are at the coalface of this.  We are talking here about 1.3 million people who are on hospital waiting lists and community waiting lists.  The people who are dealing with these patients every single day are staff and they want the tools to do the job to provide better healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  One of the features of the Irish healthcare system is outsourcing.  It is something we are very good at.  We outsource treatment to private hospitals, and even in the Minister's plan that he announced, we are going to see more of that.  We outsource diagnostic tests even though we have 225,000 people waiting for a diagnosis.  We outsource cancer screening and, let us be honest, we have seen the consequences of that in recent years.  We outsource employment of staff through agencies, which costs huge amounts of money.  More and more outsourcing means less and less capacity in the public system.  However, we do not just outsource the hiring of staff or outsource services; we also outsource responsibility.  It seems we have an absolute failure of accountability and responsibility in the Irish healthcare service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100054#DDD00200","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1646170800,"counter":447,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100054#DDD00300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1646170800,"counter":448,"content":"<p>The people at the top who run the health services get mega salaries that are multiples of what anybody in this Chamber will get, yet we do not have accountability or transparency.  At the top of the health services targets set are missed over and over again and it permeates right down to local hospitals where we can again say there are major problems in some hospitals.  In some cases, I have to say it is simply bad management.  If I were the Minister for Health, I would of course put capacity into hospitals where it is needed.  We must of course look at minor injuries units like the ones in Monaghan that need to be properly supported, and if I was Minister, I would do that.<\/p>  <p>  There is also much more we can do.  We must bring about a new culture of accountability and transparency in the Irish healthcare system.  The Minister outsourced responsibility for the waiting list plan and Sl&aacute;intecare to the two people whose responsibility it is to manage the day-to-day running of our health services, namely, the Secretary General of the Department and the head of the HSE.  The Minister should have taken responsibility.  The people who were leading healthcare reform and whose sole job it was to drive reform of healthcare left.  They resigned from Sl&aacute;intecare because they saw the Minister and his Government are not committed to the necessary reforms.  They did not see action on waiting lists, and they are right.  They did not see action on e-health, and they are right, and they did not see action on regionalisation.  When the Minister outsources responsibility and there is failure, he as the Minister for Health must take responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  I was being 100% sincere earlier when I said I welcome and celebrate every additional cent that has been put into our health services over the past two years and I recognise additional investment was made.  I celebrate also every single additional staff member who has been brought into the health services, and we need many more.  However, we also have real problems with recruitment and retention.  The Minister knows we are not training enough healthcare professionals and railed against it himself when in opposition.  We need to train more.  There are real problems with recruitment and we need to deal with that.  There are real problems with retaining staff and we need to deal with that.  We do not have enough surgical theatre capacity or diagnostic capacity.  We do not have enough beds in our acute hospitals so patients cannot be admitted quickly enough.  We do not have enough capacity in the community sector.  We do not have the cohesion and the integrated healthcare system we need.  Unless we deal with those structural problems, the Minister is going to come into the House with reports and strategies he believes in his heart will work but that I can tell him will not.  Listen to the INMO.  Listen to the IMO.  Listen to the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA.

In 2022, almost &euro;12 billion is available to spend on vital infrastructure in areas such as housing, transport, education, enterprise, sport and climate action.

The programmes included in the plan have been subject to high-level prioritisation and assessment of compatibility with critical Government priorities such as housing, climate action and balanced regional prosperity.

We have brought forward a proposal in that regard.  It is civil and administrative in nature, with a fine of up to &euro;25,000 and a prohibition on lobbying for up to a two year period.

As we emerge from the pandemic and the economy recovers, we are faced with a new set of challenges, including rising energy prices and transitory supply issues that are causing prices to increase.  In that context, last October's budget included a range of measures to support citizens with the rising cost of living, including increases to weekly social welfare rates.  Targeted measures included increases in the living alone allowance, the qualified child allowance and the weekly rate of fuel allowance.  The latter increase, which was implemented immediately on budget night in October, was an exceptional measure and is not what normally occurs.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Government is acutely conscious of the challenges still facing households, in particular relating to energy bills and especially for those on lower incomes.  In recognition of those challenges, the Government has in recent weeks set out a series of measures aimed at further mitigating the cost of living pressures people are facing.  These measures, as the Deputy knows, add up to over &euro;500 million.  The Deputy is also well aware of what they are so I do not need to go through them in detail.

While the operation and management of the existing employment control framework approach is a matter for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the HEA and the individual higher education institutions, a key issue from my Department's perspective is to ensure it appropriately reflects fiscal, expenditure and public service staffing and pay policies.

As the Deputy is aware, Harnessing Digital - The Digital Ireland Framework document was deliberately written to align Ireland with Europe's Digital Decade: digital targets for 2030.  While my Department is primarily responsible for co-ordinating the delivery of the digital Government element of the digital Ireland framework, we will, of course, work across all of government, including the Department of Health and the HSE, in the achievement of the specified targets.<\/p><p>We have seen a significant step forward in the provision of e-government services in Ireland over the last few years, with our passport, Revenue and driving licence services all proving extremely popular and an ever-growing uptake of MyGovID and use of <i>gov.ie<\/i>.  I acknowledge the work of the Deputy's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, who cannot be here as he is abroad on Government business, for driving a number of these reforms.<\/p><p>During the worst of the pandemic, we were able to stand up numerous services, including in e-health, with the vaccination portal and world-leading contact tracing app.  The digital Covid certificate system was developed by the Department of Health and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, within my Department.  There is considerable material here, which will be put on the record, but I want to specifically touch on the issue of e-health.<\/p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE have committed to revise and deliver a renewed e-health strategy by 2030.  In doing so, they continue to work closely with my Department.  We will also work with it as it delivers on Ireland's national recovery and resilience plan, and the renewed national development plan's digital commitments in respect of e-health and digital health services.<\/p><p>This will involve: continued phased deployment of electronic health record systems; use of health identifiers to create records that are unique to each patient; e-pharmacy and e-prescribing; summary and shared-care records; tele-medicine and remote care monitoring solutions.  We have received specific funding under the national recovery and resilience plan with regard to a suite of e-health projects which, perhaps, I can come back on in a moment.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>The digital Covid certificate not only enabled our people to travel with digital proofs of Covid-19 vaccination and recovery but we were also able to open up a portal to pharmacies and testing centres to provide proofs of negative tests for travel.  Then we were able to create a privacy-enhanced version of our verifier to help open up hospitality and, finally, create the means whereby nearly 53,000 Irish people who were vaccinated in other countries have been able to avail of EU-compliant digital Covid certificates.<\/p><p>These successes provide a firm foundation for a more advanced and user-centric service model, with the evolution from e-government, where existing manual services and processes were computerised, to digital government, where services are re-imagined and developed based on a greater understanding of user journeys and choices.<\/p><p>The Government is committed, over the next several years, to build upon our strong foundations and to creating a trusted, user-driven, intuitive, inclusive and efficient world-leading digital government service, in which 90% of applicable services are consumed online.  This is a very ambitious objective because it covers Government, local government, education and justice as well as healthcare.  Moreover, we will develop priority plans and approaches through consultation with the most important users of the systems, our people and our businesses.<\/p><p>I am convinced that building our digital offerings around the needs of our people will further facilitate the already increasing uptake of digital government services, helping us drive towards the 90% of applicable services consumed online by 2030 target.  This, in turn, will help facilitate the freeing up of resources to better support those who may struggle with technology, and-or may not be in a position to independently engage online.<\/p><p>This includes supporting such cohorts to engage, through providing them with digital skills and access to infrastructure, but also through focused supports such as assisted digital approaches, where individuals can get the necessary help to enable them over time to grow their confidence and capability in digital transactions.  This will be further supplemented by non-digital complementary options, where more appropriate.  Creating a better face-to-face experience for those who need it most and improving the times when and locations where these services will be available is an important part of an inclusive approach where everyone can benefit from digital transformation.<\/p><p>It is also important to foster public trust in the safety, transparency and the value of digital solutions.  To that end, my Department has driven forward the implementation of the Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019, which will provide full transparency around the sharing of data across the public sector.  We have also worked with the National Cyber Security Centre and the public service, including the HSE, in the development of baseline security standards to raise the protection of citizen data.  Both of these initiatives will help underpin e-health development.<\/p><p>These initiatives, coupled with investment in foundational infrastructure and national systems to enable transformation and reform of the health service in Ireland, will help to reduce our reliance on acute hospitals.  It will also empower citizens to monitor their health status, adapt their lifestyles and support independent living and enable people to be cared for closer to home.  Finally, the Government is digitally enabling the healthcare workforce in order that it has access to modern, fit-for-purpose technology, which allows them to save time, record better data and provide better care to their patients.  For support staff, the provision of tools such as the integrated  financial management system will increase efficiencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100060#KKK00600","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1646174400,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the role of NearForm in my home town of Tramore which was instrumental in the production of that Covid tracker app.  It did a great job of work in a short space of time and for relatively good value.

There is a huge opportunity in providing healthcare in hard-to-reach areas such as the islands, where it is very difficult to access healthcare, when put together with e-prescribing.<\/p>  <p>  However, we need a strategy in place, because there are also issues around the safeguarding of privacy, if we move the more integrated model in order that people have more rights and control over their records.

The opening public consultation on the review closed shortly before Christmas.  This preliminary consultation was designed as an opportunity for all interested stakeholders to have their say in setting the direction of the review at an early stage of the process.  Stakeholders in the public sector, journalism, academia, the political domain, as well as individual  members of the public, were asked to briefly identify key issues with the current FOI system in Ireland as they see it.<\/p>  <p>  Close to 1,200 responses were received from a diverse range of stakeholders, which demonstrates the high level of interest in this matter.  These responses are currently being analysed by my officials and will inform a further consultation paper.

We should be providing more information.  The Minister mentioned that information should be widely available.  If the Departments published everything, they would have very little to do with FOI.

The Brexit adjustment reserve aims to provide financial support to the most affected member states, regions and sectors to deal with the adverse consequences of Brexit.  Ireland will be the largest beneficiary of the reserve, with an allocation of over &euro;1 billion, the equivalent to just over 20% of the entire reserve.  Approximately 80% of the funding will be paid to member states as pre-financing in three tranches of the period 2021 to 2023.  I am pleased that on 6 December last, the European Commission approved payment of Ireland&rsquo;s first tranche of &euro;361.5 million, making us the first member state to receive such approval.  To qualify for funding, expenditure must be incurred between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2023.  The direct link to the adverse consequences of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU must be demonstrated.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, the allocation of resources from the reserve is being aligned with the annual Estimates process, which has been the vehicle for allocating Brexit resources since the UK referendum on EU membership in 2016.  Budget 2022 announced that approximately &euro;500 million of the overall BAR allocation will be made available as a first tranche of funding, with the remainder available next year.  Indicative areas for BAR funding that were identified include enterprise supports, measures to support fisheries and coastal communities, targeted supports for the agrifood sector, reskilling and retraining and checks and controls at ports and airports.  <\/p>  <p>  To allow partners to proceed with programmes to be funded under the reserve, some &euro;54 million was allocated as an initial funding in the Revised Estimates for public services 2022, with further allocations to be provided later this year, when there is more certainty on the requirements and timelines for spending of funds. <\/p>  <p>  Initial allocations were made.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science was allocated &euro;14.5 million for Skillnet digital skills programme and Erasmus after Brexit initiatives.  There is also an allocation to the OPW, to support its work to develop the infrastructure for checks and control at Rosslare Europort.

Part of my constituency lies within the Garda divisional area known as the K district, which comprises Finglas, Cabra and Blanchardstown.  This Garda divisional area covers a district with a population of about 160,000 people.  Finglas is a fast-growing area with a population of about 40,000.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear from an analysis of Garda resources from throughout the country that there is significant variation in the numbers of garda&iacute; relative to the size of communities.  An analysis of Garda manpower throughout the country's 28 divisions highlights wide variations in the strength of the force relative to the size of communities, creating an obvious imbalance in the way these communities are being served.  For example, Limerick city, with a population of approximately 95,000, has 377 garda&iacute; serving the community.  Finglas, by contrast, which has a population of 40,000, has approximately 90 garda&iacute; covering the area.  As can be seen immediately, there is a glaring imbalance in respect of available Garda resources in this densely populated area.  Issues that have come to national attention involve illegal drug-related activity, gang-related criminality and feuding among gangs, which are greatly affecting the community of Finglas and impacting on those going about their daily business.  Much of this activity is confined to a small number of people in a small number of areas, but it has the effect of creating a climate of fear for families, and especially the elderly, in sections of the community.<\/p> <p>People impacted by this criminal activity are often afraid to go to the Garda and report these matters for fear of reprisals from these gangs or by those involved in criminality.<\/p> <p> For a number of years, there has been a number of individuals associated with what is known locally as the \"Gucci Gang\".  People associated with this criminal gang have been involved in horrific activity that has shocked the community with shootings, kidnappings and beatings.  There is also ongoing issues with people from Finglas and Cabra organising fights on Facebook, which have resulted in serious injuries.  In the light of this criminal activity, I commend the efforts of local community activists and others to draw young people away from this type of activity.  In spite of the lack of resources available to the Garda, I acknowledge the good work they have done around Finglas in combating this criminal activity.<\/p> <p> A recent successful Garda operation was carried out in the Finglas area and resulted in the seizure of guns and money from a criminal gang.  The operation also resulted in a number of houses used by this criminal gang being boarded up by Dublin City Council.  The garda&iacute; would be the first to acknowledge that more needs to be done and if they had the proper resources, they could even be more effective.<\/p> <p> At every policing forum or joint policing committee meeting, the issue of the lack of Garda resources is raised by me, other public representatives and members of the community.  We need to be listened to.  There is no substitute for garda&iacute; on the ground in our communities and interacting with people.  That is why more garda&iacute; and resources are needed to help safeguard the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100063#NNN01400","speaker":"1470","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646176800,"counter":587,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.<\/p>  <p>  As he will be aware, under section 26 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business, which encompasses all operational policing matters, including the allocation of resources.

The emphasis the Minister has placed on the enhancement of further and higher education in Ireland is welcome, including the very significant increase in budgets that the education and training boards, ETBs, have mentioned for delivery nationwide.  Swords in particular, with such a dense population, offers the possibility of developing and delivering additional educational facilities that can unlock skills and take Ireland into the next decade.  As the climate action spokesperson for my party, I know it is vital for a carbon-neutral society that we deliver upon the likes of the retrofitting scheme with the necessary skill sets.  Clearly, this will be a dramatic area of growth in the coming years, not to mention the range of other training available across the State, and through apprenticeships.<\/p> <p> It is extraordinarily important to see the further education and training, FET, feature that is available on CAO applications this year.  I commend the Minister on his relentless focus on this much neglected area of education and the development of apprenticeships in existing and emerging sectors, such as cybersecurity and other technology which will emerge in the coming years as vital.<\/p> <p> Fingal is the most diverse and youngest community in the country and it is the youngest community in Europe.  On that basis, there should be significant further investment by the Department in Swords and in communities like Balbriggan, which again has seen dramatic growth in recent decades.  Fifteen years ago the population of Balbriggan was 6,000 to 7,000 and now it is in excess of 20,000.  However, there are gaps and I believe that Fingal is one such gap that can be addressed, in particular with the additional emphasis that has been placed by the Government and the Minister on this sector.  In order to meet the need to give people the option both at local and national level to meet the skills required in the coming decades, it is crucial that we invest in the long-term health of the nation and its long-term education.  Moreover, by providing these services in areas of maximum impact that will be key to this goal, Swords offers the Department a chance to make a significant impact on a young and growing population.  I fully expect the coming census to show the population is far above 55,000, if not 60,000.  I hope the Minister, along with the Education and Training Boards Ireland and the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, DDLETB, will look upon it as a suitable location given its proximity to the city but also the significant young population that is located there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100064#OOO00500","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646177400,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Alan Farrell, for raising this very important issue this evening and also for talking about it on a regular and ongoing basis.  I also thank him for his interest in and commitment to FET and in particular how it can benefit the community of Swords in the county of Fingal.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy has outlined, Fingal county has shown the highest growth of any local authority in Ireland over the past 20 years.  Swords is officially the largest town in Dublin and the second largest in the country, and in the next decade it is expected to reach a population of 100,000.  The previous census, in 2016, showed the population was approximately 46,000.  The growth since then has been significant and that will continue.  Increasing further education and training provision to meet the needs of the diverse and fast-growing community in Swords and in Fingal is a priority for the Department and the Government and I am pleased to say it is a priority for the DDLETB.  I know the Deputy has met with the board to discuss the issue.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has already been made.  The opening of the new FET facility for Swords, Burgundy House, took place in autumn 2021, following delays experienced by many projects due to Covid.  I am delighted the centre is now open.  It is exceptionally well equipped, with two IT suites, plus five spacious classrooms, as well as plans for further development of the third floor.  Together with the neighbouring facility in the plaza, these centres are very accessible and are in a town centre location.  The DDLETB has also invested considerably in Balbriggan with the opening of a second FET centre there, Castlemill Education Centre, in 2019.  These developments, coupled together, have more than doubled FET capacity in the north east of the county and that is most welcome.<\/p>  <p>  I can also confirm that work is ongoing on the development of the second set of three-year strategic performance agreements between SOLAS and the 16 ETBs.  These agreements are an opportunity for SOLAS as the FET agency to sit down with the ETBs and invite them to map out their strategic priorities and how they, individually, intend to contribute to our overall aim and ambition for FET.  Furthermore, the agreements identify the key risks and challenges which must be mitigated and addressed in order to ensure successful delivery of these agreements in the region.  I have no doubt that any issues in relation to the demand for FET provision in Swords will be addressed in the strategic performance agreement process between SOLAS and the DDLETB.<\/p>  <p>  I am also pleased to be talking about the matter this evening in the context of the significant announcement we have just made on capital spending in both higher and further education.  We have set out our intention to spend &euro;430 million on new capital programmes in the further and higher education sector between now and 2025.  Some 45% of that is allocated to FET.  This is truly a scale of capital investment that we have not seen in a very long time, if ever.  The capital investment will invite our ETBs to put forward their ideas for a FET college of the future project.  I note that in its submission to the Fingal county development plan for 2023 to 2029, the DDLETB outlined the business case for the development of a new FET college of the future in Fingal.  My understanding is that it intends to develop a new integrated college structure and campus in Swords with satellite campuses around the county of Fingal, including Burgundy House and Baldoyle Training Centre.  It wants to create a centre of excellence offering integrated, seamless learning opportunities and to provide learning pathways for school-leavers and adults in Fingal.<\/p>  <p>  In its submission, it also presented a case for commissioning and developing a new outdoor education facility to meet the growing needs of the younger population to which Deputy Farrell referred in Fingal, thereby future-proofing perhaps the needs of young people to connect, engage and develop in their own community.  It will be invited to put that forward now as part of our capital call.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100065#PPP00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1646177400,"counter":594,"content":"<p>There was some very positive news contained within the Minister's response.  I was especially pleased to be informed recently of the very significant increase in the capital budget and to learn that, as he mentioned, a substantial part of it, 45%, is to be expended in this particular area.  That shows the sort of commitment we need in order to meet the demand of a growing young population, but also to broaden the options available to younger people, in particular school-leavers.<\/p>  <p>  My engagement with ETBI was based on an exceptional level of knowledge and information exchange.  A number of Dublin Deputies attended the meeting last week, as well as Deputies from all over the country.  A level of ambition was set out, in particular in trying to support and deliver upon recent Government policy in the area of retrofitting but also areas like cybersecurity and the technology and software of the future.  That is something I would wholeheartedly support.<\/p>  <p>  I am very pleased to hear of the emphasis on the delivery of such a facility in the community of Swords with satellite facilities to be delivered elsewhere or enhanced in other communities.  The community in Fingal will certainly welcome this level of investment.  I very much look forward to visiting the fantastic new facility in County Louth on Monday.  Later this month, I will meet with the DDLETB in order to thrash out its plans for my constituency, so the Minister's response is very welcome.

My message to the DDLETB in the context of Swords, and my message to all ETBs, is that we have a very significant pot of funding to invest in FET colleges of the future, to expand provision and to upgrade facilities for exactly the reasons the Deputy outlines, including the need to make sure we have the skills we require in this country to meet some of the massive challenges we face in particular in the area Deputy Farrell has responsibility for in my party in terms of the climate agenda, retrofitting, the green economy but also regarding Housing for All and making sure we can meet our housing targets and upskill and reskill people.  There are so many opportunities in that regard.<\/p> <p>This will be an opportunity for all the ETBs, including Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB, to put forward their proposals.  I note with interest and excitement the fact a lot of work has already been done in Fingal in regard to how they will deliver this, with Swords as the hub and with spokes out across other parts of the county.<\/p> <p> I want to take the opportunity to thank everybody involved in DDLETB for their work and thank everybody involved in adult education in the Deputy's constituency for the work they have done.  It has been a very challenging number of years with the Covid pandemic, to put it mildly, but really good work is being done.  I am delighted to say there are 152 courses planned in 2022, offering 1,396 places in Swords in further education and training, which is a 28% increase on 2019, which is probably the last comparable year before the Covid pandemic.  Of course, delivery methods include part-time, full-time, online, blended and a range of unaccredited provisions and accredited provisions up to level 5.  There is a new vocational training opportunity course to be delivered in the area in 2022 and there is also specialist provision for early school leavers in Swords Youthreach Centre, where there are adult literacy and back to education programmes.  A lot of very good work is being done in Swords in this area.  I look forward to the discussions we will have about how we can do more and future-proof that offering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100065#PPP00400","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Schemes","time":1646178000,"counter":597,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100066#QQQ00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1646178000,"counter":598,"content":"<p>There is no doubt the better energy warmer homes scheme is an important support for many eligible homeowners.  It is one of the key tools that will help to reduce the use of carbon in our economy and help us reach our climate action goals.  Since 2000, more than 143,000 homes have availed of the scheme and, in some ways, it has been a victim of its own success.  When it was first promoted over a decade ago, many people who were eligible availed of the scheme but benefited from very basic upgrades, such as attic insulation.  A decade later and with improved technology, these homeowners, many of whom are over 70 and on fuel allowance, wish to avail of other interventions, such as wraparound external insulation.  The bad news is that they are being rejected by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, as they are deemed to have previously availed of the scheme, even though those availing of the scheme for the first time this year will receive a far greater intervention.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the changes that were made to the scheme last month as part of the Government's wider announcement in this area and I received a parliamentary question reply from the Department confirming that a second application may be possible.  It stated very clearly that applications may be accepted from qualifying homeowners who were previously in receipt of support under the scheme but who could still benefit from deeper upgrade measures.  This means homeowners will not be precluded from applying for the second time for qualifying works not previously carried out on their properties.  It seems clear but when the SEAI is contacted and these people apply again, they are in fact precluded and their application is rejected.  Have the recent changes been embedded yet with the SEAI?  Is every person who applies for the scheme for a second time able to avail of the scheme and what are the qualifying criteria?  Equally, there have been calls for the application process to be brought online to make it speedier.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State knows, in order to qualify for the better energy warmer homes scheme, there are very strict criteria linked to certain social welfare payments.  I think we can both agree there is a serious risk of fuel poverty for people who are availing of this scheme and for those who are on the other side of an arbitrary threshold.  Along with the increasing demand for better interventions, there are also more than 7,000 homes waiting for works under this scheme.  Will the Minister of State outline how the Government hopes to break down the backlog that has grown during the pandemic and how he and the Minister, Deputy Harris, are addressing the skills shortage in this area?  There has been a steady decline in the number of homes being completed through this scheme in Dublin in the past five years, from 1,598 in 2017 to just 693 last year.  Are there plans to increase numbers in what is a very beneficial scheme that has generated much demand?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100066#QQQ00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1646178000,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McAuliffe for raising this important issue and I know he has raised it on a number of occasions.  I am grateful for the opportunity to give an update on Government action on the better energy warmer homes scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government and the climate action plan set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a building energy rating, BER, of B2 and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings by the end of this decade.  These targets represent a very significant increase in both the volume and depth of retrofit activity in Ireland.  The recently published national retrofit plan sets out how we will achieve these targets and identifies an unprecedented &euro;8 billion to support homeowners to retrofit their homes to 2030.  It includes a range of measures aimed at supporting those least able to afford to retrofit.  Recently, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, also announced further improvements to the supports available to homeowners to retrofit their homes, in line with the commitments in the national retrofit plan.<\/p>  <p>  The better energy warmer homes scheme delivers free energy upgrades to eligible homeowners in low income households who are vulnerable to energy poverty.  It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Since the start of the scheme in 2000, more than 143,000 free upgrades have been supported by the scheme.  In 2021, the average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was &euro;17,100.  A budget allocation of &euro;109 million has been provided for the scheme this year.  This will support an increase in the number of free home upgrades from an average of 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month this year, helping to reduce waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications committed to reviewing qualifying criteria for the scheme, including the rule only allowing one visit to homeowners.  I am delighted to tell the Deputy that several revisions to the scheme were made recently to better target those in need.  For the first time, applications will be accepted from qualifying homeowners who previously received supports under the scheme but who could still benefit from even deeper measures.  This means that applicants will now be able to have a second visit under the scheme.  The scheme will target the worst performing properties by prioritising homes that were built and occupied before 1993 and have a pre-works BER of E, F or G.  Existing applications will not be affected by this change.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme eligibility criteria will also be extended to include those in receipt of the disability allowance for more than six months who have a child under seven years.  The scheme is now open to applicants in receipt of the following welfare payments: fuel allowance; jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for over six months and having a child under seven; working family payment; one-parent family payment; domiciliary care allowance; carer's allowance where someone lives with the person they are caring for; and disability allowance for over six months and having a child under seven.  The eligibility criteria are kept under ongoing review with the Department of Social Protection to ensure they are consistent with and complementary to the other income support schemes offered by that Department.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently just over 7,000 homes awaiting works on the better energy, warmer homes scheme work programme.  This includes homes that are awaiting the initial survey of their home; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor; have been allocated to a contractor for works; or are currently undergoing works.<\/p>  <p>  Activity under this scheme, and the associated expenditure, were significantly impacted in both 2020 and 2021 by the Covid pandemic, when construction activity was paused for approximately 12 months.  However, activity did ramp up again towards the end of last year and there is confidence around the capacity to deliver 400 homes per month under this scheme this year.  Works under the scheme have now recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector.  SEAI data indicate that for homes completed to date in 2021 , the average time from application to completion was approximately 26 months, taking into account the increase in waiting times due to the impact of Covid.  The Department is happy to confirm that the SEAI is now expecting that the current backlog can be cleared within the next 18 months.<\/p>  <p>  A research network on fuel poverty chaired by the Economic and Social Research Institute has been established to examine the data and metrics needed to improve existing measures around fuel poverty in Ireland.  The details I have outlined demonstrate the Government's significant commitments to supporting those at risk of energy poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100066#QQQ00300","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1646178000,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I particularly welcome the Minister of State's confirmation regarding the particular criteria I outlined, when he stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tFor the first time, applications will be accepted from qualifying homeowners who previously received supports under the scheme but who could still benefit from even deeper measures.

I would like it to go further, as I am sure would the Minister of State.  Have we taken fully into account the increased role for the sector under this scheme as well as other measures?  The comments by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science earlier about further education are something we should be taking into account.  If there is an option for someone to take up an apprenticeship and specialise in insulation, I would tell the mothers and fathers of Ireland there is plenty of work in the area.

In many cases where the walls were not cavity walls, only the attic was insulated.  With the expansion of the scheme in 2018, internal and external wall insulation was introduced, which meant that solid wall properties could now receive insulation under the scheme.  With the scheme expansion, many homeowners who only received attic insulation previously but who, under current scheme rules, qualify for wall insulation began contesting the one home, one visit rule.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications committed to reviewing the qualifying criteria for the scheme and the Government recently announced several revisions to that scheme.

Every day I ask people to move their location so that I can hear what they are saying because of the quality of mobile phone coverage.  The Minister of State, coming from a rural constituency, will know exactly what I am talking about.  On 1 February the Government launched the new national digital strategy, Harnessing Digital - The Digital Ireland Framework.  One of the objectives set out in the framework was making connectivity available to everyone.  It set a target that all populated areas would be covered by 5G not later than 2030.  Eir today has 5G coverage over 70% of Ireland's population, covering 322 towns throughout the country.  That is close to providing coverage for every town of a population of 500 or more.  Three has population coverage of 79% for 5G technology.  By 2028 we will have 146,000 km of fibre cable stretching across 96% of Ireland's landmass.  Therefore, setting a goal for only covering the populated areas of the country two years later by 2030 is not very ambitious.<\/p>  <p>  On top of that, the Minister of State's own Department of Justice, will have to retender for the TETRA radio communications network, the digital radio service for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the other emergency services that is costing the taxpayer &euro;40 million per annum at the moment.  This network needs to be replaced with a 5G network and to have geographic coverage.  That is not only to support the existing emergency services but also to support the remote drone operation through the Air Corps that provides Garda air support throughout Ireland and not only in the city of Dublin.  That can be done with 5G technology.<\/p>  <p>  Today there is a real gap in providing mobile voice and data services to address the blackspots around the country that are having a negative impact on business and tourism in our rural areas.  This will have a significant impact on medical care, the care of older people and the use of technology on farms into the future.  As one of the most dispersed populations in Europe, Ireland has a relatively high percentage of its landmass with no mobile data coverage.  I believe now is the time to focus on the opportunity the State has by working in collaboration with industry to develop a shared rural network to address this issue and assist in the further balanced regional development and economic development of our rural areas.  This shared rural network could provide the critical 4G and 5G coverage that would enhance the operation of our rural economy, support key activities such as farming, medical services, older people's schemes in rural areas, and SME business operations, and ensure people could remain connected when travelling around the country, working in rural Ireland or living in our rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100067#RRR00400","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1646178600,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Naughten for raising this important issue for discussion.  It is well recognised how important telecommunications services are to citizens for so many aspects of their daily lives, including remote working, studying and staying in touch with family members.  These services have proved even more essential since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and will continue to provide vital support in accelerating digitalisation as part of our economic recovery from the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Access to high-quality telecommunications services is also of crucial importance in the context of supporting the current and future development of enterprise in both rural and urban Ireland as well as supporting our emergency services.  Ireland's level of connectivity to support digital activity has improved significantly in recent years.  The Digital Economy and Society Index, DESI, is a composite index summarising relevant indicators in Europe's digital performance.  Ireland ranked fifth among EU countries in 2021 compared with 11th in 2019.  The continued investment by commercial operators and by the State through the national broadband plan will ensure Ireland is set to become the EU leader in connectivity by the second half of this decade.<\/p>  <p>  Mobile coverage obligations are set out in licences granted by the independent regulator, ComReg, to mobile operators.  ComReg advises that the current minimum coverage obligations in those licences are being considerably exceeded by all operators.<\/p>  <p>  Capital investment by telecommunications operators over the past five years was in the order of &euro;3.3 billion for both fixed and mobile services.  This has significantly enhanced the availability of services, both voice and data, throughout Ireland, including in rural areas.  Telecommunication operators have committed to continued investment programmes in the coming years, estimated to be in the region of &euro;700 million per annum.<\/p>  <p>  ComReg is currently in the process of running another multi-band spectrum award to assign rights of use in four spectrum bands.  The award comprises 470 MHz of spectrum and represents a 46% increase in the harmonised spectrum assigned for the provision of wireless broadband services in Ireland.  This will significantly enable the market to provide improved services to meet increasing consumer demand for mobile data and new services.<\/p>  <p>  To assist consumers to choose the network provider that best meets their needs for where they live, work and travel, ComReg has developed a national outdoor coverage map.  This map, which is available on the ComReg website, provides consumers with very clear information on where operators have good 2G, 3G and 4G coverage.  For a truly connected society and economy, having access to both mobile and fixed services is important as these services are complementary to each other.<\/p> <p>The national broadband plan, which is being deployed across every county, will ensure every home, business, farm and school in rural Ireland will have access to a future-proofed fibre broadband service on par with the best such service available in urban areas.  Where citizens have a fixed fibre broadband service, this will reduce some pressure on mobile networks and free up capacity for other users.  Another positive benefit results from the amount of fibre now being brought very deep into rural areas, which offers the potential for mobile operators to access this fibre to carry high volumes of data.<\/p> <p> It is clearly evident that people living and working in rural areas have benefited from the very significant investment in upgrading both mobile and fixed telecommunications infrastructure.  The Government's ambition is for this investment to continue into the future until Ireland has become the most connected country in the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100067#RRR00500","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646179200,"counter":607,"content":"<p>There is big ambition for providing fibre but none for mobile services.

The estimated cost of doing that in Ireland is between &euro;30 million and &euro;50 million.  That is small money and it would also slash the cost of the provision of an emergency and Garda communications network which must now be re-tendered and a new network built.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware the telecoms industry is already engaging with the Government via IBEC to progress a phase 1 proof-of-concept roll-out of this particular shared rural network model.  That will cost approximately &euro;5 million if implemented in the short term.  This project would ensure all operators have equal opportunity to provide a service in rural locations and would ensure in the short term that those communities with the poorest service today got an immediate benefit in the form of improved mobile phone coverage.  It would be just like what we are doing with the national broadband plan, where we are giving universal access to a network available to all of the operators.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the auction that is to take place with ComReg.

I will certainly bring to the Minister's attention his comments on the proposal for a shared rural network with costs estimated at between &euro;30 million and &euro;50 million.  As I outlined, connectivity in rural areas, both fixed and mobile, is very much on an upward trajectory.  Coverage at both a population and geographical level has greatly improved through the very substantial investments being made by commercial operators and through the Government's national broadband plan.<\/p>  <p>  From a mobile perspective, in particular, a key determinant for quality coverage is the availability of suitable spectrum.  Over the past decade, spectrum awards have consistently included appropriate spectrum that has allowed mobile operators to provide enhanced services for customers.  ComReg is in the process of running another multiband spectrum award and this will include a number of spectrum bands, including the 700 MHz band.  That band is important for the provision of widespread coverage, including in rural areas and on national transport routes.  It is highly suitable for the provision of existing 4G and, over time, new 5G services.
