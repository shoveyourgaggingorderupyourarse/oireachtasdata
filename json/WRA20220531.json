hubs as key economic assets for our rural towns and villages. Notwithstanding the clear benefits to individuals and families in terms of quality of life indicators, remote working from hubs will also support local economies, reduce carbon emissions and may arrest or reverse the depopulation of certain areas. Accordingly, over recent years my department has invested some &euro;100\u00a0million in the sector, to build, improve and expand hubs.<\/p><p>Last May, I launched the National Connected Hubs network together with the connectedhubs.ie platform.\u00a0\u00a0The platform offers a suite of booking and hub management applications to members of the Network. There are currently\u00a0236 hubs live on the platform, with this number increasing on an ongoing basis.\u00a0In total 41\u00a0of these 236\u00a0hubs are located in county Dublin, with a further 32 hubs\u00a0in county Dublin\u00a0mapped for invitation\u00a0to join the network. <\/p><p>The attached table provides\u00a0a full breakdown of connected hub platform figures. <\/p><p>My Department continues to fund the establishment and development of remote working hubs under a number of funding streams.\u00a0 For example, under the Connected Hubs 2021 funding call, over &euro;670,000 was\u00a0awarded\u00a0to applicants across county Dublin, with funding going to, amongst others, Digital HQ hub and the Glasshouse hub in Dun Laoghaire. <\/p><p>In February, I launched the 2022 Connected Hubs\u00a0Call, a &euro;5 million\u00a0funding stream to further support remote working facilities (including\u00a0BCPs) throughout the country and to\u00a0add further capacity to the National Hub Network. The 2022 evaluation process\u00a0has now concluded and\u00a0I\u00a0will be\u00a0announcing the successful applicants very shortly. \u00a0<\/p><p>Details of successful applicants\u00a0\u00a0will be\u00a0available on www.gov.ie. \u00a0<\/p><p>The development of a National Hubs Network is a key commitment in Our Rural Future and I am committed to continuing my Department's support for the ongoing development of a comprehensive and integrated network of\u00a0remote working hubs in recognition of the vital role that they can play in our post-Covid recovery.<\/p><p>TABLE 1 &ndash; Connectedhubs.ie -\u00a0Remote Working Hubs by County (as of the 23rd May 2022)\u00a0 <table>    <tr>       <th>County<\/th>       <th>Live on the connectedhubs.ie platform<\/th>       <th>Mapped to be invited to join the connectedhubs.ie   platform<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>14<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork<\/td>       <td>23<\/td>       <td>17<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>       <td>18<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin<\/td>       <td>41<\/td>       <td>32<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway<\/td>       <td>18<\/td>       <td>33<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry<\/td>       <td>17<\/td>       <td>11<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>17<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo<\/td>       <td>18<\/td>       <td>18<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>20<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>15<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>       <td>19<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>13<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>11<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>236<\/td>       <td>349<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100061#WRA03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100061#WRA03600"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[27672\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100061#WRA03700","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the way applications under the local improvement scheme will be expedited considering the backlog of work that local authorities are dealing with.","asker":"1557","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>The Local Improvement Scheme (LIS) supports the improvement of rural roads and laneways that are not normally maintained by local authorities.\u00a0 As part of Our Rural Future, the Government is committed to ensuring that the Scheme\u00a0is funded into the future.<\/p>  <p>  LIS was reintroduced in 2017 following a number of years with no dedicated funding in place.

Compared with 2020, the International Energy Agency estimates that the overall investment costs of new utility-scale PV and onshore wind plants are from 15% to 25% higher in 2022. While RESS 2 bid prices were higher than the first auction, renewable energy delivered under the scheme will pay back to consumers when wholesale electricity prices are high through the Public Service Obligation Levy.

This has caused a spike in the price of crude and in the price of refined products on the retail market.<\/p>  <p>  On 15 March 2022, Minister Ryan and I proposed to Government an emergency support measure &ndash; the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme. The Scheme will provide support of &euro;100 per week for eight weeks for each eligible heavy goods vehicle (HGV) authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is being administered by the Department of Transport. Application forms have been provided directly to all licensed hauliers by email using the email address held on file by the Road Transport Operator Licensing Unit in Loughrea. <\/p>  <p>  On 19 May 2022, Minister Ryan and I announced the extension of the closing date for receipt of completed applications for the Scheme to 6 June 2022. I can confirm the Scheme will not be extended beyond this date and that the current eligibility requirements, principally that applicants must hold a valid road haulage operator licence, will not be revisited.<\/p>  <p>  In deciding on a targeted scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. While this is true for some other operators also, in addition I am informed that fuel represents up to 40 per cent of cost inputs for road haulage operators. The sector is highly exposed to fuel price fluctuations and is more limited than others in terms of its ability to absorb such cost shocks. Also, licensed operators must hold a licence, employ a qualified Transport Manager and meet stringent financial standard requirements. Exempted operators, including those carrying livestock, are not required to hold a Road Haulage Operator Licence. <\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Government has acted to offset the rising cost of fuel through the reduction in Excise on fuels - a reduction of 20 cent on petrol and 15 cent on diesel fuel. While this measure (announced in early March 2022) was originally proposed to last until 31 August 2022 the Government has extended it out to Budget Day 2022.

If a property was occupied by an individual as his or her principal private residence for all or part of his or her period of ownership, then full or partial relief from CGT will be available where a chargeable gain arises on the disposal of that property.

The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 enabled Revenue to collect certain information in relation to the occupancy status of\u00a0 residential properties including, where unoccupied, the duration and reason for this, in the Local Property Tax (LPT) return forms submitted by residential property owners in respect of the new LPT valuation period 2022-2025.

It is also essential to identify the reasons for vacancy, and whether this is long or short-term in nature.

Its primary purpose was to widen the tax base and to provide a stable revenue stream to the Exchequer to provide funding for public services.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The USC is an individualised tax, meaning that a person&rsquo;s liability to the tax is determined on the basis of his\/her own individual income and personal circumstances.\u00a0The USC is applied at a low rate on a wide base, which ensures that it is a stable and sustainable source of revenue for the State. <\/p>  <p>  Currently individuals with incomes of less than &euro;13,000 are exempt from USC. For 2022, it is estimated that just over 797,000 taxpayer units which represents 28 per cent of all taxpayer units will be exempt from USC.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, medical card holders with total income of &euro;60,000 or less benefit from reduced rates of USC. The reduced rates of USC that apply for 2022 are 0.5% on the first &euro;12,012 of income\u00a0and 2% on the balance. Taxpayers that can avail of this concession are not subject to the 4.5 per cent USC rate of charge, as would be the case for other taxpayers.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out that the concession for medical card holders was never intended to be a permanent feature of the USC.\u00a0 Instead, it was planned to phase in the full USC charge for medical card holders via a transitional approach. This concession for medical card holders has been extended on a number of occasions most recently in Budget 2022, with an extension of the concession until 31 December 2022. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The USC has played a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer.\u00a0 USC receipts have been central to the current stability of the public finances since March 2020, despite the challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has one of the most progressive personal income tax systems in the world, which plays a crucial role in the process of income redistribution.

There have been many positive aspects to this experience for both employers and employees.  It has also highlighted certain challenges.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the Civil Service, remote working will be facilitated into the future on a blended basis.  In this context, my Department, in collaboration with Civil Service employers, Trade Unions and Staff Associations, has developed a Blended Working Policy Framework for Civil Service Organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The Framework focuses on the longer-term approach to remote working in the Civil Service and will assist in providing a consistent approach across the wider public service. The Framework supports commitments contained in a number of strategies which this Government has launched. These include, the National Remote Working Strategy, Our Rural Future, the Climate Action Plan and the National Planning Framework. <\/p>  <p>  I, along with Minister of State Smyth, published the Framework on 31 March.  The Framework provides broad strategic direction to individual organisations in the Civil Service to develop tailored policies on blended working that are appropriate to their business needs and employees. It is anticipated that Departments and Offices will have these policies completed as soon as possible but no later than end-Q2 2022. <\/p>  <p>  In developing their own policies, Civil Service Departments and Offices will have the flexibility to determine matters such as the proportion of time individual employees work remotely versus onsite and the roles that are suitable for blended working.<\/p>  <p>  Access to blended working by civil servants will be dependent on Departments\/Offices having the ability to meet the needs of the business.  In general, remote working will not be available to employees on a 100 percent basis, as some physical attendance at workplaces will be required to facilitate face-to-face meetings, training and other key events deemed necessary by the employer. Any requirements an employee may have for flexible working arrangements should be discussed directly with their employer.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also developed a Civil Service Mobility scheme which offers an opportunity for permanent Civil Service staff members to apply for mobility, within the Civil Service, through an open and transparent system.  The scheme was phased in, by grade, over a number of years and mobility opportunities are in place since mid-2021 for all general Civil Service grades.  The scheme is currently under further development to include the Professional and Technical grades. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100070#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff","counter":498,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100070#WRK01400"},{"type":"question","counter":499,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[27619\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100070#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the timeline for full pay restoration for public sector workers on low incomes.","asker":"1453","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":500,"content":"<p>The process of unwinding the Financial Emergency (FEMPI) legislation commenced under the Lansdowne Road Agreement 2016-2018, with the remainder of the process largely completed under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 (PSSA).

It should be noted that neither the bye-laws of the Phoenix Park, nor the Phoenix Park Act, reference a speed limit within the Park. <\/p>  <p>  On the specific issue of compliant signage, when the speed limit reduction was implemented all existing regulatory signage within the Park was updated.\u00a0 However, my officials have undertaken to review the regulatory signage to see if improvements could be made. The OPW continues to work closely with Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council on ensuring consistency of signage.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My officials continue to monitor the implementation of these changes throughout the Park. I understand that they are not aware of motorists travelling in the wrong direction on one way roads. Signage has been installed to prohibit motorcyclists on Military Road. This will continue to be monitored and signage will be adapted as required.<\/p>  <p>  Surface mounted counters were installed in the Phoenix Park in late December 2021 to monitor traffic in the Park until June 2022.\u00a0 The monitors count vehicular and cycle traffic while also recording vehicle speeds for the duration of the survey. As part of the project, interpretive data analysis is under review by engineers within the OPW. These counters are providing critical information to help manage visitors within the park. It will provide further data for the parking strategy for cars and cycles within the Park.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW is working with the National Transport Authority to provide much improved facilities for sustainable transport modes, such as cycling and connections to the wider public transport network. The design and plans for the 8km permanent one directional cycle lanes along both sides of Chesterfield Avenue, linking Castleknock to the city, are currently being advanced with the National Transport Authority &amp;amp; Dublin City Council.<\/p>  <p>  The changes made to date are significant and more improvements are planned over the coming months and years for all visitors. A parking strategy for cars and cycles is currently under development with a public survey due to open shortly. I would encourage all visitors to the park to engage with this survey.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100070#WRK03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":516,"content":"<p>Question No. 192 answered with Question No. 191.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":517,"content":"<p>Question No. 193 answered with Question No. 191.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":518,"content":"<p>Question No. 194 answered with Question No. 191.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":519,"content":"<p>Question No. 195 answered with Question No. 191.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":520,"content":"<p>Question No. 196 answered with Question No. 191.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":521,"content":"<p>Question No. 197 answered with Question No. 191.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100070#WRK03900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Consultations","counter":522,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100070#WRK03800"},{"type":"question","counter":523,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[27503\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100070#WRK03900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"to list the disability consultative groups and members of these groups that her Department engages with;

This includes supporting Tourism Ireland in its mission to grow tourism into the island of Ireland, to promote the recovery of the sector post-pandemic and to work with the Northern Ireland Executive on developing large scale North\/South tourism initiatives which will support the sustainable growth of the sector including cross-border walking and cycling trails as well as new marketing opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100071#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":545,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[27678\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100071#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the amount of funding that her Department allocated to the Tourism Ireland regional cooperative marketing fund in each of the years 2020, 2021 and to date in 2022; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1497","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":546,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, Tourism Ireland promotes regional air and sea access to Ireland in overseas tourism markets through initiatives like the Regional Cooperative Marketing Fund, which\u00a0seeks to encourage new access and maximise the potential of existing services to the regions, with matched funding from airlines, sea carriers, airports, ports and regional tourism stakeholders including Local Authorities.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Regional Cooperative Marketing Fund has been very important in enabling tactical partnerships that have helped drive increases in visitors to the regions, amplifying the Ireland message overseas and supporting direct access.

Since the programme commenced in 2013 over 75,000 homes have been retrofitted with a total exchequer spend of &euro;184 million under the scheme.<\/p><p>In response to the Programme for Government commitment, my Department launched a newly revised\u00a0ten year Energy Efficiency Programme in 2021 for local authority owned housing. This new programme set a BER performance requirement of &ldquo;B2&rdquo; or cost optimal level. The upscaling of the works included in the programme sees a substantial overall increase in funding being made available for insulation, windows and\u00a0doors and heating\u00a0upgrades, specifically\u00a0the installation of a Heat Pump and associated works. The installation of gas\/oil boilers are no longer supported under the energy efficiency programme funded by my Department.<\/p><p>An annualised breakdown of the total funding provided and the number of properties upgraded under the Energy Efficiency Retrofit programme for the years 2013-2021 is available on my Department's website at the following link:<\/p><p>My Department also introduced a pilot Midlands Energy Retrofit Programme in 2020-2022, the details of which are found below. A further 146 properties were retrofitted to a BER of B2\/ Cost Optimal Equivalent and these figures are in addition to the National Retrofit Programme.<\/p><p>The 2021 Energy Efficiency Retrofit Programme provided funding for the installation of 604 heat pumps, while the Midlands Retrofit Pilot allowed for the installation of heat pumps on all 146 properties. The funding available for the installation of a heat pump last year was &euro;13,000. This has been increased to &euro;16,000 for the 2022 programme.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, my Department announced that funding of &euro;85 million will be provided for the upgrade of approximately 2,400 social homes in 2022. Each local authority received an individual allocation along with a minimum target of homes they are required to retrofit. The programme has been devised in a way to\u00a0give local authorities\u00a0a level of flexibility when selecting properties\u00a0to retrofit ranging from those\u00a0requiring minor levels of works\u00a0to properties needing the maximum level of retrofitting\u00a0required to bring them to a B2\/cost Optimum standard. <\/p><p>Under the 2022 EERP programme, my Department funds costs of up to\u00a0&euro;48,850, plus project management fees, on individual local authority homes. The actual\u00a0cost of retrofitting works on each\u00a0home will depend on its pre-works\u00a0BER but can be as low as &euro;16,350 in some cases.\u00a0Targets\u00a0set and\u00a0funding allocated to local authorities under the new programme calls for local authorities to undertake retrofitting on a variety of house types, from those requiring minimal investment to those requiring major investment, in order to achieve the B2\/Cost Optimal BER. Local authorities are asked\u00a0to ensure that the average cost per home drawn down under the programme is circa\u00a0&euro;36,000, including project management fees.

However, within my own Department and by way of comparison, derelict site levy due nationally to local authorities in 2020 (the most recent year for which data is available) was &euro;5,448,642 of which &euro;378,763 was collected, indicating a national collection rate of just under 7%. In the case of the vacant site levy, the demands issued nationally in 2020 totalled &euro;21,429,540 of which &euro;1,976,090 was collected, indicating a collection rate of just over 9%.<\/p>  <p>  The foregoing data does not compare favourably with the data for the collection of commercial rates by local authorities, as collated by my Department, which for 2020 stood at 89%. However, where monies are owed under the derelict site levy, they become a charge on the land concerned under section 24 of the Derelict Sites Act 1990 (the Act) until they are paid.<\/p>  <p>  The Act imposes a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.<\/p>  <p>  Local authority powers include requiring owners or occupiers to take appropriate measures on derelict sites; acquiring derelict sites by agreement, or compulsorily; and applying a derelict sites levy on derelict sites. It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.<\/p>  <p>  The only circumstances under the Act where the derelict sites levy may be waived is on hardship grounds. The waiving of the derelict sites levy under section 26 of the Act is at the discretion of the local authority concerned. Section 23(6) of the Act further provides that a local authority may allow for payment of any levies due by instalments.<\/p>  <p>  Where land entered on a local authority derelict site register, or an interest in such land, is transferred from one person to another, such as on foot of being sold, both persons involved in the transaction are required under section 29 of the Act to notify the local authority concerned of the transfer within 4 weeks of the date of transfer. When a local authority is so notified, it shall cause the appropriate entry in the register to be amended. As outlined, the levy remains a charge on the land until it is paid and is payable by the registered owner. It is an offence not to comply with this requirement.<\/p>  <p>  I have not specifically met with local authority Chief Executives collectively regarding the operation of the derelict site levy but it has come up in individual engagements I have had with some of them. However, officials of my Department continue to liaise with local authorities on the implementation of the Act with a view to improving its effectiveness. In this regard, my Department initiated a review of the Act in November 2021 and has sought initial submissions from local authorities on potential improvements to the legislative provisions and the way they are applied. My Department is now in the process of establishing a focused working group to speedily progress this matter further and has been in contact with the Local Government Management Agency in relation to the nomination of relevant local authority officials to participate in this review. It would be premature to speculate on possible legislative changes and improvements in the levy collection mechanisms in advance of the completion of this review.<\/p>  <p>  There is currently no proposal to replace the derelict site levy with a tax. However, action 15.2 of Housing for All commits to the introduction of a new tax to activate vacant land for residential purposes, to replace the current Vacant Site Levy. In this connection, the new Residential Zoned Land Tax was introduced by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Act 2021. The purpose of the proposed measure is to incentivise the activation of land which is zoned and serviced for residential development, but remains undeveloped, thereby assisting in increasing housing output, rather than to raise revenue.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance is also giving consideration to a vacant property tax and is assessing the current Local Property Tax returns to ascertain the present vacancy situation. Once collated and analysed, this will provide a new data set on vacant homes.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage proactively with local authorities to ensure that all derelict site levies due are paid and that the measure can achieve its full potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100073#WRN01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"question","counter":662,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[27452\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100073#WRN01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of sites on each derelict sites register by local authority in tabular form.","asker":"1453","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":663,"content":"<p>Local Authorities are required to submit an annual return to my Department providing information on the operation of the Derelict Sites Act 1990 in their functional areas.

This is due to a combination of the increased cost of regulatory compliance, general increases in labour and material costs, and increases in energy costs. The CSO Wholesale Price Index (WPI) shows the annual increase for building and construction materials to be 18.2% to the end of April 2022.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to diligently monitor this trend, and has implemented extensive mitigation measures under its own its own remit, whilst also collaborating expansively with other Government Departments and Agencies in addressing the increasing cost issue <\/p>  <p>  Given the importance of technology to the maximisation of construction efficiencies, and accordingly, cost-reduction, the Government is enhancing the role of the new Construction Technology Centre (CTC) which is under development by Enterprise Ireland. The CTC&rsquo;s role will be enhanced beyond the standard remit of Technology Centres in general for its first three years of operation in order to prioritise residential construction. It will incorporate:<\/p>  <p>- Structures to enable innovation in residential construction;<\/p>  <p>- A proactive role in strengthening the residential construction value chain;<\/p>  <p>- Promotion, development and support for innovation \/ modern methods of construction (MMCs) using digital and manufacturing technology;<\/p>  <p>- Support for SMEs to develop scale and to adopt MMCs and Building Innovation Modelling (BIM) techniques; and<\/p>  <p>- Support for digitisation in the manufacturing sector for residential construction.<\/p>  <p>  This will be complemented by an increased focus for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform-led Construction Sector Group (CSG) on the residential construction sector. This will include the introduction and full implementation of a pipeline of cost reducing innovations and productivity measures, in line with its established remit to improve productivity and efficiency, and to control price inflation.<\/p>  <p>  To further support innovation the development of MMC will be broadened, and will include the establishment of a national Centre of Excellence Demonstration Park for MMC.  Construction industry representatives have expressed robust support for these measures, and collaboration between stakeholders will be overseen by the Department of Enterprise, Trade\u00a0and Employment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also in the process of preparing a study to carry out an analysis for each component of cost of construction (including cost of compliance) of house and apartment development, with a view to reducing cost and increasing standardisation. It will also identify opportunities for cost reduction for consideration by relevant Government departments and industry. It is proposed that this study will also include workshops to engage with industry on construction costs.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, in January 2022, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP)\u00a0introduced the following interim measures to address the impact that the recent price increases in construction materials is having on public works tenders:<\/p>  <p>- Reduced fixed price period duration to 24 months (previously 30 months minimum).<\/p>  <p>- Permit mutual cost recovery within the fixed price period for material price changes in excess of 15% (previously 50%).<\/p>  <p>- Introduction of a new mechanism to address the period between tender submission and award through limited indexation of the tender price.<\/p>  <p>  The above measures related to new Public Works Contracts going forward (contracts with a version date earlier than 7 January 2022).  More recently, in the interest of safeguarding public projects that are already under construction and to mitigate the risks of significant losses being sustained by contractors, the OGP has introduced an &lsquo;Inflation\/Supply Chain Delay Co-operation Framework&rsquo; for parties engaged under a public works contract. This framework will operate on an ex-gratia basis and includes measures to:<\/p>  <p>- address delay to the Substantial Completion of the Works, or a Section of the Works, that has occurred since 1 January 2022 where the delay is caused by supply      chain disruption; <\/p>  <p>- address recent inflation in the prices of fuel and energy; <\/p>  <p>- address inflation in materials, from 1 January 2022 onwards for those Public Works contracts with a version date earlier than 7 January 2022; and<\/p>  <p>- proactively, and collaboratively, manage the on-going impact of these external factors insofar as is possible within the project&rsquo;s original delivery parameters.<\/p>  <p>  My Department meets with the Construction Sector Group on a quarterly basis and the Construction Sector Group Digital and Innovation sub group on a monthly basis to ensure regular and open dialogue between government and industry on how best to achieve and maintain a sustainable and innovative construction sector positioned to successfully deliver on the commitments in Project Ireland 2040.  My Department also meets regularly with Industry Representative bodies and participates in Industry conferences met where increases in building and fuel costs and their impact on the delivery of housing is discussed.  My Department has both enacted and collaborated in a host of cost saving measures to facilitate both the necessary growth in and the speeding up of residential construction, and engagement with the construction industry has been and remains central to this.

The interviews have concluded and TCOs recruited from this competition are being assigned on a weekly basis. The first group began work on Monday, 23 May. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers at the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0to over 900 which represents double the number of staff with the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0in June of last year.<\/p>  <p>  Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff has been underway for several months to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0continues to implement further measures to deal with increased demand on its services:<\/p>  <p>  - The\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0has a comprehensive plan to ensure that adequate staff, accommodation and technology supports are in place to meet expected demand for passports\u00a0in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  - The\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0has released video tutorials with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos will be shared on social media and will include instructions on submitting consent forms for child applications properly.<\/p>  <p>  - The\u00a0Passport Service is prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time.\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0staff are working targeted overtime in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  - The Urgent Appointment Service is available for customers who wish to renew their passport\u00a0at short notice. Customers availing of this service can renew their passport within 1 or 4 days in Dublin, within 4 days in Cork and within 5 days in London.<\/p>  <p>  - A new document management system was put in place at the beginning of March. This aims to improve the processing speed in the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0offices, and subsequent turnaround times for the applicant. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are being prioritised and complete applications can then be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants.<\/p>  <p>  - Public information media campaigns reminding citizens to check and renew their passports\u00a0will continue during this busy year.<\/p>  <p>  - There is an updated Department of Foreign Affairs website, which includes a new\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022 and will assist the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.<\/p>  <p>  I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports\u00a0before booking travel and to apply for their passports\u00a0online in plenty of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100075#WRP02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":820,"content":"<p>Question No. 295 answered with Question No. 294.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Relations","counter":821,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100075#WRP02800"},{"type":"question","counter":822,"qnumday":296,"qnumall":"[27466\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100075#WRP02900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will meet the ambassador from India to express the Government&rsquo;s outrage at recent and escalating calls by members and supporters of President Modi&rsquo;s party in Haridwar and Delhi for the large-scale elimination of Muslims (details supplied); if he will use Ireland&rsquo;s position on the United Nations Security Council to call for international sanctions against the Modi regime for encouraging such calls; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":823,"content":"<p>Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur or who the victims are.  <\/p>  <p>  The promotion of freedom of religion or belief is a priority for Ireland&rsquo;s human rights engagement at both multilateral and bilateral levels, as reaffirmed in &lsquo;The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World&rsquo;.

I have spoken out clearly on this issue, including at the D&aacute;il debate on journalists in conflict on 24 May.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I also condemn unreservedly the policing of the funeral in Jerusalem. The use of force against mourners by the Jerusalem police was wholly unacceptable and attracted widespread and fully justified condemnation.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been proactive in ensuring that these issues are highlighted internationally, including at the UN Security Council. On 24 May, Ireland organised an Arria formula meeting at the Security Council on the protection of journalists. At the most recent Security Council meeting on 26 May on the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, Ireland again called for a swift and independent investigation into Ms Abu Akleh&rsquo;s killing. Ireland reiterated this call in a joint media statement following the meeting along with France, Albania, and Estonia.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has condemned recent civilian deaths in the occupied Palestinian territory, and called on Israel to address disproportionate security responses, including those seen in Jerusalem, Jenin and elsewhere. Ireland has also stressed the importance of protecting the status quo of the Holy Sites in Jerusalem, and our full respect for Jordan&rsquo;s custodial role.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the EU, on 11 May the EU condemned Ms Abu Akleh&rsquo;s killing, calling for a thorough and independent investigation. The EU expressed solidarity with journalists and emphasised the importance of supporting their fundamental work, in particular while covering conflicts. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of sanctions against Israel, Ireland does not have any unilateral sanctions regimes, but implements EU sanctions, adopted as part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and UN sanctions. There are currently no EU or UN sanctions in place against Israel and there is not a consensus either at the level of the EU, or the UN Security Council, on the introduction of sanctions against Israel.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs the overall human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territory remains a key priority for me. Ireland will continue to seize every opportunity to stress the need for respect for human rights and full accountability.

million passports have been issued so far this year. Last year, 634,000 passports were issued in the whole year. In less than five months, the Passport Service has issued over 80% of the total number of passports that were issued in the whole of last year.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is already out-performing any previous year, despite the challenges that it has encountered over the past two years. In 2019, which was the busiest year for passports pre-Covid, the Passport Service had issued 445,000 passports by the third week of May. In the same time period this year, over 520,000 passports have been issued.<\/p><p>99% of all child and adult online renewal applications are issued within the standard turnaround time and almost half of all adults who renew their passports online will receive their new passport in the post within 2 working days. This compares very favourably with passport services internationally.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is experiencing a very high volume of applications and is currently processing over 25,000 applications per week.\u00a0 While the numbers of applications in the system is high, there is a continuous stream of new applications coming in and a dispatch of completed passports being sent out every day.<\/p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Passport Service have been proactively planning for this significant increase in demand for many months and have made an unprecedented investment in the staffing and resources necessary to meet this demand.<\/p><p>Since March, processing times for first time applications have already been reduced by 25% and applications now take 30 working days rather than 40 days. From Monday, 6 June, it is hoped that, based on current trends, this processing time will decrease yet again to 25 working days for first time applications. That means that, in the space of three months, processing time for first-time applications will have been reduced by almost 40% as a direct result of the substantial level of investment that the Department has made in the Passport Service.<\/p><p>The Passport Service\u00a0has been scaling up resources to deal with anticipated demand since June of last year. A major recruitment drive, in partnership with the Public Appointments Service, has been underway over the past several months. This has seen the number of Passport Service\u00a0staff increase by 344 since June 2021.<\/p><p>In addition, the Passport Service has run its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs). The interviews have concluded and TCOs recruited from this competition are being assigned on a weekly basis. The first group began work on Monday, 23 May. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers at the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0to over 900 which represents double the number of staff with the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0in June of last year.<\/p><p>Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff has been underway for several months to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.<\/p><p>I am confident that the additional staff assigned to the Passport Service will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022 and will assist in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.<\/p><p>The staffing numbers within the Passport Service fluctuate throughout the year depending on the level of demand.

First time applications are necessarily complex to process, since, in many cases, they are applications\u00a0for Irish citizenship. The\u00a0Passport Service must validate the identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport.\u00a0Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of\u00a0first time passport applications\u00a0for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff,\u00a0first time applications take 30 working days to process.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service makes every effort to provide clear and comprehensive instructions for applicants, using plain English. In 2019, the Passport Service won the National Adult Literary Agency (NALA) award for Plain English for the Passport Online Renewal service.<\/p>  <p>  There are several resources currently available to applicants and parents of first-time applicants in order to ensure that their application is submitted correctly.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service encourages\u00a0applicants to check the requirements for their type of application carefully on my Department's website. The recently updated website includes a new\u00a0Passport Service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Passport Service has also released public education materials in the form of video tutorials with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos are available on the Department's website and Youtube page and are being shared on social media. They include instructions on submitting photos and consent forms for child applications\u00a0correctly. The videos can be found here:\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0www.dfa.ie\/passports\/photo-guidelines\/<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0www.dfa.ie\/passports\/consent-for-children\/\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service Customer Service Hub is available to respond to customer queries by phone and webchat. The Customer Service Hub handled over 100,000 queries to date this year and is currently handling over 6,000 customer contacts each week. During times of high demand, there can be delays in getting through to a service agent due to the high volumes of enquiries. The Passport Service webchat is also operational and customers should refresh the page if the icon is grey. A webchat operator is available when the icon is green.<\/p>  <p>  The Customer Service Hub will be the initial priority for allocation of new staff from the recent Temporary Clerical Officer competition ran by the Passport Service. The first group of officers from this competition started on Monday, 23 May. Officers will continue to be assigned over the coming weeks with the aim of increasing staff at the Passport Service to over 900. This represents a doubling of staff numbers since June 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing unprecedented demand for passports.\u00a0 For resource and other operational reasons it would not be feasible to open outreach clinics in each county.

This funding was allocated to 102 DEIS primary schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020\/21 school year.\u00a0 This funding continued for the 2021\/22 school year. <\/p>  <p>  The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents. It will continue to run for the 2021\/22 school year and its effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation. It is my intention to complete this process as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I recently announced the expansion of the DEIS programme benefitting 347 schools - 310 schools will be included in DEIS for the first time and 37 existing DEIS primary schools are being reclassified and will be eligible for increased supports. Schools in the DEIS programme are provided with additional financial support by way of a DEIS grant and an enhanced school book grant rate.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I also understand the need for improved capitation funding to schools for running costs and I am pleased that Budgets 2020 and 2019 provided for increases in standard capitation funding for primary schools.\u00a0 It is my intention to seek funding for further capitation increases in future budgets.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, in recognition\u00a0of the pressures facing families,\u00a0the Government this year has reduced the cost of the school transport scheme for families for the coming school year. The cap of school transport fees that currently stands at &euro;220 per family at primary level and &euro;650 per family at post primary level will be reduced to &euro;150 per family at primary level and &euro;500 per family at post primary level. Furthermore all examination fees have been waived. <\/p>  <p>  Voluntary contributions by parents of pupils enrolled in recognised schools are permissible\u00a0only where\u00a0it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no\u00a0requirement\u00a0to pay. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government 2020 contains a commitment to enacting the Student and Parent Charter Bill 2019. The overall aim of this legislation is to foster a\u00a0more inclusive culture in all schools by improving the level of engagement between the school communities. The Bill will enable the whole school community to be better informed about matters relating to their school including school costs, plans and policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100079#WRT05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":988,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100079#WRT05800"},{"type":"question","counter":989,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[27379\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100079#WRT05900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her Department is working with the National Council for Special Education to identify children with additional needs but who have had incomplete assessments or who are on longer than average waiting lists within the HSE for assessments to ensure that their needs are met for enrolment in September 2022; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":990,"content":"<p>The Assessment of Need (AON) process is provided for under the Disability Act 2005.

In 2021 nearly 38,000 children availed of the summer programme, an increase of 60% from the previous year.<\/p>  <p>  A key objective of this year&rsquo;s scheme is to increase the number of schools offering the summer programme to their students. Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to ease administrative requirements. This year there is provision to recruit newly qualified teachers graduating this summer as well as undergraduate student teachers who have registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5.<\/p>  <p>  To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 Summer Programme allows principals to delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. The Overseer and preparation roles provide an exciting personal opportunity for teachers to develop their leadership skills and experience with recognition at a whole-school level.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced measures have been put in place to encourage participation of schools. These include:<\/p>  <p>  -  A Centralised Application Process to reduce the administrative burden on schools.<\/p>  <p>  -  Provision of funding to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes.<\/p>  <p>  -  Provision to recruit final year student teachers graduating this summer and Route 5 undergraduate student teachers.<\/p>  <p>  -  Guidance, information and support provided to schools to help design and deliver the programmes.<\/p>  <p>  -  Capitation Grant Funding provided to cover the running costs of the scheme, including enhanced capitation for special schools and classes.<\/p>  <p>  This year, for the first time, there will be an online claims system for schools to submit payments details for those staff taking part in the school based summer programme. This will provide for faster and more streamlined payments to staff.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, with the assistance of the National Association of Management Boards in Special Schools (NAMBSE), the Department and Inspectorate recently hosted a webinar for Special Schools and provided a presentation on the supports and benefits of running a school based summer programme. The presentation focused on the positive outcomes for students that participated in the 2021 programme.<\/p>  <p>  An online registration portal is currently open for schools to register their participation in this year&rsquo;s programme with a closing date June 9th. Numbers of those who have registered for the Summer Programme are not yet available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100080#WRU04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Meetings","counter":1038,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100080#WRU04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1039,"qnumday":400,"qnumall":"[27736\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100080#WRU04900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a request for a consultation meeting has been received from a school (details supplied); if so, when this meeting will be scheduled; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1595","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1040,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy, that my Department is in receipt of correspondence from the school in question concerning a possible amalgamation with another school.<\/p>  <p>  The decision making authority for\u00a0any amalgamation is the\u00a0Patron of\u00a0the schools concerned and\u00a0this is subject to\u00a0the approval of my Department.

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area. <\/p>  <p>  The Department additionally consults with school patron bodies in order to identify areas with pressures on enrolments.<\/p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through:<\/p>  <p>  -  Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  -  Extending the  capacity of a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  -  Provision of a new school or schools.<\/p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required. The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage as well as language of instruction, i.e. Irish or English, of new schools. Parental preferences, as well as other considerations such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area (including Irish-medium provision), are key to the decision-making process and to whether at post-primary level a school would take the form of an Irish-medium Gaelchol&aacute;iste or whether, if English-medium, the school would include an Irish-medium unit or &ldquo;Aonad&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Most new post-primary schools must have a student enrolment capacity of 600 &ndash; 1,000 students.  A lower threshold of 400 students may apply to Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;, having regard to the alternative of establishing an Aonad within a school.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the area referred to by the Deputy, the year of establishment, patronage model and language of instruction have yet to be determined for the new post-primary schools announced to serve the following school planning areas in the general South Dublin area: Dublin 2_Dublin 4 and Sallynoggin_Killiney_DLR\/Cherrywood.<\/p>  <p>  While it is expected that the existing Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; in the general South Dublin area between them have sufficient school places to accommodate the level of demand identified as part of the recent patronage processes in the short term, given the number of new gaelscoileanna which have opened in recent years or are planned to open in this area, my Department is keeping the position under active review as these schools grow and the number of sixth class pupils in gaelscoileanna increases.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to school admissions, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998 and the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in that area.   Nonetheless, where a school is oversubscribed some pupils may not obtain a place in the school.<\/p>  <p>  The Act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied, post-primary schools can give a priority to a gaelscoil\/gaelscoilleanna as a selection criterion, and this is permitted under the act, schools can apply this as a criterion should they wish to do so.  The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves.<\/p>  <p>  There is an additional provision in the Act that allows Irish-medium schools, where it is their policy to do so, to include in their admission policy a priority for the admission of a student who has attained a reasonable age appropriate level of oral fluency in the Irish language and where that student&rsquo;s fluency would be at risk of regressing if the student was not admitted to an Irish medium school. This provision recognises the difficulties that applicants may experience in accessing schools that provide an education though the medium of Irish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100082#WRW03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1137,"content":"<p>Question No. 434 answered with Question No. 433.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":1138,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100082#WRW03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1139,"qnumday":435,"qnumall":"[28122\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100082#WRW03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if school transport can be provided to a school (details supplied) for ten children in various townlands in the vicinity; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1140,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.

Since 2011, the number of special classes has increased by 386%. Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 to 2,148 for the 2021\/2022 school year. <\/p><p>Provision has been made for 19,169 SNAs by the end of 2022, which will represent an increase of 81% since 2011. <\/p><p>My Department and the NCSE are working closely to maximise the number of new special classes that can be established in Dublin for the start of 2022\/23 school year. <\/p><p>As an interim measure and to provide additional educational supports to those children awaiting a special class placement the Department of Education is considering a draft proposal to open a number of temporary special education centres in Dublin across strategic locations in close co-operation with the Education and Training Boards in Dublin (City of Dublin ETB and Dublin Dun Laoghaire ETB). <\/p><p>This draft proposal is very much a temporary option for those children who are awaiting a placement in a special class in a mainstream school. It is envisaged that this draft proposal, which would be voluntary for parents\/guardians and children could present a more suitable option than Home Tuition for some children as they await a special class placement. Many of these families are having difficulties in securing a tutor for this work. Families would now have access to an alternative to Home Tuition providing them with  <\/p><p>- Access to fully qualified teachers removing the burden of sourcing an appropriately qualified home tutor<\/p><p>- An opportunity for their child(ren) to interact with their peers and access education in a school\/classroom environment which is &lsquo;out-of-home&rsquo;<\/p><p>- Integration opportunities, where possible, on a case by case basis. <\/p><p>It is envisaged that these centres would follow the standard school day and school year. It is intended that the Centres will be located to facilitate engagement with local schools with a view to optimising integration opportunities for children in local schools. Integration and transition arrangements for local schools and the SEN Centres will be developed by the NCSE in conjunction with the Inspectorate and NEPs.

Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.\u00a0 Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2022 is\u00a0estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the main scheme by which the Department provides income support to carers in the community.\u00a0 Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means tested social assistance payment awarded to those carers who are caring for certain people who require full-time care and attention.\u00a0 The means test is used to target the support to those most in need.<\/p>  <p>  The primary objective of the payment is to provide an income support to carers whose earning capacity is substantially reduced as a consequence of their caring responsibilities and in so doing to support the ongoing care of the person in respect of whom care is being provided.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Carer's Benefit payment is an entitlement based on social insurance contributions.\u00a0 Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is a payment made to insured people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person(s) in need of full-time care.\u00a0 It is payable for a period of 2 years (104 weeks) for each care recipient and may be claimed over separate periods up to a total of 2 years (104 weeks). <\/p>  <p>  A primary qualifying condition for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit payments is that the applicant provides full-time care and attention to a person in need of such care.\u00a0 The person being cared for\u00a0must be so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention and be likely to require this full-time care and attention for at least 12 months.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The provision of full-time care and attention requirement is moderated somewhat by allowing a carer to work or engage in education or training for up to 18.5 hours.\u00a0 Budget 2020 changed the rules so that those in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant could increase the number of hours they work, study or attend a training course from 15 to 18.5 hours.\u00a0 This measure was prioritised in response to the carers who expressed that they found 15 hours to be too restrictive, not only for work but for education and training purposes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There are currently two separate Benefit of Work Estimators available on Gov.ie which aim to show Department customers how starting work or increasing work hours could affect their payments.\u00a0 One is for those in receipt of jobseeker and one parent family payments, while the other is for those in receipt of disability or illness payments.\u00a0 The latter was created as a result of a Make Work Pay Report Recommendation in relation to people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion would involve creating a new Benefit of Work Estimator specifically for those in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit.\u00a0 The creation of a new estimator for this cohort would need to be considered by my Department in the context of a range of factors such as IT resources, development costs and potential usage. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the current income disregard and means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system.\u00a0 The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple. <\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I announced measures which will allow carers to have a higher weekly household income, as well as a higher level of savings, and still qualify for a Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payment, as follows:<\/p>  <p>  -  From June, the income disregarded in the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will increase\u00a0to\u00a0&euro;350 for a single person, and to &euro;750 for a couple. <\/p>  <p>  -  In addition, the amount of capital disregarded in the means test will be increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to keep the range of income supports provided to family carers by this Department under review and will ensure that consultations with carer&rsquo;s representative groups continue so that the overall objectives of the carer income support schemes provided are met. <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, my officials\u00a0will examine the merits of the proposal outlined by the Deputy. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the

of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19.<\/p><p>Enhanced Illness Benefit is a temporary measure that has been extended until the end of June.\u00a0

the Appeals Office.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme is the safety net within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents.\u00a0 Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment, a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, as well as single exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs).\u00a0 Applications made under the SWA Scheme are administered by

Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 i.e. Basic SWA and all Supplements, can be appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office under Section 311 of that Act and this has not changed.\u00a0 Appeals from customers who are dissatisfied with the decision on their application are reviewed by the Designated Person to assess if new information has been made available and, where the decision on the

201 and 202 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, namely ENPs and UNPs are not appelable to the Appeals Office but can be reviewed by a SWA Reviewing Officer under Section 323 of that Act.\u00a0 In order to make this process more accessible for customers, they may now send their request for a review to a PO Box in the Department using a FREEPOST service.\u00a0 The request for the review of the Designated Person&rsquo;s decision is then sent to an independent SWA Reviewing Officer to objectively review all of the information provided by the customer and assess the decision made by the Designated Person.\u00a0 The only change to this process has been the provision of a FREEPOST PO Box service for the customer. <\/p>  <p>  The Department's National Processing Team (NPT) now process all new claims for jobseekers payments and one parent family payment.\u00a0 If a customer appeals a decision in relation to one of these schemes their appeal is registered by the Appeals

of 55% in Fuel Allowance support provided during this fuel allowance season compared to last season.\u00a0 A recipient household which would have received &euro;735 in fuel season 2020\/2021 would see an increase of &euro;404 to &euro;1,139 in fuel allowance payments in fuel season 2021\/2022. \u00a0When taken in conjunction with the electricity costs emergency benefit payment, paid in April, this

In general, staffing pressures in the sector are caused not by insufficient supply of qualified personnel, but by high levels of staff turnover. Recruitment and staff retention difficulties are undoubtedly linked to poor terms and conditions, with for example the average pay for non-managerial staff being &euro;12.60 per hour in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting providers to respond to current challenges. In designing responses, however, it is important that any measures considered are proportionate to the problem they seek to address and that wider impacts are carefully considered. In that regard, it is important to stress that the minimum qualification requirement to work directly with children in an early learning care service was introduced in 2016 in order to improve the quality of provision and to achieve better outcomes for children.<\/p>  <p>  To remove this minimum qualification requirement could be contrary to the best interests of children and the vision for the sector that is outlined in\u00a0First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy to improve the lives of babies, young children and their families. Such a move could be a significant backwards step in efforts to improve quality outcomes for children and could only be considered if there were a very strong evidence base requiring a change.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals who wish to work directly with children in a pre-school service must hold at least a major award in Early Childhood Care and Education at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), or a qualification deemed equivalent. My Department has published a list of qualifications that meet this regulatory requirement. If an individual's qualification does not appear on the list they may apply to my Department for assessment of equivalence of their qualification.<\/p>  <p>  In addressing issues of staff recruitment and retention, improving pay and conditions for those working in the early learning and childcare sector is a key priority. The Programme for Government committed to supporting the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee (JLC) in the sector and the drawing up of an Employment Regulation Order. I initiated a pre-JLC process in December 2020 and I was happy to see this result in a JLC for Early Years Services being established last year.<\/p>  <p>  The JLC is continuing to meet. The new Core Funding scheme, which commences this autumn, will, among other objectives, support early learning and childcare providers to meet the requirements of any Employment Regulation Orders that result from the work of the JLC. The precise implications of Core Funding for staff terms and conditions depends on the agreement by the JLC. However, I believe that the level of funding provided is significant enough to achieve a substantial improvement in levels of staff pay and the development of career frameworks which are fundamental to improving quality in the sector and supporting the retention and progression of staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100085#WRZ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":1312,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100085#WRZ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1313,"qnumday":493,"qnumall":"[27353\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100085#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if the new funding model for early year services will build in recognition of those offering childcare in disadvantaged settings; if it will include a DEIS-style mechanism for childcare settings where there are added needs and in which additional resources may be required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1698","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1314,"content":"<p>Partnership for the Public Good, A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC) - the report of an independently chaired Expert Group - was adopted in full by Government last December.<\/p>  <p>  Amongst other things, this sets out a new approach to State funding of the ELC and SAC sector that includes universal and targeted Tackling Disadvantage funding and support, building on Core Funding.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A number of research inputs contributed to this work including a paper on &ldquo;Approaches to Identifying Children or Settings in Need of Additional Support&rdquo; and another on &ldquo;Funding Models Addressing Early Childhood Disadvantage&rdquo;.

In the fourteen months since its publication my department has placed a significant focus on delivering the new model of accommodation and supports for International Protection applicants. The progress made has included:<\/p><p>-  Establishment of a dedicated transition team to drive implementation of the programme. This team currently has a staffing level of seven people. <\/p><p>-  Development of a detailed implementation plan including inputs from other key stakeholders who have a responsibility for delivering services to International Protection applicants. <\/p><p>-  Governance structures established to oversee transition to the new model in the form of a Programme Board and an External Advisory Committee. The membership of the Programme Board includes a representative with lived experience of International Protection and representatives of non-governmental organisations. The Board has met regularly over the past twelve months to review progress. The board most recently met on the 28<sup>th<\/sup>April and are due to meet again on the 16<sup>th<\/sup>June. As part of the Programme Board governance framework it has appointed a Risk Committee to oversee the management of risks. <\/p><p>-  Significant progress has been made on putting in place the new accommodation model.\u00a0 This work has involved working very closely with the Housing Agency in the development of detailed policy advice papers including an acquisition policy, an ownership model and a funding model. Proposals in relation to the ownership model were brought to the Programme Board in November and approved by myself in January 2022. Work is also ongoing to develop a funding model for Approved Housing Bodies to support them in building a pipeline of Phase Two accommodation. The funding model will be launched in the coming months. <\/p><p>-  The County and City Management Association has developed and approved a Local Authority allocation key. The key allows for a distribution of applicants across the country according to population criteria.\u00a0 DCEDIY and the Housing Agency are using the allocation key to identify suitable properties for purchase for Phase Two accommodation. <\/p><p>-  The Housing Agency has proceeded to source a range of properties for Phase Two accommodation and has acquired an initial number to date. Work to source and acquire properties will continue for the remainder of 2022.<\/p><p>-  Work is also moving ahead on\u00a0developing\u00a0the system of income support that applicants will receive\u00a0when moving into Phase Two accommodation. A policy paper has been developed and work is now proceeding to design the operational structures for the payment. <\/p><p>-  The Transition Team is also developing an integration programme to support the principle of &lsquo;integration from day one&rsquo; as set out\u00a0in the White Paper. In collaboration with the Local Authorities there has been a focus on designing the supports that will be required at a local level. The proposal is to expand the current model of interagency working groups and resettlement and intercultural workers that is in place for the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.\u00a0 The aim is to establish a permanent integration system at local level that will provide support both to programme refugees and to applicants for international protection. Work is being finalised to determine the respective roles of Local Authorities and NGOs in delivering the new integration model;<\/p><p>-  Work is ongoing to launch an integration fund in the coming months which will fund civil society organisations to support the integration of International Protection applicants;<\/p><p>-  A number of stakeholders meetings were held in the early part of 2022 including a briefing of the NGO sector which I was delighted to attend. Over 30 organisations were in attendance and were provided with a comprehensive update on how the implementation of the White Paper is progressing. Further briefings with the NGO sector will be held periodically.<\/p><p>-  Development of a Communication strategy including in February 2022 the launch of a dedicated webpage where all members of the Public can find updates on the progress being made in implementing the White Paper. Work will continue in 2022 to develop further, other avenues to ensure communities are fully briefed on implementation of the White Paper.<\/p><p>As deputies will appreciate the war in Ukraine has had an unavoidable impact on timelines for implementation of the White Paper, as staff in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth were temporarily diverted to fulfill Ireland&rsquo;s obligations. Upwards of 33,000 Ukrainian refugees have come to Ireland under the Temporary Protection Directive, and over 23,000 have been accommodated by the State. <\/p><p>Over the coming weeks a review will be undertaken to assess the full impact of the Ukraine crisis.\u00a0 However, it is \u00a0currently planned that the transition team will move ahead to operationalise parts of the new system in late 2022. The implementation of the new model is and\u00a0will continue to be a key priority for my department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100086#WRAA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency","counter":1357,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100086#WRAA01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1358,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[27699\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100086#WRAA01600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of cases that are currently open with Tulsa and in need of a social worker; the ratio of open cases to social worker; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1449","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1359,"content":"<p>Statutory and operational responsibility for the delivery of child protection and welfare services is a matter for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.\u00a0The Deputy is seeking\u00a0information\u00a0in relation to\u00a0case numbers and social workers\u00a0which is\u00a0an operational matter for Tusla.

This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during the lifetime of the NDP as follows:<\/p>  <p>  (1) Modernisation: Much of the existing early learning and childcare infrastructure that was previously delivered by large scale capital programmes is now in need of upgrading and modernisation in order to be fully compliant with new regulations and more recent guidelines, as well as to maximise energy efficiency.

The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0(3) First 5 Initiatives: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.

As the Deputy may be aware, I announced a number of changes to the Scheme as part of Budget 2022. These changes will be of significant benefit to many parents. <\/p>  <p>  For instance, from 2 May, the NCS no longer deducts hours spent in pre-school, or school, from NCS awards. This means that parents may use their full awarded subsidised NCS hours &ndash; benefitting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families. <\/p>  <p>  In September 2022, the NCS Universal subsidy will be extended to all children under 15 years of age.\u00a0 This is worth 50 cents per hour, or over &euro;1,100 per annum for\u00a0children in full time early learning and care.\u00a0 The extension of the universal subsidy will\u00a0benefit up to 40,000 children. <\/p>  <p>  Both of these changes will result in more parents getting additional subsidised hours for early learning and childcare in Tusla registered services. <\/p>  <p>  Total funding under the NCS in 2022\u00a0is estimated to be\u00a0&euro;200 million.\u00a0 The NCS is demand lead so the total level of subsidy is dependent on the number of applications from parents, and the level of subsidy they are awarded. <\/p>  <p>  Funding for the NCS will increase over the coming three years, to\u00a0improve the affordability of childcare for parents.\u00a0\u00a0The amounts\u00a0of NCS funding for\u00a0each year will be set in the\u00a0relevant Budgets.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these improvements to the NCS, a core funding stream is being introduced in September 2022. The intention of this funding is to support providers to cover increased operating costs linked to quality improvement measures. A condition of this funding is that providers will not increase parents&rsquo; fees for early learning and childcare from September 2021 levels.\u00a0 This will ensure that parents can fully\u00a0benefit from\u00a0NCS subsidies.\u00a0Furthermore, to participate in core funding, providers will be required to offer the NCS and\/or the ECCE programme to all eligible children\/parents.\u00a0 This will ensure that more families can access NCS subsidies.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is not possible to calculate a percentage reduction in costs that the scheme will yield for parents over the next three years, as\u00a0subsidies awarded under the NCS will vary depending on the application type chosen, and a family&rsquo;s individual circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Subsidies under the NCS are awarded as an hourly rate, along with a maximum number of hours for which that rate is payable. The rate a family receives will vary depending on their level of family income, child&rsquo;s age and educational status, and the number of children in the family.\u00a0 Early learning and childcare providers set their own fees, and that the amount of childcare required will vary depending on individual family needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100086#WRAA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":1366,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100086#WRAA02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1367,"qnumday":512,"qnumall":"[27914\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100086#WRAA02500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the engagement that has taken place between a development company and his Department and or IPAS on an issue (details supplied); if agencies such as the HSE and the Department of Education have been consulted to ensure that local supports and service provision will be put in place to support such an initiative; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1368,"content":"<p>My Department is focused on providing short term accommodation to people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine.

The Commission carried out cartographic and landscape assessments of possible unrecorded burial arrangements and also followed up with people on responses to its appeal seeking information about burials in Bessborough. As no evidence of locations was found, the Commission did not consider it feasible to excavate the full available site, which amounts to 60 acres.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to a period which predates the\u00a0publication of the Commission's report\u00a0and its conclusions on the Bessborough site.

The 'freezing' of fees at or below September 2021 levels is the first step in this process.\u00a0 The fee management system will be developed further in future years. Further information on proposed fee management mechanisms in the longer term is available in the Group's report, 'Partnership for the Public Good', which was published in December 2021.<\/p><p>Core Funding will be funding directly to providers and is designed improve affordability, quality, inclusion and sustainability.

A Ready Reckoner has also been launched to assist providers in estimating the potential value of Core Funding for their individual service, as well as to test different scenarios. The provider contract for Core Funding will be published in June so applicants can review what they will later be asked to sign in August.

Should a student choose to depart a course of study during the academic year they may be entitled to a refund or partial refund of fees paid depending on the fee policy of the institution they were attending.<\/p>  <p>  For Undergraduate students, under my Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative (FFI), the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate higher education students with students paying the student contribution. <\/p>  <p>  A key principle of the scheme is to support students in progressing through a chosen course of study from year to year. To satisfy the terms and conditions of the FFI in relation to progression, a student must be moving from year to year within a course having successfully completed the previous year or, having successfully completed a course, is progressing to another related course where the award for the subsequent course is of a higher level than the previous course.<\/p>  <p>  Typically students are not supported for a repeat period of study or for a different course at the same level under the FFI, however in exceptional circumstances such as ill health an exception may be allowed. The objective of this policy is to help as many students as possible to obtain one qualification at each level of study. However, once an equivalent period of study has been completed on the new course, the student may be eligible for free fees funding for the remainder of the course. An individual student's eligibility for the scheme, is assessed by\u00a0the institution\u00a0in accordance with the terms of the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Where undergraduate students do not meet the qualifying criteria of the FFI they are required to pay tuition fees in full to their higher education institution. It is a matter for the higher education institution as an autonomous body to determine\u00a0the applicable fee rate for students.<\/p>  <p>  In general there is a real requirement to have a responsive approach to student needs wherever possible and it is important to acknowledge that HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways where a student's study was impacted by COVID-19.

Section 38 of the Universities Act, 1997 states that: (1) A university may borrow money by means of bank overdraft or otherwise and may guarantee or underwrite a loan taken or borrowing undertaken by a person or a body of persons. (2) Borrowing, guaranteeing and underwriting under subsection (1) shall be in accordance with a framework which shall be agreed from time to time between the universities and An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s, following consultation by An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance. The intent of the framework is as follows: That a university can engage in borrowing, underwriting and guaranteeing activities provided that they impose no threat to, and do not create any contingent liabilities for, the public purse. To ensure that the capacity of a university to function effectively is not endangered. That advanced approval by An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s or the ministers, of individual instances of borrowing, underwriting or guaranteeing by a university would not be required. University borrowing arising from fully self-financed or tax financed projects approved under the Finance Acts, are not subject to the borrowing limit established under this framework and may take place provided the servicing of those borrowings has no impact on the annual income of the University.  The HEA provided the below information in relation to University borrowing.: Total University borrowings at 30 September 2021 were &euro;942m Analysed by Lender:  Lender EIB; value &euro;618m; Average Interest Rate of 1.1% to 1.9% Lender HFA; value &euro;105m; Average Interest Rate of 1.5% to 2% Lender ISIF; value &euro;21m; Average Interest Rate 4% (Ireland Strategic Investment Fund) Lender Commercial Banks; value &euro;198m; Average Interest Rate 1% to 6%.  The purpose of these loans is to fund a range of capital development projects. The original value of these loans amounted to &euro;1,034m. There is no State guarantee or underwriting provided for these loans. While universities are required to submit details of their Framework and non-Framework borrowings to the HEA on an annual basis, the HEA does not have details regarding dates of drawdowns or repayment schedules. There has been no borrowing framework in place for the Technological Universities or Institutes of Technology. Waterford Institute of Technology, now South East Technological University obtained an interest free State loan of &euro;12.1m in 2014 to assist with the purchase of student accommodation and completion of a sports arena. Repayments are &euro;903k per annum. The balance outstanding at 31 August 2021 was &euro;7.2m. The Department has secured agreement to allow TUs borrow. Final arrangements are now being worked on with the TUs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100087#WRBB02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":1427,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100087#WRBB02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1428,"qnumday":533,"qnumall":"[27430\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100087#WRBB02800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the details of the prioritisation exercise for capital expenditure and capital project approval process for all Higher Education Authority-funded higher education institutions in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1616","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1429,"content":"<p>The revised National Development Plan (NDP) provides for Exchequer investment of nearly &euro;2.9 billion in further and higher education infrastructure, research and innovation over the five-year period 2021&ndash;2025. <\/p><p>This is in addition to infrastructure\u00a0to be\u00a0delivered by way of the Higher Education\u00a0PPP programme Public Private Partnership (PPP), which is focused on Technological Universities\/Institutes of Technology.\u00a0<\/p><p>Higher education capital funding is mainly organised on the basis of funding programmes, which have tailored parameters depending on the objectives that they seek to achieve.\u00a0 Capital investment is an enabler of wider sectoral objectives and there is therefore close alignment between policy priorities and capital investment decisions.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The key Exchequer funding programmes to date include the following: <\/p><p>- Higher Education Strategic Infrastructure Fund <\/p><p>- Higher Education Infrastructure Upgrade and Refurbishment Fund <\/p><p>- Energy Efficiency and\u00a0Decarbonisation Pathfinder Programme (co-funded with SEAI)<\/p><p>- Apprenticeship\u00a0Grant\u00a0<\/p><p>- Devolved Capital Grant\u00a0<\/p><p>- The funding allocations under the co-funded Higher Education Strategic Infrastructure Fund (HESIF) and the EEDPP 2020 and 2021 programmes were done by way of competitive call against set criteria outlined in the call documents.\u00a0\u00a0Applications were appraised by assessment teams under the terms and conditions that issued to institutions.<\/p><p>The Apprenticeship\u00a0Grant funding requirements in the higher education sector are identified following HEA engagement TUs and IoTs in relation to available capacity and expansion potential and a joint submission (from the HEA and SOLAS) is submitted to the Department.

These measures were introduced in line with Public Health advice and have resulted in an increase in the number of prisoners whose regime has been restricted. For medical and infection control reasons, prisoners suspected of infection are placed on a more restrictive form of regime while the testing process is completed.<\/p>  <p>  All prisoners newly committed to prison are currently placed in quarantine for five days before being transferred into general population. This is in order to reduce the risk that a new committal, who might be incubating the virus, could spread Covid-19 into the general prison population. Furthermore, any prisoner who informs staff that they are experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 is immediately assessed by prison healthcare staff who arrange for the prisoner to be isolated and tested. Any prisoner who has had contact with another person who has been tested for Covid-19 and is awaiting results is also isolated from the prison population, while the testing process is completed.<\/p>  <p>  The onset of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 had a significant impact in prisons at the end of 2021 and beginning of 2022 with multiple outbreaks of Covid-19 being experienced across the prison estate. As a result, over 470 prisoners had a restricted regime in January 2022 for isolation or quarantine reasons.

This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007.  A prisoner may, either at his\/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him\/her.<\/p>  <p>  At the time of the last census, the number of prisoners on a restricted regime for protection reasons (Rule 63) was at 575, of which 563 were there at their own request.<\/p>  <p>  Under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007 a Governor may decide, for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that a prisoner or prisoners may have on the general population.

The Service has revised this Plan and the procedures for the management of outbreaks which will eliminate the need for widespread restrictions and mass testing and ensure that restrictions are limited to the areas impacted by the outbreak.<\/p>  <p>  Following a recent review, it was decided that due to the lower levels of Covid-19 in both the community and in prisons, a number of Covid-19 restrictions and infection control measures would be lifted from 9 May 2022.<\/p>  <p>  These changes include the removal of infection control screens from physical visiting booths and visits have resumed in line with Prison Rules.

The impact of Covid in 2020 and 2021 saw the numbers in prison remain at a lower level due to a number of reasons, including reduced Courts activity during the period. <\/p>  <p>  The Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts and the prison system is, of course, subject to peaks and troughs.  Numbers are particularly high when the Courts are at their busiest and following the return to a more normal level of Court activity,  committals numbers have increased across the prison system. There were 2,409 committals to prison in the first four months of 2022 which is a 19% increase on the same period in 2021.  As a result, almost all of the closed institutions are operating at, or near, full capacity. <\/p>  <p>  The Prison Service regularly approves transfers out of affected prisons to other locations in order to prevent, in so far as possible, unacceptable occupancy levels and the Service are currently progressing a number of projects that will deliver additional prison spaces over the next twelve months.

The plan will consider the appropriate use of non-custodial sanctions and the role they can play in addressing criminality, reducing reoffending and providing protection to the public while holding the individual accountable.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill 2014 seeks to update the Probation of Offenders Act 1907. The aim of the Bill is to provide a modern statement of the law governing community sanctions, and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system. It will facilitate the effective and efficient use of community sanctions by the courts, and will ensure that the courts have a wide range of appropriate options for dealing with people who have committed minor offences. <\/p>  <p>  My Justice Plan for 2022 commits to the policy review of the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill 2014 being completed in the second quarter of this year. Once this review is complete, it is envisaged that it will be published and a revised General Scheme agreed in Q3 of this year with the aim of publishing the Bill in the final quarter of 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100089#WRDD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1516,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100089#WRDD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1517,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[27263\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100089#WRDD02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 56 of 5 April 2022, if she will provide an updated publication date for the findings of the high level taskforce to consider the mental health and addiction challenges of persons interacting with the criminal justice system in line with her prior commitment to have done so by the second quarter of 2022.","asker":"1570","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1518,"content":"<p>Last April, together with the Minister for Health and Ministers of State Frank Feighan and Mary Butler, I established a High Level Taskforce to consider the mental health and addiction challenges of persons interacting with the criminal justice system. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the need for a cross-Government approach to meeting the complex needs of such people, the Taskforce comprises representatives from a wide cross section of health agencies, the justice sector and other relevant stakeholders.

If they apply initially at their port of entry to the State they will still need to make a formal application at the Dublin offices of the International Protection Office (IPO) of my Department. There is no need to make an appointment. Everyone completes their preliminary interview under section 13 of the International Protection Act 2015 on the day they first attend the IPO offices. Therefore, there are no applicants waiting for a preliminary interview.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months, the number of people claiming international protection has increased significantly with 3,354 applications made to the end of April 2022. This represents a 600% increase on the same period in 2021 and a 129% increase on the same period in 2019, the last year in which application numbers were not impacted by Covid-19. There have been 12 applications made by persons in prison to the end of April 2022. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the very large increase in the number of applications, the median processing time for all international protection cases processed to completion by the IPO in Quarter 1 2022 was 26 months.

Jury service is one of the most important civic duties that a person can be asked to perform.

A 2014 study for the World Health Organisation estimated that half the prison population of the EU had a history of drug use and many of these people continue to use drugs while they are in prison. <\/p>  <p>  Addiction is a societal problem and a major contributory factor in criminality and as a consequence, everyday life in many Irish prisons is impacted by drug-related issues. There is an over-representation of drug users in Irish prisons and prisoners have higher rates of lifetime drug use and problematic drug use compared with the general population. <\/p>  <p>  Moreover prisons are an important component of the overall response to drug problems in Irish society. The scale of the activity and commitment of prison staff and other in-reach service providers in tackling this issue should be recognised. The prison environment provides a unique opportunity to support individuals to address addiction and in this regard it is essential that the range of treatment and intervention options available ensure the best possibility of a positive outcome. <\/p>  <p>  Among the ways the Prison Service aims to support prisoners in maintaining drug free lives is by\u00a0tackling the trafficking of contraband into prisons, including the smuggling of illegal drugs, thereby reducing\u00a0supply. This is done alongside initiatives to reduce demand for drugs through the provision of drug treatment and addiction services to prisoners. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2020, prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Prison Service had completed an initial\u00a0review of the 2006 Drugs Policy with a view to developing a new Drugs Policy. The finalising of the new Policy was delayed due to the challenges presented to the Service in managing Covid. I am advised by my officials in the Prison Service that the work on the drafting of a new policy has recommenced with a view to publishing later this year. <\/p>  <p>  The Prison Service has recently established a Steering Group to review the current Drug Treatment Programme\u00a0and, if necessary, propose to revise this programme to ensure it is contemporaneous and in line with the goals of the National Drugs Strategy Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery 2017 - 2025. This includes the provision of treatment, rehabilitation, recovery, education, information and support, so that those affected by substance misuse are empowered to improve their health, wellbeing and quality of life.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Prison Service continues to work to enhance and improve its level of medical service delivery to prisoners.\u00a0 The Service has embarked on a comprehensive Health Needs Assessment to examine the broad range of health care services that are provided across the entire prison estate. Addiction and substance misuse were among the issues examined by the review.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Last April, together with the Minister for Health and Ministers of State Frank Feighan and Mary Butler, I established a High Level Taskforce to consider the mental health and addiction challenges of persons interacting with the criminal justice system. In recognition of the need for a cross-Government approach to meeting the complex needs of such people, the Taskforce comprises representatives from a wide cross-section of health agencies, the justice sector and other relevant stakeholders. The Taskforce is independently chaired by former Minister of State Kathleen Lynch and I am pleased to report that work on the Taskforce has been progressing at pace since it was established in April of last year. The Taskforce has already had ten\u00a0plenary meetings and has established three subgroups on diversion; capacity issues in the Prison Service and National Forensic Mental Health Services; and community issues, including care after release.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The subgroups comprises of relevant experts, chaired by high ranking officials from the criminal justice sector, with the health leads represented and contributing to all. Each of these groups have met on at least twelve occasions. The Taskforce has engaged with a large number of relevant bodies and civil society actors and it\u00a0submitted an interim report to myself and the Minister for Health on 22 November 2021. I understand that the work of the Taskforce is nearing completion and a first draft of the final report is under consideration by the Taskforce. I expect to receive the final report and high level implementation plan for their recommendations in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100091#WRFF04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":1646,"qnumday":609,"qnumall":"[28000\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100091#WRFF04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of drug overdoses which have taken place over the past five years in each institution in the Irish Prison Service in tabular form; and if she can provide details in the case of each if the outcome was fatal.","asker":"1570","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1647,"content":"<p>I have sought the information requested by the Deputy from the Irish Prison Service, however, the information was not available in time.

Completed application forms are to be returned by 5pm on 8 June 2022 to a dedicated email address:\u00a0<i>CommunitySafetyInnovationFund@justice.ie<\/i><\/p><p>Further information is available on my Department's website at the following link: <i>www.justice.ie\/en\/JELR\/Pages\/CSI-Fund-2022<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100091#WRFF05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":1657,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100091#WRFF05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1658,"qnumday":613,"qnumall":"[28011\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100091#WRFF05700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the renewal of a stamp 4 visa is likely to occur in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1659,"content":"<p>The person referred to by the Deputy was granted permission to remain in the state as the parent of an Irish Citizen Child on 14 September 2018. <\/p><p>They should still be able renew their\u00a0permission at their local registration office and should seek to do so immediately. <\/p><p>If they are resident in Dublin, they should do so on the online renewal system for the Burgh Quay Registration Office at: <i>inisonline.jahs.ie\/ <\/i>.\u00a0<\/p><p>Any queries in relation to this can be directed to:\u00a0<i>immigrationsupport@justice.ie<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100091#WRFF05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Policies","counter":1661,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100092#WRGG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1662,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[28044\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100092#WRGG00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of efforts to facilitate later opening hours of nightclubs in Ireland; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1663,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to modernising our licensing laws and application processes, and my Justice Plan 2022 commits to publishing and enacting new laws to update and modernise licensing laws.<\/p><p>I am delivering on that commitment by preparing Heads of a General Scheme of a Sale of Alcohol Bill.<\/p><p>The objective of the proposed Bill is to repeal the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2018, the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008, and the Public Dance Hall Act 1935, and to replace them with updated and streamlined provisions more suited to the 21st century.<\/p><p>Codifying alcohol licensing law into a single Act will make it more accessible and user-friendly for the licensed trade, courts, Garda&iacute; and the public.<\/p><p>The creation of new categories of intoxicating liquor licences in order to meet the needs of new areas of activity in the hospitality sector is under consideration. <\/p><p>Any changes in alcohol licensing laws must be balanced with the need for regulation in the public interest, in particular public health and public order. <\/p><p>Reforms will be developed with a supportive approach to businesses, and the interests of public health, consumers and communities will be central to implementation.<\/p><p>Last November, I launched a wide-ranging consultation to seek the views of the public on the modernisation of Ireland&rsquo;s licencing laws.

The Acute Oncology Service links in with community services such as Community Intervention Teams, GPs and public health nurses to provide additional support to patients where required.<\/p>  <p>  A dedicated telephone helpline to the Acute Oncology Service Nurses is advertised through a variety of methods in the inpatient and outpatient settings, including information leaflets, contact cards, and posters.\u00a0In Beaumont, the service is also signposted by the Irish Cancer Society Daffodil Centre.<\/p>  <p>  Beaumont has 1.5 Acute Oncology Service Nurses.\u00a0The Nurses in Beaumont provide a service from 8am-4pm, Monday-Friday, with staff in the inpatient wards trained to receive phone calls during the out-of-hours period and provide guidance to attend the ED for medical review, if required.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) advises that it is exploring ways to build resilience in the Acute Oncology Nursing Service, ensuring cross cover and potentially extending service hours. National metrics are completed by all Acute Oncology Service Nurses in each of the hospitals and returned to the NCCP. These will be of use in informing the future development of this service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100093#WRHH04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Investigations","counter":1765,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100093#WRHH04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1766,"qnumday":649,"qnumall":"[27331\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100093#WRHH04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a new group has been formed to investigate maternal deaths; if a person (details supplied) is leading this investigation; the timeline being worked towards; its budget; its membership; to whom it reports; if this proposal has been before the Houses of the Oireachtas or the Cabinet for approval; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1767,"content":"<p>Serious adverse events in maternity care have a devastating impact on the families concerned.

My Department, and the HSE, continue to review new evidence, research and data on all aspects of COVID-19, including long-COVID, as it emerges to ensure care is in place for all who need it.<\/p>  <p>  My Department plays a leading role in public health and medical research in Ireland. The Department supports research in these areas through the Health Research Board (HRB), a statutory body which operates under the aegis of the Department and a lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research. The HRB supports the conduct of clinical research and clinical trials (in addition to health services research, population health research, and managing several national health information systems) on behalf of the Department. The Health Research Board is also actively involved in the European Commission&rsquo;s health research response to the COVID-19 pandemic through the EU Framework Programmes.<\/p>  <p>  As the global COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, evidence has emerged that some patients who survive the virus are experiencing prolonged symptoms and complications beyond the initial period of acute infection and illness. Termed long-COVID, it can present with clusters of symptoms that are often overlapping and fluctuating. Symptoms include breathlessness, headaches, cough, fatigue and cognitive impairment or &lsquo;brain fog&rsquo;, while there is also emerging evidence that some people experience organ damage. As yet, there are no clear indicators in research to suggest why one person may develop prolonged issues and another would not. Therefore, greater focus is now being placed on assessing this and the possible causes, in order that treatments and supports can be developed and to better understand any long-term consequences.<\/p>  <p>  Recent long-Covid studies include the following:<\/p>  <p>  Alimentary Pharmabotic Centre (APC) Microbiome Ireland in UCC conducted a study which has shown that the levels of multiple biomarkers are altered in serum from patients with long-Covid, even nine months after the initial infection with SARS-CoV-2. Over 1,000 molecules were measured in patient serum, and a subset of these molecules were shown to be at different levels in patients compared to healthy volunteers. These differences indicate an ongoing activation of the immune system, which were coupled with differences in molecules generated during metabolism, giving some hints at what might be underpinning long-term symptoms such as fatigue and brain fog. Overall, the study findings identify novel mechanistic and potential diagnostic markers as well as potential therapeutic targets in long-Covid patients.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Another study, led by researchers from the Centre for Vascular Biology in the RCSI School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences\u00a0published evidence showing that patients with\u00a0long-Covid\u00a0continue to have higher measures of blood clotting, which may help explain their persistent symptoms, such as reduced physical fitness and fatigue.\u00a0Clotting markers were significantly elevated in the blood of patients with long-Covid syndrome compared with healthy controls and these clotting markers were higher in patients who required hospitalisation with their initial COVID-19 infection. Even those patients that were able to manage their illness at home still had persistently high clotting markers. The researchers observed that higher clotting was directly related to other symptoms of long-Covid syndrome, such as reduced physical fitness and fatigue. Even though markers of inflammation had all returned to normal levels, this increased clotting potential was still present in long-Covid patients. This work was funded through the Wellcome Trust-Health Research Board Irish Clinical Academic Training (ICAT) programme as well through an HRB-funded Irish COVID-19 Vasculopathy Study.<\/p>  <p>  Please also note the following information regarding other initiatives\/trials:<\/p>  <p>  The international peer-review process is at an advanced stage for the HRB&rsquo;s largest project scheme, the 2022 Investigator Led Projects Scheme and this includes a number of grant applications focusing on long-Covid. The outcomes of this call will be available in June 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, with the support of the DoH and HRB, continues to participate in the WHO Solidarity PLUS trial. This is a platform trial that represents the largest global collaboration among WHO member states. It involves thousands of researchers in over 600 hospitals in 52 countries, including sites across Ireland. This allows the trial to assess multiple treatments at the same time using a single protocol, recruiting thousands of patients to generate robust estimates on the effect a drug may have on mortality-even moderate effects. It also allows new treatments to be added and ineffective treatments to be dropped throughout the course of the trial. Previously, four drugs were evaluated by the trial. The\u00a0results\u00a0showed that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and interferon had little or no effect on hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Three further therapies were introduced in late 2021- artesunate, imatinib and infliximab &ndash; with the aim of reducing the risk of death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is also participating in\u00a0EU SolidAct, a randomised, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial for COVID-19 and emerging infectious diseases and pandemics. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a range of interventions to improve outcome of (i) hospitalized patients with moderate disease, and (ii) hospitalized patients with severe and critical disease.<\/p>  <p>  Once the underlying mechanisms and causes of long-Covid become clearer, Ireland will be well placed, through the above platform trials, to engage in international trials assessing the effectiveness of treatments for long-Covid.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has developed and is implementing an interim Model of Care to provide long-COVID services nationally. This builds on existing service provision to further develop the necessary services across a number of health care settings including GP, community services and acute hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  A phased implementation is underway with a focus on establishing, Post-Acute and long-COVID clinics nationally within each Hospital Group as initial priority. This involves expanding resources at existing clinics where required and development of new clinics in line with the Model of Care.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100094#WRJJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":1784,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100094#WRJJ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1785,"qnumday":655,"qnumall":"[27346\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100094#WRJJ00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if her Department will urgently examine the case of a child (details supplied) and liaise with an organisation;

The completion of Phase One of the roll-out, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in fully operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Hospital Groups across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out of the model of care will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system. Substantial planning, development and policy work is required to establish the scope, design and requirements for this component of the model of care. At this juncture, the design and scope of this aspect of the model of care have not been finalised as detailed consideration of a range of issues including service and treatment design, eligibility and access criteria, and associated resource implications is required. This work will also need to be informed by the final Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Act, the progress of this Bill &ndash; which has recently passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il &ndash; and associated regulations that will be developed following the enactment of this legislation. My officials are continuing engagement with the HSE in relation to the necessary programmes of work required to further advance consideration of the issues arising for commencing Phase Two of the roll-out of the model of care. As precursors to the development of this phase, the priority has been to establish the necessary services at secondary level and to develop a regulatory framework, both of which are progressing well. <\/p>  <p>  While advanced AHR treatment, such as IVF, is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant\/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I understand that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF, or other advanced AHR treatment, privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department and the Government is fully committed, through the full implementation of the model of care for infertility, to ensuring that patients always receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system. The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100096#WRLL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":1900,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100096#WRLL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1901,"qnumday":696,"qnumall":"[27553\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100096#WRLL00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the crisis situation regarding the provision of respite disability services in CHO7;

The Protocol 37 Standard was introduced by the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) and is intended to ensure that requests from hospitals for emergency inter-hospital transfers are clinically prioritised in the same way as 999 emergency calls.\u00a0 Protocol 37 calls are clinically categorised as Bravo (serious not life threatening &ndash; urgent), Charlie (serious not life threatening &ndash; immediate) or Delta (life threatening other than cardiac or respiratory arrest) depending on the patient&rsquo;s condition and need for transfer to another facility.\u00a0 Protocol 37 Transfers are allocated the nearest appropriate resource, and subject to P37 category, may respond on blue lights and sirens to the referring hospital.\u00a0 All Protocol 37 requests are made by a registrar, consultant or clinical nurse manager, and all Protocol 37 requests must come through the 112\/999 system.\u00a0 The timeframe within which the emergency ambulance or intermediate care vehicle is needed is provided by the hospital at the time of booking.\u00a0 \u00a0The ability to achieve the desired timeframe is dependent on the availability of resources at the time of the request. I have been informed by the HSE that the majority of the information provided by the HSE in its reply of 5 May to the Deputy relates to non-cardiac-related cases.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Since early summer 2021 and into 2022, the NAS has experienced a growing demand for its services when set against available capacity.\u00a0 Last year the NAS dealt with a record 366,438 emergency calls and the latest data to the end of March indicates that current demand is already around 12% higher than at the same period last year.\u00a0 \u00a0Patient transfer delays at highly pressured hospital Emergency Departments and the continuing requirement for ambulance crews to carry out necessary Covid 19-related infection prevention and control measures also continue to present significant challenges for the NAS and mean that its performance in servicing all requests is very much dependent on resource availability.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to increasing capacity in the NAS.\u00a0 The operating budget for NAS in 2022 has reached &euro;200.7m, up from &euro;187.5m in 2021, which at the time was also a record allocation and overall it represents an increase of approximately &euro;30 million since 2019.\u00a0 This year's investment includes a total of &euro;8.23m in funding for new service developments and involves the recruitment of an additional 128 staff, which will help build further front-line capacity in the service, strengthen governance arrangements and improve access to alternative care pathways for patients.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding contact with the clinical leadership in the acute coronary syndrome programme, as Minister for Health, I am awaiting the final report of the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services, which was established in late 2017 under the independent chairmanship of Professor Philip Nolan.\u00a0 The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services is examining the delivery of cardiac services nationally with the aim of ensuring that as many patients as possible have access, on a 24\/7 basis to safe, quality assured and sustainable emergency interventions following an acute myocardial infarction.\u00a0 The Review seeks to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality, and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. The review is underpinned by a rigorous systematic evidence review, data analysis of existing service provision, and examination of relevant international good practice.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the further points raised by the Deputy in his questions I have asked the HSE to respond directly to him in the matter, as soon as possible, with any further pertinent details it may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100096#WRLL06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1962,"content":"<p>Question No. 715 answered with Question No. 714.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1963,"content":"<p>Question No. 716 answered with Question No. 714.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1965,"qnumday":717,"qnumall":"[27753\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100097#WRMM00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"Further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 1849, 1850 and 1851 of 26 April 2022, the communications that have taken place between his Department and the steering leads compiling the Nolan Report in relation to the future configuration of cardiac care services; if the three year transfer times have been fully communicated to the authors of the report; if they have been advised that these transfers relate to a number of stemi heart attacks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1616","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1966,"content":"<p>Access to care at the right time is critical to ensure that cardiovascular conditions are well managed.

Co-location of maternity services with adult services provides mothers with access to a full range of medical and support services should the need arise, in line with international best practice. In order to be successful in terms of enabling immediate access in an emergency, co-location requires physical adjacencies and specific corridor-linkages from one hospital to the other. The availability of these services helps ensure the delivery of an optimum, safe service, particularly for high-risk mothers and babies.<\/p>  <p>  The National Maternity Hospital (NMH) will be the first of our remaining stand-alone maternity hospitals to be co-located as its current infrastructure is recognised as no longer being fit for purpose. The co-location of the NMH with St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital will make the wide range of general medical, surgical and diagnostic facilities on the Elm Park campus available to any woman who needs to be transferred from the adjacent maternity hospital, resulting in care provision that is far superior to the existing situation.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that, women giving birth will sometimes &ndash; and thankfully, only in limited numbers &ndash; need emergency care and Level 3 ICU and pregnant women will often need multidisciplinary care, for instance if they have co-morbidities.<\/p>  <p>  Annually, several hundred pregnant women require transfer to St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital as inpatients or outpatients for treatment that is not available at Holles Street.

The issues which arise from Irish people engaging in cross-border surrogacy primarily relate to parentage, guardianship, citizenship and, potentially, adoption.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I published and initiated the Health\u00a0(Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 (AHR). The focus of this Bill is\u00a0on the regulation, for the first time in this country, of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction exclusively, and particularly those carried out by the private fertility clinics operating here. The published Bill does not contain provisions to regulate surrogacy arrangements undertaken in other jurisdictions, as this was not the intended purpose of the Bill.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An Oireachtas Joint Committee on International Surrogacy was also established this year to consider and make recommendations on measures to address issues arising from international surrogacy. The work of that Committee is ongoing.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My colleagues the Ministers for Justice, and for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and I will consider the findings and any recommendations made by that Committee in respect of international surrogacy.<\/p>  <p>  Subject to the Committee&rsquo;s findings and recommendations, it is not clear, at this juncture, whether the AHR Bill will be the appropriate vehicle for accommodating legislative proposals, or whether the amendment of other relevant legislation on the Statute Book is more appropriate. The Deputy will also appreciate that, at this time, it is also not clear if the output of the Committee&rsquo;s work will focus on legislative recommendations or other types of intervention, if any. This will only become clearer as the Committee&rsquo;s work progresses. <\/p>  <p>The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on March 23rd   2022 and has been referred to the Select Committee on Health for Third Stage. I am particularly determined to progress this much-needed and long-awaited piece of historic legislation as quickly as possible and avoid any further delays to a robust regulatory framework for AHR being put in place. Crucially, this would also adversely impact upon the Government&rsquo;s plans to introduce the provision of IVF and other advanced AHR treatments through the public health system. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I am fully committed to supporting the work of the Committee and having regard to its work in the context of the AHR Bill where possible and appropriate, and my officials will continue to work collaboratively with it and other relevant Departments in respect of examining the issues concerned, as it has done to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100097#WRMM05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":2011,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100097#WRMM05100"},{"type":"question","counter":2012,"qnumday":734,"qnumall":"[27881\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100097#WRMM05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 618 of 24 May 2022, if he will provide a list of dentists in County Kerry who are providing services for medical card holders under the dental treatment services scheme; the number of dentists who recommenced the scheme since the scheme was expanded and the fees for contractors were increased at the beginning of May 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2013,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100097#WRMM05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2016,"qnumday":735,"qnumall":"[27886\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100098#WRNN00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the routine dental care for children scheme for third, fourth and fifth class pupils at a school (details supplied) will resume; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2017,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100098#WRNN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2018,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100098#WRNN00500"},{"type":"question","counter":2019,"qnumday":736,"qnumall":"[27899\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100098#WRNN00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be granted an appointment with a consultant in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital Dublin regarding their carpal tunnel syndrome; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2020,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Six of these 12 planting categories focus on the establishment of broadleaves. It is a requirement that all new afforestation must include at least 15% broadleaves. The earlier years of the Programme saw lower rates of broadleaf planting averaging 20% in 2015. I am pleased to say this figure has increased each year reaching 41% in 2021 and 58% year to date in 2022.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This increase has come about as a direct response to incentives put in place by my Department to encourage the planting of broadleaves.

The development of the scheme was based on a recommendation of the 'Report of the Seafood Task Force &ndash; &lsquo;Navigating Change&rsquo; (October 2021). The 2022 scheme represents an extension of the 2021 tie-up which ran from October to December 2021 and which I launched rapidly following the publication of the Task Force report, in order to respond to the situation facing fishers.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the scheme is to enable a reduction in quota uptake in 2022 so as to improve quota availability for the fleet overall throughout the remainder of the year. In light of the further quota cuts taking effect in 2022, I have modified the scheme compared to 2021, so that vessel owners can, if they wish, choose to tie-up for up to two calendar months. This enhanced tie-up opportunity will free up additional quota for those vessels continuing to fish, supporting viability in the wider fleet in these challenging times.\u00a0 Payment rates will be the same as for the 2021 scheme. Vessel owners participating in the 2022 scheme will again be required to distribute one third of that payment to crew.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is initially expected to operate over the period June to October, but I will be asking the European Commission to amend the approval of the scheme to encompass November so as to provide for an additional August\/November tie-up option.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme and its timing have been developed in order to mitigate for quota reductions while also ensuring the protection and continuity of the seafood supply chain. To this end, the majority of vessels choosing to tie-up for two months must maintain a two month gap between tie-up months, currently allowing for an individual vessel to tie-up for June and September or July and October. As December is\u00a0typically a shorter month for fishing its inclusion would negate some of the effectiveness of this scheme in achieving its objectives.\u00a0I consider that the proposed structure of the amended scheme, covering the\u00a0period June to November\u00a0will have the greatest capacity to balance quota uptake throughout the year.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme has also been developed in the context of the full suite of Task Force recommendations, such as a voluntary decommissioning scheme which is presently with the European Commission for its consideration of the scheme in terms of State Aid rules.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100102#WRRR04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commonage Land Use","counter":2286,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100102#WRRR04900"},{"type":"question","counter":2287,"qnumday":828,"qnumall":"[27794\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100102#WRRR05000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his Department owns the commonage (details supplied) in County Tipperary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2288,"content":"<p>I have consulted with the officials in my Department's Records Branch\u00a0who have examined the relevant estate files.<\/p><p>I am advised that my Department does not own the lands in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100102#WRRR05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry","counter":2289,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100102#WRRR05200"},{"type":"question","counter":2290,"qnumday":829,"qnumall":"[27810\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100102#WRRR05300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 874 of 10 May 2022, the way that he will be reinvesting the &euro;9 million that was saved by his Department back in to fishing communities in the State.","asker":"1463","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2291,"content":"<p>I have previously advised the Deputy of almost &euro;32 million in funding to local authorities for projects concerning public marine infrastructure over 2022 and 2023.\u00a0 A further call for projects is planned for later in the year to allocate remaining funding identified for the scheme.\u00a0 Of particular note in this context is that the Brexit Adjustment Reserve does not cover VAT and so that is an element the Exchequer may need support for these projects.

These have already had a positive effect.<\/p><p>In 2021 an additional 12,000 hectares were farmed organically and it is expected that this will increase by a further 17,000 ha taking into consideration those that applied to join the scheme this year.\u00a0 These 29,000 new hectares mean a 35% increase in land farmed organically in the last two years.<\/p><p>I am committed to continuing the implementation of the National Organic Strategy 2019-2025 which sets out ambitious growth targets for the sector by aligning it closely with the market opportunities.<\/p><p>For the years 2023 &ndash; 2027, I have proposed the allocation of &euro;256 million under the new CAP Strategic Plan to continue the development and growth of the organic sector.\u00a0Based on this level of funding, it is my intention to introduce enhanced payments to organic farmers to support the maintenance and conversion to Organic Farming.<\/p><p>We are currently awaiting approval from the Commission on the proposed enhanced payment rates, and I can confirm that participants in the current Organic Farming Scheme, will receive the higher rates of payment subject to their approval by the Commission.<\/p><p>We have also provided funding to the Agricultural Consultants Association to increase advisory support in the sector.\u00a0 Teagasc are also committed to continuing their support of\u00a0 Organic Farming through their Advisory Service which will ensure farmers have access to professional advice to aid in the important decision making process.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100103#WRSS01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2310,"content":"<p>Question No. 836 answered with Question No. 835.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry","counter":2311,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100103#WRSS01700"},{"type":"question","counter":2312,"qnumday":837,"qnumall":"[28097\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100103#WRSS01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a consultant has been appointed for the deep-water quay at Ros a Mh&iacute;l; if the timeline and key milestones for the development have been agreed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2313,"content":"<p>I am happy to advise that my\u00a0Department has procured the services of consulting engineers and the detailed design for the Deep Water Quay Project is underway.\u00a0 Additionally, the consulting engineers will\u00a0manage the tender process for construction works,\u00a0supervise the construction works, and in due course handover completed construction works back to\u00a0my Department.\u00a0 Until the consultant's work has been undertaken, the timeline or key milestones for the\u00a0development cannot be specified.\u00a0 My Department will be advised by\u00a0the\u00a0consulting engineers on the schedule of the different elements of the project including the dredging and construction works.\u00a0 However, my Department will be working\u00a0closely with the consultant to progress the development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100103#WRSS01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":2315,"qnumday":838,"qnumall":"[28098\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022053100103#WRSS02150","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the details of the agreement entered into between Ireland, France and Belgium in which responsibility for weighing and inspection of all fish landed into Irish ports by French and Belgian-registered fishing boats passed from the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority to their control agencies; if the the European Commission was involved in either initiating and or overseeing and or consenting to this special arrangement between the Irish, Belgian and French fisheries control authorities; if there is a written agreement in relation to this; and if so, if he will publish the agreement.
