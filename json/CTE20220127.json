As Covid-19 restrictions have receded, it is again open to Members and witnesses to attend committee meetings in person.  I ask those present to continue to wear face coverings when not addressing the committee and when moving about the room.  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, Members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness and is present.<\/p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from the National Transport Authority, NTA, to examine its 2020 financial statements.  The NTA has been advised that the committee may wish to examine the following matters during the course of the engagement: the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area; expenditure on MetroLink, BusConnects and DART expansion and underground; bus transport infrastructure and the selection process for the location of bus stops; public private partnerships; and the purchase of buses by the State for private operators.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the NTA: Ms Anne Graham, CEO; Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy chief executive officer and director of transport planning and investment; and Mr. Tim Gaston, director of public transport services.  Attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House are Mr. Philip L'Estrange, director of finance and corporate services, and Mr. David O'Flynn, financial controller.  Attending remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House are the following officials from the Department of Transport: Ms Ethna Brogan, assistant secretary, and Mr. Garret Doocey, principal officer.  All of our guests are very welcome.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask Members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that mobile phones are on silent or switched off.<\/p> <p>  I wish to explain some of the limitations to parliamentary privilege as well as the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the precincts of the Parliament is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  A number of today's witnesses, however, are to give their evidence remotely, from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to specific witnesses.  If a question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time he or she contributes.<\/p> <p>  I now call on Mr. Seamus McCarthy, the Comptroller and Auditor General, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The NTA was established in 2008 and has evolved since then to undertake a wide range of statutory responsibilities, mainly related to public transport planning and funding.  The authority's income in 2020 amounted to &euro;1.085 billion, up from &euro;661 million in 2019.  The majority of the income comes from Exchequer grant funding.  The authority's expenditure in 2020 amounted to &euro;1.043 billion.  More than half of this, &euro;579 million, was in respect of public service obligation, PSO, payments.  These payments are made to the operators of public transport in respect of public services that otherwise would not be financially viable.  Significant additional PSO payments were provided in 2020 as a result of the severe impact of Covid-19-related travel restrictions on the viability of public transport services.  In addition, the authority introduced a support scheme in 2020 to offer temporary financial supports to commercial bus operators at a cost of &euro;32.6 million in the year.  The second largest area of spending by the authority in 2020 was in respect of the provision of capital investment grants to a wide range of bodies.  This amounted to just under &euro;350 million in the year.  In addition to the investment funding provided to other bodies, the authority invested &euro;65 million in the purchase of buses that were added to its own bus fleet, which is made available to public transport operators.  The carrying value of the whole bus fleet in the statement of financial position was &euro;227 million at the end of 2020.<\/p> <p>  I certified the financial statements on 24 June 2021 and issued a clear audit opinion.  However, I drew attention to a disclosure in the statement on internal financial controls regarding non-effective expenditure of about &euro;400,000 incurred in respect of the development of a new grant management system.  After the project commenced, growth in the authority's capital programme meant that enhanced oversight, control and reporting were required.  Following an assessment, a management decision was made in 2020 to terminate the project and instead to redevelop the authority's existing grant management system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

As requested by the committee's secretariat, we have furnished some information in advance.  To assist in answering the committee's questions, I am accompanied by three directors from the NTA: Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO; Mr. Tim Gaston, director of public transport services; and Mr. Philip L'Estrange, director of finance and corporate services.<\/p> <p>  The remit of the NTA is primarily concerned with the planning, development, regulation, funding and provision of sustainable transport.  Within the greater Dublin area the authority has a greater depth of functions.  The authority's role covers not only public transport capital investment and provision of services but also securing greater integration between land use and transport planning.  The authority's statutory transport strategy for the GDA sets out the key transport projects that are required to be delivered to provide for the growth in travel demand by sustainable modes and to meet the carbon emission targets agreed by the Government.  The authority is obliged to review the transport strategy for the GDA every six years, and the first review was completed last year and published in November for public consultation.  That consultation closed on 10 January and the authority is now reviewing those submissions and preparing a final draft for approval by the Minister for Transport.<\/p> <p>  The Government has published its long-term investment programme, the National Development Plan 2021-2030, which continues to support the BusConnects programme, MetroLink and the DART+ programme as well as other important public transport projects which will assist in meeting the demand for sustainable transport and our obligations to reduce carbon emissions.  The authority manages the capital investment programme for public transport, cycling and walking on behalf of the Department of Transport and funds the transport operators and local authorities for approved projects.<\/p> <p>  Planning and public consultations for three major capital projects, namely, BusConnects, MetroLink and the DART+ programme, continued during the pandemic and the preliminary business cases for all three were submitted to the Government for approval in 2021.  It should be noted that, in accordance with the public spending code, the NTA has been appointed as the approving authority for all three of these programmes in addition to being the sponsoring agency for BusConnects.<\/p><p>Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is the sponsoring agency for MetroLink and any other Luas projects, and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is the sponsoring agency for the DART+ programme.  A robust governance structure is in place to manage these projects through the planning, design and construction phases.  The authority is also managing a significant increase in active travel funding to local authorities, which saw &euro;280 million allocated in 2022 for more than 1,000 projects in different stages of delivery across the State.<\/p><p> Following a successful year in 2019, which saw significant growth in public transport usage, the impact of the Covid pandemic was dramatic.  The health measures necessitated by the pandemic saw capacity on public transport services reduce by up to 75% at various stages throughout that year, resulting in a 50% reduction in passenger numbers by year end.  Despite these challenges, the NTA, along with its operating partners, managed to keep public transport services going in order that key workers could get to their places of work and make essential journeys.  In that context, I thank all the operators and their staff for continuing their work in keeping our public transport services operating in a safe and efficient manner.  This continued through 2021, and while there was recovery at times in the public transport numbers, they were still well below pre-pandemic levels.  We are particularly grateful the Government supported the NTA with increased funding to offset the fare revenue shortfall due to the pandemic.  As a result, public transport operators suffered no commercial loss for the operation of services contracted by the NTA.  Government financial support was also extended to the authority in July 2020 to support the re-introduction or continued provision or both of a number of public transport services normally provided under licence by commercial bus operators without State subsidy.  This funding has been extended to the end of March 2022. <\/p><p> Despite the emergency crisis brought about by the pandemic, there were a number of key achievements to note in 2020 and 2021.  We saw a significant number of new and improved services delivered in a short time frame under the Government's July 2020 stimulus funding package in that year.  Two phases of the BusConnects Dublin network have been successfully delivered and there are plans to deliver three more phases this year.  We have recently concluded consultation on our Connecting Ireland plan for improving connectivity for people living outside our major cities and towns.  With Connecting Ireland, we are proposing an overall increase of approximately 25% in rural bus services as part of a five-year plan starting this year.  Since the beginning of 2020, we have invested substantially in town bus networks in Drogheda and Navan and this year, we will progress the delivery of services in Carlow and Portlaoise.<\/p><p> Proposals on redesigning the bus network in Cork city have gone out for public consultation as part of the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy, CMATS, and we are looking to do something similar for Galway and Limerick.  We also saw the first deliveries of the electric hybrid double-deck bus fleet in 2020, which marks the start of a process that will see carbon emissions dramatically reduce on our subsidised bus services and help us to achieve a reduction in transport emissions, as set out in the climate action plan.  The authority has purchased three hydrogen-fuelled zero-emission vehicles, which are now in operation by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We have also ordered 34 single-deck battery electric buses for delivery commencing later this year, as well as completing the tendering process for up to 800 double-deck electric buses, all of which allows us to meet our target of having zero-emission vehicles operating on all State-subsidised urban bus services by 2035.<\/p><p> In respect of the small public service vehicle, SPSV, sector, the number of vehicles that are now wheelchair accessible grew to 17% of the total fleet by the end of 2021.  A number of supports for the SPSV sector were introduced to mitigate the impacts of the Covid-19 crisis.  In addition, with the support of the Department of Transport, the NTA opened a new grant scheme for SPSV licence holders who wish to switch their vehicles to electric or electric hybrid vehicles.<\/p><p> Since its establishment, the authority has been significantly under-resourced.  Our staffing complement, in particular, was below what we require to effectively undertake our statutory and non-statutory functions.  A great deal of work was undertaken during the past three years on the development of a strategic resourcing plan to identify the needs in that regard through consultations with our parent Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am pleased this culminated in approval for the filling of a significant number of key posts in 2020 and 2021, which has assisted greatly in building our capacity to deliver on our mandate.  As for our funding and expenditure, the authority has been strongly focused from the outset on ensuring we have robust financial and audit controls, bearing in mind the scale and range of the authority's financial activities.<\/p><p> I welcome any questions members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Graham.

This is where a review of the routes and timetables is necessary to support schoolchildren and their families.  At 3.43 p.m. a 59 bus leaves Dalkey, where the school finishes at 3.45 p.m.  It gets to the next school at 3.48 p.m.  That school also finishes at 3.45 p.m.  They are both girls' schools.  The next bus from Dalkey is at 4.30 p.m.  This is a local example but it shows how the schoolchildren in two secondary schools should be able to depend, particularly in the winter, on not waiting around for public transport and access it easily.

I support my colleagues in saying that, from the perspective of school transport and buses, we also have a significant issue in this regard in rural Ireland.  Children cannot be delivered to or collected from the bus by their parents.  Every year, there seems to be a growing need for a parent who is working to be able to take a child to the school bus.  We are having the same difficulties in that regard.  It is paramount, given what we have seen of late, that we keep our children as safe as possible and that we do what we can to ensure that they can be delivered to their doors.  There are many instances where the bus passed less than 200 m or 500 m from a door, but it will not go down that route.  The bus operators never have a difficulty.  When I speak to them, they never have an issue with doing that.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is preventing it from happening.  We must have a forum where an explanation is given to public representatives concerning why this is the case, because it comes up year after year and costs a fortune over time.  It is preventing people from going back to work.  I ask that we look at that in future, because it is not a part of what we are discussing today.<\/p> <p>  I am baffled by the climate policy that has been developed and how it has no regard, it would appear, for rural Ireland and its requirements.  Undoubtedly, those travelling in rural Ireland are disproportionately affected by the rising cost of fuel.  I refer to the costs of having to travel to work in rural Ireland, with no alternatives being put in place.  The intention in the climate action plan was that the alternative means of travel would be in place before costs would rise.  The costs are rising exponentially, however, and no alternatives are in place.  The Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan only has a &euro;50 million budget allocated over five years, with &euro;5.5 million of that for this year.  It is going nowhere and will do nothing for the services.  We are experiencing exponential increases in fuel costs, while Local Link contractors have entered into a tendering process where the price of fuel is not considered.  They do not get anything, but they have suffered the consequences of these fuel increases.  I ask Ms Graham, Mr. Creegan or Mr. Gaston to comment on whether any proposal has been made to examine this issue or to compensate those affected, because many of our Local Link operators are no longer viable.  Before the witnesses answer, the Connecting Ireland policy went out for public consultation in November.  The closing date for contributions was December.

The public consultation closed in December and we are analysing the contributions now.  We are also in the process of developing phase 1 of the plan.  It will be a five-year plan and, as the Deputy said, our estimate is that there will be an increase of approximately &euro;50 million in revenue expenditure to match the proposal.  We will deliver phase 1 of the plan in the coming weeks.  We have targeted those services that are already nearly planned or where the Local Link offices have been able to indicate there is demand.  We will shortly be publishing the phase 1 plan, along with an indication of when phases 2 to 5 will be delivered.  Those will involve a more regional approach.  The plan will have three main strands.  Local Link will provide services, or we will jointly tender and then Local Link offices will oversee the contracts for routes.  Bus &Eacute;ireann routes will be modified.  We are also in detailed discussions with several commercial operators regarding licensing.  Those are the three strands of delivery which must come together.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the question of indexation, we are very much aware of the cost of fuel increase.  Some of our contracts, those I described earlier, include a fuel index component.  If there is an increase in the price of fuel, then the feed we pay them will be increased.  Some contracts, however, do not have such a provision.  In those cases, we have identified what we believe to be the indexation increase and we are doing a one-off variation for 2021 in respect of the increased fuel costs the operators incurred.  If fuel remains at a high price, then we will do a one-off indexation variation for 2022 as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#G02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Gaston"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Must that be requested or will it be rolled out to all the operators, such as those operating the Local Link services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#G02200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":209,"content":"<p>It is a bit of both.

I am relaying a message as a public representative on behalf of the constituents who elected me regarding the need to provide a service.  We must provide an alternative means of travel, and it must fit the requirements.  Therefore, it can not be done from an office in Dublin using Google Maps.  It must be done based on genuine co-ordination and not box-ticking.  It must be a process involving the TCUs, because they have the people who understand what is required.  They cannot be dictated to in a scenario like this because that will not work and it will cost too much.

We have to achieve a modal shift.  That has got to be the objective, not least because of our climate obligations and the crisis the planet is in but also because there is a very strong economic reason.  We need our public transport services to connect and work.<\/p> <p>  I am a strong advocate of public transport and have been for decades.  I have been very active in this regard, including through my co-ordination, along with CI&Eacute;, of a sizeable survey in my area in the 1980s that delivered very significant changes tailored to the needs.  I have got to say, however, that my experience with BusConnects has been horrendous.  I just do not believe people were listened to.  It was said in the opening statement that two phases of the BusConnects Dublin network have been successfully delivered and that there are plans to deliver three more this year.  One of them certainly has not been successfully delivered.  There are significant problems.  I can testify to that because my area is one of the areas where one phase, the C spine, has been rolled out.  I cannot measure the H spine and do not know how the witnesses measure success, but success is not empty buses, the generation of more traffic, or people buying cars because the public transport is not working for them.  It may well be working to some degree, but you could not say it is successful.<\/p> <p>  Let me use as examples the L58 and L59, the buses that connect to train stations in my area via Celbridge and Leixlip.  The complaint that I most frequently get from the public concerns why money is wasted running empty buses.  On most days, the number of people on each bus could be put into a taxi.  The service runs every half hour from 4.30 a.m. until 11.30 p.m., empty.  Services that were being used have been removed from routes to allow for the delivery of the new services.  My office has become the complaints department for BusConnects.  That has been my experience of it.  It may well be working closer to town.  I accept there is a much more direct route if one is going along the motorway or main carriageway rather than into communities, but it is in communities that people live.  The buses are not connecting; the feeder buses come after those on the main route.  They are not turning up and people are just giving up on them.  They are running empty.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses might provide us with the information on the income.  It is not a great time to measure it, because of Covid, but the witnesses might state the income and numbers of passengers before Covid and now.  As far as I am concerned, the number of passengers indicates success.  We were promised a dedicated line for people to give feedback.  We got a booklet with a general number, which I have rung several times.  To be honest, it is just a Dublin Bus general number; it is not a dedicated line.  I do not know how the NTA picks up the feedback and complaints and how re-tailoring is done.  We were given many commitments, including a commitment to have ambassadors along the route.  I went out looking for them but did not come across any.  Success is not the word that I would use.  I am hugely disappointed that there has not been the desired opportunity for the public to engage directly, rather than engaging via other public representatives and me.  There is no point in engaging with the witnesses because I do not get a response.  I have found the whole process highly frustrating and disappointing.  I believe money and opportunities are being wasted.<\/p> <p>  The NTA had better get the H spine and C spine right before starting to roll other ones out.  Considering that the bus is the workhorse of the public transport system in terms of the number of people carried, we cannot afford to get this wrong.  I do not want to be critical of the potential improvements to public transport but my experience of it has been awful.  Most of the complaints I receive concern the waste.  The booklet was sent out a week before the spine was delivered.  The NTA needs to learn some lessons from that.  People cannot make sense of it.  If you have been over and back, made many submissions and are a bit familiar with it, it is fine, but it is not very clear.  The NTA really needs to make a much bigger effort in communicating with the public.  I would not rely on the feedback on the H spine that the NTA has got so far because my experience of the C spine is that the methods of feedback are wholly inadequate.<\/p> <p>  I would like an opportunity to contribute later because there are other issues, concerning the DART and the metro, on which I would like to engage.  I would like to hear what the witnesses are going to do about measuring success and feedback, because we cannot afford to get this wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#J00400","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I am very disappointed to hear Deputy Catherine Murphy&rsquo;s remarks.

The fact is we have a private bus system operating under the umbrella of Bus &Eacute;ireann through Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway.  How does Ms Graham think that is sustainable, with the NTA also giving in excess of &euro;570 million in PSO funding to operate the same routes?  Although they are getting a subvention from the State they are, in some cases, double the price.  I will give her one very good example.  There is an Expressway service that leaves Dungarvan to go to Cork.  It passes through Youghal and Midleton on its way.  That costs half what the PSO-funded, NTA-controlled service Bus &Eacute;ireann provides leaving Youghal to go to Cork does, on a similar journey that is half the distance on the same road.<\/p><p>Why is that allowed to happen?  The NTA has responsibility for setting the price but it makes no sense that we are giving hundreds of millions in PSO funding and then undermining that system by providing the Expressway service.

There was an announcement of approximately &euro;91 million, as I understand it, for the upgrading of that line to ensure that the speed at which commuters could travel between Cork and Dublin and <i>vice versa<\/i>is speeded up.  I want to get a deeper understanding of where that spend is going and how it is proposed to spend the moneys.  I understand that signalling upgrades are a component part of that, and possibly new intercity railcars, ICRs.  I could be wrong but Ms Graham will clarify that for me.  The reason I ask is because, while I am a weekly traveller on the Cork to Dublin line and I am a regular DART user, I wonder whether the Mark 4 engines are fit for purpose in a modern railway infrastructure and whether there is a proposal to replace those with more energy-efficient carriages and train sets.  Where is the NTA in terms of that conversation with Irish Rail?  That is my first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#P00200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>In terms of the fleet, we have not been having any conversations in relation to replacement of the Mark 4s.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the investment on the infrastructure outside of the greater Dublin area, that is not managed by ourselves.

The other issue relates to correspondence that we would have received in relation to bus shelters.  People may ask why am I asking a question about bus shelters.  Bus shelters are important to people who do not have their own transport, particularly if they live in intermediate towns.  For instance, if you are living between Cork and Limerick in a town such as Buttevant, which has been waiting for a bus shelter for a number of years, it is entirely appropriate for me to ask where the NTA is in terms of the provision of such shelters and why they are not being rolled out at a quicker pace to ensure that we encourage more people to use public transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#P00400","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":425,"content":"<p>Mr. Creegan might respond to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":426,"content":"<p>It is fair to say and we accept that the roll-out of bus shelters has not been as fast as we would like it to be.  Certainly, over the past two years, with various restrictions that we all know about, we have not achieved as much as we wish.<br\/><br\/>It is more difficult, though, than people think.  Generally, what holds us up is that some additional footpath works are required in a particular location before we can put the shelter down.  We do not have the <i>vires<\/i>to go in there and dig up those footpaths.  We are relying on the local authority doing some work at those locations and they have been pulled all over the place for the past two years.<br\/><br\/>We have worked with most of the local authorities now and have developed a schedule of bus shelters that we hope to get installed as quickly as we can.  Equally, we will be working with the bus shelter supplier to see can we roll out more shelters as well over this year, next year and onwards.<br\/><br\/>It is a place where we recognise we have not done enough and have more to do.<br\/><br\/>The last point I would make is there are other locations where people are asking for shelters and the location just does not suit because either the footpath is too narrow or there is a window or an entrance alongside that is affecting visibility lines.  It may look obvious to somebody asking why do we not do it but, actually, we and the local authority could not agree to it.  Wherever we can do it, we will try and get over the obstacles that I have mentioned there.

I appreciate the answer.  I used Buttevant as one example and I am unashamedly parochial in this sense.  Buttevant is an example of where infrastructure is not being rolled out in towns and villages that depend on intercity routes.  If some attention could be given specifically to Buttevant, I would be very grateful for that.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to fare structures.  I have a mountain of correspondence with the NTA in respect of fare structures between Mallow and Cork.  Mallow is a typical example of a town that is within commuting distance of a big city and where I perceive that there is an inequality as between the commuter who commutes to Cork from Mallow and the person who travels, for instance, from Greystones to Pearse Station in terms of fare structures.  I note and welcome the correspondence that I have received from the NTA in relation to the introduction of commuter fares.  I wish to raise the issue of commuter fares because there are thousands upon thousands of people who will make the modal shift from car to train if the fare structures are right throughout the country.  Mallow is a typical example of that.  The sooner we get those new fare structures this year, the better.  Overnight, you will see a demand for those services among students, workers and citizens in general.  That is why I asked the question about the Cork-Dublin upgrades in relation to speed.  If we can get more rolling stock on those lines between Cobh, Midleton, Cork, Mallow and Charleville, for instance, and open up new intermediate stations as well, you will create demand.  Quite frankly, that is where the Minister is at.  That is where the citizens are at.  The more the NTA can influence that and bring that about, the more positive the impact it will have for citizens.  If there is a confirmation of the fact that commuter fares will be introduced, as per the NTA's correspondence to me already, I would welcome that.  That is my final question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#P00700","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":428,"content":"<p>If members want to come back in for a second round, I ask them to indicate if they are not in the room.

In relation to the DART+, BusConnects and MetroLink, I read through the briefing notes yesterday that the NTA sent along.  I thank Ms Graham for them.  There is &euro;46 million spent so far on DART+.  There is fleet money there but I am not counting that.  I am talking about spending on developing the project.  On BusConnects, there is &euro;89 million spent on developing the project and on MetroLink, there is &euro;88.1 million spent on advancing the project.  In the documents that the NTA sent along to us, I was trying to map out the progress on them.  While I understand that there will be substantial preparation work to be done, when you put all of that together, &euro;223 million has been spent on preparation work across those three projects, namely, the DART+, BusConnects and MetroLink.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the documents the NTA sent.  For example, DART+ is set out under five headings.  If you take DART+ West, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann published the preferred option for public consultation, with consultation closing on 6 October.  On DART+ South West, the second round of the public consultation process on the preferred route was held during November and December.  On DART+ Coastal North, there is an initial public consultation project for an emerging preferred route for the DART+ Coastal North project.  The DART+ Coastal South project is at an early stage of development and it is currently planned to launch the initial public consultation in the middle of this year.  The DART tunnel is similar.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to BusConnects, if the committee will bear with me, I will find a relevant piece here.<\/p><p>In line with the public spending code, the preliminary business case for BusConnects Dublin has been provided to the Department of Transport.  It is currently being reviewed prior to a Government decision.<\/p><p> On MetroLink, it is stated that it is anticipated that a railway order application will be submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the end of the second quarter of this year, subject to Government approval of a preliminary business case.  To be honest, I was a bit taken aback by where progress with the DART, BusConnects and MetroLink projects stands.  The other thing I was taken aback by is the combined sum of &euro;223 million has been spent on this preparation work.  Some of them are from way back.  There is a long way to go.  The witnesses know that and I know it from reading through those documents.  Is the amount of money involved as regards preparation work not excessive?<\/p><p> The second question, and I ask the witnesses to keep their answers brief because I have a few other questions, is how much more is it estimated to cost to get it to the stage where we will see JCBs on-site and shovels in the ground?  How much more will cost in preparation work for those projects?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#P01300","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Creegan to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":436,"content":"<p>First, &ldquo;preliminary business case&rdquo; is the term that is used.

The 46,615 in the State.  Approximately 21,000 were bought in the first 11 months of last year according to the figures that we have.  In the Dublin area, 9,816 were bought in that 11-month period in 2021.  There are 159 charging points in the Dublin area.  People would accept that there is regular public transport in the Dublin area, as there should be, and it needs to be improved.  This is not an argument of urban versus rural.  I want to make that clear.  I understand why there needs to be efficient public transport and continuous work to improve all the time in our capital city and in other cities and towns.  In County Laois there are 457 EVs and there are 249 in County Offaly.  That compares with 21,519 in Dublin.  There are ten charging points in Laois and there are eight in Offaly.  That is the best information that I can get via the mapping from the Department or from the NTA.  There are 159 points in Dublin.  The point that I am trying to make is that there is substantial investment being put into public transport in the Dublin area, as there should be.  However, we are caught in a situation in rural counties where the EV is not an option at the moment.  One can see that the greatest of number of subsidies for EVs are in the greater Dublin area.  A greater number are being bought there.  The number of charging points is higher in Dublin, as I would expect it to be.  I am trying to point out, however, that the numbers are tiny in rural counties such as Laois and Offaly.  The number of vehicles that are being bought as a result of that is tiny.  This is because we do not have the infrastructure.  As well as this, range anxiety is a real issue because the technology is not there yet.<\/p> <p>  The other point I wanted to raise about EVs relates to a reply to a parliamentary question that my colleague, Deputy Darren O'Rourke, obtained about the latter.  I was taken aback by this, because I had thought people who buy EVs were careful about money and might be a little frugal.  I do not mean that in a bad or derogatory way.  I thought that they might be careful about the environment.  However, the list of vehicles bought last year is jaw dropping.  It included Jaguars, Land Rovers, BMWs and Mercedes.  There were huge numbers of them.  From an NTA and Department issue point of view, and I know this policy issue, but maybe we should look at this again.  Are we subsidising Mercedes-Benz, Jaguars, Land Rovers, BMWs and huge Audis in and around the cities where there are already extensive public transport networks?<\/p> <p>  I do not want to be too parochial about this, but people who live in rural counties like Laois and Offaly are stuck with petrol or diesel cars and they might not have the money to change them.  The option of charging points is not there.  The infrastructure is not there.  There is also the range issue, which will hopefully be improved, although I think that hydrogen will be the real gig.  EVs are not an option in these places because of price, the lack of charging points and range anxiety.  Ms Graham might comment on that.<\/p> <p>  It certainly opened my eyes when I saw the reply to the Parliamentary question on what we are subsidising.  I am for subsidising EVs, by the way.  I do not want this to be taken up wrong, but are we subsidising 4-tonne cars in areas where 1-tonne cars would do because there is already good public transport?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#Q00800","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":442,"content":"<p>That is probably a matter for the Department.

I thank Ms Graham for the replies.  She sent me back a lot of information on this over the year.

That is welcome however a point that I have made before and will make again today, one train goes up and down that line once a day.  There is huge potential there.  We have a regional strategy, which I welcome, with the delivery of Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  We need to seriously look at how we can use that line to increase tourism around Limerick, the south west, Tipperary and south Laois.  It is travelling to Ballybrophy.  Much more use could be made of it.  The car park has been expanded at Ballybrophy station which we looked for and is good news.  The line has been upgraded.  I have received answers in the past that the travel speeds had to be kept low because of the lack of investment but substantial investment has gone into it.  It needs an on-the-spot, up-to-date engineering examination.  I ask Mr. Gaston to come back to me on that.  There is tourism potential but there are also large numbers of students and workers commuting from south Laois, down through Tipperary, Roscrea, Cloughjordan, Nenagh and the towns along there, who would make use of it.  It goes straight into south Laois.  There are tourism and commuter opportunities that can be exploited and explored.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#R00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Certainly.

There has been a doughnut-shaped settlement pattern with Fingal leading the charge in growth, followed by counties Meath and Kildare.  They are all putting pressure on the city centre.

That is abnormal and needs to be rebalanced to an extent.<\/p><p>When you start looking at some of the initiatives like DART+ and MetroLink, the areas that are generating that traffic are the ones that lag far behind.

It is, in fact, going to Kilcock as a huge facility is going in there; it is just that people will not be able to get on, which seems daft.

Naturally enough, when people have been told not to use public transport during the Covid pandemic, it has had a very significant impact on confidence in terms of the safety of public transport through a pandemic.  However, there are a number of people who have been using public transport through the pandemic.  We put in place additional cleaning and other controls in order to build up the confidence that people have in public transport.  In terms of trying to attract people back to public transport, we are looking at marketing campaigns to build confidence.  We were just talking, yesterday, about how we would build people's confidence in using public transport again where they have not been using it over the last two years.  We are trying to see if we are in a position to do anything from a funding perspective on fares reductions in order to encourage people to use a particular service.  For example we ran the Kids go Free campaign pre-pandemic.  We are looking at whether to run that again to encourage young people and their parents to use public transport.

If it is two, that is a very different arrangement for us than if it is four.  The other challenge we face is determining whether everybody will want to work Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.  They actually still need the same peak for only three days of the week, where previously it was spread over five.  There is a number of things that we need to see teasing out.  There is work under way at the minute, recognising exactly the point the Deputy has made that the suburbs are busier than the city centre now.  That is where the growth has been.  We anticipate that we may and will need to rebalance how bus services are managed to give more service and more frequency, particularly more services between the peaks in the evenings and weekends.

Of course, it is in line with our climate action policies and plan and the NTA's objective to encourage people to use public transport.  There are two issues that I wish to raise on foot of that.  The first is one that I have previously contacted the NTA about, namely, the short hop zone that currently extends to Balbriggan.  The witnesses will know that the hybrid DART is going to be extended, on the northern rail line, as far up as Drogheda.  That would indicate that the greater Dublin area now extends as far as Drogheda.  There is a huge problem, which as I said I have flagged up previously, namely, the disparity in the cost of rail fares between Drogheda and Dublin, Laytown and Dublin and Balbriggan and Dublin.  As a result of that, many people, particularly in Laytown, choose to drive to Balbriggan.  There is a difference of &euro;25 in the cost of a weekly ticket.  There is a situation where people living in the east Meath area and working in Dublin will drive to Balbriggan and then get the train from Balbriggan to Dublin.  If you are talking about a difference of &euro;25 a week, that adds up to a substantial amount over the course of a year.  It flies in the face of everything the witnesses have said on the NTA's objective and our climate action policy.  Thus far, I have not had much luck campaigning on the issue.  Will the NTA agree to examine the issue and look at the practicalities, given what they have previously outlined?  It will stop people getting into their cars and driving to Balbriggan or indeed, on to Dublin, because it works out cheaper for them to drive.<\/p> <p>  The other issue that I wish to raise on foot of Ms Graham's points concerns the D1 and D2 bus routes.  Again, it is logical, practical and for the life of me, I do not know why there is resistance.  The buses operate between Drogheda and Laytown.  They are very successful and a huge amount of the public use them.  However, the current terminus is at Laytown train station and the thousands of people living in the Julianstown area have asked for the route to continue on as far as Julianstown.  If the witnesses listen to this, they will see that it is madness that it has not been done.  At the moment, the only way for residents in Julianstown to travel to Laytown - and bear in mind that Laytown has the train station, a beach and other amenities - is to drive.  That particular 4 km stretch of road between the two villages has neither lighting nor footpaths.  It is extremely dangerous to either walk or cycle on.  If parents are taking their children to activities in Laytown, they have no alternative but to use the car.  If that bus route were to be extended, it would also link the coastal villages of Laytown, Bettystown, Donacarney and Julianstown.  Julianstown has connecting buses to Swords and Dublin Airport.  The only way to get there currently is by car.  It would also provide a link for the residents of Julianstown to all of the coastal villages and, of equal importance, it would provide public transport from all of the villages to the national ecology centre, Sonairte, which is on that road.  For the life of me, given climate change policy and the objective of the NTA go get people to use public transport, I do not know why there is resistance.  It is logical and an alternative to the car.  Do the witnesses believe something like that is logical, practical and in line with NTA objectives and Government policy?  I ask them to explain why it has not been done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#S00400","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":477,"content":"<p>We are up against the clock.

While it sounds like a small issue, I have engaged with Ms Graham on this many times over the past 11 years and although some progress has been made, it is terribly slow.  I have a couple of things to note, one of which is they cost a lot of money.  I have observed two things.  First, some of the areas that we have put forward do not require a big bus shelter.  In Monasterevin, the NTA put in a big one.  It was right because there were more people at the bus stop than at the train station and it needed a big bus shelter.<\/p> <p>  Portlaoise could do with a second one, particularly on the upper-bound line.  I ask Ms Graham to examine that.  There is a very small one at Lyster Square, opposite the shopping centre in Portlaoise.  That needs to be bigger.<\/p> <p>  I would like to focus on the route along the R445 through Borris-in-Ossory, Castletown, Mountrath, Portlaoise and Ballybrittas for a moment.  There are no bus shelters along it.  Bus shelters have been promised.  Can we look at ones that are less expensive?  I argue strongly that Borris-in-Ossory needs one.  There is room on the street as there is a wide main street, which has been bypassed.  We can make better use of what is there.  Could Ms Graham come back to me on what is happening on that? <\/p> <p>  When one is standing on the road in Castletown waiting for a bus, cars or trucks pass at high speed.  On a wet day or on a wet morning, when people are going to work and children are going to school, they are wet before they even get there.  We need to try to provide a small bus shelter there.  In Mountrath, there may be problems with footpath widths.  However, the local authority needs to be given latitude around Patrick Street, Mountrath.  It is a wide street and the parking bays have been built out in order to designate the parking spaces.  This means that there is street space on Patrick Street.  Portlaoise needs a second one on Lyster Square and Ballybrittas needs a bus shelter.  Again, it does not need one as big as those in the larger towns.  It does not need one as big as in Monasterevin.<\/p> <p>  On the N78 route, bus shelters are needed at Crettyard, Newtown and Ballylynan.  Again, small ones would do in Crettyard and Newtown.  There is loads of space for them.  At Ballylynan there is a wide street with build-outs to designate the parking areas.  I was in Ballylynan on Saturday and there are locations there for bus shelters.  The weather has been dry for the last two weeks, but there was a week when it rained all week.  We want to get people onto public transport but we live in a country with a wet climate where we get intensive periods of heavy rain.<\/p> <p>  I forgot to mention Kilminchy.  There is supposed to be a bus shelter on each side of the road there.  Kilminchy alone has over 1,000 people living in it.  There are a couple of thousand more people living around that end of Portlaoise.  It urgently needs a bus shelter on each side of the road there.  Again, there is space.  If we are going to get people to use public transport, we have to provide that.  I ask that a smaller model of bus shelter be looked at.  I have seen big ones going up in areas where there are generally one or two people using it.  I want to see that figure increasing, as I am sure Ms Graham does, to six, seven or eight people, in order to get people out of cars.  However, people will not get out of the car on a wet day to stand on the side of a road, or leave the car at home or forget about the car altogether to use public transport unless we have that vital infrastructure.  I do not expect Ms Graham to come back to me with all of the details in an answer.  However, perhaps she could come back to me on each one of those.<\/p> <p>  To conclude, the local authorities under the bus legislation that was brought in eight years ago were given greater role in respect of bus stops.  This is for the Department to take on board as well.  Local authorities need to be the bodies that designate them, put them up and put them in place.  I mean no disrespect to the witnesses but cannot be co-ordinated from their office.  The NTA cannot be sorting out bus stops in Castletown, Crettyard and places like that.  That needs to happen locally, with the municipal districts of the council, with the councillors and with the engineers.  Of course, the NTA designates the bus routes, and I am not arguing against that.  However, that needs to be devolved down.  While I understand that the NTA must operate within the legislation that is there, can you give any slack to the local authorities to allow them do as much as they can?  I would argue for that.  Would Ms Graham like to respond briefly on that point?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#T00700","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":490,"content":"<p>We will respond to local authorities that come to us with plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Have you, though?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#T00900","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":492,"content":"<p>We do not really want to be going to the local authorities with plans.

In general, they relate to the 2020 year of account and, in most cases, a clear audit opinion.  No. 1 is the special EU Programmes Body, which is a North-South body that I audit in conjunction with the Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern Ireland.  It gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 2 is the National Library of Ireland, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 3 is the Local Government Fund, which is a substantial amount of &euro;1.5 billion, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 4 is An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 5 is the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund which, again, gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 6 is the Food Safety Promotion Board, again a North-South body, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 7 is the National Council for Special Education, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 8 is the National Tourism Development Authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  In this case, I gave a qualified audit opinion.  The accounts give a true and fair view except in regard to pension funding, in my view.  Unlike most other grant-funded bodies, the financial statements of the National Tourism Development Authority do not recognise a deferred retirement benefit funding asset in regard to some of its pension liabilities.  This is on the basis that the authority considers that it has not been provided with a statutory or other guarantee in regard to the future funding of the scheme.  As a result, it has a net liability position on its statement of financial position, but it still believes that it is appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis.  I have drawn attention to that.  I think it should be recognising a matching pension funding asset.<\/p> <p>  No. 9 is Tourism Ireland, again a North-South body, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 10 is the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 11 is the Intestate Estates Fund Deposit Account, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 12 is the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and its accounts for 2020.  I give a qualified opinion in that case also.  The accounts give a true and fair view except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements of staff only as they become payable.  That is a standard instruction for health sector bodies from the Minister for Health.  Otherwise, the accounts give a true and fair view.  No. 13 is the special account Hepatitis C Insurance Scheme, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 14 is the National Training Fund, again a sizeable fund of &euro;718 million, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 15 is St. Angela's College, which is a college of education in Sligo, to which I gave a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to Note 11, which again relates to retirement benefits accrued by current and former staff.  That is standard for the university sector.  No. 16 is the National University of Ireland, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 17 is the Law Reform Commission, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 18 is St. James's Hospital, which is one of the section 28 hospitals.  It is given a clear audit opinion, but I draw attention to non-compliance with procurement rules in that case.  No. 19 is the Sport Ireland Facilities company, which is a subsidiary of Sport Ireland, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 20 is the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, which gets a clear audit opinion, but I draw attention to Note 9 to the financial statements, which deals with the superannuation arrangements for staff.  Discussions are ongoing between the Office of the Ombudsman and the Department of Finance about the responsibility for the funding of pension liabilities under the schemes.  That has not been resolved.<\/p> <p>  No. 21 is the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 22 is the Leopardstown Park Hospital Board, again a section 38 hospital, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 23 is the special account for the purpose of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.<\/p><p>This is a relatively small turnover and it was reimbursement of charges that were improperly levied.  A scheme was put in place to provide for that.  It is a clear audit opinion.  Related to that is the health repayment scheme donations fund, which had a nil turnover but the account continues to exist.  There is a clear audit opinion on that.  The Health Service Executive consolidated patients' private property account, which had a turnover of &euro;41 million and net assets as of 31 December of a total of &euro;103 million got a clear audit opinion.  This is actually private funding of individuals but it is being managed and held in trust by the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p> No. 26 is the Institute of Public Administration and that got a clear audit opinion.  No. 27 is the Irish Museum of Modern Art, which gets a clear audit opinion.  There were three of the accounts that were signed on 30 June and only presented in December.  They are within the committee's scope for asking for an explanation.  Those are No. 4, An Bord Plean&aacute;la; No. 8, the F&aacute;ilte Ireland accounts; and No. 27, the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  The certificate for the National University of Ireland was signed on 30 August but the Department has already provided the committee with an explanation for why it was late.  That is in the correspondence for today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>With regard to St. James's Hospital, the amount is &euro;516 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#AA00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":507,"content":"<p>The turnover.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":508,"content":"<p>Yes.

This arises from the commentary relating to the scandalous case of the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in County Kerry.  It is a scandal in the first instance in health terms.  It is clear from reading the reports that there will be a significant financial outlay in potential legal proceedings and in the resolution of the matters.  There is a Garda investigation and a review ongoing but this is not the first time we have had a case like this.  In fact, our health services are littered with stories and scandals of this nature.<\/p> <p>  Where is such a case reflected in terms of the potential liabilities that could arise as a result of such cases in accounts and financial statements?  I am talking about the ultimate cost to the taxpayer.  How do we as a committee examine the financial obligations?  Whatever the findings of the Garda investigation or the review, we can probably say with absolute certainty that there will not be a single individual in the HSE who will pay a price with a job, reprimand or future entitlements.

It provides information requested by the committee on ten diverse issues, including the taxation of couriers, the number and associated value of seizures of drugs and cigarettes from 2019 to 2021, expenditure on facilities at Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort due to Brexit, a monthly analysis of the support Revenue has provided to each sector during the pandemic, and the settlement between Revenue and Perrigo.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.  It was flagged for discussion by me and Deputy Matt Carthy.<\/p><p>Two separate pieces of correspondence come under No. 1009.  One gave a breakdown of the use of the voluntary PAYE scheme over the 15-year period from 2004 to 2018.  There is a table of the gross pay of the taxation by a number of employees and number of employers.  One thing that stood out, which I found very unusual, was that in 2018 the gross pay of those ten employers for 154 employees was &euro;1,524,970 and tax paid &euro;22,329, and the number of employees 154.  That means that the wage for each employee was about just over &euro;10,000.  The taxation the PAYE paid was &euro;144 for the year by employee.  I want to take more time with this but it is something that we may have to follow up again with Revenue.  There is certainly something unusual about that.<\/p><p>Deputy Carthy has left, but other members may wish to comment on the second document.  It relates to bogus-self employment. Revenue have sent a document from the Chief Inspector of Taxes.  It is copy of a document dated from 1997.  It says that compliance of tax by couriers &quot;was 'put on hold' until the status of couriers for tax and PRSI was concluded&quot;.  This is from 7 March 1997.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAs you are aware, the Department of Social Welfare Appeals Office have decided that a motorcycle courier who provided his own equipment (e.g. motor cycle, special gear etc.) and was engaged under the standard courier contract was insurable as a self-employed contractor under the Social Welfare Acts.  <br \/><br \/>While the decision is not binding on Revenue I propose, as previously stated, in the interest of uniformity and with a view to bringing the matter to a conclusion, to treat couriers as self-employed for tax purposes, whether deliveries are made by van, motorcycle or bicycle ... <\/blockquote> <p>That appears to be at complete odds with what we were told when Revenue was before the committee, namely, that there was not a uniform decision to treat all couriers as self-employed.  The document refers to treating couriers as self-employed for tax purposes elsewhere.  It can be seen that the decision was made to treat all couriers as self-employed.  I wanted to bring that to the attention of the committee.  If any member wants to come in on that, feel free.  Any future engagement may have to revert back to that.  We will note and publish that correspondence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#CC00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":550,"content":"<p>For clarity, is it the suggestion that this is not the most up-to-date statement of the employment status of couriers that is on the public record but that it is the most relevant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#CC00600","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>We received this correspondence.

This arises from information requested by the committee regarding compliance with procurement guidelines.  Last week, we considered an interim response from the Secretary General, No. R1004, and the substantive response is before us today.  In its 2020 accounts, the Department disclosed non-compliant procurement totalling over &euro;91 million, and 151 of the 153 contracts concerned related to the provision of international protection accommodation, which is part of direct provision.  Responsibility for this area was transferred to the Department from the Department of Justice in 2020.  In No. R0939, the Secretary General explained that he took the view that these accounts, which the Department of Justice considered to be competitively procured, should be included in the disclosure of an uncompliant procurement for 2020.  Linked to efforts to address this non-compliance is the Department&rsquo;s work in implementing the White Paper to end direct provision and to establish a new international protection support service.  The Secretary General includes an overview of that process.

Any payments that were made to An Taisce from the then Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht would have been made exclusively by the heritage division of that Department.  Responsibility for the heritage function no longer resides with that Department as it transferred to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage as part of the transfer of functions in 2020.  As the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage did not provide the requested information relating to its heritage function, for which it now has retrospective responsibility, the secretariat has sought an update on the heritage funding.

This one went to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Hopefully, we will have it soon.<\/p> <p>  No other items of correspondence have been flagged for consideration today.<\/p> <p>  The next item is the work programme.  Next week, on 3 February, we will engage with Transport Infrastructure Ireland to examine its 2020 financial statements.  On 10 February, we are scheduled to examine expenditure on the national broadband plan with NBI and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  As agreed last week, we have a series of housing-related meetings scheduled after that with the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government, the Residential Tenancies Board and Home Building Finance Ireland.  The secretariat is working to make the necessary arrangements which would take us up to 3 March.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, an issue that has arisen is the provision of women's refuges, and, unfortunately, it has become more pressing in the past fortnight for the wrong reasons.  There are nine counties without a refuge and it is causing big problems.  Perhaps we could add it in and take it as a small item in one of those meetings.  We could address that with the Department regarding what is being spent on it, what money it has and what plans there are for the future.  Nine counties, including Laois and Offaly, do not have a premises.  Women and children are being sent miles away from schools, doctors, support groups and families, with no transport and nothing.  That is along with the trauma of being out of the family home and in many cases being victims of domestic violence.  One can imagine the extra layer of difficulty.  I have dealt with too many of them, unfortunately, over the years.

Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The only other item I wish to raise regarding the work programme is that there are some more developments with the University of Limerick, UL.  I propose to put it on the work programme again.  Matters are far from being resolved there and there are a number of serious issues that might need further examination.  With the agreement of the committee, I propose that we invite the chancellor, who is the chair of the board, to appear before the committee on the next occasion.  On the last occasion, the president, who is a relatively new president, was put in a very difficult position.  We have to ask the hard questions, but in some ways she was fairly new to it.  That is not doubting her ability or anything like that, but she was dealing with a lot of issues that arose or started before her term.<\/p> <p>  The last issue I wish to raise relates to the three separate meetings scheduled on policing.  Combined with the three on housing, that is six gone.  With the mid-term break, we are looking at two months gone.  Could we amalgamate two of the meetings on policing?  There are meetings with the Policing Authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are having three-hour rather than two-hour meetings now.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appropriations accounts would need a separate day by itself, but perhaps we could bring in GSOC in the first part of one morning meeting and from 11 a.m. we could take the Policing Authority.  Deputy Catherine Murphy asked for it to be included, but I am not sure that we have much to go through with the Policing Authority.  She obviously has issues she wants to raise and I want to be fair to her, but I suggest that we do it as part of one engagement.  Have members any strong feelings one way or the other on that?<\/p><p>If not, then we will seek to do that on the same day.  If anyone has a better suggestion, he or she should feel free to make it, but I suggest that we take GSOC first because there are a number of issues involved.  That would be from 9.30 a.m. until 11 a.m., after which we could take the Policing Authority.  Would that order be okay?  Agreed.  We will ask the secretariat to arrange it that way, which will bring things back a week.

It arises from our consideration last week of R1000 from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform concerning the format and content of the appropriation accounts of Government Departments and offices.  We agreed to include this as an agenda item for today's meeting.  This matter has arisen several times, including last week.  It is an area that we need to try to improve.  Members might also recall that, last November, we agreed to request that the Department include the committee in any consultation process involving proposed changes to the framework for accounting by central government agencies, rules around management of public funds and the publication of codes of practice for governance of public bodies.  It is welcome that the Department has agreed to do so.  We also included a number of potential additions to the information presented in the appropriation accounts, including legal costs and pay and staffing.  The Department has made changes in respect of reporting on legal costs.  They will come into effect this year for the 2021 appropriation accounts.  This is a good move and is welcome, as is the fact that the Department has committed to considering the other suggested changes for the following year's appropriation accounts.<\/p> <p>  However, there is one other change that, in the interests of transparency and accountability, the committee should request that the Department act on for the 2021 accounts.  It relates to pay, specifically the remuneration of Accounting Officers.  It is not detailed in the appropriation accounts and, as noted in our letter to the Department, this is significantly out of step with the standard of disclosure expected of non-departmental State bodies under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.<\/p> <p>  I will open the matter to the floor before requesting agreement that we write to the Department to request that this information, as well as the previous year's remuneration, be prioritised and included in the 2021 accounts.  Members will recall that we went through a rigmarole trying to get information on the pay of Secretaries General and we only got vague answers or did not get answers at all.  That is not satisfactory.  There are now four separate grades of pay for Secretaries General.  There used to be three.  Exactly what is being paid out in this regard needs to be shown in the appropriation accounts when we receive them, which would normally be the following September.

We would also like to thank the Department of Foreign Affairs for the financial support fro its reconciliation fund and encouragement over the past 20 years to help grow the integrated education movement in Northern Ireland.<br\/><br\/>As the Chairman said, Mr. Peter Osborne is a director of the Integrated Education Fund, Ms Tina Merron is chief executive of the Integrated Education Fund and I, Paul Collins, am head of public affairs and advocacy at the IEF.<br\/><br\/>We would like to begin with a quote from a young woman who was born at the time of the Good Friday Agreement and who has benefited from an integrated education at both primary and secondary level.  The lady is Tara Curran.  Ms Curran is a past pupil of New-Bridge Integrated College, Loughbrickland.  This is what she says:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt's not just about bringing Catholics and Protestants together; Integrated Education is far more than that.  It is the bringing together and the teaching of people from all abilities, all religions, all sexualities, all genders, all interests, and personalities.  It prepares young people for their way forward no matter where they go in the world. <\/blockquote> <p>Ms Curran's words echo the views and experiences of many current and past pupils of integrated schools over the last 40 years since the first integrated school, Lagan College, opened in 1981.<br\/><br\/>It is 24 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and yet, despite the best intentions of that agreement to promote integrated education, in Northern Ireland we live in a society that segregates the vast majority of our children at four years of age.  We have a system that has created groups of young people who are divided into two tribes, who have no knowledge of the other.  Many young people have no opportunity to make friends, learn and play together with those from other denominations or, indeed, those of no denomination.<br\/><br\/>At the time of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement there were 41 integrated schools in Northern Ireland.  Today, 24 years later, there are 68 schools.  There has been roughly one additional integrated school every year in that time.  All integrated schools in Northern Ireland were set up by the actions of parents coming together and no integrated school was planned by a government.  Twenty per cent of first-preference applications to integrated schools are unsuccessful due to the oversubscription for school places in integrated schools.  Many more pupils are denied the opportunity of a place in an integrated school because there simply is not an integrated school in their area.  If you do not have an integrated school in your area, you do not have a choice.<\/p><p>There is a statutory duty on the Department of Education under the Education Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 to encourage and facilitate the development of integrated education.  However, there is no government strategy for growing the number of integrated schools.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Education&rsquo;s measurement of demand for new schools is based on the number of existing schools.  This maintains the <i>status quo<\/i>and hence allows no opportunity to measure demand in areas where there are no integrated schools.  In areas where there are too many unfilled school places in too many schools, the approach to area planning for schools considers either closing schools down and bussing pupils to the next nearest school of that sector or schools merging within their own sectors.  The option of schools merging across sectors to create new integrated schools that could serve the whole community is not even considered.  This poor approach to area planning can be illustrated in the Ulster University transforming education research, which was supported by the IEF.  This showed that in 32 separate communities there are 64 primary schools, where there is only need for 32 schools.  There is no meaningful cross-departmental working to address the need for a less segregated society involving the shared housing programme of the Department of Communities, the Department of Justice, the Department of Finance, Department of Health and Department of Education.<br\/><br\/>Thanks to the actions of parents across Northern Ireland, integrated schools are now providing places for 25,000 pupils.  Over the past 30 years, the IEF, which is a charity, has invested &pound;26 million in grants to try to meet parental demand for integrated education and support the development and growth of integrated schools.  For a new-build school, this means the parents starting the schools and then the parents and the fledgling school, with the support of the IEF, having to provide evidence of future demand.  There has been no new-build integrated school for the past 15 years.  New integrated schools are created through the democratic actions of their parent communities voting to change their existing non-integrated school through the legal process of transformation, to integrated status.  Four more schools transformed to become integrated in September 2021, with another set to join the family in September 2022.  Other schools are also on this journey, with one awaiting government approval to become integrated.  Two more have recently held parental ballots overwhelmingly in favour of transformation and 30 more schools have expressed their interest in becoming integrated.<br\/><br\/>The Northern Ireland attitudinal poll by LucidTalk in July 2021 showed 71% of Northern Ireland people questioned in this survey believed that integrated education should be the model of education throughout Northern Ireland.  Some 73% said if their child&rsquo;s local school proposed to become an integrated school, they would support this.<br\/><br\/>The Integrated Education Fund has been working since 1992 towards a Northern Ireland where children from different traditions learn and play together in the same classrooms, in the same schools, and where there is a respect and celebration of religious and cultural diversity.  The IEF is an independent charity dedicated to the development and growth of integrated education in Northern Ireland.  However, there are challenges.  It is undoubtedly true that there are many good schools and many dedicated and professional teachers across Northern Ireland, as well as many other school staff and governors who work tirelessly to support schools.  However, the education system within which those dedicated staff work is, through no fault of theirs, seriously flawed.  The skills shortages and the failings of the current system are evidenced by the following Northern Ireland statistics.  We have the lowest proportion of working adults with a degree and the lowest rate of adult literacy in the United Kingdom.  In 2017, nearly 17% of 16- to 64-year-olds had no qualifications, compared with 8% of all UK residents.  Alongside these figures, there is the deeply segregated education system with around 90% of pupils in Northern Ireland educated in schools that identify with a single tradition or denomination.  Only 7% of Catholics attend controlled, that is, mainly Protestant schools and just over 1% of Protestants attend Catholic-maintained schools.  Education has an important role to play in reconciliation and the way it is delivered should never get in the way of people from different backgrounds being educated together and getting to know and understand one another.  There are close to 50,000 empty desks in schools across Northern Ireland and upwards of &pound;95 million per annum is wasted on duplication.  It is estimated that over &pound;1 billion has been spent in the last decade on bringing young people together in various cross-community initiatives to correct the negative consequences and prejudices resulting from their experience of segregation at school.<br\/><br\/>However, against this background there is hope for the future as evidenced by the following.  Attitudinal polls, micro polls at a local level and parental ballots all show that the vast majority support integrated education.  There has been an increase in the number of integrated schools being pushed forward by schools, parents and the IEF, and the integrated education movement.  The Integrated Education Bill, a Private Members' Bill introduced by Kellie Armstrong, MLA, has gained cross-party support and is now entering its final stages in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  Chris Lyttle, MLA, has proposed a Private Members' Bill to remove the exemption of teachers from fair employment legislation.  The setting up of the independent review of education under the &ldquo;New Decade, New Approach&rdquo; agreement may be able to address the need for systemic change in the education system.  The IEF-supported Ulster University's Transforming Education papers, which gained significant media attention by putting a spotlight on key issues which impact on the delivery of education in Northern Ireland.  The IEF and Ulster University developed the future schools project, which helps put communities and schools to the forefront of the area planning process, thereby enabling parental choice locally.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for providing us with the opportunity to present today and we would be happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022012700002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643241600,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Collins for his very interesting and analytical presentation of the facts.

Getting the schools established in the first place is the issue.  The Department of Education does not have a strategy to start up new integrated schools; it is left to parents.  We provide support to parents if they wish to consider either their school transforming, which is one method, or establishing a new school on a greenfield site.  A lack of strategy, which is left to the Integrated Education Fund and our sister organisation, the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, NICIE, is the key missing element.  Once a parent group establishes, they face various challenges.  They need to get a certain number of pupils and a religious balance.  All of this is supported by us and by NICIE.<\/p> <p>  There is little support from the Department of Education.  When it has a development post that can go to the Department, the Department will often insist on proof of evidence.  For example, the only way to prove there is demand for an extra P1 class in primary school is actually to establish it.  That way nobody can argue that the demand exists because the pupils are in the seats.  We would fund the additional P1 class, a teacher and other costs until that proof of demand is established.  The funding gap and the lack of strategy from the Department of Education are key issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022012700002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Tina Merron"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643241600,"counter":632,"content":"<p>The Senator has asked a very apt question.  Ms Merron has provided an answer based on the current models.  We need to recognise the step before that.  The model of funding for education in Northern Ireland in itself wastes a considerable amount of money.<\/p><p>The system of education needs to look at itself and at how it approaches the provision of education.  Mr. Collins talked about how there are 50,000 to 60,000 empty desks.  That leads to approximately &pound;90 million worth of duplication.  That money does not necessarily need to be spent.  The really important thing to note is that we spend hundreds of millions of pounds a year to bring young people and children together to compensate for the fact that the education system keeps most of them separated.  Only 7% attend integrated schools and most of the rest of the children are educated in almost completely single-identity schools.<\/p><p> With regard to the issue of the funding model, it is absolutely appropriate to look at where we are now and at how we can get a more level playing field to support integrated schools.  The fundamental question is actually one of recognising that the current model wastes a huge amount of money and that not tackling the issue of segregation through schools, where five-year-olds are separated and live separate patterns of life, requires us to spend hundreds of millions of pounds trying to bring them back together to try to understand each other a little bit better.  In many ways, that is a more fundamental question than that of correcting the current model, although that is also important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022012700002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Osborne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643241600,"counter":634,"content":"<p>Here as much as anywhere else, you cannot talk about integrated education without recognising Baroness May Blood.

That would allow for a lot of lost time to be made up.  It should also be remembered that one of the reasons we want this Bill to go through is to help meet parental demand.

The official Department of Education figures show that, in the Catholic-maintained sector, 1% of pupils are from a Protestant background, while in the controlled sector, 7% of pupils are from a Catholic background.  The education that goes on in all of those schools is largely superb.  I am quite sure that most, if not all, of the teachers and everybody else involved are doing a fantastic amount of terrific work not just in the educational development of the young people under their care, but also in their spiritual development.  We certainly are not criticising the quality of teaching or the commitment of teachers but, when there is 1% from a Protestant background in one sector and 7% from a Catholic background in the other, the fundamentals of supporting a reconciliation process and the systemic separation of children and young people from the age of five have not been addressed, despite the Good Friday Agreement having been agreed nearly a quarter of a century ago.  Something can be done to bring them together outside of school hours and something can be done through initiatives like Shared Education but, in some ways, it is like throwing a bucket of water over a stone.

Today is an opportunity to look at how to progress further and at how we, as a committee, can help in that.

I am sure Ms Merron and Mr. Collins will have things to add.  I welcome the questions and the fact that, over many years now, this joint committee has been looking at aspects of policy in these areas, including issues in respect of integrated education and education as a whole.  These areas are covered by the Good Friday Agreement.  It is really important that an eye is kept on the models and that advice is given to policymakers in the North as well as in the South as to how the Good Friday Agreement can continue to be advanced in these respects.<\/p><p>It probably has not advanced as much as it should have done.  I will ask Mr. Collins and Ms Merron to talk about the integrated education model.<\/p><p> One thing the committee should look at in the context of the independent review of education, which has just started and will probably take a year or so before reporting, is how area planning works in Northern Ireland.  Area planning is based largely on planning for the two different types of education system, and that is a real difficulty.  If we had more time, we would go into research done by Ulster University on isolated pairs of schools.  The authors of the research looked at villages throughout Northern Ireland where there was a controlled school and a maintained school within a mile of each other.  They found 32 pairs, or 64 schools, in villages where the two different schools were within a mile of each other.  Of those 32 pairs, in the case of 26 at least one if not both of the schools are below the threshold for sustainability in a rural area, which is 105 pupils.  It is therefore very possible that in the next five or ten years one or both of those schools will close.  The area planning model will not immediately recommend looking at planning for those schools in the village together.  One might assume that they would look at amalgamating schools to ensure there is a school that survives in the village and ensures that the demographic mix in the village survives as well.  The area planning model will look more to how, if one of the schools has to be closed, children from that school are bussed to the nearest school within that system, which may be five or ten miles away, in another village.  Quite apart from the fact that this adds to the cost of bussing pupils to schools that are not the closest to them, which I think is about &pound;81 million a year, involving about 130 million miles of extra bussing per year, which has an environmental impact, if one of the schools serving by and large one side of the community is closed and there is no integrated option in that village, eventually, over five, ten or 20 years, that village will be seen to edge slowly towards being a single-identity village from what might have been a 50:50 or 60:40 village.  The parents of children from the background affected will increasingly look to move to another village where there is education provision for their children.  I think that is one of the reasons we increasingly have single-identity villages and communities in large parts of Northern Ireland.  That is one of the models that we think needs to be looked at through the review of education in Northern Ireland.  It is one of the areas on which the joint committee could keep a watching brief to see if it wants to form a view about the area planning model in the education service in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> I apologise - I have gone on for a long time.  Does Mr. Collins or Ms Merron wish to add anything in response to the other questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022012700002#C01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Osborne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643241600,"counter":647,"content":"<p>If the committee so wished, I am sure the University of Ulster would be happy to update it on its future schools project and to present to it, but I will leave that up to the committee.<\/p> <p>  To respond to some of the other questions asked, there are 68 integrated schools, 20 post-primary and 48 primary, across Northern Ireland.  There are two ways of creating an integrated school.  One is to start a new school on a new greenfield site, which we talked about earlier.  The second way is to get an existing school to undergo a process called transformation.  Are all schools successful?  The process of transformation takes time.  It can take anything up to five to ten years to change the balance of the pupils and the teachers.  It will automatically change the balance on the board of governors from the get-go.  At that stage a transformation action plan is worked through.  The schools have to plan everything they do with regard to the customs, traditions and everything else.  They plan that through a five-year period.  Some schools are a lot quicker on that journey; other schools take more time.  Recently we have opened a fund to encourage schools that have transformed.  It is mainly schools that have transformed that have applied to look at sports in their schools to see if they wish to offer different sports.  Sports are normally offered for just one tradition or another.  For example, there could be a formerly controlled school that has now become controlled integrated and wants to offer the GAA sports, hockey and so on.  The school can apply to us for funding for the additional equipment it needs.  This is done over a period of time.  As I said, some schools are very quick at this process; others are quite slow.  The Department of Education monitors religious balance and advises schools if they are not meeting the religious balance required.  It is up to the school.  A lot of it depends on the community and if the communities mix before the school goes down that road of transformation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022012700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tina Merron"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643241600,"counter":648,"content":"<p>I will come in on the issue of opinion polls.  The specific opinion poll referred to was conducted by LucidTalk, which is an independent polling body.  It did the opinion poll last weekend or the weekend before for the <i>Belfast Telegraph<\/i>.  In that survey we have quoted from there were 2,000 responses.  For such a poll to be statistically accurate, it needs 1,080 responses.  There was a 2.3% margin of error.  According to that poll, about 73% of people support their local schools becoming integrated.  Digging into that, there are some interesting statistics in respect of political parties.  Of DUP supporters, 58% support integrated schools; of Sinn F&eacute;in supporters, 74%; of SDLP supporters, 77%; of UUP supporters, 78%; and of Alliance supporters, 94%.  There has been survey after survey all indicating that the vast majority of people want their schools to become integrated.  Probably the most important statistic I can cite is that in all the polls that have taken place in all schools over recent years for the Integrate my School campaign, funded by the IEF, the vast majority of people, that is, the parents whose children are in those schools, voted for their schools to become integrated.  Those polls are run independently, and the range is from 71% through to 92%.  Therefore, of all the people who are asked whether they want their schools to become integrated, the vast majority indicate that they do.  In every opinion poll over recent years, people responding have responded that they want and support integrated education.  Yet I come back to what we mentioned in our initial presentation: only 7% of schools in Northern Ireland are integrated.  In fact, if all the schools that had voted to transform to become integrated were to become integrated, it would result in less than a 1% increase in the integrated school movement over the past year or two.  The only way we can significantly move forward is through systemic change.

I give a warm welcome to Mr. Osborne, Ms Merron and Mr. Collins.  I thank them for the broad spectrum of work they are doing on this.  The research and the polls they are doing are smart.  I give credit to the political parties that supported their Bill in Stormont.  It is an indictment on the parties that did not support it.  You wonder what their real agenda is.<\/p> <p>  Rather than going down that road, I will get to the teeth of the report.  It is stated in the report that there is a statutory duty on the Department of Education under the education order of 1989 to encourage and facilitate the development of integrated education but there is still no Government strategy for growing the number of integrated schools.  Given that so many political parties supported the IEF's Bill, what is the IEF doing to influence them to change this?  This will take political will and drive and, given the very high figures the IEF has found in its polls for those in favour of integrated education, and if we are ever going to have a shared future on this island, this has to happen.  I believe strongly that education shapes society and we need to question ourselves about segregation of any kind, whether in the line of sex or religion.<\/p><p>The future is integrated education across the board, not just in the context of Catholics and Protestants, but it is still important in a Northern Ireland context.

We are pushing to move those Bills forward among all political parties.  I will send an invitation out to every member here to visit an integrated school in the next 12 months and see what is happening on the ground.

It is not just about changing one school at a time; we need to have systemic change in Northern Ireland.  We need to pull together the different government bodies to bring together a more community-led approach to area planning.  We need to cut down on the vast costs involved in that, which Mr. Osborne mentioned.  We have put forward that manifesto and we will have hustings in the North to which we will invite political representatives, including Claire Hanna MP and whoever is available.

The statistics presented by them paint a stark picture.  We realise that prior to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 there were 41 integrated schools and one new integrated school per year has been developed in the meantime.  Some 71% of people surveyed by LucidTalk believe that integrated education should be the norm.  Some 73% of those would support their children&rsquo;s schools becoming integrated and 64% of the people surveyed attributed the slow growth to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s political parties.  At the same time I gather from one of the recent contributions that the majority of supporters of all political parties favour integrated education.  There is a strong message from parents that they want the sector to be developed but it is obvious and clear that there has been no worthwhile state assistance.<\/p> <p>  Is the opposition at a political level in the department or at the level of officials?  Or is it a combination of both?  If the integrated education Bill is passed before the mandate of this Assembly expires, what can it achieve?  Are there provisions within that legislation to make it mandatory for the Department to provide integrated education where there is a proven desire by parents for such a system?  It is a huge lost opportunity not to be developing the integrated education sector.  Many years ago I had the opportunity to visit Lagan College, which was established 40 years ago, and I saw first-hand the value of that college.  Speaking to staff, pupils and former past pupils, I learned a great deal about it and about the value and contribution that college has made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022012700002#E00500","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speech","time":1643241600,"counter":658,"content":"<p>I invite the witnesses to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022012700002#E00600","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643241600,"counter":659,"content":"<p>The difference this Bill will make is that the Northern Ireland Department of Education will have to have a strategy, look at demand and have targets.

Discussions will need to be had across all the sectors in education.  I will give the committee another statistic from Ulster University.  Of all preschool provision in Northern Ireland, 47% is totally segregated and of the rest, almost all would have only one or two preschool participants from the other side of the community to the majority.  That would be one or two children compared to the other side of the community that would have all the rest of the participants in the preschool provision.  Some 47% of preschool provision does not have anybody from the other side of the community participating.<\/p> <p>  When I chaired the Community Relations Council I carried a session somewhere around the north coast.  Integrated education and education as a whole were mentioned and one of the participants came to me privately and told me he or she lived in a rural area up the end of the lane where there were two houses.  This person said that his or her family was in one house and the other house had a family from a Protestant background.  It only occurred to him or her after I spoke that the children of both families were of the same age and played together.  However, when they got to the age of five and went to school for the first time, they went down to the bottom of the lane and one of them turned left and the other turned right.  He or she said they had been turning left and right at the bottom of the lane ever since.  It is a phrase that I have never forgotten because that is what is happening.  It is abnormal for that to happen in an education system because what then happens is the children play different sports, make different friends, go to different youth clubs and organisations, have different social structures around them and live their lives in different ways.  That is abnormal and we should not be surprised if at the end of that we have an abnormal society where people from different backgrounds do not know enough about each other, do not respect each other and do not understand each other.  That relationship is what reconciliation is all about and if we do not address this issue within schools and the schooling system, including area planning and all sorts of other relevant issues, we will not address the issue of reconciliation in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to the question that was asked earlier about the political parties in the North.  I have a great deal of time for all the political parties across the divide and it was wonderful to see that coalition from across the divide recently supporting the Bill going to the next Stage in the Assembly.  That is a remarkable thing and I have a lot of praise for it.  I ask members to go to their colleagues and thank them for what they did there.  One of the main things is that those parties are convinced that this is the right thing to do.  That is what the Integrated Education Fund is trying to achieve but it is a small team of staff, along with voluntary directors like me.<\/p><p>There is a limit to what can be done.  In that context, apart from thanking the political parties for their support - and hopefully that support will deepen as people think through the consequences of not tackling the abnormalities in the education system - I also thank the Department of Foreign Affairs, because its reconciliation fund has helped the IEF to do some of the work it is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022012700002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Osborne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643241600,"counter":662,"content":"<p>Ms Claire Hanna from the SDLP is present.

As I notified the committee, I have a constituency surgery on Thursday afternoons.  I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  I missed it being delivered, but I read their papers with interest yesterday evening.  My party and I come from the position that this society is not going to change until people are living and being educated together.  It very much needs to change in the context of the reconciliation aspect Mr. Osborne is addressing.  The project in that regard is to increase integration and sharing in education.  The challenge is how we do that.  The witnesses will know that this is not the case because they are doing this every day, but sometimes there is a perception that the problem would be solved if everybody would just decide that they wanted to share.  My worry concerns our inability to undertake that transformation and our general culture of poor governance here.<\/p> <p>  I make the comparison with health.  We have failed to reform health and to reorganise and remodel some 20 hospitals.  My concern is how we are going to undertake a similar process with approximately 1,000 schools, each of which has its own identity, governance structure and interests.  It is a core part of this issue as well.  Some of this context, then, is about that practical level of transformation.  Picking up on the issue raised by Deputy Brendan Smith, there is a question regarding how much of this relates to political blockages and how much is really an inability to manage transformation.<\/p> <p>  The other bisecting issue is selection.  To me, that is as egregious in some ways.  The system, almost from the start, has at its core an educationally unsound and socially unjust method of separating children out.  The rest of the education system, and I am just commenting as a parent because I am not a policy expert in this area, seems to be hinged around this poor core.  This issue is partially about how an integrated model can help to address some of this social segregation.  Lagan College is a good example of that.  It is modelling the good behaviour of all-ability schooling.  There is a perception that it provides great outcomes for bookish, academic children and for those developing in different directions or at different speeds.<\/p> <p>  I will give the witnesses a barrage of questions and then they can take them apart.  How we get to the point I referred to is the major question.  How do we disaggregate the technical barriers and the political barriers?  How do the witnesses propose that we address the transfer issue?  Some of this context is concerned with another aspect.  Before I had kids, I thought that all I would want from a school was the ethos.  Then as a parent, I realised that I also wanted the school to be five minutes away and to have a breakfast club costing &pound;1.  Most people make their educational choices on practical issues, such as where their childminder can collect from and where good after-school services are available, for example, in addition to the educational outcomes.<\/p> <p>  Like every sector, some schools are performing less well academically.  One of the easier wins among the low-hanging fruit in respect of the current position could be training teachers together.  Where does that stand now?  It is seen as important by many people.  When I consider the blockages that will arise from trying to reorganise schools, it is also the case that each school will have its own vested interests.  I do not mean that negatively, but everybody has their attachment to their school and its history.  I do not think that is a sectarian thing; it is just their project.  Teacher training should be a little bit easier.  I ask the witnesses to answer whichever of those questions they wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022012700002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hanna"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643241600,"counter":664,"content":"<p>They are all relevant and pertinent questions.  Again, time is against us in some ways, but I will attempt to give brief answers.  I did not pass my 11+ examinations.  I do not use the word \"fail\".  I did not fail it; it failed me.  It failed every other child in the class I attended.  I was brought up in a working-class area in Ballybeen.  Every child failed the 11+ examinations in my year.  I was fortunate in that circumstances allowed me to go on to university.  What the system was really saying to me, however, was that I should know my place, which was not to go to university and wind up doing some of the things I ended up doing.  That is completely wrong.  The integrated sector has elements in its schools of how it deals with mixed abilities which could be part of the answer to this issue.  Of course, that is the political answer.  It is up to the Assembly to legislate and to take forward the answers regarding selection and 11+ examinations.<\/p> <p>  Regarding how we do this, we are in the middle of a 50-year-plus peace process.  It will take at least that many years from the agreement.  It will even take more than that, because in some ways we have successfully managed the divisions in our society, but what we need to do in a peace process is to tackle the causes of these divisions.  We have been less good at tackling those causes of division.  One of those causes is that we send almost all our children into segregated education.  We must end segregation in education.  We must have people from different backgrounds in the same classrooms, wearing the same uniforms, playing the same sports and doing everything together to enable them to understand and respect each other, despite coming from different faith backgrounds and having different political views.  It is absolutely fine to have those different political views, but if there is no contact with people with other views and backgrounds, there will be less understanding of and respect for them.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, while we are in the middle of a 50-year-plus peace process, making those changes is not going to happen next year.  One of the difficulties here is that people do not see how it is possible to make the changes.  It is too difficult.  One of the things I will be saying to the independent review, as well as to this committee, is that we need a 20- or 30-year roadmap of how we can make these changes over time.  The longer we put that off, however, and do not have such a roadmap in place, the longer this peace process is going to last.  We will end up not having a 50-year-plus peace process, but a 70-year peace process.  We must take the necessary decisions about systemic change and what causes division, and not continue to try to just manage those existing divisions.  By the way, the roadmap process, if we lay it out, would be like eating an elephant.  It would involve doing it one step at a time and one bite at a time, and we would get there eventually.  We must, however, have the roadmap in place to specify responsibilities on everybody at each stage.<\/p> <p>  I do not disagree about teacher training.  That is absolutely right.  Why on earth would we do it this way?  If people said they were going into medical training to become a GP and we asked them whether they wanted to make Protestants or Catholics better, because, depending on the answer, the person in question would go to a different college to train how to be a doctor, what sort of madness would that be?  Yet that is what happens in teacher training, by and large.  Before the next round of PEACE funds comes in, I would suggest that we slice off &pound;30 million, or whatever the figure is, to build a bespoke, state-of-the-art, best-in-the-world teacher training college that is going to be the teacher training college.  I would then put a five- or ten-year process in place to move into that kind of system.  <\/p> <p>  We are talking about adults here.  These trainee teachers, by and large, are men and women in their 20s and we must have them train together to be teachers.  I am sorry, but I could go on all day about some of this stuff.  Whenever there is a system where people are brought up, by and large, in one sector or another, for example, where they go to school with Protestants or Catholics, and they are from that background, what happens later?  We then put them into teacher training colleges, where, predominantly, they are trained how to be teachers in the company of other Protestants or Catholics.  They then go to take their placements in controlled schools with Protestants or maintained schools with Catholics.<\/p><p>They then go and take their placements in controlled schools with Protestants or maintained schools with Catholics.  They then go and become teachers in controlled schools with Protestants or maintained schools with Catholics.  Then we say to the teachers, who are the best placed people to influence the young folk in their classrooms to be better citizens and engage in cross-community activity with other people from other backgrounds, that they should go ahead and do that.  The teachers are saying, of all the trades that could have been picked, we are one of the trades that has less experience of being in a place with people from another community background, and, therefore, there is a lack of confidence to do that within teachers.

I thank Mr. Osborne for his wonderful presentation.  I greatly appreciate it.  Without a shadow of a doubt, it is quite clear that integrated education is excellent education.  It is a very important sector in the education system.  It is a sector that I want to see increase and grow in the North of Ireland over the next number of years.  From my perspective and from the perspective of Aont&uacute;, we believe in a pluralist education system.  I probably would disagree with the idea that all schools should become integrated schools.  Parents should be able to choose which school they send their children to.  That has to remain a key element of a liberal democratic education system - that there is a pluralism of ethos and that parents and children can select the ethos they wish to go to.<\/p> <p>  I agree that there is a difficulty in the lack of integrated options and choices in the North of Ireland at the moment.  The point about having a statutory planning unit officially with in the Department of Education there is very important to drive the sector there.  <\/p> <p>  I do not disagree with any of the language that I have heard today, but some of the language outside of this debate can be a little bit difficult at times.  I have heard other people outside of this debate mention that Catholic schools and Protestant schools are parcels of hate and they are the cause of the divisions in North of Ireland.  It is very important that we say that the Catholic and Protestant schools are not cause of the divisions in the North of Ireland and that they are excellent schools and they valued elements of the education system in the North of Ireland.  For many nationalists, especially, Catholic schools are very important because for many years they felt that the only official section of society that their history, language and culture was protected in within the North of Ireland were those schools. <\/p> <p>  In the South of Ireland, obviously, there is a need to remove many schools from the Catholic sector and to make more multidenominational and interdenominational schools available.  There is a big push for that.  When it happens, oftentimes, to a specific school, one will find that parents often have a difficulty with the change in the school that they went to and, indeed, perhaps where their parents went to as well.  <\/p> <p>  My question is similar to Ms Hanna&rsquo;s.  How do we get to a fully pluralist education system; an education system where parents can choose the education for their children?  What is the process?  What is necessary?  First and foremost, what is the stumbling block?<\/p> <p>  I recently met with representatives of a Gaelscoil school in Dungiven, south Derry, and they mentioned the lack of a statutory planning function within the education system.  It seems that the department itself is a laggard in terms of recognising the new political and societal landscape that exists.  Perhaps that is where some of the effort needs to be focused.  <\/p> <p>  In the South, when a new school is being built, there is a process where parents are surveyed as to their desire of the patronage of that school.  Is there a similar process in the North of Ireland?  There is also a process for schools that want to migrate or transition from one patronage to another.  Is that the same in the North?  One of the speakers mentioned that the transformation process is there but it is very slow, almost glacial, in its development.  I would appreciate if those three elements could be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022012700002#G00300","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643241600,"counter":668,"content":"<p>Perhaps I can clarify on the matters regarding the Department of Education.  The current system within the department maintains the <i>status quo<\/i>.  It should also be borne in mind that the number of children has dropped in Norther Ireland, so we have too many school places and schools.  It is very hard to grow against that background.<br\/><br\/>Generally, the Department of Education does not ask parents what they want for the future.  Parents assume that of what they have got, that is the choice.  Therefore, if you do not have an integrated school in place, you are not going to get one.  It has to be up to parents to start that themselves.  <br\/><br\/>The transformation of a school from a maintained or controlled school to integrated education is a long process.  I would like to see the process speeded up, but it requires the school to think about the changes and bring the parents with them as well.  The parents are part of that process.  First, they have to vote it through on a parental ballot.  They get that opportunity to vote their school to transform.  They then want to be part of the process.  They have to think through what they want to do, such as what sports they want to bring and what changes they want to make.  That change takes time.  The slowness is probably, in regard to the Department of Education, in approving that.  That usually takes about two years; that would probably be the period of time.  However, the school will take longer in bringing in the changes.  <br\/><br\/>The department just assumes it knows what parents want.  That is the <i>status quo <\/i>and nothing will change.

I would need to go back and check over the past number of years, perhaps even the past decade or two, but that increase is a regular trend around the numbers of people who like the principle of their children going to a school where they can learn and develop with children from other backgrounds.  There are a number of issues that have stopped that and not all of them are negative.  Some of them are understandable.  Examples of those have been touched on and include parents wanting their children to go to the same school they went to and other practical issues.  It certainly could be helped by the work that the Integrated Education Fund and NICIE do at the moment.  As Ms Merron said, perhaps another 30 schools are on the runway.  That takes a lot of resources.  The situation would be helped by extra resources.  That is why funding, for example through the reconciliation fund, is important and appreciated from our end.<\/p> <p>  We do not have time to go into the issue but I touched on isolated pairs of schools.  There are 64 schools, 32 pairs of schools, in rural villages and in 26 of those 32, at least one school is below the threshold for sustainability, and sometimes both schools are.  If the area planning model changed to make the assumption that the first thing to be done is the exploration of the amalgamation of those schools to ensure sustainable schools in villages, which is important to those villages, that policy change to the system would be significant in terms of the numbers we could look for over the next five or ten years.

There are some great schools across the sectors and we do not want to lose them.  On the question as to whether the education system is a recipe for failure, it is not.

Those attending remotely from within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present within the complex.  Members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy, and it is my duty as Chair to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks, and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I invite the Minister of State to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012700002#A00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1643241600,"counter":700,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the committee for affording us the opportunity to brief them on the proposed monuments and archaeological heritage Bill.  The Chair has outlined our officials.  I welcome Emer Connolly, the recently appointed director of the National Monuments Service; Michael MacDonagh; Se&aacute;n Kirwan; Nessa Foley; and Se&aacute;n Carpenter, who recently joined our team as well.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the Bill&rsquo;s general scheme, which was approved by the Government on 30 November 2021, and I thank the committee for the speed with which we are now able to commence the pre-legislative scrutiny process.<\/p> <p>  The proposed monuments and archaeological heritage Bill is important legislation that has been in development for a number of years.  It both revises and replaces the existing legislative framework, which is nearly 100 years old, and introduces a range of innovative provisions to help bolster some of the systems and processes currently in place.  Overall, it seeks to provide for the effective safeguarding and conservation of our treasured archaeological heritage.  It is my hope that if enacted, it can continue to protect our monuments for another 100 years to come.<\/p> <p>  The National Monuments Act 1930 was inventive and forward-looking in its time, as were the various amending Acts over the decades.  However, those multiple amendments, combined with multiple transfers of functions, have left us with fragmented legislation that is far from being easily accessible and comprehensible.  Moreover, the legislative scheme as it stands leaves some significant gaps and is unclear and inconsistent in significant areas.  These include overlapping systems for protecting monuments, lack of clarity in some key definitions, overlapping licensing requirements, absence of any protection for new discoveries of archaeological monuments and a lack of clarity as to the role of the Office of Public Works in regard to the management of the portfolio of national monuments in the care of the State.  The proposed legislation aims to address all of these structural issues, as well as to provide a single accessible item of legislation.<\/p> <p>  One of the core purposes of the proposed Bill is to protect monuments and the first of several innovative ideas to be found in the general scheme is the concept of a prescribed monument.  Regulations to be introduced under the enacted Bill will set out classes of structures and sites that are of archaeological interest and these structures and sites will then become prescribed monuments.  The purpose of this approach is to ensure that newly-discovered archaeological sites have immediate protection, thus ending one of the major inconsistencies in existing legislation.<\/p><p>The term \"prescribed monument\" is one of two terms that when grouped together will define what a \"monument\" is under the proposed Bill, the other being a \"registered monument\".  A \"registered monument\" will refer to something entered into a newly established register of monuments.  In general, any structure or site that is of archaeological, architectural, artistic, historic or traditional interest may be eligible for entry into the register.  When we refer to monuments under the proposed Bill, we refer to prescribed monuments and registered monuments.  This is but one example found throughout the general scheme where attempts are made to simplify terminology and definitions, especially because some of the terminology under the existing National Monuments Acts can be confusing and inconsistent in places.<\/p><p> Ireland ratified the 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention in 1991.  Part 3 of the proposed Bill will define the term &ldquo;world heritage property&rdquo; in Irish law for the first time.  Importantly, there are a number of other significant international conventions that can be given effect to under the proposed Bill, should Government decide to ratify them.  These conventions cover matters of global importance such as the illegal trade of stolen cultural property and the protection of underwater cultural heritage.<\/p><p> The intricate licensing and consent requirements provided for under existing legislation are to be replaced by a single integrated licensing system, thereby ending the situation whereby a single activity might require several different licences or consents.  Furthermore, an appeal process for licensing decisions is to be introduced for the first time.  This new licensing system is an example of the intention to have legislation that is innovative yet balanced, promoting regulatory reform and procedural fairness while at the same time strengthening heritage protection.<\/p><p> As things stand, criminal proceedings are the only enforcement option available to authorities.  The planned enforcement notice system will be a major innovation that will see workable and robust civil enforcement powers that can be introduced to aid enforcement and help ensure compliance with the legislation without the need for criminal proceedings.<\/p><p> Throughout the development of the general scheme, there has been detailed engagement with other Departments and a range of key stakeholders.  I acknowledge the broad support the general scheme has received to date.  Please be assured that, where required, my officials will be in contact with their counterparts in other Departments and with other organisations as the Bill is developed and drafted.<\/p><p> My officials and I welcome the questions committee members may have.  I will ask the officials to respond to a number of them.  We look forward to the questions and to ongoing engagement with the committee.  The committee has always been very proactive in taking a very comprehensive view of legislation brought forward.  We look forward to this engagement in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012700002#A00300","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643241600,"counter":702,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

The Minister of State might explain how the proposed legislation may benefit the protection of these two monuments.  I do not expect the Minister of State to have all of the specific details.  The national monument on Moore Street is a very important site and it is the national monument that is most referred to.  Dublin City Council has given permission for development in the curtilage of the national monument.  There is also the battlefield site.  Will the Minister of State use these sites to explain some of the benefits of the new legislation?  How will such sites be protected?  There was a huge campaign by civic society to protect not only the core headquarters but also the surrounding buildings and laneways.  Will the Minister of State use these sites as an example to speak about the benefits of the legislation?  How will the Bill protect other sites?

There is already protection in existing legislation for sites such as Moore Street.  Where the Bill would have a role is that there are added elements in terms of licensing for works around the curtilage of such sites.  There is an innovation in the Bill with regard to sites of archaeological interest and sites that could be described as prescribed monuments.  If they are identified by members of the public to the national monument service, they will be provided a level of protection once they are on the register of monuments.  This is one of the key innovations in the legislation with regard to other sites.

One of the gaps in the existing legislation is that before a preservation order is made, in addition to showing something is of national importance, the Minister must be satisfied that something is under a specific threat.  The new legislation would assign a high level of protection and this would allow a more proactive approach, subject to resources being available to select sites and being appropriate in a particular case.  Sites could be entered in the register and assigned the highest level of protection on a proactive basis well in advance of any particular issue emerging in regard to them.  This would be significantly stronger than where we are at present.  Not only does the Minister have to show or be of the opinion that something is of national importance at present, he or she must also take the view there is a specific threat to it.  The new legislation will certainly allow a stronger and more proactive approach and clear up any doubt as to what can be included in the register and the wide scope of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012700002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Kirwan"},{"type":"speech","time":1643241600,"counter":706,"content":"<p>Is there an update on the specific proposals for the opening of an interpretive centre at the national monument on Moore Street?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012700002#B00600","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643241600,"counter":707,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms Connolly to speak on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012700002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael MacDonagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643241600,"counter":708,"content":"<p>We are in very close talks with the Office of Public Works, OPW, with a view to progressing this very shortly.

The Bill has been a long time coming.  I remember it being on the list of promised legislation in 2002.  At least we have the heads of a Bill.  I have gone through them and good work has been done.<\/p><p>There have been additions and clarifications.<\/p><p> In terms of the point that has just been made about the curtilage, it is not just the curtilage but the surrounding area, which suggests more than a curtilage in head 9.  That would have probably saved a lot more buildings on Moore Street than is suggested at the moment but I am not going to dwell on Moore Street as we had discussion previously.<\/p><p> As well as the modernisation of legislation and defining the licensing process, which is welcome, there is no definition of a \"monument\".  It is a building, mound or structure for most people.  As far as I know, there are national monuments that are artefacts.  Perhaps the Minister of State will tell me whether the Book of Kells is a national monument; we know that it is a national treasure.  If that is the case then it would be appropriate to have a greater definition than what we have at the moment because it just states: &ldquo;monument&rdquo; means &ndash; (a) a registered monument, or (b) a prescribed monument'.  The definition does not say what the monument itself is but maybe that is an oversight.<\/p><p> It is good that there is now a proposed list of preserved or protected buildings.  There is a need for the relationship between the list that the State will have, as in the national monuments list, and those that the council often holds, which are specific buildings and might not be as important as national ones but there needs to be some relationship or connection.<\/p><p> There is nothing in the Bill thus far regarding a crime.  I ask that a crime be created to make it illegal to hide a discovery because of the increase in building works around the city.  We know that in the past there were occasions when building works happened and to avoid delays, because of archaeological digs and the like, some builders papered over the cracks, laid concrete or removed material.  It is a crime to interfere with archaeological artefacts and I am concerned about this.<\/p><p> With regard to territorial waters around Ireland, we have a 12-mile, 50-mile and 200-mile limits.  So far only the 12-mile limit has been mentioned in pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p><p> Finally, throughout the Bill reference is made to the board of the National Museum rather than to the director and I do not know whether the director would be active.  The board only meets once a month or once every two months and I do not know whether the board would have the capability to deal with some of the proposals in the PLS, which will require faster action. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012700002#B01100","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643241600,"counter":713,"content":"<p>Certainly there is a definition of \"monument\" in the Bill and that is clarified.

The general scheme refers to a monument being either a prescribed or a registered monument.  The idea here is to simplify some of the terminology that we use.  A prescribed monument is basically going to be a relevant thing and it will be a broad definition.  Structures and sites that are of archaeological interest will be eligible to be prescribed and, therefore, the Minister will set out regulations and they will define what a prescribed monument is.<\/p> <p>  By way of background, the idea is to fill a gap in the existing legislation where newly discovered monuments, in many cases, do not have any legal protection afforded to them until they are designated a monument.  The idea here is that by prescribing them we will be able to afford that level of legal protection to them before they are even discovered as such.<\/p> <p>  Second, there is registered monuments.  Again, it is a relevant thing so we are talking about structures and sites.  The definition is slightly broader so as opposed to just being of archaeological interest, it will be of relevant interest.  We are talking archaeological interest, architectural interest, historical interest, etc.  Those two terms are defined in head 2.  Either those prescribed monuments or the registered monuments will be what we are talking about when we refer to a monument in the actual Bill.<\/p> <p>  Under head 8, when it comes to the prescribed monuments there will be a requirement to report finds of prescribed monuments.  Again, we will set out in regulations exactly how that is meant to happen.  The idea will be that within something like a 72-hour period after finding, or believing one has found, a prescribed monument that it will have to be reported to either the Minister or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  Finally, regarding underwater cultural heritage, our territorial waters and the contiguous zone, etc., at the moment we have the 12 nautical mile and 24 nautical mile jurisdictions where we can apply some of the laws as if we are dealing with archaeological objects and monuments on land.  What we are hoping to do is make provision for the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.  That will extend the scope out to a 200-mile radius where either certain relevant people, be it a captain of an Irish registered ship or an Irish resident, if they are engaged in certain activities or if the discover underwater cultural heritage they will be obliged to report those finds to the Minister.  I hope that those provisions will widen the scope of what we can do in the context of protecting underwater cultural heritage.<\/p> <p>  As regards the question on the board of the National Museum of Ireland and the director, I ask Mr. Kirwan to provide some background. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Carpenter"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643241600,"counter":715,"content":"<p>The Deputy is entirely correct to point out that there is a change in what is proposed from the existing legislative scheme where the National Museum, when it is referred to, will be referred to in terms of the director of the museum.  By way of explanation, the existing National Monuments Acts are quite old and go back to 1930, and there have been several Acts since.  Most of their provisions were enacted before the National Museum had been set up under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 as a body outside of the Civil Service with its own board.  It was considered appropriate in the drafting the general scheme that we should reflect that in formally assigning powers.  I mean that the museum will have those and formally assign those to the board.  In the detailed drafting of that I would expect that there would be provision to deal with the point that the Deputy raised about the board being able to authorise the director to carry out certain functions on behalf of the board so that there would not be any lack of continuity.  The director would have powers on an ongoing basis, or other authorised officers, to deal with the day-to-day implementation of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012700002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Kirwan"},{"type":"speech","time":1643241600,"counter":716,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked how the Book of Kells is classified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012700002#C00500","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643241600,"counter":717,"content":"<p>Mr. Kirwan would be best to answer that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012700002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael MacDonagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643241600,"counter":718,"content":"<p>It would certainly, I think, meet the definition of archaeological object under the existing legislation.

Under existing law and under what is proposed here it is a criminal offence to alter an archaeological object without a licence, in practice issued by the National Museum.  We would anticipate that would continue under the proposed scheme.  Certainly, the definition of archaeological object, and I will not go into the detail, but any object that really has a greater value by reason of the archaeological interest attaching to it, and that is its own intrinsic value, which is the core of the definition, would be an archaeological object and is under existing law.

Equally, there are many listed buildings that will fall down and become obsolete because of a lack of investment.  Who is responsible for this?  Who will fund it?  Is it the case that when one encounters an issue like this, one contacts the local authority?

We have quite a broad definition of what a relevant thing may be.  For a thing to be considered a prescribed monument there must be a level of archaeological interest associated with it.

Some of these historical monument designations are now being brought into houses under the listing of the local authorities, for example where a ceiling in a house is listed.  From the point of view of me getting investors into a town or village, consider the situation where a whole town or village is saying that everything is a monument or historical.  Then we will get nobody to come back into our historical streets where people had lived, and where we want people to live now.  I am afraid that this will put on another layer, and slow down the redevelopment of historical towns.  There has to be a cut-off point with regard to what is a historical monument.  The post office in Kilmallock was a historical monument.  It has been brought back into use and now the credit union is there.  It has retained its old state and it is fantastic to see it being reused. There are other places within the town, however, where people were trying to move into them and could not get insurance in one part of the house, and the cost of doing up the listed part of the house far outweighed putting on a new extension to the back of it, where the historical face could have been kept along with the roof structure.

They also, to be eligible for entry into the register of monuments, would have to meet the further criterion of being of relevant interest so they would have to be of archaeological interest, historical interest or architectural interest.  These are the criteria and one or more of those would bring a structure, etc. to be a relevant thing of relevant interest.

Head 2 does not contain a definition of a monument although it defines historic heritage and historic interest.  The definition of \"relevant thing\" contains a reference to an artificial structure but there is no definition of a monument.  The reason that I think this is a problem with the Bill becomes particularly clear or acute when one talks about architectural or built heritage.  Most people think of a monument as an obelisk, a cross, a symbol of some kind and not a building that is occupied by people.  Built heritage is the buildings, particularly the historically important buildings in cities, town and rural landscape.  If one looks at the definitions there is talk of architectural heritage but from what period?  Could a building that was built 20, 50 or 90 years ago be considered architectural heritage?  Of course it could because heritage simply means, by definition, the things or cultural inheritance from the people before us so our parents, grandparents, etc. but that is not clear from the Bill.  I appreciate that Mr. Carpenter does not want to keep having to revise to the legislation but there is a risk by making the definitions too broad that things will fall out and I will give a couple of examples.<\/p> <p>  The definition for \"historic interest\" refers, in general, to historic events, associations with people, etc.  The definition includes \"representative of ... periods\".  The definition would be much better if it included the words \"representative of historic styles\".  I say that because, particularly with architecture from the 17th century, 18th century, 19th century and 20th century, such styles may not be representative of a period but still really important to be recognised.  I make these points because, as the Minister knows, I have a particular interest in 20th century architecture.  For example, I believe that Collinstown Airport should be an historic monument under the terms of this legislation but it is not clear that it would fit into any of this.  Collinstown Airport is a hugely important 20th century piece of architecture and Bus&aacute;ras is another example.  It is not that one would declare as a national monument every bit of 20th century architecture but those that are particularly important.  I worry that they jar a little bit with the definitions in the Bill.  This matter is important because a very large volume of our 20th century built heritage has been knocked down.  For example, Robin Walker's Bord F&aacute;ilte building and Fitzwilton House.  Some of these buildings people think of as the ugliest buildings that have ever been seen such as River House, which is a former motor tax office located at the back of the Four Courts.  Such buildings are an integral part of the built heritage of this country and I worry that the definitions are not broad enough.<\/p> <p>  Should we not think about making this a Bill not just about national monuments and archaeological heritage but also built heritage?  Should we be much more explicit that built heritage and architecture is a central part of this legislation?  Should we not be a little bit more explicit in our definitions to ensure that the general perception of heritage, as being an older thing, does not, by default, become the interpretation of the Bill?  To be slightly flippant, everybody should know or Dubs should know the \"Why go Bald?\" neon sign located at the bottom of Georges Street and Dame Street.  The sign got heritage funding, and rightly so, because it a really important piece of this city's built heritage, albeit it an object rather than a building.  I appeal to the delegation to respond to my concern that the built heritage, particularly the modern built heritage is not explicitly protected in the Bill and could fall foul of that.  I will explain my reason for saying that.  With respect to 17th century, 18th century and 19th century built heritage, that has often fallen into dereliction, then there is a big fuss and then we restore it just like Customs House, the GPO and other sites.  Let us make sure that we do not make the same mistake with 20th century built heritage and instead preserve and maintain the really important examples so that future generations do not have to dol with Bus&aacute;ras or Collinstown what our generation or that of our parents have had to with the Customs House or other such important buildings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012700002#H00800","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1643241600,"counter":776,"content":"<p>I share Deputy &Oacute; Broin's interest in 20th century architecture.

The national inventory of architectural heritage was updated with another 1,400 structures for recommendation to elected members of Dublin City Council, including street furniture and other features such as the \"Why go bald\" sign.  The Deputy is absolutely correct that it was funded.  All of these structures are of huge social and cultural interest as well as architectural interest.  I am not sure whether putting them under the aegis of the Bill would afford them additional protection.  Perhaps they would fall under the ownership of the Minister directly.  At least under the record of protected structures there is local control with local elected members and local councils.  I am not sure whether anyone else wants to comment on this.  The architectural policy of the Department will be published shortly.  This policy statement will be most welcome.

There is clearly plenty of scope in the general scheme for quite recent structures on the basis of being of architectural or historic interest.  Even if they are not of particular architectural interest but had an historic association there would be no difficulty if the Minister of the day was satisfied the applicable criteria had been met for them to go into the register.<\/p> <p>  Clearly there is a policy issue regarding which piece of legislation is involved, as the Minister of State touched on.  There can be debate as to whether planning law is a better way to deal with some contemporary structures rather than legislation such as this with a central authority.  That is more a question of the implementation of the legislation rather than its underlying structure.

My concern from reading the heads is that they are not as explicit as they could be.  I urge the team and the Minister of State to consider this issue and the word style of the definitions, particularly \"historic interest\".  Architecture is not just about what happened in the building, although this is crucial and the Minister of State has covered it very clearly in terms of relations with historic events or historic people.  There is also the issue of style.  It should be more explicit.  The reason I mentioned Collinstown and Bus&aacute;ras is because they very clearly have a status way above their protected structure.

Mountjoy Square is the finest and most perfect of the five Georgian squares in Dublin.  Will this in and of itself as a square be defined as a monument?  Will the components of it have to be individually defined as monuments?  Senator Seery Kearney mentioned the former Magdalen laundry site on Se&aacute;n MacDermott Street.  I could also mention the courthouse on Green Street, Col&aacute;iste Mhuire on Parnell Square and the individual modern and historic built structures in Dublin's north inner city.  I support the legislation.  We need to recognise that while updating the legislation is important, the real-life activity on protecting, restoring and developing our historic sites and monuments has to be accelerated.  The deterioration and dereliction is shameful.  I cannot let today's discussion go by without saying this.<\/p> <p>  I am interested to understand how the penalties will apply.  How were the proposed maximum penalties of up to five years imprisonment and a fine of up to &euro;10 million benchmarked?  How did the Department come up with these as potential penalties?

When we talk about prescribed monuments, we have that concept of a relevant thing, which is broad, but there has to be an archaeological interest for it to be a prescribed monument.  Prescribed monuments are those structures, sites etc. with an archaeological interest.  The Minister will be empowered to make secondary legislation and prescribe what they are.  We can afford a level of protection to them.  That is what the core pillar of the Bill is about.  It is about protecting and conserving monuments and archaeological heritage.  <\/p> <p>  When we talk about registered monuments, we have the \"relevant thing\" concept again, the same definition, and then it is slightly broadened in terms of the \"relevant interest\" that is included.  That refers to archaeological, architectural, artistic, historic etc.  While in head 2 we do not have definitions for some of those terms, work is under way to specify what they will be.  When we have draft legislation, we will be able to have a good discussion around whether they are adequate or not.  <\/p> <p>I ask Mr. MacDonagh to come in on the discussion around Mountjoy Square etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012700002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Carpenter"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643241600,"counter":786,"content":"<p>I will come in first on deterioration.  It is not proposed to make deterioration an offence.  Given the wide range of things and structures proposed to be covered by the Bill, such as ruined castles, it would be onerous and unfair for owners of such antiquities to be put under an offence of deterioration.  The focus of the Minister of State and the Department is to provide significant additional funding to private owners for the upkeep of monuments and we hope that will continue.   Through the newly established community monuments fund, the historic structures fund etc., we are providing money through local authorities to private owners.  In the case of the community monuments fund, there is 100% funding to enable the upkeep of antiquities and monuments of which they are the proud custodians and stewards, to protect them from falling down and for future generations.<\/p> <p>  On the national heritage estate, we work closely with our Office of Public Works colleagues on conserving our wonderful national monuments and historic properties in the Minister's ownership and care.  <\/p> <p>  In areas such as Mountjoy Square, there is clearly a lot of overlap with built heritage legislation and planning law.  As Mr. Kirwan pointed out, there are cases in which we will have to look at which legislation suits better and offers better protection.  Those are things we will look at down the line.  There are varying levels and pieces of legislation which can help protect those.  There is the Town Centres First policy and the forthcoming policy on architecture.

It has been a useful exercise and exchange of commentary.  We have slightly erred and strayed into the area of built heritage.  It is clearly a different strand and is reasonably well protected.  We have the record of protected structures.  People spoke about Mountjoy Square.  We have architectural conservation areas to deal with that.  We have city and county development plans that do the job well and are obliged to keep a record of protected structures.  It is best placed there and close to the ground in relation to local government.  People are active and proactive at that level.  It is constantly reviewed and one can add a building to the record of protected structures through three mechanisms, which I will not go into.  That is live, active and in the heart of communities and I think it is best left there.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of issues, including planning law and the issue of the national monuments law.  There is a huge overlap.  We are familiar with the 31 local planning authorities, all with statutory county development plans.  They are clearly mapped.  I am familiar with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown because I live there and was a councillor there for over 20 years.  All the monuments are mapped out there.  We have the famous Carrickmines Castle that many are aware of.  At all times it is incumbent on the planners through pre-planning or any discussions about it that there is some discussion regarding these identified sites.  They are not all identified but the ones registered or on the lists are identified.  There is a real role for the local authority and we do not want to duplicate process so I recommend, if it is not already there, that there be greater synergy with local authority mapping so we can clearly see it there.  The Land Development Agency has done extensive mapping of lands across the country.  There may be synergy and building of data and information that we should explore.<\/p> <p>  Who will keep the inventory?  Who will add to it, particularly in relation to monuments?  How does one revoke a monument?  We have a hotel called the Radisson Blu St. Helens Hotel that the President, when a Minister, designated a national monument.<\/p><p>However, it could be very well argued that it should be a protected structure.  We have to look at things.  We never set something in stone.  That is a functioning hotel.<\/p><p> There may be a case to revisit some of the designations.  There is always a case to revisit protected structures, particularly at a time when we are looking to develop our towns and cities.  I just wanted to make that point.<\/p><p> What is do the witnesses see in relation to the county development plan process and that relationship?<\/p><p> On guardianship, especially in relation to structures mentioned, guardianship means a monument remains privately owned but the Minister or the local authority becomes responsible for the maintenance.  Therefore, the local authority could become responsible for the maintenance.  There are big funding issues here and big funding implications for private owners as well.  I am not saying that has to be addressed; that is the reality of it.  How does the Minister of State envisage the funding, particularly of local authorities?  That is an area I want to get into.  The power to revoke or remove a monument from the list is an important one we need to understand because we, of course, can change protected structures.<\/p><p> I am a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Given the land mass of this country in terms of agriculture, sustainable agriculture, utilisation of lands and agriculture, and issues around access to national monuments and structures, has the Minister of State had any engagement with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  The Minister of State said he had interdepartmental discussions with a range of key stakeholders.  Will he touch on that?  Perhaps he might share with us how he looked at the best practice internationally on this.<\/p><p> I will wrap up by talking about the Valletta Convention, which was ratified in 1997.  It is a very important convention that covers this area.  Somebody may have already suggested it, but I would like to see it considered to be added to the Long Title of the Bill.  There has to be clear reference to the Valletta Convention.  It is critical.<\/p><p> There are just some thoughts.  Other issues are mapping and registration.  Who centrally controls the register?  There is a role for local authorities in that, or certainly an overlap and a sharing of data.  That is very important.

Enforcement of all of these things is very important, and I note from the memo and detailed documents attached to this discussion today that enforcement is the issue.  All of the legislation in the world is no good unless we can enforce it.  I accept we do not want to go down the legal route as it is a last resort for many people, but is there a role for the planning regulator in it?  He has statutory functions and statutory oversights and can make certain recommendations.  Certainly, it is something we should look at.

It is giving statutory effect to what has been going on for a long time in terms of there being a national archaeological survey of Ireland that the national monuments service maintains on behalf of the Minister.  It is also continuing on the national inventory of architectural heritage and the historic wreck inventory.  All of those are national functions and it is a national data source, so that is maintained and run by the Department.  Of course, it feeds very much into what local authorities do because it is a data source that is available to them to draw on, as we have noted in relation to their development plans and so forth.  Therefore, it is a national source.<\/p> <p>  Again, in terms of what goes into the register, the power of entry in the register vests in the Minister.  It is something that runs distinct from planning law and that is an important distinction to bear in mind.

It will maintain that distinction.  It will not take away from the role of local authorities in the record of protected structures.  It will be a national system and the Minister will be the person who, in law, determines what goes into the register and what might be taken out of it if deemed appropriate, at a future stage.

The witnesses might comment on that.  Where there is a known owner of an archaeological object, the State will give power for compulsory acquisition.<\/p> <p>  Second, I agree with you, Chairman, about the interim protection.  That is very important.  We see that in protected structures, of course.  When a protected structure is designated as such or there is a candidate ACA, it has a certain protection.  That is very important because it is usually a critical time.  Once one alerts people about the intention to protect something, things can happen very quickly.  The interim measure being discussed is a good and strong one, which I endorse.<\/p> <p>  I will wrap up by referring to Part 9 on issuing the guidelines on relevant matters of co-operation to other bodies in heritage protection.

There were fantastic questions and certainly a lot of food for thought for us.  The point made about the provision of records and the compiling of records in the course of licensed activities is critical.  Archiving that material and making it publicly available is something the National Monuments Service has done very well, particularly over the course of the pandemic when a great deal of good aerial footage and other footage, photographic and otherwise, of our national monuments has been made available online.  It has added greatly to the public understanding and appreciation of our national monuments and archaeology.  It is an ongoing process of engagement that we all must collectively be involved in for the protection, care and conservation of our built and archaeological heritage.<\/p> <p>  I probably forgot to mention the sectoral climate change and adaptation plan that was carried out, interdisciplinary, in the Department.  Again, that entails a broad community-based approach to future-proofing our archaeological heritage and built heritage for future generations.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of the day and other relevant bodies will be given power to promote research and to provide assistance to other persons or bodies to publish relevant material and promote knowledge and awareness of monuments and archeological heritage.

As members are aware, I am the CEO of NBI.  I am joined by T.J. Malone, who is the CEO of NBI deployment and leads the team building the NBI network.  In addition, we have senior management team members: Ms Tara Collins, responsible for marketing and communications, Barry Kelly, who is in finance, and Ms Jenny Fisher, who oversees governance and the interface with the Department with responsibility for communications.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for their attendance at our offices in mid-October when we also took the opportunity to witness the operations in a nearby deployment area.  It was a pleasure to present first-hand how the NBI network is being deployed and I strongly believe these field trips are informative and helpful as it is always hard to convey the size, scale and complexity of the NBP without this context.<\/p> <p>  As the CEO of NBI, I remain incredibly proud of the work our team is delivering, particularly against a backdrop of the turbulent conditions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Across the project, we have already made major achievements.  Almost 294,000 premises have been surveyed, of which more than 252,000 are designed or are in detailed design.  These activities are vital precursors to the main build and are continuing at pace.  It is the survey and design activities that are creating the pipeline for the build works and, ultimately, for premises to be passed.  Some 54,450 premises are currently able to place their order via their preferred retail service provider.  There are more than 154,000 premises constructed or under construction.  For context, the original plan would have seen us at approximately 180,000 premises at this stage of the programme.  Some 454 broadband connection points, BCPs including schools, have been installed by NBI.  Nationally across all 26 counties, we have BCPs and schools connected.  We have also increased our minimum speeds from 150 Mbps to offer 500 Mbps as the minimum speed, as well as offering 1 GB and 2 GB products.   <\/p> <p>  We recently announced we are delivering high-speed broadband infrastructure to six islands off the coast of counties Donegal and Mayo.  In our view, building this world-class infrastructure now ensures that all people and businesses on the islands will have access to a broadband network capable of supporting the communications, information, education and entertainment requirements of current and future generations.<\/p><p>Some 50 retail service providers, RSPs, have already signed up to sell services on the NBI network.  This is expected to bring significant benefits directly to consumers and businesses where competition between RSPs ensures better quality and an increased range of products, all being offered at competitive prices. <\/p><p> Since contract award, NBI has built an organisation to deliver the project with predictability and pace.  As we roll out the network, we have encountered a number of issues, the majority of which have been beyond our direct control, meaning it is difficult to predict completion dates for premises with absolute certainty.  While this is inevitable in the early days of delivery of a project of this nature, I appreciate that it can cause some frustration when seeking to communicate with stakeholders.  In relation to 2022, it is important that I provide some context to the size and scale of our current work that is under way and how the volume of activity has substantially increased.  As mentioned previously, right now more than 154,000 premises are either constructed or under construction.  The equivalent figure this time last year was approximately 19,000.  When we appeared before the committee last September, the same metric was 108,000.  Members can see how this is ramping up and how it will directly feed into the premises passed and connection numbers in time.  We believe this metric is the leading indicator in terms of delivering the programme.  Having such a significant volume already in the pipeline means that the capacity is there to move through the various stages of build to completion and ultimately, to get users connected to this vital infrastructure.  <\/p><p> Additionally, we are implementing a series of initiatives that lend confidence to delivery in 2022.  We have contracted with Eir to increase the volume of pole replacement and duct installation.  This commenced from 1 October 2021.  We have submitted all of the Eir Make Ready packs required to support the build in 2022 to Eir for validation.  Eir has provided committed start dates.  We have now awarded contracts to our build partners for 195,000 premises.  Other operational efficiencies and experiences gathered from the initial deployment areas are being industrialised to assist with project delivery.  For example, 35 of the 40 section 254 licensing requirements to support the 2022 deployment have already been submitted to the local authorities.  By way of contrast, NBI was only able to submit the majority of the section 254 licences requirements for 2021 after the new process supported by the local authorities was launched in May of last year.<\/p><p> As the Eir make-ready works are completed in advance of NBI's contractors commencing the main works and we incorporate the lessons we have learned in the past 12 months into our planning processes, we are confident that we will be able to provide greater accuracy and predictability in future projections for the programme.  We also believe that it will be possible to increase the trajectory of the deployment programme over the coming years. <\/p><p> Turning to other matters, I can appreciate that some recent media attention on the shareholder structure of NBI may have caused concern for members of the committee. I would like to draw members' attention - and that of the public - to assurances from both NBI and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications confirming \"the ownership structure remains as it was at the signing of the contract\".  As a business, we are concerned about a series of inaccuracies and-or misleading claims in certain media reports surrounding our shareholdings and broader financial matters, most notably reporting that suggests subsidy payments to NBI were somehow used for reimbursing shareholders for bid costs associated with the tender process.  I want to make it abundantly clear and categorically put on the record that the subsidy provided by the State is in satisfaction of NBI delivering defined milestones under the project agreement.  NBI has not been and will not be paid by the State if it does not deliver these milestones.  We are seeking to resolve the media inaccuracies and misrepresentations on an ongoing basis. <\/p><p> I would like to conclude by saying that at NBI, we are acutely aware of how vital reliable, high-speed broadband has become to our lives.  We believe that despite the extreme and turbulent conditions faced throughout the project to date, the work of our team provides a platform and gives us confidence to deliver the project on time and on budget.  We welcome the opportunity to take questions from the committee and look forward to its continued support in the delivery of this project for the citizens of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022012700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hendrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643241600,"counter":829,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hendrick.

It was helpful also that we had the opportunity to meet with National Broadband Ireland on site.  I will follow on from the comments by my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  Perhaps the witnesses will come back to us with a detailed outline of issues National Broadband Ireland has that we might be able to resolve through our engagement with the Department.  Rather than going back over those waters, it would be helpful to do that.<\/p> <p>  From public representatives' point of view, the only thing the people we engage with and the people we represent want to know daily is, \"When am I getting my broadband?\"  We have spent time out of number explaining to them the complexities of the interface between the private and the public, the commercial and otherwise.  They glaze over.  They really do not want to know.  We understand the complexity, as does National Broadband Ireland, but the people we represent want to know \"when\" rather than anything else.  In different debates in the House I have mentioned, it would be helpful to us and, ultimately, to the customers and consumers if National Broadband Ireland could provide some level of forward planning or insight into where it is at.<\/p><p>I know that would have taken time at the beginning but there have been learnings since then.  There is an interactive map that clearly delineates where NBI's responsibility begins and ends.  It would be helpful if there were also indicative timeframes.  I know NBI has been trying to indicate to people if they will be connected within the next six months or so but consumers who are three years out or beyond that can only see so far into the future.  I always believe in telling constituents the truth rather than creating hope where I know none exists.  If they are beyond two or three years and are closer to four, five or six years, it is better that they know now because some of them will make a decision to invest in another product in the short term, such as a satellite or some other package system.  There are some options out there.  The uncertainty is a killer for people.  NBI should do everything it can in that regard.  I know there is a cost involved and money does not just fall off trees but maybe that is something for which NBI can seek additional revenue from the Department.  I would certainly support that.  Anything that can be done there would be helpful because certainty is important to the consumer.<\/p><p> I do not want to overlap too much with what my colleague said.  At one stage after he took office, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, indicated a willingness within Government and in the programme for Government to try to hyper-charge the roll-out.  That was always going to have limited capacity because there is only so much one can do on the ground at any one time.  Does Mr. Hendrick have any thoughts on that?  Is there anything he wants to share with us that might be helpful or that would bring the timeframe from seven years to five?  Is that doable?<\/p><p> Mr. Hendrick addressed the media comments well in his statement.  I do not want to dwell on them but there are issues and concerns there, some of which I would have expressed myself.  I am on record with those comments prior to NBI being given the contract but I have always taken the view that once the contract is signed it is signed and we have to help get it done for the benefit of the people who need broadband.  Is Mr. Hendrick confident that NBI is capitalised in a manner that allows it to do its work or is there still some background work to be done in shoring up that capital?  Is there anything that concerns him as chief executive?  That would be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022012700002#C02500","speaker":"1655","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643241600,"counter":880,"content":"<p>I look at the future and I see it being a lot brighter than the last two years of the programme.

Almost a year ago today we were able to measure the 19,000 premises we had under construction.   We did not have full deployment areas completed but we had a measure of what those risks were and what we needed to do on our volumes in order to hit a five-year programme.  As such, we engaged with Eir on the number of poles it needed to replace per annum and the number of kilometres of underground duct that needed to be repaired or installed and we contracted with Eir to move from 22,000 poles per annum to over 50,000 poles per annum, and from 1,500 km of duct installation to 2,500 km.

It is a phased ramp-up because one has to buy machinery to put poles in and hire contractors.  There is mobilisation and the phasing of that started in October 2021.  There will be another step in April and another in June to increase the capacity.  A year on, we now have 154,000 premises under construction, almost ten deployment areas complete and we are active in all 26 counties.  We have much better visibility in terms of what the risks are and what the volume needs to be.  That is why Mr. Malone said we are now engaged with Eir again to say that we are clear on the programme and we know what the risks are.  We now want to know how to build the same contingency into our build programme that we have in our survey and design.  We are ahead percentage-wise so we want to do the same on the build programme and we are working on that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to areas of concern or areas where we need support, we can share the list of issues we had a year ago, which ones we have mitigated against and where we are today.  We are always going to have challenges on the ground.  We spent a number of millions of euro redesigning some of the deployment areas that we had already designed because of learnings we took from the first ten deployment areas.  Those efficiencies will start to come through the programme but we will start providing more predictability around when homes are going to get passed.<\/p> <p>  On communications, in August we released a map on our website which gave people visibility, typically within a 12-month or 24-month period depending on where they are in the programme.  The challenge with the predictability of that and giving them a shorter window was that we could not really do that until the designs were completed.  As Mr. Malone said, we will have done 70% of the designs at the end of the year and will have much more certainty about the timing and activity that is required in order to pass those homes.<\/p> <p>  Today, 195,000 premises are awarded to our contractors.  The contractors have start dates and finish dates and we know what we need to do to clear any blockages out of their programme, such as getting the S254 licences for the poles, using the Eir \"make ready\" programme or getting the rapid response teams to fix problems at the back end of that programme.  We are putting all those things in place to mitigate the challenges and put predictability into the programme.  Within Ms Collins's team we will update the website with more certainty around times.  There are always areas or homes that might fall out of a deployment area.  Deployment areas might fall behind because a national motorway is being put through an area and that means we have to delay a deployment area or a ribbon to a later date.  There will always be that challenge in terms of communication but we are trying to bring predictability to the programme.<\/p> <p>  In terms of shareholder funding, we originally required &euro;175 million of shareholder funding but we signed our shareholders up to &euro;223 million of committed funding.  Our shareholders are contractually committed and bound to provide that funding as and when we call it.  Two years ago, getting operators or investors to look at investing in full fibre networks was very difficult but things have changed.  We have always believed that wholesale fibre networks would be the future.  Going forward, the European Commission has said that every single premises will have access to gigabit connectivity by 2030.  That has driven a huge demand to roll out fibre networks, both under commercial funding and state aid funding.  What we have developed and the lessons we have learned about construction and wholesale operations here in Ireland under NBI can add a lot of value in what is happening across Europe and we believe we have a part to play in that.  We could bring an ESBI-type approach to what is happening in Europe and we have led the way to date on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022012700002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hendrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1643241600,"counter":883,"content":"<p>Senator Dooley asked a specific question about being capitalised.

It is also very important the message gets out today that the company has confirmed funding to deliver and complete the project, and that is not in doubt.  Shareholder funds will be available as requested.  That is important because, as I said, the public has an expectation that this broadband project - the biggest in the history of the State - will be delivered.<\/p> <p>  In this context it is usually important there is confidence.  Before Covid-19, people were expecting broadband but now it is an absolute necessity.  In particular, we can see the Government's efforts in respect of encouraging people to work from home and the supports being put in place in this regard.  There is a significant culture change.  Broadband was never more important than it is now in the context of people living in rural Ireland in particular.<\/p> <p>  I am in business and I know how difficult Covid-19 has been in trying to get a workforce available and fully functional.  There are also procurement problems because other supply companies also have problems.  With respect to procurement, everybody in business knows costs have risen steeply and procurement is a problem because manufacturing bases do not have the output they previously had.  It is heartening to hear that the company has its procurement in place for 2023.  Everybody out there has a problem with procurement and supplies.  That is encouraging.<\/p> <p>  There is clearly a blockage in a number of systems and this partly explains the delays experienced by the company.  What level of co-operation is the company getting from the local authorities in terms of planning and licences for poles etc.?  Is this a complex matter and is it delaying the work?  Is there anything the committee can do to encourage local authorities to be more supportive or speed up the process?<\/p> <p>  There is a area that all of us have been asking about for years, and these are the black spots or locations that must be joined between where Eir finished and NBI has taken over?  It is incensing people in rural areas that there can be broadband within 50 yd. of a premises but a refusal to connect that premises.  NBI refers to these as amber areas.  What progress has been made in this regard and what timescale is involved in delivering service to those areas?<\/p> <p>  I am glad the witnesses are here and I thank them for their presentation and update.

We are at a point now where we can see over 150,000 premises under construction and they will quickly start to move to being premises passed and connected.  We are very confident about that.<\/p> <p>  The amber area is the national broadband plan area in which we operate.  The blue area is that which is currently serviced by commercial operators.  Part of the challenge with the commercial operators is that they would say their infrastructure supports connectivity to this point.  The definition of what is high-speed broadband today is 30 Mbps under the national broadband contract.  In time, I expect that number of 30 Mbps to grow.  We are trying to manage a future-proofed network and provide certainty for the future in building out our network to premises in the amber area.<\/p> <p>  There will always be premises that are close to existing infrastructure, whether that is Eir or another operator, and that fall into the national broadband plan area and cannot get connected by the commercial operator.  We are seeing that all over the country.  The last time I spoke before the committee I said we are looking at areas where there is existing infrastructure and where homes might be connected if the national broadband plan does not naturally go through the area.  We have a tender out at the moment and we expect the first round of responses this week.  We are doing an evaluation over February and March and doing trials and pilots of those technologies.  We will keep the committee informed of that progress.  We absolutely understand the frustration where a neighbour might have connectivity and others have to wait until 2024 or 2025.  In some circumstances, even that procurement process we are looking to undertake might not solve those problems.  We will keep the committee informed of the progress.

Significant progress has been made and we appreciate all the help and support we have received from this committee and local authorities.  We have made significant progress in the past 12 months.  Mr. Hendrick mentioned this earlier.  We spent 12 months getting this agreement in place under section 254 on the poles.<\/p><p>It took us longer than we would have expected, but we got it in and the Minister launched it on 5 May.  We had probably secured enough licences for approximately 15,000 premises by May 2021.  As of today, we have enough licences for the poles for approximately 135,000 premises.  Some local authorities move faster than others and construction of some of those will start later in the year and will not be delivered until 2023.  However, for what we would expect to be delivered this year, out of the 40-odd deployment areas, all bar five are secured for this year and we believe we will get the other five within the next four or five weeks.<\/p><p> We are well advanced from that point where we are working and have worked very hard with them.  A steering committee has been set up that involves us, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and the County and City Management Association, CCMA, and we meet regularly to check whether there are any blockages.<\/p><p> One area on which we need to improve, when we hit a snag on the ground from a road-opening licence point of view, is that we need to have the ability to turn them around faster.  When we get a low-level design, we can predict where we are going.  We put in forward-planner local authority road-opening licences at that point.  The issue, some of which the committee will have seen on site, is when we come across an issue on site that had not been predicted at the time of applying for the initial licence.  We need to speed that up because some of those licences can take anything between four and 12 weeks to turn around, depending on the local authorities.  That is where the predictability of the numbers comes in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022012700002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. T.J.

The point she made, which I thought was a very good one, is that she is in an area where there is zero reception.  I do not know how she sent me the text but I thought it was an interesting point.  Is there something that can be done - I note our briefing documents indicated there is up to &euro;120 million that has not been drawn down from investors yet - in those areas where there is, quite frankly, a blackout in telephone reception, to deal with that or to make the system to some degree more accessible?

One recent inquiry concerned a large employer at Rathcormac, which employs more than 150 people.  I highlighted this case to representatives of NBI before.  There is a concern about the prospect of waiting two to three years for installation.  Every business has operational capacity constraints, and that is particularly the case with a complex project like that being undertaken by NBI.  Large employers, however, need a more urgent intervention.  It is being done successfully in the isolated rural communities I spoke about earlier.  It is good to see that happening, but I am concerned about the pace at which businesses are being identified in this process.<\/p> <p>  We all know how important broadband is to our lives.  It is especially so for those businesses with users of products requiring a high-speed connection.  The current situation is damaging businesses in rural areas.  The place I am talking about is called Rathcormac.  Perhaps Mr. Hendrick could note it.  There are many logistical companies there, including everything from the timber industry to the local mart, which operates as a kind of hub for venue hire and things like that.  More must be done in that area.  It is easy for me to say that, but I would not like Mr. Hendrick to be under the impression that I am not aware of the demands already being borne by NBI.  From a business perspective, however, it would be helpful for NBI itself to plan more work in 2022, now that we are reopening the economy and society.  Hopefully, NBI will be working at full capacity.  Can Mr. Hendrick say something to alleviate some of my concerns in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022012700002#H00900","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643241600,"counter":979,"content":"<p>What we can do is to respond with more details of what broadband community points are close to or in the region of the business in Rathcormac.

It is hard to say that we will be able to accelerate one area, because the way the network is rolled out means it is just not as simple as accelerating individual areas.

I welcome the NBI team to the meeting and thank them for the regular updates we receive.  They are really useful when we are meeting and dealing with constituents.  Naturally, they all ask when they will get their high-speed broadband.  Those updates are helpful in that, as was our recent visit to Kilcoole.  As I am criss-crossing County Wicklow, I have learned to spot ducts up on poles so that I know houses have been passed.  It has been very helpful in that.<\/p> <p>  I suppose we must think about what we are trying to do here.  We are trying to bring high-speed fibre broadband to every premises, household, business and farm in the country.  Fibre is the gold standard.  There is nothing better than bringing fibre right to the house.  It is a massive contract.  It is huge.  It is a &euro;2.1 billion contract to make sure that everybody is connected.  It is a massive job, but it brings huge benefits to everybody who gets connected.  It brings an equity in communications that perhaps has not existed in rural areas for a long time, where they were previously not getting their fair share of investment.  It seeks to balance that urban-rural divide that can sometimes exist.  I have heard it compared to the rural electrification scheme.  It is akin to that.  It is that kind of level of investment we are trying to make here.  It is complicated.  NBI is trying to follow existing ducts, networks and poles, which in some ways has advantages but in other ways has disadvantages.  Mr. Hendrick has spoken about the learning curve that NBI has experienced.  Delays were incurred at the start but NBI has learned from that and expects the momentum to ramp up and speed up the delivery.  I am looking at the figures for January 2022, as we sit here, with 54,500 premises currently able to place their order.  If we are sitting here in January 2023, with the learning that NBI has done so far, what would Mr. Hendrick expect that figure to be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022012700002#K00700","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643241600,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>Mr. Malone has talked about the build programme.

Our guests referred to 26 counties but there are five constituencies in Dublin, for example.  I accept that much of Dublin is not covered by the programme but I saw figures indicating there are approximately 13,000 premises to be passed in Dublin, as there are in Longford.  As a percentage of the number of houses in Dublin, it is a small figure, but it is still a significant number of premises, many of which are located in Fingal and so on.  It would be useful to have widespread availability of data by constituency or by local electoral area and a timeline for when broadband will be provided in each area.  The faster that is done, the better.  Those data should not be shared just with the committee; it should be shared more widely.  I appreciate NBI has been doing a lot of that.  It should be doing as much of it as it can.  I hope everybody gets broadband as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  I ask our guests to develop the point in respect of the take-up they expected compared with what they are actually getting.

Granahan McCourt Dublin has always been the controlling shareholder under NBI and the structure had not changed.  We had informed the media outlet before that was published, but it chose to seek a narrative based on its interpretation or understanding of our annual financial returns even though we explained it, so it has been frustrating.  At this point, we share as much information as we can.  Obviously, there are confidentiality arrangements with shareholders up the chain.  I can give an example.  The Irish infrastructure fund, in which Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, is an investor, has 24 pension funds in that fund.  Although they were party to an investment in Enet, Eircom and other assets in Ireland and I know the team, I do not know what the 23 funds are.  I do not know anything about who the investors are in that, under confidentiality agreements.  The same applies in any infrastructure project.<\/p> <p>  That was just one example of the inaccuracies.  The other was the bid cost and that the State had somehow paid out money to shareholders.  There were inaccuracies there.  The State did not pay &euro;32 million.  Again, we clarified those inaccuracies, but the headlines did not change.  Therefore, what have we done about it?  We have tried to explain the corporate structure, the investors' funding, how the project agreement works and how our subsidy flow works whereby we do not get paid until we have achieved certain milestones.  There is the contract summary, although it is still a lot of pages.  If anything comes up in the future, we are available to support the committee, other Members of the Oireachtas or the media with any questions that arise.  We are trying to give a contract summary that shows, if questions are asked about where something is covered in the contract, that it is covered under section 5 regarding governance and controls.  The reason we come here as a team is that Mr. Kelly and Ms Fisher are deeply involved every day with regard to subsidy claims, corporate governance, board interactions and the Department interaction.
