As Covid-19 restrictions have receded, it is again open to Members and witnesses to attend committee meetings in person.  I ask those present to continue to wear face coverings when not addressing the committee and when moving about the room.  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, Members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness and is present.<\/p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from the National Transport Authority, NTA, to examine its 2020 financial statements.  The NTA has been advised that the committee may wish to examine the following matters during the course of the engagement: the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area; expenditure on MetroLink, BusConnects and DART expansion and underground; bus transport infrastructure and the selection process for the location of bus stops; public private partnerships; and the purchase of buses by the State for private operators.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the NTA: Ms Anne Graham, CEO; Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy chief executive officer and director of transport planning and investment; and Mr. Tim Gaston, director of public transport services.  Attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House are Mr. Philip L'Estrange, director of finance and corporate services, and Mr. David O'Flynn, financial controller.  Attending remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House are the following officials from the Department of Transport: Ms Ethna Brogan, assistant secretary, and Mr. Garret Doocey, principal officer.  All of our guests are very welcome.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask Members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that mobile phones are on silent or switched off.<\/p> <p>  I wish to explain some of the limitations to parliamentary privilege as well as the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the precincts of the Parliament is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  A number of today's witnesses, however, are to give their evidence remotely, from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to specific witnesses.  If a question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time he or she contributes.<\/p> <p>  I now call on Mr. Seamus McCarthy, the Comptroller and Auditor General, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The NTA was established in 2008 and has evolved since then to undertake a wide range of statutory responsibilities, mainly related to public transport planning and funding.  The authority's income in 2020 amounted to &euro;1.085 billion, up from &euro;661 million in 2019.  The majority of the income comes from Exchequer grant funding.  The authority's expenditure in 2020 amounted to &euro;1.043 billion.  More than half of this, &euro;579 million, was in respect of public service obligation, PSO, payments.  These payments are made to the operators of public transport in respect of public services that otherwise would not be financially viable.  Significant additional PSO payments were provided in 2020 as a result of the severe impact of Covid-19-related travel restrictions on the viability of public transport services.  In addition, the authority introduced a support scheme in 2020 to offer temporary financial supports to commercial bus operators at a cost of &euro;32.6 million in the year.  The second largest area of spending by the authority in 2020 was in respect of the provision of capital investment grants to a wide range of bodies.  This amounted to just under &euro;350 million in the year.  In addition to the investment funding provided to other bodies, the authority invested &euro;65 million in the purchase of buses that were added to its own bus fleet, which is made available to public transport operators.  The carrying value of the whole bus fleet in the statement of financial position was &euro;227 million at the end of 2020.<\/p> <p>  I certified the financial statements on 24 June 2021 and issued a clear audit opinion.  However, I drew attention to a disclosure in the statement on internal financial controls regarding non-effective expenditure of about &euro;400,000 incurred in respect of the development of a new grant management system.  After the project commenced, growth in the authority's capital programme meant that enhanced oversight, control and reporting were required.  Following an assessment, a management decision was made in 2020 to terminate the project and instead to redevelop the authority's existing grant management system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

As requested by the committee's secretariat, we have furnished some information in advance.  To assist in answering the committee's questions, I am accompanied by three directors from the NTA: Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO; Mr. Tim Gaston, director of public transport services; and Mr. Philip L'Estrange, director of finance and corporate services.<\/p> <p>  The remit of the NTA is primarily concerned with the planning, development, regulation, funding and provision of sustainable transport.  Within the greater Dublin area the authority has a greater depth of functions.  The authority's role covers not only public transport capital investment and provision of services but also securing greater integration between land use and transport planning.  The authority's statutory transport strategy for the GDA sets out the key transport projects that are required to be delivered to provide for the growth in travel demand by sustainable modes and to meet the carbon emission targets agreed by the Government.  The authority is obliged to review the transport strategy for the GDA every six years, and the first review was completed last year and published in November for public consultation.  That consultation closed on 10 January and the authority is now reviewing those submissions and preparing a final draft for approval by the Minister for Transport.<\/p> <p>  The Government has published its long-term investment programme, the National Development Plan 2021-2030, which continues to support the BusConnects programme, MetroLink and the DART+ programme as well as other important public transport projects which will assist in meeting the demand for sustainable transport and our obligations to reduce carbon emissions.  The authority manages the capital investment programme for public transport, cycling and walking on behalf of the Department of Transport and funds the transport operators and local authorities for approved projects.<\/p> <p>  Planning and public consultations for three major capital projects, namely, BusConnects, MetroLink and the DART+ programme, continued during the pandemic and the preliminary business cases for all three were submitted to the Government for approval in 2021.  It should be noted that, in accordance with the public spending code, the NTA has been appointed as the approving authority for all three of these programmes in addition to being the sponsoring agency for BusConnects.<\/p><p>Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is the sponsoring agency for MetroLink and any other Luas projects, and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is the sponsoring agency for the DART+ programme.  A robust governance structure is in place to manage these projects through the planning, design and construction phases.  The authority is also managing a significant increase in active travel funding to local authorities, which saw &euro;280 million allocated in 2022 for more than 1,000 projects in different stages of delivery across the State.<\/p><p> Following a successful year in 2019, which saw significant growth in public transport usage, the impact of the Covid pandemic was dramatic.  The health measures necessitated by the pandemic saw capacity on public transport services reduce by up to 75% at various stages throughout that year, resulting in a 50% reduction in passenger numbers by year end.  Despite these challenges, the NTA, along with its operating partners, managed to keep public transport services going in order that key workers could get to their places of work and make essential journeys.  In that context, I thank all the operators and their staff for continuing their work in keeping our public transport services operating in a safe and efficient manner.  This continued through 2021, and while there was recovery at times in the public transport numbers, they were still well below pre-pandemic levels.  We are particularly grateful the Government supported the NTA with increased funding to offset the fare revenue shortfall due to the pandemic.  As a result, public transport operators suffered no commercial loss for the operation of services contracted by the NTA.  Government financial support was also extended to the authority in July 2020 to support the re-introduction or continued provision or both of a number of public transport services normally provided under licence by commercial bus operators without State subsidy.  This funding has been extended to the end of March 2022. <\/p><p> Despite the emergency crisis brought about by the pandemic, there were a number of key achievements to note in 2020 and 2021.  We saw a significant number of new and improved services delivered in a short time frame under the Government's July 2020 stimulus funding package in that year.  Two phases of the BusConnects Dublin network have been successfully delivered and there are plans to deliver three more phases this year.  We have recently concluded consultation on our Connecting Ireland plan for improving connectivity for people living outside our major cities and towns.  With Connecting Ireland, we are proposing an overall increase of approximately 25% in rural bus services as part of a five-year plan starting this year.  Since the beginning of 2020, we have invested substantially in town bus networks in Drogheda and Navan and this year, we will progress the delivery of services in Carlow and Portlaoise.<\/p><p> Proposals on redesigning the bus network in Cork city have gone out for public consultation as part of the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy, CMATS, and we are looking to do something similar for Galway and Limerick.  We also saw the first deliveries of the electric hybrid double-deck bus fleet in 2020, which marks the start of a process that will see carbon emissions dramatically reduce on our subsidised bus services and help us to achieve a reduction in transport emissions, as set out in the climate action plan.  The authority has purchased three hydrogen-fuelled zero-emission vehicles, which are now in operation by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We have also ordered 34 single-deck battery electric buses for delivery commencing later this year, as well as completing the tendering process for up to 800 double-deck electric buses, all of which allows us to meet our target of having zero-emission vehicles operating on all State-subsidised urban bus services by 2035.<\/p><p> In respect of the small public service vehicle, SPSV, sector, the number of vehicles that are now wheelchair accessible grew to 17% of the total fleet by the end of 2021.  A number of supports for the SPSV sector were introduced to mitigate the impacts of the Covid-19 crisis.  In addition, with the support of the Department of Transport, the NTA opened a new grant scheme for SPSV licence holders who wish to switch their vehicles to electric or electric hybrid vehicles.<\/p><p> Since its establishment, the authority has been significantly under-resourced.  Our staffing complement, in particular, was below what we require to effectively undertake our statutory and non-statutory functions.  A great deal of work was undertaken during the past three years on the development of a strategic resourcing plan to identify the needs in that regard through consultations with our parent Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am pleased this culminated in approval for the filling of a significant number of key posts in 2020 and 2021, which has assisted greatly in building our capacity to deliver on our mandate.  As for our funding and expenditure, the authority has been strongly focused from the outset on ensuring we have robust financial and audit controls, bearing in mind the scale and range of the authority's financial activities.<\/p><p> I welcome any questions members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Graham.

This is where a review of the routes and timetables is necessary to support schoolchildren and their families.  At 3.43 p.m. a 59 bus leaves Dalkey, where the school finishes at 3.45 p.m.  It gets to the next school at 3.48 p.m.  That school also finishes at 3.45 p.m.  They are both girls' schools.  The next bus from Dalkey is at 4.30 p.m.  This is a local example but it shows how the schoolchildren in two secondary schools should be able to depend, particularly in the winter, on not waiting around for public transport and access it easily.

I support my colleagues in saying that, from the perspective of school transport and buses, we also have a significant issue in this regard in rural Ireland.  Children cannot be delivered to or collected from the bus by their parents.  Every year, there seems to be a growing need for a parent who is working to be able to take a child to the school bus.  We are having the same difficulties in that regard.  It is paramount, given what we have seen of late, that we keep our children as safe as possible and that we do what we can to ensure that they can be delivered to their doors.  There are many instances where the bus passed less than 200 m or 500 m from a door, but it will not go down that route.  The bus operators never have a difficulty.  When I speak to them, they never have an issue with doing that.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is preventing it from happening.  We must have a forum where an explanation is given to public representatives concerning why this is the case, because it comes up year after year and costs a fortune over time.  It is preventing people from going back to work.  I ask that we look at that in future, because it is not a part of what we are discussing today.<\/p> <p>  I am baffled by the climate policy that has been developed and how it has no regard, it would appear, for rural Ireland and its requirements.  Undoubtedly, those travelling in rural Ireland are disproportionately affected by the rising cost of fuel.  I refer to the costs of having to travel to work in rural Ireland, with no alternatives being put in place.  The intention in the climate action plan was that the alternative means of travel would be in place before costs would rise.  The costs are rising exponentially, however, and no alternatives are in place.  The Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan only has a &euro;50 million budget allocated over five years, with &euro;5.5 million of that for this year.  It is going nowhere and will do nothing for the services.  We are experiencing exponential increases in fuel costs, while Local Link contractors have entered into a tendering process where the price of fuel is not considered.  They do not get anything, but they have suffered the consequences of these fuel increases.  I ask Ms Graham, Mr. Creegan or Mr. Gaston to comment on whether any proposal has been made to examine this issue or to compensate those affected, because many of our Local Link operators are no longer viable.  Before the witnesses answer, the Connecting Ireland policy went out for public consultation in November.  The closing date for contributions was December.

The public consultation closed in December and we are analysing the contributions now.  We are also in the process of developing phase 1 of the plan.  It will be a five-year plan and, as the Deputy said, our estimate is that there will be an increase of approximately &euro;50 million in revenue expenditure to match the proposal.  We will deliver phase 1 of the plan in the coming weeks.  We have targeted those services that are already nearly planned or where the Local Link offices have been able to indicate there is demand.  We will shortly be publishing the phase 1 plan, along with an indication of when phases 2 to 5 will be delivered.  Those will involve a more regional approach.  The plan will have three main strands.  Local Link will provide services, or we will jointly tender and then Local Link offices will oversee the contracts for routes.  Bus &Eacute;ireann routes will be modified.  We are also in detailed discussions with several commercial operators regarding licensing.  Those are the three strands of delivery which must come together.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the question of indexation, we are very much aware of the cost of fuel increase.  Some of our contracts, those I described earlier, include a fuel index component.  If there is an increase in the price of fuel, then the feed we pay them will be increased.  Some contracts, however, do not have such a provision.  In those cases, we have identified what we believe to be the indexation increase and we are doing a one-off variation for 2021 in respect of the increased fuel costs the operators incurred.  If fuel remains at a high price, then we will do a one-off indexation variation for 2022 as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#G02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Gaston"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Must that be requested or will it be rolled out to all the operators, such as those operating the Local Link services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#G02200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":209,"content":"<p>It is a bit of both.

I am relaying a message as a public representative on behalf of the constituents who elected me regarding the need to provide a service.  We must provide an alternative means of travel, and it must fit the requirements.  Therefore, it can not be done from an office in Dublin using Google Maps.  It must be done based on genuine co-ordination and not box-ticking.  It must be a process involving the TCUs, because they have the people who understand what is required.  They cannot be dictated to in a scenario like this because that will not work and it will cost too much.

We have to achieve a modal shift.  That has got to be the objective, not least because of our climate obligations and the crisis the planet is in but also because there is a very strong economic reason.  We need our public transport services to connect and work.<\/p> <p>  I am a strong advocate of public transport and have been for decades.  I have been very active in this regard, including through my co-ordination, along with CI&Eacute;, of a sizeable survey in my area in the 1980s that delivered very significant changes tailored to the needs.  I have got to say, however, that my experience with BusConnects has been horrendous.  I just do not believe people were listened to.  It was said in the opening statement that two phases of the BusConnects Dublin network have been successfully delivered and that there are plans to deliver three more this year.  One of them certainly has not been successfully delivered.  There are significant problems.  I can testify to that because my area is one of the areas where one phase, the C spine, has been rolled out.  I cannot measure the H spine and do not know how the witnesses measure success, but success is not empty buses, the generation of more traffic, or people buying cars because the public transport is not working for them.  It may well be working to some degree, but you could not say it is successful.<\/p> <p>  Let me use as examples the L58 and L59, the buses that connect to train stations in my area via Celbridge and Leixlip.  The complaint that I most frequently get from the public concerns why money is wasted running empty buses.  On most days, the number of people on each bus could be put into a taxi.  The service runs every half hour from 4.30 a.m. until 11.30 p.m., empty.  Services that were being used have been removed from routes to allow for the delivery of the new services.  My office has become the complaints department for BusConnects.  That has been my experience of it.  It may well be working closer to town.  I accept there is a much more direct route if one is going along the motorway or main carriageway rather than into communities, but it is in communities that people live.  The buses are not connecting; the feeder buses come after those on the main route.  They are not turning up and people are just giving up on them.  They are running empty.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses might provide us with the information on the income.  It is not a great time to measure it, because of Covid, but the witnesses might state the income and numbers of passengers before Covid and now.  As far as I am concerned, the number of passengers indicates success.  We were promised a dedicated line for people to give feedback.  We got a booklet with a general number, which I have rung several times.  To be honest, it is just a Dublin Bus general number; it is not a dedicated line.  I do not know how the NTA picks up the feedback and complaints and how re-tailoring is done.  We were given many commitments, including a commitment to have ambassadors along the route.  I went out looking for them but did not come across any.  Success is not the word that I would use.  I am hugely disappointed that there has not been the desired opportunity for the public to engage directly, rather than engaging via other public representatives and me.  There is no point in engaging with the witnesses because I do not get a response.  I have found the whole process highly frustrating and disappointing.  I believe money and opportunities are being wasted.<\/p> <p>  The NTA had better get the H spine and C spine right before starting to roll other ones out.  Considering that the bus is the workhorse of the public transport system in terms of the number of people carried, we cannot afford to get this wrong.  I do not want to be critical of the potential improvements to public transport but my experience of it has been awful.  Most of the complaints I receive concern the waste.  The booklet was sent out a week before the spine was delivered.  The NTA needs to learn some lessons from that.  People cannot make sense of it.  If you have been over and back, made many submissions and are a bit familiar with it, it is fine, but it is not very clear.  The NTA really needs to make a much bigger effort in communicating with the public.  I would not rely on the feedback on the H spine that the NTA has got so far because my experience of the C spine is that the methods of feedback are wholly inadequate.<\/p> <p>  I would like an opportunity to contribute later because there are other issues, concerning the DART and the metro, on which I would like to engage.  I would like to hear what the witnesses are going to do about measuring success and feedback, because we cannot afford to get this wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#J00400","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I am very disappointed to hear Deputy Catherine Murphy&rsquo;s remarks.

The fact is we have a private bus system operating under the umbrella of Bus &Eacute;ireann through Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway.  How does Ms Graham think that is sustainable, with the NTA also giving in excess of &euro;570 million in PSO funding to operate the same routes?  Although they are getting a subvention from the State they are, in some cases, double the price.  I will give her one very good example.  There is an Expressway service that leaves Dungarvan to go to Cork.  It passes through Youghal and Midleton on its way.  That costs half what the PSO-funded, NTA-controlled service Bus &Eacute;ireann provides leaving Youghal to go to Cork does, on a similar journey that is half the distance on the same road.<\/p><p>Why is that allowed to happen?  The NTA has responsibility for setting the price but it makes no sense that we are giving hundreds of millions in PSO funding and then undermining that system by providing the Expressway service.

There was an announcement of approximately &euro;91 million, as I understand it, for the upgrading of that line to ensure that the speed at which commuters could travel between Cork and Dublin and <i>vice versa<\/i>is speeded up.  I want to get a deeper understanding of where that spend is going and how it is proposed to spend the moneys.  I understand that signalling upgrades are a component part of that, and possibly new intercity railcars, ICRs.  I could be wrong but Ms Graham will clarify that for me.  The reason I ask is because, while I am a weekly traveller on the Cork to Dublin line and I am a regular DART user, I wonder whether the Mark 4 engines are fit for purpose in a modern railway infrastructure and whether there is a proposal to replace those with more energy-efficient carriages and train sets.  Where is the NTA in terms of that conversation with Irish Rail?  That is my first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#P00200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>In terms of the fleet, we have not been having any conversations in relation to replacement of the Mark 4s.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the investment on the infrastructure outside of the greater Dublin area, that is not managed by ourselves.

The other issue relates to correspondence that we would have received in relation to bus shelters.  People may ask why am I asking a question about bus shelters.  Bus shelters are important to people who do not have their own transport, particularly if they live in intermediate towns.  For instance, if you are living between Cork and Limerick in a town such as Buttevant, which has been waiting for a bus shelter for a number of years, it is entirely appropriate for me to ask where the NTA is in terms of the provision of such shelters and why they are not being rolled out at a quicker pace to ensure that we encourage more people to use public transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#P00400","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":425,"content":"<p>Mr. Creegan might respond to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":426,"content":"<p>It is fair to say and we accept that the roll-out of bus shelters has not been as fast as we would like it to be.  Certainly, over the past two years, with various restrictions that we all know about, we have not achieved as much as we wish.<br\/><br\/>It is more difficult, though, than people think.  Generally, what holds us up is that some additional footpath works are required in a particular location before we can put the shelter down.  We do not have the <i>vires<\/i>to go in there and dig up those footpaths.  We are relying on the local authority doing some work at those locations and they have been pulled all over the place for the past two years.<br\/><br\/>We have worked with most of the local authorities now and have developed a schedule of bus shelters that we hope to get installed as quickly as we can.  Equally, we will be working with the bus shelter supplier to see can we roll out more shelters as well over this year, next year and onwards.<br\/><br\/>It is a place where we recognise we have not done enough and have more to do.<br\/><br\/>The last point I would make is there are other locations where people are asking for shelters and the location just does not suit because either the footpath is too narrow or there is a window or an entrance alongside that is affecting visibility lines.  It may look obvious to somebody asking why do we not do it but, actually, we and the local authority could not agree to it.  Wherever we can do it, we will try and get over the obstacles that I have mentioned there.

I appreciate the answer.  I used Buttevant as one example and I am unashamedly parochial in this sense.  Buttevant is an example of where infrastructure is not being rolled out in towns and villages that depend on intercity routes.  If some attention could be given specifically to Buttevant, I would be very grateful for that.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to fare structures.  I have a mountain of correspondence with the NTA in respect of fare structures between Mallow and Cork.  Mallow is a typical example of a town that is within commuting distance of a big city and where I perceive that there is an inequality as between the commuter who commutes to Cork from Mallow and the person who travels, for instance, from Greystones to Pearse Station in terms of fare structures.  I note and welcome the correspondence that I have received from the NTA in relation to the introduction of commuter fares.  I wish to raise the issue of commuter fares because there are thousands upon thousands of people who will make the modal shift from car to train if the fare structures are right throughout the country.  Mallow is a typical example of that.  The sooner we get those new fare structures this year, the better.  Overnight, you will see a demand for those services among students, workers and citizens in general.  That is why I asked the question about the Cork-Dublin upgrades in relation to speed.  If we can get more rolling stock on those lines between Cobh, Midleton, Cork, Mallow and Charleville, for instance, and open up new intermediate stations as well, you will create demand.  Quite frankly, that is where the Minister is at.  That is where the citizens are at.  The more the NTA can influence that and bring that about, the more positive the impact it will have for citizens.  If there is a confirmation of the fact that commuter fares will be introduced, as per the NTA's correspondence to me already, I would welcome that.  That is my final question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#P00700","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":428,"content":"<p>If members want to come back in for a second round, I ask them to indicate if they are not in the room.

In relation to the DART+, BusConnects and MetroLink, I read through the briefing notes yesterday that the NTA sent along.  I thank Ms Graham for them.  There is &euro;46 million spent so far on DART+.  There is fleet money there but I am not counting that.  I am talking about spending on developing the project.  On BusConnects, there is &euro;89 million spent on developing the project and on MetroLink, there is &euro;88.1 million spent on advancing the project.  In the documents that the NTA sent along to us, I was trying to map out the progress on them.  While I understand that there will be substantial preparation work to be done, when you put all of that together, &euro;223 million has been spent on preparation work across those three projects, namely, the DART+, BusConnects and MetroLink.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the documents the NTA sent.  For example, DART+ is set out under five headings.  If you take DART+ West, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann published the preferred option for public consultation, with consultation closing on 6 October.  On DART+ South West, the second round of the public consultation process on the preferred route was held during November and December.  On DART+ Coastal North, there is an initial public consultation project for an emerging preferred route for the DART+ Coastal North project.  The DART+ Coastal South project is at an early stage of development and it is currently planned to launch the initial public consultation in the middle of this year.  The DART tunnel is similar.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to BusConnects, if the committee will bear with me, I will find a relevant piece here.<\/p><p>In line with the public spending code, the preliminary business case for BusConnects Dublin has been provided to the Department of Transport.  It is currently being reviewed prior to a Government decision.<\/p><p> On MetroLink, it is stated that it is anticipated that a railway order application will be submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the end of the second quarter of this year, subject to Government approval of a preliminary business case.  To be honest, I was a bit taken aback by where progress with the DART, BusConnects and MetroLink projects stands.  The other thing I was taken aback by is the combined sum of &euro;223 million has been spent on this preparation work.  Some of them are from way back.  There is a long way to go.  The witnesses know that and I know it from reading through those documents.  Is the amount of money involved as regards preparation work not excessive?<\/p><p> The second question, and I ask the witnesses to keep their answers brief because I have a few other questions, is how much more is it estimated to cost to get it to the stage where we will see JCBs on-site and shovels in the ground?  How much more will cost in preparation work for those projects?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#P01300","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Creegan to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":436,"content":"<p>First, &ldquo;preliminary business case&rdquo; is the term that is used.

The 46,615 in the State.  Approximately 21,000 were bought in the first 11 months of last year according to the figures that we have.  In the Dublin area, 9,816 were bought in that 11-month period in 2021.  There are 159 charging points in the Dublin area.  People would accept that there is regular public transport in the Dublin area, as there should be, and it needs to be improved.  This is not an argument of urban versus rural.  I want to make that clear.  I understand why there needs to be efficient public transport and continuous work to improve all the time in our capital city and in other cities and towns.  In County Laois there are 457 EVs and there are 249 in County Offaly.  That compares with 21,519 in Dublin.  There are ten charging points in Laois and there are eight in Offaly.  That is the best information that I can get via the mapping from the Department or from the NTA.  There are 159 points in Dublin.  The point that I am trying to make is that there is substantial investment being put into public transport in the Dublin area, as there should be.  However, we are caught in a situation in rural counties where the EV is not an option at the moment.  One can see that the greatest of number of subsidies for EVs are in the greater Dublin area.  A greater number are being bought there.  The number of charging points is higher in Dublin, as I would expect it to be.  I am trying to point out, however, that the numbers are tiny in rural counties such as Laois and Offaly.  The number of vehicles that are being bought as a result of that is tiny.  This is because we do not have the infrastructure.  As well as this, range anxiety is a real issue because the technology is not there yet.<\/p> <p>  The other point I wanted to raise about EVs relates to a reply to a parliamentary question that my colleague, Deputy Darren O'Rourke, obtained about the latter.  I was taken aback by this, because I had thought people who buy EVs were careful about money and might be a little frugal.  I do not mean that in a bad or derogatory way.  I thought that they might be careful about the environment.  However, the list of vehicles bought last year is jaw dropping.  It included Jaguars, Land Rovers, BMWs and Mercedes.  There were huge numbers of them.  From an NTA and Department issue point of view, and I know this policy issue, but maybe we should look at this again.  Are we subsidising Mercedes-Benz, Jaguars, Land Rovers, BMWs and huge Audis in and around the cities where there are already extensive public transport networks?<\/p> <p>  I do not want to be too parochial about this, but people who live in rural counties like Laois and Offaly are stuck with petrol or diesel cars and they might not have the money to change them.  The option of charging points is not there.  The infrastructure is not there.  There is also the range issue, which will hopefully be improved, although I think that hydrogen will be the real gig.  EVs are not an option in these places because of price, the lack of charging points and range anxiety.  Ms Graham might comment on that.<\/p> <p>  It certainly opened my eyes when I saw the reply to the Parliamentary question on what we are subsidising.  I am for subsidising EVs, by the way.  I do not want this to be taken up wrong, but are we subsidising 4-tonne cars in areas where 1-tonne cars would do because there is already good public transport?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#Q00800","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":442,"content":"<p>That is probably a matter for the Department.

I thank Ms Graham for the replies.  She sent me back a lot of information on this over the year.

That is welcome however a point that I have made before and will make again today, one train goes up and down that line once a day.  There is huge potential there.  We have a regional strategy, which I welcome, with the delivery of Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  We need to seriously look at how we can use that line to increase tourism around Limerick, the south west, Tipperary and south Laois.  It is travelling to Ballybrophy.  Much more use could be made of it.  The car park has been expanded at Ballybrophy station which we looked for and is good news.  The line has been upgraded.  I have received answers in the past that the travel speeds had to be kept low because of the lack of investment but substantial investment has gone into it.  It needs an on-the-spot, up-to-date engineering examination.  I ask Mr. Gaston to come back to me on that.  There is tourism potential but there are also large numbers of students and workers commuting from south Laois, down through Tipperary, Roscrea, Cloughjordan, Nenagh and the towns along there, who would make use of it.  It goes straight into south Laois.  There are tourism and commuter opportunities that can be exploited and explored.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#R00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Certainly.

There has been a doughnut-shaped settlement pattern with Fingal leading the charge in growth, followed by counties Meath and Kildare.  They are all putting pressure on the city centre.

That is abnormal and needs to be rebalanced to an extent.<\/p><p>When you start looking at some of the initiatives like DART+ and MetroLink, the areas that are generating that traffic are the ones that lag far behind.

It is, in fact, going to Kilcock as a huge facility is going in there; it is just that people will not be able to get on, which seems daft.

Naturally enough, when people have been told not to use public transport during the Covid pandemic, it has had a very significant impact on confidence in terms of the safety of public transport through a pandemic.  However, there are a number of people who have been using public transport through the pandemic.  We put in place additional cleaning and other controls in order to build up the confidence that people have in public transport.  In terms of trying to attract people back to public transport, we are looking at marketing campaigns to build confidence.  We were just talking, yesterday, about how we would build people's confidence in using public transport again where they have not been using it over the last two years.  We are trying to see if we are in a position to do anything from a funding perspective on fares reductions in order to encourage people to use a particular service.  For example we ran the Kids go Free campaign pre-pandemic.  We are looking at whether to run that again to encourage young people and their parents to use public transport.

If it is two, that is a very different arrangement for us than if it is four.  The other challenge we face is determining whether everybody will want to work Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.  They actually still need the same peak for only three days of the week, where previously it was spread over five.  There is a number of things that we need to see teasing out.  There is work under way at the minute, recognising exactly the point the Deputy has made that the suburbs are busier than the city centre now.  That is where the growth has been.  We anticipate that we may and will need to rebalance how bus services are managed to give more service and more frequency, particularly more services between the peaks in the evenings and weekends.

Of course, it is in line with our climate action policies and plan and the NTA's objective to encourage people to use public transport.  There are two issues that I wish to raise on foot of that.  The first is one that I have previously contacted the NTA about, namely, the short hop zone that currently extends to Balbriggan.  The witnesses will know that the hybrid DART is going to be extended, on the northern rail line, as far up as Drogheda.  That would indicate that the greater Dublin area now extends as far as Drogheda.  There is a huge problem, which as I said I have flagged up previously, namely, the disparity in the cost of rail fares between Drogheda and Dublin, Laytown and Dublin and Balbriggan and Dublin.  As a result of that, many people, particularly in Laytown, choose to drive to Balbriggan.  There is a difference of &euro;25 in the cost of a weekly ticket.  There is a situation where people living in the east Meath area and working in Dublin will drive to Balbriggan and then get the train from Balbriggan to Dublin.  If you are talking about a difference of &euro;25 a week, that adds up to a substantial amount over the course of a year.  It flies in the face of everything the witnesses have said on the NTA's objective and our climate action policy.  Thus far, I have not had much luck campaigning on the issue.  Will the NTA agree to examine the issue and look at the practicalities, given what they have previously outlined?  It will stop people getting into their cars and driving to Balbriggan or indeed, on to Dublin, because it works out cheaper for them to drive.<\/p> <p>  The other issue that I wish to raise on foot of Ms Graham's points concerns the D1 and D2 bus routes.  Again, it is logical, practical and for the life of me, I do not know why there is resistance.  The buses operate between Drogheda and Laytown.  They are very successful and a huge amount of the public use them.  However, the current terminus is at Laytown train station and the thousands of people living in the Julianstown area have asked for the route to continue on as far as Julianstown.  If the witnesses listen to this, they will see that it is madness that it has not been done.  At the moment, the only way for residents in Julianstown to travel to Laytown - and bear in mind that Laytown has the train station, a beach and other amenities - is to drive.  That particular 4 km stretch of road between the two villages has neither lighting nor footpaths.  It is extremely dangerous to either walk or cycle on.  If parents are taking their children to activities in Laytown, they have no alternative but to use the car.  If that bus route were to be extended, it would also link the coastal villages of Laytown, Bettystown, Donacarney and Julianstown.  Julianstown has connecting buses to Swords and Dublin Airport.  The only way to get there currently is by car.  It would also provide a link for the residents of Julianstown to all of the coastal villages and, of equal importance, it would provide public transport from all of the villages to the national ecology centre, Sonairte, which is on that road.  For the life of me, given climate change policy and the objective of the NTA go get people to use public transport, I do not know why there is resistance.  It is logical and an alternative to the car.  Do the witnesses believe something like that is logical, practical and in line with NTA objectives and Government policy?  I ask them to explain why it has not been done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#S00400","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":477,"content":"<p>We are up against the clock.

While it sounds like a small issue, I have engaged with Ms Graham on this many times over the past 11 years and although some progress has been made, it is terribly slow.  I have a couple of things to note, one of which is they cost a lot of money.  I have observed two things.  First, some of the areas that we have put forward do not require a big bus shelter.  In Monasterevin, the NTA put in a big one.  It was right because there were more people at the bus stop than at the train station and it needed a big bus shelter.<\/p> <p>  Portlaoise could do with a second one, particularly on the upper-bound line.  I ask Ms Graham to examine that.  There is a very small one at Lyster Square, opposite the shopping centre in Portlaoise.  That needs to be bigger.<\/p> <p>  I would like to focus on the route along the R445 through Borris-in-Ossory, Castletown, Mountrath, Portlaoise and Ballybrittas for a moment.  There are no bus shelters along it.  Bus shelters have been promised.  Can we look at ones that are less expensive?  I argue strongly that Borris-in-Ossory needs one.  There is room on the street as there is a wide main street, which has been bypassed.  We can make better use of what is there.  Could Ms Graham come back to me on what is happening on that? <\/p> <p>  When one is standing on the road in Castletown waiting for a bus, cars or trucks pass at high speed.  On a wet day or on a wet morning, when people are going to work and children are going to school, they are wet before they even get there.  We need to try to provide a small bus shelter there.  In Mountrath, there may be problems with footpath widths.  However, the local authority needs to be given latitude around Patrick Street, Mountrath.  It is a wide street and the parking bays have been built out in order to designate the parking spaces.  This means that there is street space on Patrick Street.  Portlaoise needs a second one on Lyster Square and Ballybrittas needs a bus shelter.  Again, it does not need one as big as those in the larger towns.  It does not need one as big as in Monasterevin.<\/p> <p>  On the N78 route, bus shelters are needed at Crettyard, Newtown and Ballylynan.  Again, small ones would do in Crettyard and Newtown.  There is loads of space for them.  At Ballylynan there is a wide street with build-outs to designate the parking areas.  I was in Ballylynan on Saturday and there are locations there for bus shelters.  The weather has been dry for the last two weeks, but there was a week when it rained all week.  We want to get people onto public transport but we live in a country with a wet climate where we get intensive periods of heavy rain.<\/p> <p>  I forgot to mention Kilminchy.  There is supposed to be a bus shelter on each side of the road there.  Kilminchy alone has over 1,000 people living in it.  There are a couple of thousand more people living around that end of Portlaoise.  It urgently needs a bus shelter on each side of the road there.  Again, there is space.  If we are going to get people to use public transport, we have to provide that.  I ask that a smaller model of bus shelter be looked at.  I have seen big ones going up in areas where there are generally one or two people using it.  I want to see that figure increasing, as I am sure Ms Graham does, to six, seven or eight people, in order to get people out of cars.  However, people will not get out of the car on a wet day to stand on the side of a road, or leave the car at home or forget about the car altogether to use public transport unless we have that vital infrastructure.  I do not expect Ms Graham to come back to me with all of the details in an answer.  However, perhaps she could come back to me on each one of those.<\/p> <p>  To conclude, the local authorities under the bus legislation that was brought in eight years ago were given greater role in respect of bus stops.  This is for the Department to take on board as well.  Local authorities need to be the bodies that designate them, put them up and put them in place.  I mean no disrespect to the witnesses but cannot be co-ordinated from their office.  The NTA cannot be sorting out bus stops in Castletown, Crettyard and places like that.  That needs to happen locally, with the municipal districts of the council, with the councillors and with the engineers.  Of course, the NTA designates the bus routes, and I am not arguing against that.  However, that needs to be devolved down.  While I understand that the NTA must operate within the legislation that is there, can you give any slack to the local authorities to allow them do as much as they can?  I would argue for that.  Would Ms Graham like to respond briefly on that point?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#T00700","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":490,"content":"<p>We will respond to local authorities that come to us with plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Have you, though?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#T00900","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":492,"content":"<p>We do not really want to be going to the local authorities with plans.

In general, they relate to the 2020 year of account and, in most cases, a clear audit opinion.  No. 1 is the special EU Programmes Body, which is a North-South body that I audit in conjunction with the Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern Ireland.  It gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 2 is the National Library of Ireland, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 3 is the Local Government Fund, which is a substantial amount of &euro;1.5 billion, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 4 is An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 5 is the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund which, again, gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 6 is the Food Safety Promotion Board, again a North-South body, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 7 is the National Council for Special Education, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 8 is the National Tourism Development Authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  In this case, I gave a qualified audit opinion.  The accounts give a true and fair view except in regard to pension funding, in my view.  Unlike most other grant-funded bodies, the financial statements of the National Tourism Development Authority do not recognise a deferred retirement benefit funding asset in regard to some of its pension liabilities.  This is on the basis that the authority considers that it has not been provided with a statutory or other guarantee in regard to the future funding of the scheme.  As a result, it has a net liability position on its statement of financial position, but it still believes that it is appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis.  I have drawn attention to that.  I think it should be recognising a matching pension funding asset.<\/p> <p>  No. 9 is Tourism Ireland, again a North-South body, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 10 is the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 11 is the Intestate Estates Fund Deposit Account, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 12 is the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and its accounts for 2020.  I give a qualified opinion in that case also.  The accounts give a true and fair view except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements of staff only as they become payable.  That is a standard instruction for health sector bodies from the Minister for Health.  Otherwise, the accounts give a true and fair view.  No. 13 is the special account Hepatitis C Insurance Scheme, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 14 is the National Training Fund, again a sizeable fund of &euro;718 million, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 15 is St. Angela's College, which is a college of education in Sligo, to which I gave a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to Note 11, which again relates to retirement benefits accrued by current and former staff.  That is standard for the university sector.  No. 16 is the National University of Ireland, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 17 is the Law Reform Commission, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 18 is St. James's Hospital, which is one of the section 28 hospitals.  It is given a clear audit opinion, but I draw attention to non-compliance with procurement rules in that case.  No. 19 is the Sport Ireland Facilities company, which is a subsidiary of Sport Ireland, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 20 is the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, which gets a clear audit opinion, but I draw attention to Note 9 to the financial statements, which deals with the superannuation arrangements for staff.  Discussions are ongoing between the Office of the Ombudsman and the Department of Finance about the responsibility for the funding of pension liabilities under the schemes.  That has not been resolved.<\/p> <p>  No. 21 is the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 22 is the Leopardstown Park Hospital Board, again a section 38 hospital, which gets a clear audit opinion.  No. 23 is the special account for the purpose of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.<\/p><p>This is a relatively small turnover and it was reimbursement of charges that were improperly levied.  A scheme was put in place to provide for that.  It is a clear audit opinion.  Related to that is the health repayment scheme donations fund, which had a nil turnover but the account continues to exist.  There is a clear audit opinion on that.  The Health Service Executive consolidated patients' private property account, which had a turnover of &euro;41 million and net assets as of 31 December of a total of &euro;103 million got a clear audit opinion.  This is actually private funding of individuals but it is being managed and held in trust by the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p> No. 26 is the Institute of Public Administration and that got a clear audit opinion.  No. 27 is the Irish Museum of Modern Art, which gets a clear audit opinion.  There were three of the accounts that were signed on 30 June and only presented in December.  They are within the committee's scope for asking for an explanation.  Those are No. 4, An Bord Plean&aacute;la; No. 8, the F&aacute;ilte Ireland accounts; and No. 27, the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  The certificate for the National University of Ireland was signed on 30 August but the Department has already provided the committee with an explanation for why it was late.  That is in the correspondence for today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>With regard to St. James's Hospital, the amount is &euro;516 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#AA00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643275800,"counter":507,"content":"<p>The turnover.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":508,"content":"<p>Yes.

This arises from the commentary relating to the scandalous case of the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in County Kerry.  It is a scandal in the first instance in health terms.  It is clear from reading the reports that there will be a significant financial outlay in potential legal proceedings and in the resolution of the matters.  There is a Garda investigation and a review ongoing but this is not the first time we have had a case like this.  In fact, our health services are littered with stories and scandals of this nature.<\/p> <p>  Where is such a case reflected in terms of the potential liabilities that could arise as a result of such cases in accounts and financial statements?  I am talking about the ultimate cost to the taxpayer.  How do we as a committee examine the financial obligations?  Whatever the findings of the Garda investigation or the review, we can probably say with absolute certainty that there will not be a single individual in the HSE who will pay a price with a job, reprimand or future entitlements.

It provides information requested by the committee on ten diverse issues, including the taxation of couriers, the number and associated value of seizures of drugs and cigarettes from 2019 to 2021, expenditure on facilities at Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort due to Brexit, a monthly analysis of the support Revenue has provided to each sector during the pandemic, and the settlement between Revenue and Perrigo.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.  It was flagged for discussion by me and Deputy Matt Carthy.<\/p><p>Two separate pieces of correspondence come under No. 1009.  One gave a breakdown of the use of the voluntary PAYE scheme over the 15-year period from 2004 to 2018.  There is a table of the gross pay of the taxation by a number of employees and number of employers.  One thing that stood out, which I found very unusual, was that in 2018 the gross pay of those ten employers for 154 employees was &euro;1,524,970 and tax paid &euro;22,329, and the number of employees 154.  That means that the wage for each employee was about just over &euro;10,000.  The taxation the PAYE paid was &euro;144 for the year by employee.  I want to take more time with this but it is something that we may have to follow up again with Revenue.  There is certainly something unusual about that.<\/p><p>Deputy Carthy has left, but other members may wish to comment on the second document.  It relates to bogus-self employment. Revenue have sent a document from the Chief Inspector of Taxes.  It is copy of a document dated from 1997.  It says that compliance of tax by couriers &quot;was 'put on hold' until the status of couriers for tax and PRSI was concluded&quot;.  This is from 7 March 1997.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAs you are aware, the Department of Social Welfare Appeals Office have decided that a motorcycle courier who provided his own equipment (e.g. motor cycle, special gear etc.) and was engaged under the standard courier contract was insurable as a self-employed contractor under the Social Welfare Acts.  <br \/><br \/>While the decision is not binding on Revenue I propose, as previously stated, in the interest of uniformity and with a view to bringing the matter to a conclusion, to treat couriers as self-employed for tax purposes, whether deliveries are made by van, motorcycle or bicycle ... <\/blockquote> <p>That appears to be at complete odds with what we were told when Revenue was before the committee, namely, that there was not a uniform decision to treat all couriers as self-employed.  The document refers to treating couriers as self-employed for tax purposes elsewhere.  It can be seen that the decision was made to treat all couriers as self-employed.  I wanted to bring that to the attention of the committee.  If any member wants to come in on that, feel free.  Any future engagement may have to revert back to that.  We will note and publish that correspondence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#CC00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":550,"content":"<p>For clarity, is it the suggestion that this is not the most up-to-date statement of the employment status of couriers that is on the public record but that it is the most relevant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022012700002#CC00600","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1643275800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>We received this correspondence.

This arises from information requested by the committee regarding compliance with procurement guidelines.  Last week, we considered an interim response from the Secretary General, No. R1004, and the substantive response is before us today.  In its 2020 accounts, the Department disclosed non-compliant procurement totalling over &euro;91 million, and 151 of the 153 contracts concerned related to the provision of international protection accommodation, which is part of direct provision.  Responsibility for this area was transferred to the Department from the Department of Justice in 2020.  In No. R0939, the Secretary General explained that he took the view that these accounts, which the Department of Justice considered to be competitively procured, should be included in the disclosure of an uncompliant procurement for 2020.  Linked to efforts to address this non-compliance is the Department&rsquo;s work in implementing the White Paper to end direct provision and to establish a new international protection support service.  The Secretary General includes an overview of that process.

Any payments that were made to An Taisce from the then Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht would have been made exclusively by the heritage division of that Department.  Responsibility for the heritage function no longer resides with that Department as it transferred to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage as part of the transfer of functions in 2020.  As the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage did not provide the requested information relating to its heritage function, for which it now has retrospective responsibility, the secretariat has sought an update on the heritage funding.

This one went to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Hopefully, we will have it soon.<\/p> <p>  No other items of correspondence have been flagged for consideration today.<\/p> <p>  The next item is the work programme.  Next week, on 3 February, we will engage with Transport Infrastructure Ireland to examine its 2020 financial statements.  On 10 February, we are scheduled to examine expenditure on the national broadband plan with NBI and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  As agreed last week, we have a series of housing-related meetings scheduled after that with the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government, the Residential Tenancies Board and Home Building Finance Ireland.  The secretariat is working to make the necessary arrangements which would take us up to 3 March.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, an issue that has arisen is the provision of women's refuges, and, unfortunately, it has become more pressing in the past fortnight for the wrong reasons.  There are nine counties without a refuge and it is causing big problems.  Perhaps we could add it in and take it as a small item in one of those meetings.  We could address that with the Department regarding what is being spent on it, what money it has and what plans there are for the future.  Nine counties, including Laois and Offaly, do not have a premises.  Women and children are being sent miles away from schools, doctors, support groups and families, with no transport and nothing.  That is along with the trauma of being out of the family home and in many cases being victims of domestic violence.  One can imagine the extra layer of difficulty.  I have dealt with too many of them, unfortunately, over the years.

Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The only other item I wish to raise regarding the work programme is that there are some more developments with the University of Limerick, UL.  I propose to put it on the work programme again.  Matters are far from being resolved there and there are a number of serious issues that might need further examination.  With the agreement of the committee, I propose that we invite the chancellor, who is the chair of the board, to appear before the committee on the next occasion.  On the last occasion, the president, who is a relatively new president, was put in a very difficult position.  We have to ask the hard questions, but in some ways she was fairly new to it.  That is not doubting her ability or anything like that, but she was dealing with a lot of issues that arose or started before her term.<\/p> <p>  The last issue I wish to raise relates to the three separate meetings scheduled on policing.  Combined with the three on housing, that is six gone.  With the mid-term break, we are looking at two months gone.  Could we amalgamate two of the meetings on policing?  There are meetings with the Policing Authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are having three-hour rather than two-hour meetings now.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appropriations accounts would need a separate day by itself, but perhaps we could bring in GSOC in the first part of one morning meeting and from 11 a.m. we could take the Policing Authority.  Deputy Catherine Murphy asked for it to be included, but I am not sure that we have much to go through with the Policing Authority.  She obviously has issues she wants to raise and I want to be fair to her, but I suggest that we do it as part of one engagement.  Have members any strong feelings one way or the other on that?<\/p><p>If not, then we will seek to do that on the same day.  If anyone has a better suggestion, he or she should feel free to make it, but I suggest that we take GSOC first because there are a number of issues involved.  That would be from 9.30 a.m. until 11 a.m., after which we could take the Policing Authority.  Would that order be okay?  Agreed.  We will ask the secretariat to arrange it that way, which will bring things back a week.

It arises from our consideration last week of R1000 from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform concerning the format and content of the appropriation accounts of Government Departments and offices.  We agreed to include this as an agenda item for today's meeting.  This matter has arisen several times, including last week.  It is an area that we need to try to improve.  Members might also recall that, last November, we agreed to request that the Department include the committee in any consultation process involving proposed changes to the framework for accounting by central government agencies, rules around management of public funds and the publication of codes of practice for governance of public bodies.  It is welcome that the Department has agreed to do so.  We also included a number of potential additions to the information presented in the appropriation accounts, including legal costs and pay and staffing.  The Department has made changes in respect of reporting on legal costs.  They will come into effect this year for the 2021 appropriation accounts.  This is a good move and is welcome, as is the fact that the Department has committed to considering the other suggested changes for the following year's appropriation accounts.<\/p> <p>  However, there is one other change that, in the interests of transparency and accountability, the committee should request that the Department act on for the 2021 accounts.  It relates to pay, specifically the remuneration of Accounting Officers.  It is not detailed in the appropriation accounts and, as noted in our letter to the Department, this is significantly out of step with the standard of disclosure expected of non-departmental State bodies under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.<\/p> <p>  I will open the matter to the floor before requesting agreement that we write to the Department to request that this information, as well as the previous year's remuneration, be prioritised and included in the 2021 accounts.  Members will recall that we went through a rigmarole trying to get information on the pay of Secretaries General and we only got vague answers or did not get answers at all.  That is not satisfactory.  There are now four separate grades of pay for Secretaries General.  There used to be three.  Exactly what is being paid out in this regard needs to be shown in the appropriation accounts when we receive them, which would normally be the following September.

It should take this one on board.  There is no reason not to.  As the Deputy said, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  We would then not have this again in the coming years.  We would not have to go on a wild goose chase to get answers to questions.  Regarding the role of the Committee of Public Accounts, the joint report from it and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, is absolutely clear in the 14 recommendations.  I do not see any reason for Government not to take it on board.  We and the committee that Deputy McGuinness chairs did not work on that report for it to gather dust on shelves.  That report needs to be acted on.  It is clear with regard to benchmarking and how these figures are reached that there are issues with transparency and process.  They are laid bare in the report.  The case is laid out for what needs to be done.  The recommendations are clear.  This is an all-party committee.  There are Government and Opposition members of this committee.  The positions of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, which is the same, are clear.<\/p> <p>  Along with our duties in this committee, we have a responsibility as Members of the D&aacute;il to make sure to raise this and keep an eye on it, to ensure that it is followed through on.  The concern from last year was that if a small group of people can arbitrarily decide to jack up pay by &euro;80,000 or &euro;84,000, it does not inspire public confidence at a time when we are cutting back pandemic unemployment payments and other payments.  I urge members from all parties to watch that and to make sure that it is followed through on.  We will do what we can to make sure that it happens.<\/p> <p>  We will write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about the format in the appropriation account in future.
