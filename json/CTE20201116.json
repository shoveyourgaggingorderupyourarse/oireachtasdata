There are a number of amendments that are in order for dealing with this section.  I am sure we will have the opportunity to debate a number of different elements that have been put forward.<\/p> <p>  I want to make clear from the very start the intention of the Government that these payments would be taxed and treated in the same way as we tax other equivalent social welfare payments.  I point members of the committee to the D&aacute;il answer I gave on 17 April on this matter.  The sitting on 17 April was one of the early sittings of the D&aacute;il after the pandemic unemployment payment had been introduced.  It was one of the first opportunities for me to take questions in the D&aacute;il on the matter.  For the purpose of getting the debate on this section under way I want to read into the record of the committee some of the lines and statements I made at that point.  I proposed to take a set of questions together because they related to tax treatment of the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme.  I stated that disbursements made under both the pandemic unemployment payment and the temporary wage subsidy scheme were in the nature of income supports and shared the characteristics of income.  I also stated that on first principles, therefore, they were liable to income tax and that other income earners in receipt of comparable normal wages were taxable on those wages.  I stated that in the interests of equity, the payments made under both schemes were, therefore, subject to income tax.<\/p><p>I also stated: \"In the case of the PUP, the taxation position follows the general taxation rule for social welfare payments and [is therefore also] exempt from USC and PRSI.  This will be the case [for] former PAYE worker[s] or [those who were] previously self-employed.\"<\/p><p> When the PUP was introduced, that it was taxable income was always made clear.  The grounds for that claim rest on a number of points: it is a regular payment; it is not means tested; and it confers a monetary benefit on those who need and deserve it.  Furthermore, we are treating this payment in the same way as comparable payments under our social welfare code, in particular jobseeker's payments.  This is why that income is and was taxable and why this section is in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#B01400","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I will put the question on the section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#C00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>No.  Let us deal with this.

Is that the legal basis on which those hundreds of millions of euro were paid?  I believe the answer is \"Yes\".  Therefore, is it not clear from the table in section 13 of the Finance Bill that payments under section 202 of the 2005 Act are exempt from income tax?  Let us differentiate between the Minister for Finance's position as stated on the D&aacute;il record and the actual legal position of the State as stated by the Houses of the Oireachtas, namely, that these were payments that were non-taxable.

I am not dismissing what he or the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, have said - theirs are the views of the Ministers of relevant Departments - but what have the Houses of the Oireachtas said is the legal basis for the payments?  The legal basis is clear, in that they were made under section 202 of the 2005 Act, which section 13 of the Finance Act 2018 made tax exempt payments.  Whatever about the Minister's intentions at the time, they were tax-exempt payments.<\/p> <p>  This is a very serious issue and is much wider than the Minister wanting to tax payments &ndash; I do not understand why &ndash; that were made to people who lost their jobs during the pandemic and to do so in a way that is unconventional.  In debates on previous Finance Bills, I have stated that there should not be retrospective taxation.  The only time that any parliament throughout the world should consider the principle of retrospective taxation is in very unique circumstances involving tax avoidance.

We are not being asked to retrospectively tax a billionaire corporation that has been involved in tax avoidance but to retrospectively tax men and women who lost their jobs in the pandemic and who, in many cases, had their incomes drastically reduced.  People were penalised in terms of their weekly income reducing from &euro;600 or &euro;700 to &euro;350 and they are now to be penalised a second time by way of the application of tax on that income retrospectively.

I will deal with each of the points in turn, beginning with the points made by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  As the pandemic unemployment payment was introduced at &euro;350 in the first instance it offered a very high degree of income support to those workers who had lost their jobs through no fault of their own.  The only reason they were losing their jobs was because of the arrival of a pandemic onto our shores.  The setting of that payment at &euro;350 offered a very high level of income support.  In the cases of many workers, their income was broadly protected versus their after tax income.  We are, of course, familiar with the fact that some workers may even have seen an increase in their income when compared with their post-tax income, which happened because we had to bring in an exceptional payment at a high level in the emergency circumstances that we were in.<\/p><p>It is going to take some time to determine the overall income effects of the PUP.  That information will be available from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, but it is very unlikely, however, to be a story of dramatic income reduction, given the high level of the PUP at that point, at &euro;350, for everybody.  <br\/><br\/>Moving on to deal with the point regarding the issue of taxation in this regard, and what the claim could be, I do not have available what we expect to be any significant tax take as a result of this situation, but my officials will share that information with me during the morning, if it is available.It is worthwhile, however, to talk about this matter in the way that the House would.  I refer to looking at the effect on an individual and what kinds of sums of money we are talking about in this context.  I will use the example of someone being on the PUP for 12 months to illustrate the sums of money that would be involved for that person.  In this case, however, that would be a significant fraction of the figures I am going to talk about, because we are dealing with the tax liability that was due over a specific period of time.  If a citizen were on the PUP for a full year, that would mean that his or her taxable income during that period would be &euro;18,200.  The only tax that person would pay would be income tax, because he or she would not pay the universal social charge, USC, or employees' PRSI.  The total tax due from that person on the PUP across a 12-month period, therefore, would be the income tax of &euro;340.  In addition, for the period in question, from March to August, the amount concerned is a fraction of that.<br\/><br\/>The effective tax rate, therefore, that would be due on the PUP is 2.88%, and that worker would have the default ability to pay off that &euro;340 over a period of four years, which would mean that the tax he or she would be paying per week would be &euro;1.26 in that four-year period.  Deputy Doherty is of course correct because we are debating principles here, but while we are debating the principles it is also appropriate to frame those principles in respect of the total amount of tax that would be due in respect of that person from the application of the taxation code in the way which I have described.  It is &euro;500, if a person is on the PUP for a full year, and he or she has the ability to pay off that amount over a four-year period.  Those are the figures we are talking about, therefore.  In respect of the comments from Deputies To&iacute;b&iacute;n and Barry, if figures are shared with me during the morning regarding what amount of tax would be available to the country as a result, I will of course share that information with the committee.<br\/><br\/>To deal with Deputy To&iacute;b&iacute;n's main contention, in respect of creating a narrative of dramatic and savage income reduction, not that he is in his question but I refer to if one were to create such a narrative, it is not consistent with the reality of the introduction of the PUP of &euro;350 being taxed in the way which I have described.  Turning to the points made by Deputies Barry and Doherty, I have acknowledged, because it is the case, and Deputy Doherty asked me this question and has done so in the past as well, the heading under which this payment was made available through social welfare legislation.  Just because the payment was made available under section 202 of that legislation, however, does not mean that it is an urgent needs payment.  It is not an urgent needs payment.  It is not means tested and it is not <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  We are repeating, and have repeated, this payment since it was introduced.  As such, it is very different, even in nature, to the other social welfare payments listed under section 126 of the tax Act on which we must base this as well.<br\/><br\/>Moving on to deal with the other claim being made regarding this action being retrospective, it is not retrospective.<\/p><p>It is being collected in the same way as taxation on any other social welfare payment would have been collected.  In fact, it will be collected over a longer time period because of the emergency circumstances that we were in.  It is not just a view of the Minister, either myself or Minister Humphreys.  At that point we were making that statement cognisant of what the legislation is and cognisant of the need to ensure equity of tax treatment between the PUP and other jobseeker's payments, the other income supports, that were available at that point in time.  It is not retrospective.  Just because it was made under section 202 does not mean it was an urgent needs payment.  While we are debating matters of principle here, and I am addressing the principle questions that are put to me, it is important also to be aware of the actual sums of money that are at debate here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#D00400","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I am aware that over the four-year period and for the reasons set out by the Minister present, the tax liability of the people who availed of the PUP is probably not huge, as he has described it but I still think it is unfair.  Frankly, it is meanspirited because the Minister has not taken into account that the people who were on PUP are the people largely who have economically suffered the most as a result of the pandemic.  They are people who would otherwise have been earning.  They are people who may have got into arrears in their rent or mortgages, or accumulated debts because they lost work.  The Minister has stressed, in fact three times, that this was a very significant income support.  Yes, but it was still an income drop for huge numbers.  He said some people got more than they would have previously.  For the very significant number of people who got it, this was a drop in their income and they were the people who were particularly hit by the pandemic.  Think about taxi drivers, arts workers and bar workers.  These are people who, even now, are suffering more than those who can work from home, who have not been significantly impacted and whose financial situation has not changed.<\/p> <p>  Let us look at the stuff that came out from the Central Bank at the weekend about the fact that household net wealth has increased during the last period so some people are doing quite well in the pandemic because their income has remained the same and they have been able to save but there is a very significant group of people who, to a greater or lesser extent, have lost out significantly because of the pandemic.  To just load this on top even though it is relatively small in the great scheme of things, and I accept that there is not going to be a water charge-style revolt over it, but is it not just a bit meanspirited for the people who have been impacted most, and will continue to be impacted most as long as the pandemic is with us?<\/p> <p>  The Minister has said that this issue does not come under the same category as the exceptional needs payment even though it is under that category.  One could not get a more strong example of exceptional than the current pandemic and the way it has impacted on very particular cohorts of people, and their ability to work at all or to earn an income.  Frankly, it is meanspirited to do this.  The Minister has been unable to give the figure here but I doubt if the revenue generated is a huge amount of money in the great scheme of things that have happened.  Why be meanspirited when we are supposed to be all in this together?  The people in here have not had their incomes impacted one jot but the people who have had to avail of the pandemic unemployment payment must now face a small additional tax liability even though they have been impacted.  On that basis, the Minister should reconsider, in the spirit of \"we are all in it together\" and recognising that there are particular cohorts of people who have suffered dispropionately through this.<\/p><p>Why add any additional financial liability to their situation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#F00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>We can all give examples, but the Minister gave an example of somebody on the pandemic unemployment payment for 12 months.  First, he will acknowledge that this is impossible because the pandemic unemployment payment did not come into existence until mid-March.  People were earning full wages prior to that, or at least a large cohort was.  Indeed, people came off the pandemic unemployment payment and went back to full wages.  The Minister gave his euro example.  Does he acknowledge that over the 21 weeks in which he is asking us to go back in time and make this payment taxable from 13 March to 5 August, the total amount that would have been received by somebody in receipt of the PUP during that period would be &euro;7,350?  If the person was paying tax at the 20% rate, which does not mean he or she would have to have a huge amount of income earned in the other 31 weeks, it would be a tax liability of &euro;1,470.  If the person was paying at the 40% rate, it would be &euro;2,940.  They are not small numbers.<\/p><p>The Minister says with a straight face that this is not retrospective taxation, which is the core here.  Page 9 of the Bill states: &quot;<i>Paragraphs (a)(i) <\/i>and <i>(b) <\/i>of <i>subsection (1) <\/i>shall be deemed to have come into operation on and from 13 March 2020&quot;.  Regardless of how one wants to use language, let us deal with the law.  We are legislators and we are asked to change the law.  This section asks us to change the law so this payment, which was made under section 202, will be taxable from 13 March.  Why is that text in the Bill?  That payment, made under section 202 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, is not taxable.  We know that because it is in the Finance Act 2018, which contains a table.  The Minister says it is not an urgent needs payment because it is recurring and not means tested.  Section 202 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 does not mention the words &quot;recurring&quot; or &quot;means tested&quot;.<\/p><p>It does not matter what way the Minister says it because we must deal with the law.  The law is that this payment was not taxable, regardless of the Minister's intentions.  This is retrospective and the Minister should admit it, at least, instead of trying to take the members of the committee for fools.  It states: &quot;... shall be deemed to have come into operation on and from 13 March 2020&quot;.  I understand why the Minister might not want to admit it.  The principle he is asking this House to implement is unheard of in western democracies.  It only happens in extreme cases where there is tax avoidance.  Three years ago I put forward an amendment that sought to close down a loophole used by Mr. Denis O'Brien to avail of tens of millions of euro in tax benefit by using an Irish collective asset management vehicle, ICAV, to purchase or sell property.  There was no suggestion that we would deem that amendment to have come into operation on a date prior to the Finance Bill.  Even I would not have argued for that.  Retrospective taxation is something that should not be done, but that is exactly what is in this legislation.  Regardless of the amounts to be paid, and some of them could be significant depending on the earnings before 13 March or after 6 August, and that is a serious issue in itself, the issue here is one of principle.  The issue is why we would go back and change the law to make the payment taxable from a certain point in time.<\/p><p>Perhaps the Minister can point out for me where section 202 in the Act states that it has to be recurring or means tested.  It does not.  I refer the Minister to the Finance Act 2018.  It states clearly with regard to section 202 of the Act which only deals with urgent needs payments - it is not as if the section deals with a large number of payments - that payments are exempt from taxation.  The Minister is familiar with it.  Perhaps the Minister can enlighten me.<\/p><p>During his time as Minister for Finance or indeed his time as Opposition spokesperson on finance, how many times has he either proposed as a Minister or been aware as a Minister that we have done anything like this, where we have applied taxation to a payment that legally, as we sit here today, is not subject to tax?  Why do we know that?  How can I say that with conviction?  It is because this amendment is necessary.  It will apply tax on that payment from 13 March to 5 August.  From 5 August on, the payment had a statutory basis.  The payment is subject to tax; that is indisputable.  Regardless of whether one likes it, it is subject to tax and that is it.  Prior to that date, however, it is not.  Maybe the Minister can give us other examples of where we have gone back six months to make taxable a payment which previously was not legally taxable.  I am not talking about going back to the point where the Finance Bill was introduced.  I am talking about long before that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#G00200","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I understand 300,000 people to be in receipt of the PUP as of today.

The restrictions in this country are, for better or worse, the sixth most severe on the planet at the moment.  A significant number of these individuals have had a radical income reduction.  If they were on the average industrial wage, they would have a reduction of about 60%.  I notice when the Minister discussed this, I think he said that at &euro;350 per week the PUP was \"very, very, very high\".  These are individuals who have, on average, had a 60% collapse in their particular incomes.  Their expenditure, their family costs usually mirror the income that they had before.  Many of those costs are still in existence, yet PUP recipients have a really reduced income as a result.  Even if the Minister says the average tax annually is about &euro;350, he is talking about removing 300,000 people from an ability to earn an income and then taking off them a week's income the State provided.<\/p> <p>  Compare that with Amazon, whose income is currently soaring due to the fact that 51% of retail is now online in this State.

Deputy Boyd Barrett made a point regarding the need for this payment.  I absolutely agree with and understand that point because I, along with the then Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, former Deputy Regina Doherty, and the current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, brought in the payment.  We brought it in because of our absolute awareness of the need for a payment at that point in time.  Regarding those who may have had a higher income as a result of the payment, which I mentioned to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n earlier, I must be precise and point out that this applied to a small group of people and I do not want to suggest otherwise.  The fact that a small number of people saw their income rise across that period was a consequence of the fact that we were in an absolute emergency and needed to do something really quickly.  All we could do with the mandate of acting quickly was bring in a payment at a single level.  That was the right thing to do and it provided much needed and much deserved income support for those who needed it.  While we still have many people on the PUP now, thankfully it is a decrease on where we were earlier in the year.  It is a payment that continues to be needed and that is why it is there at its current level.<\/p> <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n made a point regarding the number of people that the Government has stopped working but the reason we have done that is to protect health.  I do not hear any recognition of that in the contributions he has made.   The reason we have introduced public health guidance that means, sadly, hundreds of thousands of people are back on the PUP and not able to work is to try to protect our health and to prevent these people, their neighbours, co-workers and their communities getting the disease.  These are not the actions of a capricious Government.  We are taking action on public health grounds.  That is why we have taken these actions and why we brought in the PUP.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that I noted that the PUP was at a high level.  I made that point in the context of the average level of jobseeker's payment, which is &euro;203.  A payment of &euro;350 versus a payment of &euro;203 looks high but it was the right thing to do and it had to be done.  It had to be done to protect people at a time of great need.<\/p><p>One could take a wider view of the pandemic unemployment payment and look at the ancillary benefits a person could get under our social welfare code.  The other payments available to persons on a jobseeker's payment mean that the kind of social welfare entitlements that are available during a normal time are comparable with the single payment of &euro;350 that was made under the pandemic unemployment payment.  It was the right level and it was the right decision at the right time. <\/p><p> On the points raised by Deputy Doherty, this is not and was not an urgent needs payment.  Rather, it is an income support.  As it is an income support, we are taxing it in the way we tax other income supports.  It is not listed in the Finance Bill 2018 because, obviously, it did not exist then.  It was brought in this year.  It was not available at that point.  None of us anticipated we would be in a situation where we would be bringing in the pandemic unemployment payment.  I made clear at the time the payment was introduced that it would be a taxable payment.  The Deputy is correct that a change is being made in the Finance Bill.  That change is being made to ensure that we have legal certainty in respect of this matter.  Both I and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, made clear at the time that this was the way in which it would be treated because it was an income support.<\/p><p> On the question asked by Deputy Farrell, I would not be bringing this measure forward in the Bill unless I was clear and advised that this was legal, allowable and the right thing to do from a legal point of view.  That is why it is in the Bill.<\/p><p> Deputy Barry drew a comparison between the pandemic unemployment payment and what he referred to as corporate welfare.  If by referring to \"corporate welfare\" he is referring to the wage subsidy schemes that kept hundreds of thousands of people in their jobs during that period, I remind him that those schemes are taxable too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#J00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>The Minister cannot have it every which way to suit his own narrative.  Nobody is disputing the fact that those payments needed to be made.  Indeed, they were vital and the right thing was done by the Minister and his colleagues in Government at the time.  However, there had to be a legal basis for making those payments.  The Minister accepts that the undisputed legal basis for that is section 202 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  Indeed, that is what we are talking about here.  It is the section to which section 3 of the Bill relates.  Section 202 is about supplementary welfare allowances in cases of urgency, that is, urgent needs payments.  It does not deal with anything else.  The Minister cannot state that the legal basis on which the Government paid out hundreds of millions of euro in payments is section 202, but it is not actually section 202.  He cannot have it both ways.  There must be a legal basis on which to pay money out.  This is what we are dealing with.  We are dealing with the law and, therefore, that is what is required here.  What the Minister is asking the committee to do is to wind back the clock so that people who lost their jobs during a pandemic are taxed.  Legally, they are not taxed at this point in time for payments made from 13 March up to 5 August.  That is what the Minister is asking the committee to do.  He is asking us to breach a principle in a way that I have never seen in my ten years dealing with finance Bills.  He is not asking us to do it because some of the big accountancy firms have found loopholes to allow people to make hundreds of millions of euro by avoiding paying taxes.  He is not asking us to do it because of how real estate investment trusts, REITs, are exploiting the housing market or how vulture funds go without paying any tax by using charitable status and section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act.  He is not asking us to do any of that.  Rather, he is asking us to impose tax on people who lost their jobs during a pandemic.  Those people lost their jobs because restrictions that had to be introduced by the Government forced their places of employment to close down.  In the main, these are not high earners.  A person who had a total income of &euro;23,850 this year will now pay up to an additional &euro;1,470 because of the amendment being made by this section.<\/p><p>Let me just explain this to the Minister because he came out with his &euro;1 figure earlier.  Consider the person who was in employment and earning &euro;532 per week, which is not a very high income at all and is well below the average wage.  If that person earned this during the period outside of 13 March to 5 August, he or she will now have a taxable income of &euro;1,470 as a result of the amendment in this section.  This is not euro and cents.  This is about imposing a charge on people who have lost their jobs.  This individual would have a total income in 2020 of &euro;23,850.  That is the reality.  It is the upper end.  It is the reality for a lot of people.<\/p><p> I asked the Minister a question earlier on how many times he, as the Minister for Finance, had brought forward an amendment to the Finance Act that actually asked us to rewind back time and tax income in this way?  By God, he never did it for the vulture funds and by God he did not do it for the banks when they were carrying forward their losses.  He did not do it for REITs, for section 110 companies or for others who were exploiting Finance Acts and finding holes to avoid paying tens of millions of euro in taxes.  I can give examples, and I have given the ICAV example.  Not once did the Minister suggest that we rewind back time and clamp down on those individuals.  For the people who lost jobs in this pandemic, however, it is easy game and a \"let us go for them\" approach.  The Minister is turning back time and taxing payments to people who lost their jobs in a pandemic: not the people who are milking the system and not those people who are trying to find a way out of it.  These are people who are trying to keep their heads above water.  The Minister is asking us to do something, the principle of which should not be countenanced by any Minister for Finance.  Considering the amount of money, collectively and in the context of everything else, that would be accrued by this amendment, it is unbelievable that this principle will be breached.  It speaks volumes of the Minister's priorities about who he clamps down on with these types of matters.  I will definitely not support this.  I appeal to the Minister and to every other person on this committee with regard to what is being asked of us here.  No matter what is said about retrospective changes, we can read.  We are being asked to apply this measure not from today's date, not from a date in November or from when the Finance Bill was introduced, and not from a date of the budget, which would be the normal practice in a number of circumstances, but from 13 March 2020.  Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us as to why he has not done this for any of those other tax avoidance measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#K00200","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>If there are matters that need to be clarified for Deputy Doherty then I ask the Minister to please do so, but then I am to press this section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#L00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Deputy Doherty refers to my priorities.

The Minister cannot argue that he is protecting the most vulnerable in a dutiful way by trying to tax working people who have lost their jobs in a pandemic.  In the vast majority of cases they had their incomes reduced, not for a couple of weeks but for a sustained period to claw back tax on them.  That has nothing to do with protecting the most vulnerable.  That is putting the boot into the most vulnerable, to be blunt.<\/p> <p>  I asked the Minister earlier when we will get the figure for the total tax that is to be clawed back from PUP recipients as a whole by the State.

That would be great.  If it is available this morning, I would welcome it very much.  If it is not available this morning, will the Minister please tell us when?

The comparison Deputy Doherty makes is right.  Let us consider Seamus Coffey's proposal relating to 80% or 100% tax relief on intangible assets.  He said the companies should not have got 100% tax relief.  He was referring to those big multinationals which benefited greatly from the reduction of 100% rather than 80%.  The Minister refused to apply Seamus Coffey's proposal.  If I remember correctly, it would have brought in &euro;800 million in additional tax.  That would have been a small drop in the ocean compared with the profits these companies are making.  Essentially, the Minister refused to do what Seamus Coffey was proposing on the basis that it would be unfair and create uncertainty and so on.<\/p> <p>  However, in this instance, the Minister believes it is fair to do this to people who have already been significantly and adversely hit as a result of the pandemic.  The Minister did not really address this point.  That is my central contention for why the Minister should not do what he is proposing to do.  The vast majority of people who got the pandemic unemployment payment have lost out as a result of the pandemic.  Even with the PUP, they have lost out.  Otherwise, they would have been working and most of them would have been earning more.<\/p><p>They would not have built up debts and so on to do with rent, mortgage arrears or other charges that will have accumulated while their income has been significantly reduced in many, and probably most, cases.  Is it, therefore, not unfair and mean-spirited when huge swathes of the population and significant swathes of big businesses and so on have not been impacted at all and, in some cases, have done well?  We will get onto our proposal for a Covid-19 solidarity tax shortly.  It has been discussed actively across Europe for those who have actually done well out of the pandemic.  In that context, is it not just mean-spirited, unfair and miserable to do this to the people who have been hit adversely and have lost out?  The Minister proposes they will lose out a bit more, perhaps a significant amount more in some cases, according to Deputy Doherty's figures.  Even if it is small, however, it is unfair because others have not lost out at all or have even done reasonably okay or very well during the pandemic.  That is the unfairness and that is how it will be seen.  I do not really see how the Minister can justify it in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#M00700","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I will begin with the comparison Deputy Boyd Barrett made with the taxation of intellectual property.  Of course, with regard to revenue which might have been available from intellectual property and the Seamus Coffey argument at the time the Deputy refers, it was not the intention of the State to tax that income at that point in our history.  It was the case of the State taxing this income in our recent history.  That is the difference between the two.<\/p> <p>  I make the point to Deputy Boyd Barrett that the increasing corporate tax revenue has slowed down in September and October, as I expected it to.  Nonetheless, what we see happening in our corporate tax revenues over 2020 shows we are effectively taxing companies which, one could argue and in some places would be correct in arguing, are doing well in a time of pandemic.  That, therefore, is why we have increasing corporate tax revenues.  The difference in our argument at this debate with regard to this revenue is that we made clear at that point it was the intention of the Government to tax it.  That was made clear in the D&aacute;il by me and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.<\/p> <p>   I will address the questions put to me by Deputy Boyd Barrett regarding how much revenue could be affected by this.  I have been reminded by my officials that the reason, of course, depends on what the taxable income of an individual will be across the entire year as opposed to the point in time to which we refer, in other words, between March and August.  Unusually, I do not have the figures available to me right now.  We tax income on the basis of the year as a whole.  Because of the many layers of uncertainty regarding the year and the way in which income has changed across that period, the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Finance are not in a position to be able to say what we expect that figure to be.  My expectation, however, is that for many of those affected the figure will be spread across a four-year period.  While it is, of course, still a tax people will pay, I do not believe it will be as big as many other tax taxable liabilities people will face and have to pay.  I believe it will be a small share of our overall taxable income.<\/p> <p>  I will answer the question put to me by Deputy Doherty and then go back to the question of timing from Deputy Barry who asked when that information will be available.  I reaffirm again that this payment was made under section 202 of the Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020.  However, just because it was made under that heading does not mean we can ignore the rest of the social welfare code and the rest of the social welfare legislation.  Section 189 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 is clear in saying that supplementary welfare allowances are means-tested.<\/p><p>This is not a supplementary welfare allowance.  It is an income support.  While I am absolutely aware of the consequences it will have for those affected, as an income support it has to be taxed as such.  That was made clear at the time of its introduction.  It has also been made clear in how it has been taxed throughout 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#N00200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1605484800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 5; N\u00edl, 4.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#O00250","aye":["1584","1626","1496","1553","1473"],"nay":["1522","1462","1579","1504"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605484800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>SECTION 4<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 4 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#P00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":62,"content":"<p>On section 4, I ask the Minister if this is the first time this will be made exempt from tax and the background to this allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#P00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Excuse me, is this-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#P00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>The home sharing host allowance being exempt from income tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#P00500","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Section 4 amends the principal Act in order to address this oversight and to regularise the tax exemption of the home sharing host allowance.

The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on the economic and distributional impact of the Help to Buy Scheme.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>Amendment No. 2 uses the mechanism the Opposition has to raise issues relating to subject matters of the Bill and that is to seek a report economic and distributional impact of the help to buy scheme within six months of the passing of the Bill and lay it before the D&aacute;il.  The help-to-buy scheme is dealt with in section 7, a section to which Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed.  The help-to-buy scheme has been around for quite a while but the Government in its wisdom - or maybe lack of wisdom - has decided to turboboost it.  One would really have to question its thinking on this.  Covid-19 has caused significant challenges for the construction sector, which was closed in its entirety for a period of time due to the restrictions and is now operating under restrictions that do not allow as much capacity and output to take place and rightly so because we need to keep our community and people safe.  However, this will mean less output.  The demand is still there, as we know, and indeed is increasing.  There is a significant amount of pent-up demand.  Supply will probably be severely curtailed this year and for the best part of next year but the Government has decided to turbocharge the help-to-buy scheme by increasing the amount of money available to people to purchase homes by increasing it from 20% to 30%.<\/p><p>It will do that over the next year as it had done under the July stimulus.  The problem in the area of housing, as we have said over and over, is not demand but supply.  We need to rapidly increase housing supply and it needs to be affordable.  A core belief of Sinn F&eacute;in is that we need to suppress rather than increase house prices.  A big decision will be taken later today by Dublin City Council on what it will do with State land, what is affordable and so on.  The proposal is to provide, on a statutory basis, for an increase in the amount available under the help-to-buy scheme to &euro;30,000.  This scheme was to conclude at the end of the year but the Government will now extend it for a further year.  The Minister does not need to take my word on this; others have spoken.  The Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO, does great work in support of members of this committee preparing for the Finance Bill.  It describes the policy impact of this section.  I will read from its analysis of the help-to-buy scheme in full so that I cannot be accused of being selective.  <\/p><blockquote>\tAn analysis by the PBO in 2019 found evidence of sizeable dead-weight in relation to the HTB scheme, and suggested that the scheme did not fulfil its original aims in an efficient manner.  Specifically, some households who had claims approved for the HTB scheme, already had deposits of at least 10% accumulated.<br \/><br \/>This analysis also found that 21% of claims under the HTB scheme were for properties valued at over &euro;375,000.  This suggests that those benefiting from the scheme were households at the higher-end of the income distribution.  Considering these findings, the decision to enhance and extend the scheme in this way, is questionable. <\/blockquote><p>If the Minister does not want to take the word of the Parliamentary Budget Office, which has its views, the ESRI has also commented on the scheme.  Dr. Barra Roantree noted that research has shown that 40% of first-time buyers making a claim under the scheme had a deposit of at least 20% before applying.  Let us consider that.  During this time of great constraint - we all know the challenges - the Minister is asking us to approve a Government plan to provide &euro;30,000 to people to purchase their house, 40% of whom do not need the money.  I am not saying that; the ESRI is saying it.  In fact, it is not even the ESRI saying it because the Central Bank provided the statistics.  Many people have a deposit of at least 20% - some have more - before applying.  They have a mortgage but the Government in its wisdom has decided to give them &euro;30,000 of taxpayers' money.  That would be fine.  Who would not want &euro;30,000 of taxpayers' money when building or buying their first home?  Everyone would want it and anyone who has got it will be delighted.  However, in a time of lack of supply and increased demand, this pushes up house prices.  We have seen examples of that in a number of counties as soon as the Government announced this increase back in July.  In some estates, house prices went up by &euro;10,000 overnight.  I am sure the Minister will accuse me of arguing that he favours developers and vulture funds and is taxing the poor people who have lost their jobs.  Again, let us look at what Dr. Roantree from the ESRI said.  He stated this measure would push up demand for housing at a time when output was falling back due to the pandemic.  The scheme applies only to new houses.  He told an ESRI conference on the impact of budget 2021 that the scheme was &quot;likely to fuel property price growth&quot; and would, therefore, &quot;push up prices.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Already, 8,000 claimants for the scheme have not needed this support.  That amounts to &euro;24 million.  Everyone here will know of community groups or may be involved in organisations that are supporting children and families with disabilities or areas that really need support, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p> Not only is the Minister ignoring the ESRI, saying that 40% of the claimants of this did not need the &euro;20,000, but he is saying forget about all that, forget that there is less supply than ever and more demand than ever and let us throw some fuel on the fire.  Let us give them an extra &euro;10,000 to bring it to &euro;30,000.  What will that do?  It will push up property prices.  Who benefits from that?  It is not the person who is taking out a 30-year mortgage with a bank.  There is only one benefiter as the Minister and I both know.  The person who benefits is the developer.  The Minister may not like to hear it, but that is the reality.<\/p><p> Section 7 of the Bill is about stuffing money into the pockets of developers because it will push up prices.  The Minister and I both know it; he should be upfront and say it.  He should listen to the ESRI and the Parliamentary Budget Office.  He should look at what is happening on the ground.  At a time of lack of supply and increased demand, the Minister introduces a measure that will only further increase demand.  What happens in that context?  Do prices fall?  No, they actually rise.  That is why there is only one beneficiary of this provision.  When house prices increase, people who have mortgages end up paying increasingly more over longer periods of time.<\/p><p> We are completely opposed to this section.  The amendment seeks a report, but the reality is that the Minister should not proceed with the section which is flawed.  In the words of the Parliamentary Budget Office, it is questionable.  In the words of Dr. Roantree of the ESRI, it will push up property prices.  In the words of Sinn F&eacute;in, it is a section that will only benefit developers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#S00600","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Who benefits from the help-to-buy scheme?  We will deal with the issue of first-time buyers in a moment.  It is quite clear that developers gain significantly from this Government policy.  It is not even necessary to have studied leaving certificate economics to know that if supply is not matching demand by a long shot, and the Government increases demand with a policy like this, it will drive up the price of the commodity, in this case the house.  It is not just abstract economics that indicates that; the reality on the ground bears it out.  Almost immediately after this measure was announced in the budget, house prices in Cork increased by up to &euro;10,000.  The information I have from those in other big cities is that the story is much the same elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, developers gain directly from this policy.  Private banks also gain; developers are not the only winners.  Not only does this increase the wherewithal for deposits, the mortgages will last longer with more interest being paid over the lifetime of those mortgages.  Therefore, it is good news for private banks and increases their profits.<\/p> <p>  The extent to which it benefits first-time buyers is questionable.  Certainly, this scheme will make the difference for some first-time buyers.  Many of them will need to pay more interest in the long term to the banks.  However, many people who aspire to become first-time buyers will not benefit from this scheme.  That is particularly true for those on lower incomes and younger people.  Many lower-paid workers and younger workers will not have paid &euro;30,000 over the past four years and effectively will be locked out from the scheme.<\/p><p>One could argue, if this was the only tool available to the Government and the State, that one should consider it.  However, it is not the only tool.  There are other and far better tools available to the State.  For example, many observers of the housing scene and not necessarily people on the political left would agree with me that the money the State spends on this scheme would be far better spent if it was provided to the local authorities and those authorities were allowed to use it to build council houses and genuinely affordable houses for people on low and middle incomes, in particular.  If we look at this in the round, while many first-time buyers will have hopes that this scheme might make the difference for them, in general, it benefits the developers first and the private banks second.  Many aspiring first-time buyers do not benefit from it.  There are better alternatives.  The money should be going to social and affordable housing built by the State through the local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#U00200","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":92,"content":"<p>We have a proposal in regard to the help-to-buy scheme, which looks for a report on the potential for reconfiguring it to allow it to be expanded to include first-time purchasers of second-hand houses.  There is an issue relating to the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, which will not give a mortgage towards the refurbishment of an existing house.  Across the country, we have a huge number of vacant properties in our towns and villages and a lack of supply of housing for people who want to set up their homes.  It is an ideal opportunity but we seem to have excluded the idea of a second-hand purchase being something that is good.  Something should be done in regard to properties  any town or village, including in my constituency, so that we could bring a family back to town or village to create vibrancy there.  However, we are not offering anything to do that.  The help-to-buy scheme could be used to create that incentive, as well as affording the Rebuilding Ireland mortgage scheme the opportunity to support the purchase and refurbishment of existing houses for first-time buyers.<\/p> <p>  We all talk about the fact that we have homelessness and a lack of housing supply but when one looks around the country, or drives through any town or village, one will see the potential that is there.  In Headford in my constituency, a survey was done by secondary school transition year students on the number of vacant houses that could be brought back into use if there was support for first-time buyers.  Imagine what vibrancy we would bring back into these towns and villages if we did that.  Over the past two years in my town of Tuam, I have seen people who have businesses come back in to live over their shops on the basis that it is better for them and their families are with them more often, rather than living out in the countryside.  As well as that, they are in close to the schools their children go to.  It is important that we look at this not from a developer's point of view but as an aid to help first-time buyers.  I would be interested to see what report the Minister can bring forward on this matter.<\/p> <p>  I believe passionately that if we are to revitalise our towns and villages, we need to provide the infrastructure, wastewater facilities and so on, but there are towns that have such infrastructure and facilities.

It is an ineffective and ineffectual use of scant taxpayers' resources.  As other Deputies pointed out, it is not just me or others in this House who have said this; all the evidence provided by the ESRI, the commentary from the Parliamentary Budget Office and, indeed, as I understand it, advice provided by officials in the Department of Finance to the Minister would indicate that this is what is known as a dead weight policy.  In other words, it uses taxpayers' resources, money that belongs to the State, to support and promote activity that would happen in any event.  That is not the kind of approach we need to take to address our very difficult housing challenges.<\/p><p> I understand the logic and the principle of providing the State's resources to support, in some cases, those who require support to obtain their first home, but this is not the way to do so.  It may, at some point in the future, have to form part of an overall package to support those in need of housing.  However, this is not a policy for housing but a policy for developers, who will benefit extraordinarily from the largesse of the State if we are to pursue these kinds of policies for the reasons pointed out by other Deputies and eminent economists such as Dr. Roantree in the ESRI and those who work with the Parliamentary Budget Office.

We are looking for the help-to-buy and the Rebuilding Ireland home loan schemes to be extended not just to new builds but also to second-hand properties.  As the Minister will be aware, the census in 2016 highlighted that there are 80,000 homes vacant across the country that could have families in them.  Some of these homes have fibre-optic cable outside the door.  Many of them are in close proximity to schools that do not have existing pressures on them, to childcare facilities and to other amenities.  Some of these houses are in housing estates where there has not been a football kicked on the streets in perhaps 30 years because many of them now are home to older people.  Younger families have not moved into these areas.  We have seen huge levels of depopulation across many of our provincial towns and rural villages.  There is an opportunity here to revitalise these communities while also taking pressure off new-build housing in our bigger towns and cities.  What we are looking for, therefore, is that the incentives in place be made available to first-time buyers purchasing second-hand properties and that they also be extended for the refurbishment of those properties - not just the refurbishment of existing residential accommodation but also the refurbishment of what were previously commercial premises.<\/p> <p>  In many of our villages and smaller towns, commercial premises have closed and are lying vacant.  If we could get families back into those communities, it would bring a new life, new blood, into them, particularly with many people now working remotely.  Pretty much all of our villages have fibre-optic cable.  Many of our towns are getting fibre-optic cable as we speak from some of the commercial operators.  There is a huge opportunity for those people who can work remotely now to relocate from Dublin and the major urban centres, especially if they have young families, and to avoid commuting for hours into the city, improving their quality of life.<\/p><p>There is an opportunity to bring back numbers into local schools to make them viable.  The State has already paid significant amounts of money to construct and redevelop these schools and it has put in significant amounts of investment in terms of existing infrastructure.  It makes a lot of sense.<\/p><p> Deputy Doherty spoke earlier about the current structure of the two schemes and that they are pushing up property prices.  He referenced the research from the ESRI and from our own Parliamentary Budget Office on this.  If this were extended beyond exclusively new homes it would take off some of the pressure while, at the same time, bring life back into areas where there have been significant problems with depopulation up to now and where there have been significant problems with dereliction.

In Dublin they have increased by &euro;160,000 on average since 2011.  This is an incredible legacy for a Fine Gael Party that has been in government on two occasions since then.  With all of the competing negative legacies coming from the housing sector we forget about this one.  This average &euro;100,000 throughout the State does one of two things.  It prevents a chunk of people, a massive section of people, ever getting a home and it puts those who do get a home at those prices in hock to banks for a decade or two extra.  That money comes out of their income as a result.  It is an incredible situation.  In a normal functioning society, the price of a house should be approximately three to four times the average industrial wage but in this State it is between six and seven times the average industrial wage in most of the State and in Dublin it can be ten times the average industrial wage.  We know there has been a massive problem with the increase in the price of housing in the past while.<\/p><p>Another startling fact is that according to <i>daft.ie<\/i>the supply of houses is at its lowest point today than it has been in 14 years.  After the past ten years of the Government, we have never seen a lower supply of housing in the State.  It is one third less than it was this time last year.  One of the first things anybody studying leaving certificate economics learns is the supply and demand curve.  It is the foundation stone of anybody's understanding of how economics works.  If we have a rigid supply curve and the level of demand is increased, the equilibrium price increases.  There is not a person with any level of understanding of economics in the country that does not understand that much.  However, most of the Government's response to this has been on the demand side when the supply side has not been happening at all.<\/p><p>People such as me have been making the argument to deal with the level of vacant homes in the State.  One in 33 homes in the State are vacant and we have not seen enough on this.  The implementation of the vacant site tax has been incredibly poor.  Only approximately ten local authorities have been able to implement it and only 140 sites in the country have been able to be taxed.  The taxation levels on vacant sites is lower than the increments in prices received.  It is still not being used as a motivational tool to get these sites into function.<\/p><p>There has to be no doubt, even in the Ministers' minds, that if we continuously focus on increasing the amount of money that is chasing the rigid supply it will not lead to more houses.  It leads to an increase in price.  The important part for people who are buying houses is where this money will land.  Will it land in their pockets or in the pockets of developers?  The economics are very clear on this.  It will land in the developers' pockets in the long run.  I know from the debates we had in the D&aacute;il last week, and some of the narrative we have had here, that Fine Gael is angry at this insistence by the Opposition that the benefit of its policy is landing in the hands of developers as opposed to citizens.<\/p><p>From everything that has been said at the meeting, however, it is evidentially a fact that the benefit of the Government's policy is landing in the pockets of developers rather than in the hands of citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#X00200","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Between 70% and 80% of working people cannot afford the average house price on their incomes.  That is a damning indictment of the Government's failure to solve society's most basic need, namely, to provide an affordable roof over someone's head, particularly for those who would expect that the fact they work hard and earn a living would give them an income sufficient to buy a home.  The vast majority are not in a position to do so because successive Governments have messed up the housing sector badly.  Since 2011, Governments have compounded that problem significantly.  There are many elements to the outrageous scandal, which will go down in the history books as the greatest mistake any Irish Government ever made, of selling off all of NAMA's properties to developers who are now building shockingly overpriced housing, including at excessive rents, speculating and hoarding land to drive up prices.<\/p> <p>  Given the abysmal failure to do the most basic thing, there are two ways to address this historic mistake and the crisis it has produced.  The Government can try to find ways to give more public money to people to pay unaffordable and extortionate house prices, which is what this scheme does, benefiting only the people who are profiting from the dysfunctional housing sector.  Alternatively, it can try to drive down the price of housing to affordable levels.  The measure in the Bill is moving in the opposite direction from what is self-evidently what we must do, namely, driving down the cost of housing.<\/p> <p>  I am convinced that this and the previous Governments have failed to deliver a clear definition of \"affordable housing\" and messed around with land development agencies and so on because of a fear that the State delivering affordable housing - in other words, housing that is not based on market prices but simply on making it affordable - would mess up the private developers.  That is essentially why we have not developed affordable housing in places like Shanganagh and why there is a reluctance to define affordability or roll out affordable housing on scale.  If the State built housing at cost and set prices at levels that were affordable for the average worker, it would effectively mean that private developers could not make a profit out of housing anymore because there would be housing at below the market price at which they could make a profit.<\/p> <p>  In this sense, the Government continues to dance to the tune of the private developers, who are telling us straight that they cannot deliver housing at a price that is affordable.  In order for them to be able to deliver housing at all, they have to charge high prices to give themselves their profit margins and cover site costs, marketing and so on.  All of this has been well broken down by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland and so on.  Developers cannot deliver housing at anything like affordable levels.  The State can and should, given that it can build on its own land on a not-for-profit basis.  However, the State is reluctant to do so because it would mess up the private developers.<\/p><p>Given that situation, we end up coming up with hare-brained schemes like this which do nothing to deal with the fundamental problem that we face.  I refer to a massive shortage of affordable housing and a market which is dysfunctional and incapable of delivering to the vast majority of working people in this country.  It is a retrograde scheme, it has done nothing to address the fundamentals of the housing crisis and it should be abandoned in favour of measures that are about actually delivering affordable housing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#Y00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":101,"content":"<p> As it is now 1 p.m., I am obliged to suspend the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#Z00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605484800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.01 p.m. and resumed at 1.40 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I do not propose to agree to the proposed amendments.  Notwithstanding that the help-to-buy scheme is scheduled to sunset at the end of next year, further support is needed in the delivery of new homes, as the situation remains as acute now as it was before and during the summer.  Section 7 provides for the additional support to continue for 2021.  As discussed, it is my proposal that the increased level of support will continue to apply to applicants who sign a contract for the purchase of a new home, or who make the first drawdown of a mortgage in the case of a self-build situation, during 2021.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, it is worth pointing out that the average price of a house purchased under the help-to-buy scheme has dropped marginally year-on-year in the period from January to the end of October this year, that is from &euro;329,000 to &euro;328,000.  Regarding the specific points which these amendments seek to address, I should point out that non-tax-based housing measures, such as the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, are matters, in the first instance, for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, rather than for me.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of the effectiveness of the help-to-buy scheme and its impact on the market, at the request of Deputies this policy has already been the subject of two independent reviews.  The review of the impact assessment was published as part of budget 2018 documents and the report on the cost-benefit analysis was published on the day of budget 2019.  The most recent of the reports concluded that there may have been a small increase in prices attributable to the introduction of the incentive.  The primary driver of house prices, however, remained the continued gap between demand and supply.  The evidence also suggests that following the introduction of the incentive, there was a market increase in supply, which can be attributed, in part, to the help-to-buy scheme.  The analysis also found that the availability of the help-to-buy scheme has reduced the time required to save for all claimants and has improved the overall affordability of housing for these individuals.<\/p> <p>  Significant progress has been made in recent years to add to the construction of additional housing units.  Before the onset of Covid-19, the number of housing completions forecast for 2020 was in the range of 24,000 to 26,000 units, which was an increase from the 21,000 completions recorded by the CSO in 2019.  However, as a result of the Covid-19 restrictions, all non-essential construction ceased for a seven-week period between March and May 2020.  Upon reopening, the sector had to adopt new safety measures, with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, noting that new social distancing requirements could delay delivery of new homes by up to ten weeks.<\/p><p>According to the CSO, at the end of the third quarter there have been approximately 13,400 housing completions.  The Central Bank projects that completions are expected to reach 17,500 units in 2020 and the current expectations are for approximately 22,000 and 27,400 units in 2021 and 2022, respectively.<\/p><p> Whereas the lockdowns and new safety requirements will continue to limit the total number of units completed in 2020, I am encouraged by the data which show that the sector is faring well in terms of rehiring workers who were previously in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment.  That sector is remaining open in this phase of public health guidance.<\/p><p> I will respond to some of the points made in the debate.  It is important to place the scheme in the context of what it is worth for the average person on it and the benefit he or she gets.  A recent examination found the average income of a married couple or a couple in civil partnership who made a claim for the help-to-buy scheme was &euro;77,100 in total, with the basis of these earnings in the 2016 tax year.  This would equate to two individuals earning a salary of approximately &euro;38,500.  With respect to some of the charges made about who is benefiting from the scheme and the effect this is having, the average figures for the people participating in the scheme show that the benefits flow to those who are either at or below average income.<\/p><p> It is worth putting the number of house purchases that the scheme affects in context.  This leads to some of the requests that have been made of me.  The total number of approved help-to-buy claims that have been made up to 30 September is 3,897.  Across that period, the total number of new builds was 13,394, meaning 29% of new builds purchased here are being purchased by people in receipt of the help-to-buy scheme.<\/p><p> Claims have been made about the inflationary effect of the scheme.  Two reports commissioned acknowledged that the scheme is having and can have an effect on house prices but we must look at this effect in the context of the general significant reduction in house prices that happened in the period up to 2011 and 2012.  The total number of new builds that are being supported by the help-to-buy scheme is less than one from every three new builds.  Claiming that the scheme is having significant inflationary effects, particularly this year, is at odds with the share of the first-time purchases that are being co-funded by the help-to-buy scheme.<\/p><p> Some requests were made of me for this scheme.  Both Deputies Naughten and Canney asked that I commission a report on the scheme's operation if it were for house purchases beyond new builds, including second-hand homes.  I wish to indicate to both Deputies that it is not a change I would be willing to make to the scheme.  A broadening of the help-to-buy scheme focusing on existing housing stock would be far more likely to have an inflationary effect on the housing market, thereby unravelling the effect that I hope this scheme will have as a contribution as one of a number of measures to improve the affordability of our housing market.  I hope it will support our housing market as it looks to recover from Covid-19.<\/p><p> Other points were made about the scheme.<\/p><p>Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n made the point that house prices have increased by &euro;100,000 since 2011.  He ignores the fact that in the period preceding that, we saw a dramatic decrease in house prices.  While there has been an increase in house prices since then, in many if not all cases, they are still below, thankfully, the level of pricing we saw during the bubble.  This reflects the macroprudential rules and the effect of ensuring that help-to-buy is not applicable to second-house homes.  It is also the effect of the different decisions made by the Government to try to increase housing supply in recent years.<\/p><p> Deputies Barry, Doherty and Boyd Barrett made several claims about the operation of the help-to-buy scheme.  I pointed to the number and percentage of new builds actually supported by the scheme, as well as to the conclusions reached by various reports on its operation.  The charge was made, or at least inferred, that this is taking the place of what the Government is doing through encouraging, for example, expenditure measures for the delivery of new homes, or the increase in the amount of money going into the delivery of social housing, or the co-funding infrastructure to allow the delivery of new private homes to be built or the foundation of the Land Development Agency.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Instead, we have a high level of capital expenditure going into either enabling the delivery of new homes or building them directly via the State.<\/p><p> Deputy Doherty referred to the decision in front of Dublin City Council tonight.  I hope agreement can be made to allow those homes in question to be built.  My understanding is that up to 50% of homes due to be built on the site in question will be for social and public use with a minority of them for private use.  The city council is looking to build more than 800 homes on the site in question.  While it is a decision for the councillors themselves, it appears that reaching an agreement on housing projects of that scale in the context of the issues private housing output is facing are the kind of decisions that can contribute to the recovery of housing output in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#HH00100","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>My first question would be to understand where the Minister is coming from.

I will not go into the discussions Dublin City Council will have as they will be well played out later on.  However, it goes to the core of Fine Gael's policy, which it pushes strongly, which allows for a large portion of State lands to be used for private profit purposes with no restrictions on affordability.  What is the Minister's understanding of affordable housing?<\/p> <p>  On the points I made earlier, the Minister did not respond to any them.  Will he respond to the fact that 40% of those who are benefiting from the scheme will not require any proceeds from the scheme to have the deposit to buy their first-time house?  That 40%, 8,000 applicants, represents approximately &euro;24 million.  What is his view on what some would call or what is known as deadweight?  What is his view of the fact that 56% of the help-to-buy recipients bought houses in excess of &euro;300,000, while 22%, nearly one in four, bought houses in excess of &euro;376,000?

The fact that some people load themselves up with debt and take on mortgages that need an excessive proportion of their income to pay for accommodation does not mean that the system is good or working; it just means that people are desperate and overextend themselves.  The truth is that people should not pay more than 25% to 30% of their incomes on accommodation costs.  House prices, particularly in Dublin and some other large urban centres, are way in excess of that cost.  People on average incomes are paying a much higher proportion of their incomes to try to pay for a home.<\/p> <p>  All resources and initiatives of the Government should be put into making houses affordable.  The Minister said that the initiative is not causing major inflation in the market, which is debatable, but even he is correct, it is doing nothing to bring house prices down to genuinely affordable levels.  All the resources available to him and the Government should be used to do that.  What we are actually doing is underpinning a massively inflated, unaffordable market.  The Minister might argue that the Government policies are not driving up prices, but they are certainly doing nothing to drive them down.  That is the problem.<\/p> <p>  I will not get into the argument about the Oscar Traynor Road development in a major way but suffice it to say it is an absolute scandal that public land would be used in any shape or form to provide housing at current market levels rather than provide it on a not-for-profit level that is actually affordable or for social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#LL00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I am disappointed in the Minister's approach to the proposal that the help-to-buy scheme be extended to second-hand houses.

That is the case in every policy that we evaluate.  There are always going to be a percentage of people in any economic policy that would be able, for example, to complete a transaction or do something even if a support policy was not in place for them.  Even according to Deputy Doherty's figures, 60% of people benefit from the scheme, and for the 40% to whom the Deputy refers, perhaps it gives them the opportunity to have a lower level of debt or to use the money to buy furniture and kit out their home.  For me, that is something that needs to be considered in the evaluation of the scheme.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to the point I made to Deputy Doherty earlier, the average couple on this scheme has an average income of &euro;77,000.  That is a real world example of who is being helped by the scheme.  One will always find couples and individuals who earn more than that, who are buying homes for more than the average value, but that is the average level of income for people who are participating in this scheme, which shows the help that it gives.  I do not agree with the idea that the scheme of itself is a cause for inflation within the housing market.  It could be the case that it is a partial contributor to the increase in the cost of houses in some areas, but there are many deeper factors at play than the presence of the help-to-buy scheme.<\/p><p>The total number of purchases on the scheme, as well as the percentage of the purchases as a total of first-time purchases of the new homes being built, rebut the claim that the scheme is a significant cause of housing inflation and a beneficiary to large developers.<\/p><p> On the Deputy's question regarding comments made by the ESRI and the Parliamentary Budget Office, I am aware of those comments.  We will evaluate the impact of this scheme on the housing market next year.  The ESRI would take a very different view from that of Deputy Doherty on retention of the local property tax or decisions on amending carbon pricing.  As a politician who aspires to be the Minister for Finance and to see his party in government, the Deputy forms a view on measures which he believes to be beneficial and fair.  Sometimes institutions evaluating policies, even when one in government, take a different view on the impact of schemes in particular policy areas.  I go back to the two reports I mentioned that did not find evidence of this scheme having the impact on the housing market that the Deputy suggested.  I will review the impact of the scheme on the housing market next year given the amount of change taking place in the housing market at the moment and the uncertainty concerning housing output.  <\/p><p> To respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett, I am not arguing that this is the only thing the Government is doing to try to support housing output.  The Deputy acknowledged that.  This scheme is simply one element of that.  The Government may not be doing all the other things the Deputy called on us to do at the scale he wants.  However, we are increasing capital expenditure, paying for and co-funding infrastructure and moving ahead with major public transport projects to allow the release of more land on which to build more homes.  The Deputy wants us to do more of that and he will argue, no doubt, that we are not doing enough but this is just one policy measure alongside an array of other policy measures that are being put in place by the Government.<\/p><p> To respond to Deputies Canney and Naughten, it is increasingly the case that local authorities are purchasing vacant properties.  I hope the incentive to purchase such properties will be reflected in the selling price the local authorities are offering purchasers and that there will be no need for them to be included in the help-to-buy scheme.  In my constituency, which is highly urban and different from the settings the Deputies referred to, Dublin City Council is buying derelict properties at a very low price.  If it is looking to sell them on again, it has an opportunity to offer the properties at a very affordable price to potential purchasers on the basis of the low purchase price as opposed to including them in the help-to-buy scheme.<\/p><p> On Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell's point about affordability, there is a need for measures that drive affordability in the housing market.  Where the Deputy and I differ is that I see this as being a measure that tries to get the balance right between, on the one hand, enabling the supply of houses at a time when we need more homes to be built and, on the other, making a contribution to people on the scheme - the total number of participants last year was 6,600 - that the majority of them need to build up a deposit and help make a house purchase affordable.  From my point of view, that is one of the main reasons this scheme is in place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#MM00600","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I wish to respond to the Minister's comment about local authorities.  The situation in Dublin is very different from the situation in rural areas.  The difficulty is that local authorities are not purchasing these vacant houses in villages and smaller towns because there is not a demand for housing in those villages.  There are a number of villages with a large amount of vacant residential accommodation, but local authorities are not interested in purchasing this because they do not have any or have few people on their housing lists or the people on their housing lists are single people or require one- or two-bedroom accommodation, whereas these are family homes.  If we are going to rely on local authorities to bring life back into these smaller villages, we might as well throw in the towel now.  What we are talking about are families living in urban areas who are seeking housing and who would relocate back to these communities where there is fibre optic cable outside the door and where it would be attractive for them to purchase a property.  It would probably be at a lower price and probably within their capacity to service the mortgage.

It argued for a different scheme, indeed, one close to what the Green Party put forward.  Perhaps the Minister's clutching at the carbon tax and the ESRI might not have been the best example he could use, because it is one that has been used to show that the Minister's proposal is flawed.<\/p> <p>  I will return to the core of what we are discussing.  Perhaps the Minister could answer the question about what is affordable in Dublin, the capital city, because it relates to that core issue.

That is not the case.  The Minister might be misinterpreting the figures, which are the figures he provided from the Revenue Commissioners to Deputy &Oacute; Broin in reply to a parliamentary question.  When we say that 40% of individuals did not need this for the deposit, that means 40% had a loan-to-value ratio of less than 85%.  Some 3,000 of these individuals had a loan-to-value as low as between 70% to just under 75%.  The number of people who had a loan-to-value of 90%, which is the figure one needs under the Central Bank's rules, was 35%.  It is not the case that the majority of them needed this.  Only 35% of those who availed of the help-to-buy scheme needed all the support required to enable them to get the mortgage.  The other 65%, to one degree or another, did not need the full payment and we know for a fact that at least 40% needed none of it.  They are the figures.  It is not a majority.<\/p><p>The Minister talks of dead weight in schemes and of course that is there but this is different.  The core issue is there is a lack of supply and the Government is throwing money at it.  We were in the Seanad Chamber for the earlier part of the meeting and myself and the Minister were Members of that House during the crash.  We heard many times about the need to withdraw the punchbowl and all the rest and how what the then Government did was like throwing petrol on the fire and so and so forth.  All the Minister is doing here is creating demand for houses that are above the median price and demand where a large proportion of purchasers - at least 40% - need no support whatsoever and the majority do not need all of the support being provided.  Despite this the Minister feels this is the best way to use this money.  Every single figure we are given is under the old 5% and &euro;20,000 scheme.  What the Minister is deciding to do is to ramp it up to 10% and &euro;30,000.  It does not make sense any way one looks at it or dices it.  The Minister may disagree but the reality is the PBO and the ESRI have said this will push up house prices.  The problem is that I do not think that is a problem for the Minister.  He is okay with that.  Fine Gael are okay with that.  The Minister's predecessor, Mr. Michael Noonan, used to talk about needing to get a floor and how he wanted the vultures in to get a floor on property prices.  This is Fine Gael's way.  The Minister does not like me saying that but he keeps on showing me over and over again that this is the Fine Gael way and that this is what it is about.  Otherwise, the Government would not be using this type of money to do something, as independent agencies have said, that pushes up house prices.  <i>Daft.ie<\/i>have shown that house prices have increased in the third quarter by 2.7%.  In the past three months it has gone up 5%.  Other people have said since the Government announced its enhanced help-to-buy scheme, it would push up property prices because the demand has increased at a time of the weakest supply we have had in more than 14 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#OO00200","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I broadly echo the points made by Deputy O'Doherty.  One further thing is that it is not just about supply.  That is a point I have made repeatedly over recent years.  I remind the committee, because this is a very important point, that even when we had record levels of supply in this country, when we were delivering 70,000 to 90,000 houses a year, they were unaffordable.  They landed the country and the people in it in absolutely enormous debt.  Even if one were to expand supply on a massive scale, therefore, our recent experience tells us that does not deliver affordability and in fact it can deliver the opposite.  That is how distorted the market is, and that is because the market is operating on the principle of profit.  We know, because the builders tell us, that they cannot deliver housing at anything remotely approximating affordability.  They just cannot do it.  That is the problem we have, and we intend to compound it by giving them public land on which to build more unaffordable housing.  That really beggars belief and the Government will say, \"We are getting 50% and, by the way, the Land Development Agency says 10% is the minimum\".  We may get more sometimes and we will get an undefined affordable proportion but then we will also have market-priced housing on public land that will contribute to an already unaffordable housing sector by any meaningful definition.<\/p> <p>  I pose the same question to the Minister as Deputy Doherty did, but slightly more sharply.  Is it not fair to say that 25 to 30% of average income is as much as anyone should spend on mortgage or rent?<\/p><p>Is that a reasonable definition of affordability?  If so, then we need to deliver housing at scale at that level, that is, housing that will only cost about 25% to 30% of average incomes in mortgage repayments or rent.  Anything more than that is excessive, will overstretch people and is of no use in solving the current crisis.  It simply serves to sustain private developers in business.  They are not capable of delivering affordable housing, even if they wanted to, because of their costs and their need to make a profit.  They just cannot do it so why on earth would the Government do anything to underpin or sustain what is a completely unaffordable and out-of-kilter housing sector?  All resources, all land available to the State and all policy measures should be directed at delivering housing that is affordable, that is, social housing for those who could never hope to buy and affordable housing at prices that are affordable for ordinary working people.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#PP00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I will deal with Deputy Naughten's point first.  He said that he wanted this incentive to be made available for vacant second-hand homes.  If there is an issue with local authorities being unable or unwilling to purchase derelict properties and to then sell them on, the inclusion of such properties in the help to buy scheme will not have a big impact.  The Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, received additional money in the budget for expenditure measures including the town and village renewal schemes.  Allowing local authorities to purchase homes and to then sell them on at a discounted price to people who can afford them is a far more impactful way of dealing with the issue that Deputies Naughten and Canney raised, rather than including vacant second-hand properties in the help to buy scheme.  That is why additional money has been made available for the aforementioned schemes.<\/p> <p>  I repeat what I said in my first answer to Deputy Doherty, namely, that a definition of affordability depends on the location of the home and the income of those who are looking to buy it.  It is not my objective, however, to have policies in place that are driving up the price of homes.  That is not the case.  In each of the budgets I have presented, I put significant amounts of money into capital expenditure measures to try to increase the supply of homes.  I want to see stability in house pricing.  If we are to see price increases at all, I want them to be moderate.  I do not want any increases getting further in the way of the affordability that he and I are debating.  That is why I have, over the years, made more money available through capital expenditure to allow more homes to be built.  It is also why I support the implementation of the macroprudential rules of the Central Bank.  I want to be very explicit in saying to Deputy Doherty that it is not the objective of policies that I have in place to cause inflation within the housing market.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's rebuttal of the point I made regarding the ESRI, which we will debate again later on, it is a hell of leap from the Deputy's quoting of the ESRI's support for a different method of increasing carbon prices and ensuring they are equitable and have less of an effect on vulnerable families to the Sinn F&eacute;in policy of not supporting an increase in carbon pricing at all.  There is a big leap between those two positions but as the Deputy said himself, it is up to politicians and Ministers to take a view on policies that they think are appropriate and fair.<\/p><p>On the Deputy's point in respect of 60% of those availing of the help-to-buy scheme not needing the full payment, it is a fair point.  However, I would make the point that it shows that for that 60% the help-to-buy scheme is helping them in the purchase of those homes.  I believe that help is valuable and has an effect.  I go back to the point that has been at the centre of this debate and which I have put to Deputy Doherty, namely, that if one looks at the average income of persons on this scheme, be they a couple or a single person seeking to purchase a house, they are deserving of support through a programme such as the help-to-buy scheme.<\/p><p> On the points made by Deputy Boyd Barrett, I believe that public housing should be built on public land, but I also believe there is a role for private housing on it and there is room for affordable housing on it.  It is about time we got the balance and the mix right.  There are issues relating to the affordability of the private sector in delivering homes, but that is why, for example, we have the Land Development Agency and things such as the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, that is trying to co-fund infrastructure in order to reduce the cost of developing homes.  It is not yet having the impact I want it to have, but I am fully supportive of continuing to have the money in place behind that scheme so that it can have an effect in what could be a different housing market next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#QQ00200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I wish to withdraw amendment No. 2 and reserve the right to reintroduce it on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#RR00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605484800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 10, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:  \t<b>8. <\/b>The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on the Help to Buy scheme which shall cover the following areas: <blockquote> \t(a) the impact on overall house prices of the scheme;<br \/><br \/>(b) the impact on the profits in construction, banking, and other related property sectors;<br \/><br \/>(c) other measures and interventions that may deliver affordable housing at a lower cost to householders and public funds.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#RR00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 3 has already been discussed.

The only incentive at present is an allowance of up to &euro;3.20 a day which can be paid by an employer to an employee who works remotely.  People were looking at this very differently this time last year, but everyone now accepts that remote working is something we should be trying to encourage.<\/p><p>It comes back to the point I made earlier regarding vacant property in many regional towns and villages in rural areas.  There is a major opportunity now to assist people in terms of their quality of life, participating in communities and keeping schools and post offices in villages alive by allowing them to work remotely.  While people living in cities are beginning to realise that there are opportunities to relocate to rural areas, and quite a number of auctioneers are reporting an interest in that, which I pointed out to the Minister previously, there needs to be encouragement from the Government in that regard.  It needs to encourage people to relocate to rural areas and to work remotely utilising the investment that will be put in under the national broadband plan.  While I mention the national broadband plan, the Minister might indicate in his response if any additional funding will be put into that plan next year.  The profile funding as announced on budget day is the funding he and I previously agreed for the national broadband plan.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to increase that investment and fast-track the roll-out of the broadband plan.  He might indicate if there are any plans to do that over the coming 12 months.<\/p><p> When I spoke to the Minister privately I mentioned that putting an incentive in place such as the bike to work scheme, which has been extremely successful, would incentivise people, whether it is in the purchase of a laptop if they do not have one, or, in preparing for the national broadband plan, putting in ducting, carrying out hedge cutting and so forth, which would save the Exchequer a significant amount of money.  As he is aware, under the national broadband plan the projected connection charge from the telegraph pole to a person's home is up to &euro;5,000.  If we could get people to do that work in advance through some sort of incentive or relief, similar to the bike to work scheme, it would save the Exchequer a significant amount of money but would also help to expedite the roll-out of the broadband plan because while many people may not realise it, bringing the fibre from the pole to the door of the house will be the slowest part of the roll-out of this particular project.  <\/p><p> As I said earlier, in many parts of the country the infrastructure, schools and childcare facilities are in place.  What we are missing is people.  When I raised this with the Minister in the House previously he highlighted concerns about the need to get people back into offices in cities.  I can understand, from an economic spend point of view particularly, the need to try to get people back working in offices in the city of Dublin but we cannot simply look at this from that perspective.  Pension funds will survive in regard to their office accommodation.  It might be the case that we should consider some sort of mechanism, which is an issue I will raise later during the discussion on this Bill, or incentive for the conversion of some of the office space in Dublin back into residential to deal with the housing crisis in the city.  This potentially is a win-win situation for everyone.  The incentives currently available are insufficient to encourage large numbers of people to consider remote working on a permanent basis.  I hope the Minister can examine that realistically and in a practical way to put incentives in place that would assist people in working remotely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#VV00800","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Is anybody else offering?

The potential for remote working is unreal.  We need to assist those who wish to work from home in doing so by providing a tax relief on the investment they must make.  A sum of &euro;3.20 per day is not a sufficient incentive for those who must adjust in order to work from home.  The opportunity exists.  We are investing so much money in broadband through the national broadband plan.  I supported this from day one and believe it is important but, to ensure we have the take-up of remote working required, people need to be able to work from home in a way that has been demonstrated in the past six months during the Covid pandemic.  We need to expand on it.  Doing so will help people in their daily and working lives and give them a better quality of life from a family perspective.

The responsibility for this falls with my Department.  There is also a commitment to the development of a national remote working strategy.  To that end, an interdepartmental group to consider this area has been set up.  Officials from my Department are included in this group, which is chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the current tax treatment of the costs associated with working from home, the position is that any such costs incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business by an employer, for example, the provision of equipment, may be deducted by the employer in the normal course of calculating the tax liability of their business.  From the perspective of the individual employee, there is no specific tax credit available to employees where they work from home.  The consideration of the introduction of any such credit would need to balance a number of factors, including issues of equity, noting that not every worker is able to work remotely or from home for a variety of reasons, including the nature of their work and also the nature of their home environment.  However, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that where e-workers incur certain extra expenditure in the performance of their duties of employment remotely or from home, such as additional heating and electricity costs, there is a Revenue administrative practice in place that allows an employer to make payments up to &euro;3.20 per day to such employees, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI or the USC. Where employers avail of this facility, they are not required to advise Revenue and, therefore, the number of employees reimbursed in this manner is not available.  Where employers choose to pay more than &euro;3.20, the excess is subject to a deduction of PAYE, PRSI and the USC.  <\/p> <p>  To respond to a point made by Deputies Canney and Naughten, it is not the case that the only support available is the &euro;3.20.  It is up to each employee working from home to decide whether a share of the expense of working from home can be deducted from the tax liability for the year, through the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>  The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purpose of this practice.<\/p><p> Revenue also advises that the provision of equipment, such as computers, scanners and office furniture, by the employer to enable the employee to work from home will not attract a benefit-in-kind charge where the equipment is provided primarily for business use.  The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a benefit-in-kind charge where private use of the connection is incidental.<\/p><p> I am advised that where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, the employee retains a statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of his or her employment.  PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional light and heat in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use.  As I announced on budget day, Revenue has agreed to allow broadband to qualify for this relief.  The apportionment is based on the number of days in the year the person spent working from home, with 30% of the apportioned value accepted by Revenue as related to work in the home.<\/p><p> I am, therefore, satisfied that the matter raised by the Deputies is being sufficiently considered through appropriate channels, with publication of the various findings in due course, so I do not believe there is a need to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#XX00200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>On the increase in the value of the naval personnel credit for another year, I am concerned this will not go far enough to help the people it is intended to help.

I have been writing and speaking for years about the possibilities and prospects of that and how policy can change to support new ways of working.  We will not all be saying goodbye to the bricks and mortar office, but it is about getting the balance right.  About half a million more of us now work from home than was the case prior to the pandemic.  Almost overnight in late March, many hundreds of thousands of people gravitated, almost automatically, from their offices to, in some cases, their kitchen table or box room, if it was available.

The burden should not fall on the Exchequer to support those who work from home but on those for whom employees work.  That is an argument we will make strongly and we will bring a Private Members' Bill on the matter to the House this week.  It will include initiatives to improve the security of those who work remotely and will update and enhance our suite of employment protections to reflect new ways of working.<\/p><p>It will also ensure that employers will have certainty regarding what their obligations to those working remotely are because employers have existing obligations in terms of the occupational health and safety code and all of the associated regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#YY00300","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":156,"content":"<p>In the context of the Minister's comments, what we will see is the hybrid model in general.  We will mainly see blended working involving people working from home part of the week, possibly working from a hot-desking facility and possibly working in their main office headquarters on a less regular basis than would have been the case up to now.  Flexibility and adaptability will be key.  We need a system whereby, as Deputy Nash outlined, the employer will provide support in terms of those costs.  We do not need the employee having to pay tax on that as a result of those facilities being provided to him or her.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned an interdepartmental working group has been established, which I welcome.  However, he will recall that this time last year he also announced the establishment of an interdepartmental working group relating to the provision of hot-desking facilities at vacant public sector office spaces across the country.  The Department of Social Protection has offices in my constituency of Roscommon along with offices in Longford, Carrick-on-Shannon, Sligo and Letterkenny.  Perhaps somebody from County Leitrim who is working in the Department of Education and Skills in Athlone could hot-desk in the Department of Social Protection in Carrick-on-Shannon if it has a vacant desk.  In the same way, an employee in the pensions office in Sligo could hot-desk at the facilities in Roscommon town.<\/p> <p>  A working group announced by the Minister on budget day last year was established.  Could he provide an update on the progress and how many hot-desking facilities have been made available to civil servants to allow them to work remotely rather than having to commute to Dublin or, alternatively, work from home?  It is a blended approach that will be needed.  Ultimately, many people will end up in hot-desking facilities.  As part of the national broadband plan, we are rolling out 300 of those centres across the country.  They will deal with a many issues relating to social isolation that exist in the context of people working remotely.  Blended working will be the approach that will be used.  We will see that the national broadband plan and the broadband connection points were very innovative at the time in terms of dealing with Covid-19 and the future post Covid-19.  It is imperative that Government leads from the front on this, leads by example and makes this flexibility available to public and civil servants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I concur with what Deputy Farrell said about the seagoing naval personnel credit.  This has been discussed and I just wanted to add my voice to what was said.<\/p> <p>  We are also dealing with Deputy Denis Naughten's amendment.  It appears that this is inserting a new section so that is the one to which I want to speak.<\/p><p>The amendment relates to remote working.  I want to get an understanding from the Minister on the contribution that would be given by an employer.  The Minister spoke of how it would be treated in respect of benefit-in-kind.  Take the setting up of a work station in someone's home, given that the work station is probably owned by the employer, how would those allowances be offset against taxable income in any year?  Is it like capital allowances, based on 12.5% or one-eighth per year?  Is there merit in looking at enhanced capital allowance for this purpose?  I would like to get a better understanding of how the business is able to offset some of that cost.  That is one of the big challenges.  I have spoken to people for whom working remotely was great for the first couple of weeks and then it was not so great because our homes are not equipped in a way that facilitates home working and some homes simply do not have the space and so on.  There are also bigger issues around access to broadband and so on.  <\/p><p> The other two issues I wish to raise are connected to issues around remote working.  One is the cross-Border worker relief.  This is something that has been thrown up as a result of the pandemic.  There has been a suspension of the rules during this period.  That was only Covid-related but we all know the trajectory, where there will be more people working from home.  There are many benefits around that including carbon emissions and climate change.  The issue is around an employee who, for example, lives in Donegal who works in a company in Derry.  If they carry out any substantial amount of work for their company, they lose their cross-Border worker relief, whereas in the North, a scenario where someone is living in Derry and works for a company in Letterkenny, they would have up to 60 days where they can work from home for the company without losing the full entitlement of the cross-Border working relief.  In the South, anything more than basic duties results in the loss of relief; there is no provision for even one or two days or anything up to 60 days.  Is the Minister open to considering how we would facilitate cross-Border, or what are referred to as frontier, workers in future?  There could be a limit in the number of days they can work from home without being double taxed, which is what happens if they are not given the relief.  <\/p><p>  My second point in not related to that but with to the issue of remote working.  Remote working has advantages and disadvantages, as has been touched on, including how our cities and town centres will look in future.  That throws up opportunities.  Some European cities have grabbed those opportunities which arise with low density traffic and how they can reshape their city centres.  Our cities were very much based on people commuting into them and working from them.  My question relates to companies where their staff no longer need to work in those offices and may not even live within the State, say in the case of big IT companies such as Google which might be located in Ireland but their staff are working in Barcelona, London or wherever.  Is the Department concerned about that type of trend?  Has it looked at this from a taxation perspective?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#ZZ00300","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I will deal with each of the questions in turn.  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell asked about the original section 10 and the change being made in the seagoing naval tax credit.  I am not suggesting for a moment that this is the Government's entire response to issues relating to the retention of naval personnel, particularly naval personnel who are at sea regularly.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, is working with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to see if measures can be applied to deal with retention in that part of our Defence Forces.  This measure is only a contribution to that work.  It is not suggested for a moment that it will be the entire policy response.<\/p> <p>  I agree with many of the points Deputy Nash made.  I believe the tax regime now in place by and large gets the balance right between being equitable and providing a degree of recognition of the costs involved in working from home.  If, for example, companies decide to facilitate more of their staff working from home on a more regular basis, I do not see why all the costs of that should be borne by the taxpayer.  There will be cost savings for companies through how they might use office space they are renting or may be renting in the future.  The State should not be the only source of incentive for encouraging or facilitating people to work from home.  Many employers are in a position to address the issue of cost and incentive themselves and the State should not be taking that role but might be able to make a contribution to it, even more so in the future.  That will be considered by the interdepartmental working group on remote working.  I believe that on balance the supports for working from home we have through our tax code are broadly okay.  Of course, we will need to reassess it in the context of what has happened in 2020.  We will do that through the interdepartmental group.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Naughten asked about hot-desking and encouraging more public servants to work outside their offices.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, made a statement on this a few days ago.  She spoke about planned investment to facilitate public servants in working in hot-desk centres outside their original location.  I think I have got the phrase \"hot hub\" wrong, but members know that we are talking about the remote working desks here.  I apologise for not being precise with my language there.  I am sure the work the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was doing will feed into the report on remote working.  I understand that work is nearly finished, and we are anticipating the completion of that work by the end of this year.  My officials have seen an advanced draft of that report.  Deputy Naughten and I have discussed this previously.  I think we will move to a hybrid model.  I do not believe where we are now will prevail into the future.<\/p><p>I do not believe we will be in an environment, health and vaccine permitting, where the vast majority of people will be working from home most of the time.  I do not believe that is a good equilibrium but we have also learned that, in addition to the previous way we had of working where almost all office work had to be done in the office, there are alternative ways.  If we take the way we are conducting this committee, if anybody had suggested a year ago that we would not all be physically present in the committee room for scrutiny of the Finance Bill, it would have seemed highly unlikely.  We are making it work, however, which is a sign of what is to come.  We are working towards a hybrid model which will, I believe, have many benefits.  I say again that I have a concern, particularly for younger workers beginning their career and particularly in larger companies.  They are never in the office at this time, which a matter of concern to me from a well-being and skill development point of view.  I hope that begins to change next year.<\/p><p> I touched on Deputy Canney's point in responding to Deputy Naughten.  As I said, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, made an announcement last week about identifying a few hubs where I expect public and civil servants, regardless of the Department they work for, will be able to come together in the same space and do their work.  Perhaps that is a sign of the hybrid model Deputy Naughten is talking about, one where people will at least have a degree of social contact.  If colleagues from the same Department are sitting in the same part of a building or floor, it will offer at least the social and personal contact element of being in work, if not the skill development component that is important.<\/p><p> Deputy Doherty agreed with Deputy Farrell on her point about section 10 and I touched on that in answer to Deputy Farrell.  I will address the different questions Deputy Doherty put to me.  He raised the issue of cross-Border work and the loss in tax recognition that could accrue to workers who would normally travel to Northern Ireland to do their work.  I am informed that the Revenue Commissioners have published a statement on their website on this in recent days and have indicated that, throughout the period of Covid, they want to put in place measures to ensure the workers the Deputy refers to are not worse off as a result of not being able to travel to their workplace.  I will get the details of that statement sent on to the Deputy.  <\/p><p> On the Deputy's question about benefit-in-kind, he is correct that if an employer pays for equipment that goes into someone's home, it is the employer who will make the claim for wear and tear to that equipment.  The responsibility rests with the employer.  On his question about large companies and workers not being present at the moment, a number of employers have reminded their workers about the obligations they have to be present in the jurisdiction in which they pay tax.  At the moment, it is more a matter of public health than of tax policy but I am eager that next year we see a phased return to offices if that is allowed for public health reasons.  I believe, particularly for large employers, that it would be advantageous for many reasons to have more of their staff present more of the time than is currently the case.  Employers have issued guidance to their staff reminding them of their duties to be present in the State in which they are meant to pay tax.  I have just been told that the guidance I refer to was issued in March.  If the Deputy believes it is deficient or not clear in any way, I am sure he will let me know and I will follow up any matters he wants me to raise with the Revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#BBB00100","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I want to move on.

The point made by Deputy Doherty about capital allowances is something we probably need to look at again.<\/p> <p>  I accept that the Minister is correct and there is a major benefit for employers.  Ultimately, we will get some type of a blended working situation, a bit like that outlined to us at the committee last week by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys.  We must also acknowledge, however, that there is a benefit to the State as well in terms of taking pressure off the street space and housing in Dublin, for example, but also in terms of carbon emissions.  If people are not travelling or commuting long distances to work, there is a direct impact on our emissions profile in transport and on air quality, especially particulate matter.  The State benefits as well in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is correct on the matter of people paying tax in the country where they are resident.

The point I was trying to make to the Minister relates to the capital allowances companies would be entitled to to provide work stations and support workers when it comes to remote working.  I heard the Minister's comments on the advantages for businesses and all the rest of it, and I am not suggesting that there should be a blanket provision for every company.  There are companies, however, that probably need additional support to assist their employees to operate remotely.  It is unfair on some workers if they do not have that type of support.<\/p> <p>  I was asking the Department to look at the concept of using an alternative to the wear and tear provision, which goes over eight years, where there would be some type of accelerated capital allowance for specific companies that would need it that would allow them to offset the full cost.  It does not even have to be the full cost.  When we look at accelerated capital allowances, we are looking at incentives in terms of energy efficiency and equipment that is energy efficient.  This could be a different model, covering 50% of the cost or whatever, but as opposed to the eight-year horizon under the wear and tear allowance.  It should be in the mix and it needs to be considered.  I am not suggesting, as I said, that this should be available to every company.  Many companies can absorb this cost themselves.  There is a benefit in not having people in offices given the high cost of commercial property and all of that.  I will leave that there and perhaps the Minister might respond to that point.<\/p> <p>  The second point is about the frontier or cross-Border workers.  The Revenue Commissioners have come out with guidelines and have waived the rules with regard to Covid-19.  I am asking that we look past the Covid-19 pandemic.  What we have here is an issue that it is just the way life and work are going.  While some companies want people in their offices, not everybody is going to be in their offices all the time.  Where we are going to land is probably in a type of hybrid model where there will be much more flexibility with work, where people will want to be able to get to the office but will also want to work at home.<\/p> <p>  For frontier or cross-Border workers, this simply does not exist.  They will be double-taxed because the cross-Border relief here is lost in its entirety if a person works one day from the South, whereas a northern worker working in the South can have 60 days.  Our proposal is quite restrictive.<\/p><p>I see many potentially unintended consequences if one went with a 60-day measure.  I am not arguing for that but instead hoping that the tax strategy group would look at this area, particularly in the context of Brexit, the Good Friday Agreement and how we need to support cross-Border workers.  It should also be examined in the context of the environment and carbon tax.  It could be a case where, for taxation purposes, a worker has to travel 40 or 50 miles every day when both the employer and employee wants one day a week at home but cannot do it because they would be double-taxed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#DDD00300","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Deputy Naughten understood the thrust of my response.  I am sure there will be an opportunity to discuss all of this again on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Doherty's point about accelerated capital allowances, we are examining that.  In the way he put his question, he recognised that it varies from company to company.  There are companies which might move to a hybrid model in which their staff are working from home for several days per week or certain types of work will be done from home more regularly.  There is a gain for those companies in which case the point about the need for accelerated capital allowances is null and void, as the Deputy said himself.<\/p> <p>  There would be other companies, however, whose staff would have to work from home but they might not have the scale that larger companies may have or may have overheads for which they need to pay the costs.  Accordingly, the equation for those companies is a bit different.<\/p> <p>  We will look at that for decisions we may need to make next year.  I hope by the time we get to next year, we will be a little clearer on what will be the equilibrium for working arrangements for the medium term.  We are not clear on that at the moment.<\/p> <p>  On the point the Deputy made about frontier workers, he acknowledged clarity has been brought to that issue during the period of Covid where those workers were not in a position to travel.  The Revenue Commissioners reminded me that those workers, during normal times, would not be double-taxed anyway because a relief is made in our jurisdiction to ensure they are not paying tax twice due to having to work in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I accept the Deputy's point that this issue has come up much during 2020.  Even since this clarification was issued by the Revenue Commissioners earlier on in the year, the issue has continued to develop.  It appears that even if we have ameliorated the issue for this year, there are policy issues which we will have to address for the next year and beyond.  I am happy to look at that through, for example, the tax strategy group process to tease out some of the issues on which we touched.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#EEE00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605484800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#EEE00500","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I move amendment No.  5:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 11, after line 34, to insert the following:  \t<b>&ldquo;Report on tapering out of income tax credits<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>11. <\/b>The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on tapering out income tax credits for incomes between &euro;100,000 and &euro;140,000 at a rate of 2.5 per cent for each &euro;1,000 earned.&rdquo;.   <\/blockquote> <p>The programme for Government has ruled out any income tax increases despite a sizeable deficit in the State's finances as a result of Covid-19, as well as the legacy of an expanded State.  In an interview last week in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, he raised the prospects of new sources of revenue in spite of the larger State without spelling out what those new sources would be.  Will the Minister square the circle for me?<\/p><p>The programme for Government rules out income tax increases while the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is examining new sources of revenue.<br\/><br\/>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are grouped and we are speaking to both of them at the same time.  The amendments propose progressive taxation measures, one of which was implemented by a Labour Government in Britain under Gordon Brown and has continued under the Tories in an aim to fund expanded services.  Amendment No. 5 proposes the tapering out of tax credits.  We know the importance of tax credits in our taxation system to offset or reduce tax liability.  The argument I am putting forward here, and have been putting forward for a number of years, is that when an individual reaches an income of &euro;100,000, he or she should then start to see his or her tax credits reducing or tapering out.  That is what happens in Britain, as I said, where for every &pound;2 that is earned, approximately &pound;1 is lost in tax credits.  We are arguing that a rate of 2.5% would apply for every &euro;1,000 earned above &euro;100,000.  Someone who earns &euro;100,000 gets the full benefit of tax credits, 2.5% of the credits is lost at earnings of &euro;101,000, and, at &euro;140,000, he or she would have no benefit of tax credits because they would all have tapered out at that stage.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 6 is connected but separate from amendment No. 5.  It proposes a solidarity levy or high income levy of 5% on incomes above &euro;140,000.  That is for the reason I earlier outlined, that is, that above &euro;100,000 of individual income, one should start to see one's tax credits reducing and tapering out until they are all lost at an income of &euro;140,000.  At that point, a solidarity levy of 5% applies to the portion of income above &euro;140,000.  Those are the types of progressive policies that the Government should consider but perhaps the Minister for Finance has other ideas and can enlighten the committee as to the other sources of revenue mentioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in his interview with <i>The<\/i><i>Irish Times<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#EEE00600","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I agree with my colleague on these amendments.

The income tax reform plan published by my Department in July 2016 examined this issue due to the fact that A Programme for a Partnership Government contained a commitment to consider the removal of the PAYE credit for high earners as part of a medium-term income tax reform plan.  It pointed out that a number of technical and policy issues would need to be addressed to achieve a tapered withdrawal of income tax credits, particularly for PAYE employees.  The issue was also discussed in my Department's tax strategy group papers on income tax for budgets 2017 to 2020, inclusive.<\/p> <p>  The significant issue arising with this amendment is that it would have a negative impact on the marginal rate of tax.  The tapering out of a tax credit would result in a higher marginal tax rate within the taper zone than would apply at higher income levels.<\/p><p>For example, if the personal tax credit of &euro;1,650 was tapered out at a rate of 5% per &euro;1,000, it would result in a loss of just over 8 cent per additional &euro;1 of income, and the marginal rate within the taper zone would be just over 60%.  Once the taper period has expired, at income over &euro;140,000 in this example, the marginal rate would then drop and would revert back to 52%.<\/p><p> Another issue that has been pointed out in previous research is that tax credits and rate bands operate on a cumulative basis, as Revenue issues a revenue payroll notification to the individual's employer, who then uses the information contained in the notification to calculate the tax to be deducted each time a payment is made.  If it is known from the beginning of the year that an employee's income will exceed the chosen threshold, then the application of the taper of the credits could be applied from the outset, thereby spreading the tax burden equally over the year.  However, where it appears during the course of the year that the employee's income may exceed the chosen threshold, Revenue will need to update the revenue payroll notification to withdraw the relevant credits and this will result in the collection of arrears from the next payment of salary by the employer, resulting in an uneven distribution of their liabilities over the year and an uneven distribution of the yield for the Exchequer.<\/p><p> I am aware that the UK tax system incorporates a personal tax allowance, which is subject to a tapered withdrawal for individuals whose income is in excess of &pound;100,000 per annum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#FFF00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605484800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but it is time to suspend the meeting until 4.20 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020111600002#GGG00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605484800,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.42 p.m. and resumed at 4.20 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605484800,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
