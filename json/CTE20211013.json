Members and all those in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and those attending the committee room will note that every second seat has been removed from use in order to facilitate social distancing.  I urge those attending not to move any chair from its position and they should also maintain an appropriate level of social distance before and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for everyone's full co-operation on this.  Any member participating in the meeting remotely is required to participate from within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Senator Paul Gavan.<\/p> <p>  Today we will give pre-legislative scrutiny to the general scheme of the consumer rights Bill 2021, which aims to give effect to two EU directives on the sale of goods and the supply of digital content and services.  It would give effect to part of a third EU directive and update and consolidate existing legislation on consumer rights and remedies.  It would strengthen the enforcement powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.<\/p> <p>  The consolidation of legislation provided for aims to give a legislative framework that is more up to date and serves consumers and businesses better.  To explain the provisions of the general scheme and explain the proposed Bill in detail I welcome from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment our witnesses, who are participating remotely.  They are Ms Clare McNamara, Ms Emily de Grae, Ms Marie Dempsey and Ms Emma Hanrahan.  Before beginning I will notify the witnesses about parliamentary privilege and explain some limitations to that privilege in the practice of the Houses in regard to references that might be made to other persons in evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  The opening statement from the Department has been circulated to members and in commencing our consideration of the matter, I invite Ms McNamara to make opening remarks on behalf of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#A00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the committee for the opportunity to discuss the scheme of the Bill.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Emily de Grae, Ms Marie Dempsey and Ms Emma Hanrahan.  We very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to the committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the scheme and to assist it in any way we can.  I intend to outline the context for introducing the scheme and then set out its main provisions, after which we look forward to hearing the members' views and answering questions.<\/p> <p>  This scheme gives effect to two EU directives on contracts for the sale of goods and contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services.  In order to implement parts of a third EU directive, namely the better enforcement and modernisation directive of 2019, the scheme also proposes to revoke and replace the 1995 Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations and the European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013.  It also updates and consolidates the existing legislation on consumer rights and remedies.  Finally, it also makes amendments to the Consumer Protection Act 2007, an element of which will be to strengthen the enforcement powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.<\/p> <p>  A comprehensive, consolidated consumer rights Act along the lines proposed in the scheme provides a legislative framework that is more appropriate to present day conditions and requirements and is simpler to understand, creates clearer rules for businesses and strengthens consumers' rights.  The scheme of the Bill now under scrutiny by the committee was approved for drafting by the Government on 20 April 2021.<\/p> <p>  As my speaking time is limited to eight minutes, it is my intention to summarise the main provisions of the scheme.  The scheme contains ten parts in all.  With limited exceptions, Parts 2, 3, 5 and 6 transpose maximum harmonisation directives, which give member states little discretion on implementation.<\/p> <p>  Part 1 deals with matters common to legislation, namely citation and commencement, interpretation, application, regulations, repeals and amendments.  It also contains generally applying provisions, including those related to the making of contracts, preventing traders from attempting to restrict the statutory rights of a consumer and the jurisdiction of court to order remedies.<\/p> <p>  Part 2 focuses on the rights of consumers under sales contracts and on the remedies available to consumers where goods do not conform to those rights.  It gives effect to the sale of goods directive of 2019 and it incorporates the provisions applying to consumer sales contracts in the Sale of Goods Act 1893.  It also gives effect to Article 18, delivery of goods, and Article 20, passing of risk in goods, of the consumer rights directive of 2011, as well as the delivery provisions at sections 30 and 31 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893.  Part 2 also deals with consumer guarantees.<\/p> <p>  Part 3 gives effect to the digital content directive of 2019 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services.  Its provisions set out the rights that apply under such contracts and the remedies that apply where digital content or digital services infringe upon those rights.  As digital content and digital services are relatively new, consumer contracts for their supply have not previously been the subject of specific statutory regulation.<\/p> <p>  Part 4 will replace Part IV of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 for services contracts between a consumer and a trader.  It deals with contracts for the supply of a non-digital service.  It expands the rights of consumers in respect of such contracts and establishes a scheme of statutory remedies that will apply where a service does not conform to these rights.<\/p><p>Part 5 re-enacts, with substantial amendments, the provisions on consumer information and cancellation rights in the consumer rights directive 2011, as given effect by SI 484\/2013.  The Part also implements the significant amendments to the consumer rights directive made by the better enforcement and modernisation directive of 2019.  As Part 5 deals with key aspects of consumer contract rights, its incorporation in the scheme is in the interests of regulatory clarity and accessibility.  Its incorporation in primary legislation also permits the application of some provisions to contracts previously excluded from the scope of the secondary legislation.<\/p><p> Part 6 repeats consumer rights contained in the consumer rights directive of 2011 and given effect in SI 484\/2013 relating to payment fees, additional payments, charges for calls to customer helplines and inertia selling, that is, the sending of unsolicited goods to potential customers in the hope of making a sale.<\/p><p> Part 7 makes several important changes to the provisions of the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995, which transposed EU Directive No. 93\/13\/EEC.  As the directive is a minimum harmonisation instrument, member states are free to extend its provisions to excluded terms and to add to the protections it provides.  The changes made to the regulations include extending the scope of the unfair terms provisions to include contract terms that have been negotiated between the consumer and trader, strengthening the transparency requirements that apply to contract terms, narrowing somewhat the exemption from assessment for unfairness of core contract terms and expanding a grey list of consumer contract terms presumed to be unfair and introducing a blacklist of terms that are automatically unfair.  The Part also gives effect to the new penalties provisions inserted in the directive by the better enforcement and modernisation directive of 2019.<\/p><p> Part 8 sets out the enforcement powers and penalties under the scheme.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, will have enforcement responsibilities for consumer contracts under all Parts of the Act.  The Central Bank will continue to have an enforcement function under Part 7 in respect of unfair contract terms in consumer contracts with regulated financial services providers.  ComReg will continue to have an enforcement function under Parts 5 to 7, inclusive, in respect of consumer contracts for electronic communication services.<\/p><p> Part 9 contains various amendments to the Consumer Protection Act 2007 required in order to transpose amendments to the unfair commercial practices directive made in the better enforcement and modernisation directive of 2019.  These amendments will extend and enhance the enforcement measures available to the CCPC.<\/p><p> Part 10 provides for several amendments to other consumer protection enactments.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding that the scheme is focused on consumer rights, it should not be seen as a measure that will harm businesses.  Indeed, it will give a legislative framework to the terms and practices that responsible businesses already adopt in their dealings with customers and will ensure that those businesses that do not do so will face effective enforcement action.<\/p><p> I am happy to discuss the provisions of the scheme in more detail and to respond to questions from members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McNamara","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McNamara.

The fact that there was no specific legislation to cover digital goods and services did not mean they were not covered under sale of goods and services legislation anyway.  However, it was important to modernise legislation to try to meet the peculiarities of digital content and digital services.  For example, one of the things we are trying to cover here is that people can sign up to a digital service and, instead of paying for that service in monetary, they supply personal data, almost as a payment.  As such, it is important to try to ensure that a consumer's rights are protected where is no monetary payment being made but the payment is in the form of data.  That was not necessarily covered in the existing legislation.  That is not to say that consumers did not have rights under existing legislation, but it was important to try to future-proof those rights in the context of the digital world we are in.  Digital content includes computer games and the famous digital platforms that offer streaming film and television services.  It was about making sure that consumers are protected regardless of whether a physical payment is made or consumers are just giving access to their data by way of payment.  I hope that answers the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McNamara"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McNamara for the response.

We have been factoring in the responses to it in the drafting.  As members are aware, the Bill was approved for drafting in April, so the drafting has been continuing apace since then.  We have been taking into consideration several of the responses that were received.  Respondents to the public consultation included the likes of the CCPC, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, the Consumer Association of Ireland, IBEC, ComReg, the Alternative Operators in the Communications Market group, the Bar Council, the Law Society and the Irish Dental Association.<\/p> <p>  The responses to the consultation were generally very supportive.  Concerns were raised regarding Part 4, particularly in respect of the supply of professional services.  For instance, the Bar Council of Ireland suggested that in the event that barristers are permitted to provide services directly to consumers, those services should be exempted from the application of Part 4 of the scheme, relating to contracts for the supply of services.  Although the matter is somewhat academic at present, we do not see any compelling reason, in principle, for the exclusion of legal services provided by barristers from the scope of Part 4 in terms of the protection of consumer rights.  The Irish Dental Association argued, for example, that the provisions of Part 4 and the fitness of a service for a particular purpose or result are inappropriate in the context of dental services.  As these provisions only apply to a purpose or a result accepted by a service provider, we think it is proportionate to offer adequate safeguards to the providers of dental or other services.<\/p> <p>  We are engaging with other Departments with responsibility for redress schemes, for example, in areas such as property or legal services.  We are engaging with bodies such as the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, the Residential Tenancies Board and the like with a view to making sure that, without impinging on consumer rights, we avoid regulatory overlap.  We do not want any overlap or confusion.  We are grateful to all the respondents to the consultation.  We might not necessarily agree on some of the points of concern raised, but all of the observations have been analysed and they will inform the onward drafting of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McNamara"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Overall, Ms McNamara would say the feedback from the consultation was very positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#B00700","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Yes, it was.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McNamara"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I will leave it at that for the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#C00100","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The next member who has indicated to speak is Deputy Louise O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#C00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McNamara and her team for the comprehensive presentation.

As it is budget week, we are all a bit stretched, no more than the witnesses are.  Head 10 states that provisions of the Act will provide for, among others, a reduction in the price of digital content, digital services, goods or services.

It increases consumers' rights in the area of remedies to which they are entitled.  Their existing rights in terms of goods will still apply.  There has been an imbalance in consumer rights legislation in the past, between goods and services, and we are trying to rebalance that in this Bill.  We are increasing consumer rights and remedies whereby they will have automatic rights and remedies laid out in the legislation in instances when goods or services are not in conformity.  As the drafting of the Bill proceeds, we will consider timelines that will be afforded to traders, particularly in regard to digital services, to bring them into conformity.  When a person's broadband is not working, how much time should the trader be afforded to correct that before the person can seek a reduction in price of what has already been paid, or be allowed to cancel the contract and seek a remedy from the trader?  That will be built into the legislation.  We are also giving the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, more powers to pursue traders if they do not meet their obligations in regard to the remedies.  I hope that covers the question asked by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McNamara"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Yes, it does.

My question might be outside the scope of what Ms McNamara can say, which is fair enough, but if not, I would appreciate an answer.  In regard to available resources, does Ms McNamara believe the necessary resources exist now or should the committee or the Oireachtas consider increasing the resources?

If there is a clause in a contract that excludes or limits the liability of the trader for death or personal injury arising from an act or omission of the trader or requires the consumer to pay for goods or digital content that have not been supplied, these would be examples of blacklist terms that should never appear in a contract.<\/p> <p>  The grey list contains terms that might be presumed unfair and that will form part of a schedule to the Act.  They could be considered questionable if they appeared in a contract.  An example of this would be a term in a contract that has the object or the effect of making an agreement binding on a consumer whereby the provision of services by the trader is subject to a condition where realisation depends on the trader&rsquo;s will alone.  This would put more obligation on the consumer than the trader providing the service.  Another example would be a term that has the object or effect of requiring a consumer, who decides not to conclude or perform the contract, to pay the trader a disproportionately high sum of money in compensation for services that have not been supplied.  That would be considered or presumed an unfair term.

We are looking at that but in reality, we do not want to reduce consumers' rights either when it comes to high-value items.

First, this legislation is going to create new rights for consumers, and, in particular, around remedies.  For example, the specific remedies that are now available to consumers that were not in place before will be around the whole area of digital content and services and where a service that does not comply with the requirements of the Act, the consumer will have the right to the digital content and service free of charge while the service is brought into compliance and within a reasonable time and without any significant inconvenience to the consumer.<\/p> <p>  If that right is not complied with, the consumer can go to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.  This commission has a number of powers.  It has the power, first of all, to accept a written undertaking from a trader to rectify the failure or the refusal to comply.  It can issue a compliance notice to the trader, setting out the actions to be taken and it can apply to the Circuit Court or the High Court for a declaration or an injunction regarding the failure or refusal.  Bear in mind that there are fines also for non-compliance under the Fines Act.  <\/p> <p>  Further to enforcement, we are bringing rights that consumers have not had before by way of remedies that are available to them and we are giving the CCPC the power to pursue those rights and remedies.<\/p> <p>  I did not quite understand the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the labelling of products and I am not sure if my colleague did.  I might ask the Deputy to repeat that question please.<\/p> <p>  On consent, we have all been there where there are hundreds of pages to read through, particularly in the case of signing up to social media, for example, and one is agreeing to rather than reading the hundreds of pages.  We would always say to consumers that they should be reading what they are signing up to.  As to whether we are dealing with any of this, specifically, I will ask my colleague, Ms Hanrahan, to answer that particular question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McNamara"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Good morning members.  Under the digital content directive, there is this new idea because previously data, or the provision of personal data to a trader, did not amount to consideration under contract law.  The digital content directive has introduced this because many digital services - and we know this happens with some of the larger platforms - provide this service that appears to be free but they are doing this in exchange for personal data.  Essentially, this would mean that consumers will now have a contract with these service providers and, going forward under the Act, they will have remedies should there be a problem with the contract.  Obviously, the provision of personal data, if it is just in order to provide the service to the consumer or if it is to comply with legislative requirements, is an exception under the Data Protection Act, which means that this essentially would not amount to consideration.  If the data, however, is processed beyond that by a trader - for instance, if they use a person&rsquo;s data to target that person for another product - that would be considered good consideration and a contract would have been formed once the scheme is enacted.<\/p> <p>  In this regard, an issue arose around personal data and we consulted with the Data Protection Commissioner about the right to withdraw data etc., and it is set in stone that the consumer can withdraw the right to access their data.  As to how that would work effectively, we said it would be governed by data protection law and we do not intend to wade into that side of things because we do not have the expertise required.  The best thing to do there is to refer to existing data protection law which governs what would happen in those instances.

These discussions are on illegal online content and the Department of Justice would be involved in an interdepartmental group that is looking into that legislation.  Other legislation in that area is within the remit of the Department of Justice.  The digital unit of our Department, which is not my unit, is engaged in this.  On the further enforcement of sanctions, it is important to point out that this Bill is transposing three EU directives, two in full and most of the third one.  These were negotiated over a four-year period in Brussels.  We, that is Ireland, were very involved in those negotiations as to the enforcement, the sanctions, the rights and remedies of consumers.  <\/p> <p>  It is also important to point out that this Bill has been a long time coming but the Sales Law Review Group, for example, produced a report back in 2011 that talked about Irish consumer legislation being somewhat disjointed and difficult for consumers to navigate and understand.  As well as transposing the three EU directives here that very strongly increase consumer rights, we are consolidating existing legislation to make it easier for consumers to access, understand and have everything in one place so that it can be easily found.  We are also increasing the enforcement powers, while we are doing this.  <\/p> <p>  EU legislation can be transposed by secondary legislation in accordance with the 1972 European Communities Act or it can be transposed by primary legislation.<\/p><p>If one transposes it by secondary legislation, one has to stick to the scope of the directive rigidly and cannot go outside it.  There are some pieces of EU legislation whose scope we could not go outside because we transposed them by secondary legislation.  Since we are using primary legislation in this context, though, we can increase the rights because we can go outside the scope of the directives in a way that we were not able to in the past.<\/p><p> The Department has been considering this matter since the sales law review group's report in 2011.  We did not produce legislation to consolidate the area because we were waiting to see the outcome of the three EU directives, which ended up taking longer to negotiate than we could have anticipated.<\/p><p> I hope I have answered most of the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McNamara","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>That has been helpful.

Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.

I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to the constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any members participating via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making a contribution to the meeting, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If members are attending in the committee room, they are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and leave at least one seat vacant between themselves and others attending the meeting.  Attendees should also maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.<\/p> <p>  I am sorry about that.  Our time is nearly up at this stage, although we might have a few minutes left.

This speech is an annual exercise by the European Commission to lay out its stall for the next year.  It tends to be quite forward-looking and basically sets the agenda for legislation and other activities, setting the priorities for the Commission for the next year.  It was the president's second State of the Union speech and was entitled, \"Strengthening the Soul of our Union\".<\/p> <p>  She looked back a little on the Covid-19 experience.  It is difficult not to look at that because it has been such a cathartic experience for Europe and the world.  She also looked ahead and set priorities and new initiatives for the year ahead.  On the pandemic, she acknowledged the speed and magnitude of events which, initially, had been very difficult to grasp.  Europe's initial response with the vaccine roll-out was slower than expected due to production bottlenecks.  All members have seen the various toings and froings in that regard.  Nonetheless, Europe very much caught up and, indeed, was one of the best performers in the world in the roll-out of the vaccine.  Every part of Europe got the same access to lifesaving vaccines.  Big and small member states were treated the same.  If we remember the scramble for vaccines, this was not necessarily guaranteed at the outset.  If there had been a free-for-all and everybody had tried to do their own thing, it was not necessarily guaranteed.  Europe coming together ensured that, regardless of the size of the member state, equal access to the vaccines, equal distribution and so forth were very beneficial to all.  There is no room for complacency.  The pain of Covid is very much still felt, but we have reasons for confidence in the future.  Europe achieved its objective by the summer of vaccinating over 70% of adults, with Ireland, of course, in the vanguard, which is very impressive.<\/p> <p>  The EU digital certificate, which was developed and implemented in a period of three and half months, has also helped to get lives back to normal and get free movement flowing again, which is one of the fundamental benefits of EU membership.  The president underlined the need to strengthen our pandemic preparedness and announced plans for a new health authority, called HERA, who I think was a Greek goddess.  Members of the committee who know the Classics might be able to tell me more.  It is planned to get this new health authority up and running.  This new authority will address serious cross-border health threats, monitor medical countermeasures and reinforce global health emergency preparedness in case a similar situation ever arises again.<\/p> <p>  Looking beyond its borders, Europe has shared half of its vaccine production, more than 700 million doses, with the rest of the world from the outset.  Other countries kept their production for themselves, but from the outset Europe shared the production of the vaccines in the European Union.  It has also been a key supporter of COVAX, which is the global facility to procure vaccines for low and middle income countries.<\/p><p>There is still a lot to do, and global vaccination remains a big priority.  The president announced a new vaccine donation of 200 million doses by the middle of 2022 on top of the donation of 250 million doses being given this year.  She underscored the need to boost vaccine production capacity in Africa.  There are measures to set up facilities in Africa so it can produce its own vaccines.<\/p><p> On the economic and social protection front, there has been a lot of hardship over the past year.  Nevertheless, when the pandemic struck, the EU's response was quick and effective.  It is fair to say lessons have been learned from the way in which the economy was handled during the financial crisis, and I know that will be welcomed in Ireland.  The EU supported more than 31 million workers and 2.5 million companies across Europe through its SURE programme, which stands for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency.  Ireland is drawing down &euro;2.5 billion in loans under the SURE facility.  A robust rebound of the EU economy is under way, and Ireland's recent excellent growth forecasts are clearly good news in that regard.  The continued easing of virus containment measures has helped propel a higher-than-expected GDP growth.  A significant element of Europe's response has been its NextGenerationEU programme and the positive impulse provided by the recovery and resilience facility.  In an unprecedented step, the EU is borrowing from the financial markets to help lay the basis for short-term recovery and longer term growth.  Ireland's own recovery and resilience programme, which was at the heart of the visit by President von der Leyen to Ireland in July and her meeting with the Taoiseach, has a significant role to play in that regard.  There is roughly &euro;1 billion for Ireland in that facility.  Another focus of the address was digital Europe, with the president describing it as \"the make-or-break issue\".  There are now plans to develop a European chips Act which would aim to link together Europe's world-class research, design and testing capacities and to tie that in with the production of semiconductors, which, as all members will be aware, are in great shortage at the moment and are holding up a lot of production.  Looking back, we could compare this forward-looking attempt on the chips Act with the time when the Galileo satellite system was being developed a couple of decades ago.  There was a lot of scepticism and even derision as to why the EU was putting money into that, but, looking back at it today, it now provides the navigation system for more than 2 billion smartphones.  We want to try to get ahead of the curve with the semiconductors operation.  Supporting young people, particularly those who have fallen through the gaps and are not in employment, education or training, was another big theme.  Europe needs to do more.  The Commission will shortly propose to make 2022 the European year of youth and will put in place a new programme called Aim, Learn, Master, Achieve, ALMA, to help young Europeans find work experience abroad.  We are therefore not just focusing on Erasmus or higher education students; we also want to help young people in difficulty to have experience of working abroad.<\/p><p> There have been many activities in respect of the green deal over the course of the past year.  The EU has high ambitions on climate change and environmental protection, including the target of at least 55% emissions reduction by 2030.  The Fit for 55 package which, unfortunately, sounds like some kind of exercise programme but is not meant to sound like that, published in July contains a very broad and ambitious set of interconnected measures to achieve this.  We want to get that package adopted and implemented.  That is a key objective of the coming months and year.  The president underlined that the green transition must be socially just and fair, and the proposed new social climate fund is intended to tackle energy poverty and provide support to vulnerable households.  For the moment the amount earmarked for that is &euro;73 billion.  With climate change and environmental protection being issues that require a global response, the president announced a doubling of external funding for biodiversity, in particular for vulnerable economies.  She also set out plans to propose an additional &euro;4 billion for climate finance until 2027 and called for the US and other partners to work closely with Europe on this issue.<\/p><p> Turning to the global dimension, the president was clear on the EU's commitment to the Afghan people and the need to do everything to avert the risk of famine and humanitarian disaster.  Yesterday the committee may have seen that the Commission announced a &euro;1 billion support package for Afghanistan in order to avert such a humanitarian crisis.  We are already hearing stories of malnutrition and even starvation come out of Afghanistan, where there appears to be a total breakdown in the functioning of the state.  Defence was another theme of the address and one that drew some attention here in Ireland.  The president reflected on the painful events in Afghanistan and the need to reflect on how the Afghan mission could have ended so abruptly.  Co-operation with NATO is vital, and the EU is investing great efforts in this direction and working on a new EU-NATO Joint Declaration.  The president said Europe can and clearly should be able to do more.  For example, we need to provide stability in our neighbourhood.  We need to be able to tackle the evolving nature of threats - for example, cyberattacks.  To quote the president, \"You no longer need armies and missiles to cause mass damage.\".  All you need is a laptop to paralyse administrations.  We have seen this happen to some extent in Ireland with the cyberattack on hospitals earlier this year.  <\/p><p> Cybersecurity is a big part of defence.  The president set out the ambition not just to be satisfied to address the cyber threat, but also for Europe to become a leader in cybersecurity.  She called for a European cyberdefence policy which would help ensure that Europe has the capacity to develop cyberdefence tools.  She also called for legislation on common standards under a new European cyber-resilience Act.  A European defence union does not mean a European army.  It is a matter of the need to develop effective measures to respond to crisis.  It is a matter of the ability to have a common assessment of threat to gather information and anticipate attacks.  It is a matter of strengthening our resilience, overcoming capability gaps in the EU and working effectively with partners.  This will be taken forward under the next Presidency of the Council of the European Union, which is the French Presidency starting in January of next year.<\/p><p> Finally, rule of law, democracy and common values are a subject very much in the news at the moment.  On the rule of law, on which this committee has engaged productively with Commissioner Reynders, the president pointed to worrying developments in certain member states, saying that dialogue always comes first but that dialogue is not an end in itself.  There is a need for a dual approach of dialogue and decisive action.  As part of a strengthening of the Commission's rule of law reports, including for Ireland, from 2022 those reports will come with specific recommendations to member states, a bit like the European semester in the past.  In the field of fundamental rights, the Commission will also propose by the end of this year a new law to combat violence against women.  The president noted that the pandemic has been particularly terrifying for those with nowhere to hide, and action is needed from prevention to protection and effective prosecution.<\/p><p>Finally, as a means to protect those who create transparency and defend democracy, the president undertook to deliver a media freedom Act in the next year.  This is in response to some rather alarming developments in relation to journalists, even the murder of journalists, in the EU, and the need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of the press.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Ms Nolan.

Thank you for the opportunity.  I thank our guests for joining us in person today, which is a novelty that we will get used to in due course as we, hopefully, all get back to normal.<\/p> <p>  It is great to hear the summary of what was a very ambitious state of the Union address.  There is a couple of areas I will pick on and perhaps ask a few questions, based on the President of the European Commission, Dr. von der Leyen's comments and, indeed, some comments she did not make.  It was an address talking about looking forward but I want to look back initially.<\/p> <p>  Ms Nolan mentioned the pandemic response and some of the supply chain and delivery issues of vaccines at the outset.  I must state frankly that the citizens of the European Union were grossly let down by certain drugs manufacturers.  I wonder if Mr. Nolan can provide an update on what actions are ongoing or will be taken by the European Commission against those companies that let the people of Europe so badly down when they needed them most and caused quite a lot of concern and heartache, particularly in this country.  I am not an expert on the classics but the new health body is certainly an area where there is huge potential.  In our engagement in relation to the future of Europe and our discussions, particularly with the Irish MEPs, this was an area that consistently came up.  There is huge scope for the European Union as a collective to do so much more providing that connectivity.<\/p> <p>  In relation to new plans for security and defence co-operation, this is something that we in Ireland need to wake up to.  We are not immune to the threats that the European Union faces on a daily basis and we have felt them, as Ms Nolan so rightly said, in the growing threat of cyberattacks, which are merely a fact of life these days.  We need to be realistic, domestically, in terms of our investment in security and defence and on a European scale, on what our responsibilities to our European Union membership are.  That does not mean a European Union army.  It does not mean abandoning neutrality.  However, we need to be much more realistic about what is required.  It is nominally such a small part of the European budget but it is one that has so much impact.  I would dread to think that one day in the future we would say that maybe we should have engaged a little more with our neighbourhood partners or committed a little more.<\/p> <p>  In relation to one of Ms Nolan's last points on the future of the rule of law, specifically, to the current situation in Poland, personally, I was cheered by the scenes in Warsaw on Sunday night to see tens of thousands of people taking to the street in defence of common European values.  Ms Nolan might provide an update on what actions the European Commission is taking in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Two areas were not covered in the President of the European Commission's state of the Union address but I will take a liberty and raise them.  The first is in relation to eurobonds and the future of eurobonds.  One of the great achievements we should take from the pandemic is the ability of the European Union finally to come together and deliver on this mechanism that will benefit every citizen of this Union.  In the post-pandemic era, it is one of the great learnings.  How do we retain that ability and how do we use it to the best of every citizen, particularly in the more deprived and socioeconomically challenged areas?<\/p> <p>  Lastly, I refer to the current situation - it has been ever thus for the past five or six years - of the European Union's relationship with our nearest neighbour and former member, the United Kingdom.  I appreciate your indulgence on this, a Chathaoirligh.  Lord Frost's speech yesterday in Lisbon was extremely disappointing.  I look forward to Commission Vice-President, Mr. &Scaron;efovi's announcements this evening.  No doubt they will be generous and reactive to what the people of Northern Ireland want.  I would be interested to get the European Commission's take on what are the next steps.  Are we dealing with a trustworthy partner any more, and if we are not, how do we react going forward?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#E00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>There were some very painful experiences in the course of accessing the supply of vaccines.  We were let down by one particular producer.  I would say it did not deliver as was agreed and this caused problems.  Fortunately, there were alternatives.  Indeed, the EU had spread its orders and had ordered supplies from several companies.  At least, that was able in time to make up the shortfalls that we experienced.  There are lessons that have been very much learned by the Commission in the management of that.  We will have to make sure that we have a spread of suppliers in the future and that we are not overdependent on any one particular company.  In a way, all is well that ends well to some extent.  Look where we are now.  Who would have believed it?  This time last year we did not even have a vaccine.  All in all, it was a good experience in the end but I agree with the Deputy that over-reliance on any one supplier clearly is not the way to go.  Indeed, the creation of this new Health Emergency preparedness and Response Authority, HERA, will help us have a better overview in the future and to be ready for something like this, which was a black swan moment in a way which nobody was expecting.<\/p> <p>  On security and defence co-operation, I am glad the Deputy said it is not an EU army.  It is not.  A lesson has been learned from the Afghanistan debacle where, for example, we were reliant on the United States to evacuate our citizens and we did not have the capacity to get people, or even refugees, out.  This is not new as in a way, this reflection has been going on.  Also, there was reflection about there being a lot of defence expenditure in the member states which is not necessarily linked up, using economies of scale, or being smart about what they purchase or pooling resources.  There are many issues in relation to better co-operation on defence.  This is the reflection that is going on at present.  It will look at probably issues such as crisis management, our resilience as the EU, capability development and better development of partnerships between the member states and between the EU and other parts of the world.  This is on the drawing board.  When we think of issues such as cybersecurity, that is also a question of defence.  We must further develop our cybersecurity protection against these attacks that are now happening on a daily basis across the world.  These are the kind of issues that we will look at.  As I said, this debate on a defence union will be kicked off under the French Presidency.<\/p> <p>  On eurobonds, I take note of the Deputy's comments but I do not have anything substantial to add to that today.<\/p> <p>  Let us get to the protocol.  Obviously, today is a big day for the Commission.  The Commission will unveil a package.  I was listening to RT&Eacute; radio this morning and I heard a very good summary of what is coming down the tracks from RT&Eacute;'s Brussels correspondent, who is very well informed.  The Commission Vice-President, Mr. &Scaron;efovi, came to Ireland and Northern Ireland a month ago.  He spent two days engaging with stakeholders, citizens and people on the ground from different walks of life - human rights, business, NGOs, those who benefited from PEACE funding etc.  He has taken careful note of the real problems on the ground that people are being confronted with as a result of the protocol.  The Commission is trying to find practical solutions to practical problems.  What will be announced later today will be a very far-reaching response to what the Commission Vice-President has heard and to the British command paper and will further build on a package that was already put on the table by the Commission on 30 June last, which passed without particular engagement but is there and we will build on.<\/p><p>It is intended to stretch our response to the absolute limits and try to address the problems on the ground.  We do not want to escalate the rhetoric or engage in political brinkmanship.  We want to find practical solutions to practical problems and ease any particular issues about goods moving from the UK to Northern Ireland.  That is the purpose of the four papers coming out today.  The idea is our officials will immediately travel to London and start to engage on this.  That is where we are at and we are trying to keep the noise from the sidelines out for the moment and focus on coming up with practical solutions to practical problems.<\/p><p> On the rule of law, the Commission is carefully studying the ruling from the Polish courts.  It is a serious challenge to the EU structure and the primacy of EU law.  This is what the EU is built on and there cannot be a situation in which national courts start to overrule EU law.  The arbiter of EU law is the European Court of Justice and that is a fundamental point.  We have a number of tools which we have been using over the past years for breaches of rule of law and fundamental rights.  We have the infringement procedure, the rule of law mechanism and Article 7.  We have a rule of law toolbox and we also have the recommendations that will be in the annual rule of law report.<\/p><p> We will not rashly respond at this stage.  We have seen Polish citizens coming out on the streets very much demonstrating their support for the European Union and their belief in it.  This is heartening for us all.  We want to see how we can engage with and deal with this, but I do not have much more to bring to the table on this issue because we are studying this ruling from the Polish courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>The committee is taking a keen interest in that ongoing issue.

I am not as brave as Deputy Richmond to go down to the committee room yet.  I acknowledge the work of Vice-President &Scaron;efovi, the proposals he will put on the table today and the commitment he has given.  He has engaged with this committee and is willing to engage with us again.  I also acknowledge the work of Ms Nolan and her team.  They do not get thanked enough, especially in the past number of years, when it has been pretty clear they have been fighting and elbowing our interests.  We should acknowledge that and I thank her and her team for doing so.<\/p> <p>  I note Ms Nolan's phrase that the Commission will stretch its response to the limit.  I suggest that all of us will have our patience stretched to the limit in the coming days.  I agree with Miss Nolan on not commenting much.  What timeline does she anticipate for this issue as it begins to come to a head?<\/p> <p>  Miss Nolan mentioned what the EU is built on.  It strikes me that many of the principles on which the EU is built are being undermined, not just by member states but by geopolitical trends, inadequate response to crises and a shift away from the values on which the Union was built, namely, solidarity and a commitment to peace and individual and human rights.<\/p> <p>  Ms Nolan mentioned there is a toolbox available but it needs to be used rationally.  This drift has been under way for some time.  We all looked askance at the US in 2016 but when it was happening here, not just in Poland but in other member states such as Hungary, we were shrugging our shoulders and the Commission was slow to respond, especially in the case of Hungary.  That may have emboldened those in Poland and other countries to go the road they are going.  I am absolutely with Ms Nolan in her view that the Commission wants to respond rationally but at some stage we have to open the toolbox and use the tools, rather than having it gather dust.  If we continue to soft-soap the response to this, it will worsen.  Yes, there were millions of Poles on the streets at the weekend, but that was people-led.  That was led by communities and people throughout Poland, not by politics.  The Commission needs to be far stronger in defending the principles of the European Union and not allowing member states to go as far as some are going.  <\/p> <p>  The ambition for the European Green Deal is very high.  We have to collectively support it get behind it, but what about those communities feeling left behind, especially fishing and agriculture?  Our fishing community would not recognise the current European Green Deal and what is being done to them as socially just or fair.  How do we ensure those communities get buy-in to the programmes and resources Ms Nolan indicated are being made available?  There is a sense of a disconnect between these communities and the negotiation as to how those resources are delivered to and within member states.  There is a sense that the interests of these communities are not being reflected.  The Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries visited some of the communities a number of weeks ago, but there is a serious disconnect, especially in our fishing communities and very much growing in our agricultural communities, from many of the aspirations of the European Green Deal.  I will leave that with Ms Nolan and thank her for her time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#F00300","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":104,"content":"<p>The Deputy referred to an inadequate response.  The Commission has been doing its best.  It has taken infringements wherever there have been breaches of rule of law or fundamental rights, against Poland and Hungary, and any other member state in that situation.  The Commission has not yet lost a single case.  All of those cases are very sensitive and delicate and take a long time to prepare, but they are extremely important because we are defending important principles.  There have also been Article 7 proceedings, as the Deputy probably knows, but Article 7 requires unanimity of the member states and we do not have that when it comes to these situations.  There have been several processes and attempts to rein in the excesses but, so far, it has been more piecemeal than we would have liked, but we are using everything we can.<\/p> <p>  We also have this rule of law mechanism since last December where EU funding can also come into play.  If there is a breakdown of rule of law or a situation where we are not happy that EU funds can be managed in the correct way, EU funding can be stopped.  As I said, there is a toolbox and I do not want to pre-empt what the Commission will do because it is studying the situation.  There will be a comprehensive response in time to this challenge to the supremacy of EU law.<\/p><p> On the green deal, it is correct that there may be winners and losers to some extent, but several funds are being put in place to help to alleviate some of the negative effects on certain groups.  First and foremost is the Brexit adjustment fund, whereby Ireland will get the lion's share among member states.  Some of the funding is to go to fishing communities that have suffered quota cuts as a result of the Brexit deal, for example.  We will also have a climate adjustment fund, which is also supposed to help with the adjustment to climate change.  It is to help people with retrofitting, for example.  It will help those in energy poverty or those suffering from some of the side-effects of going green.  The social climate fund will have around &euro;72 billion.  It is to help citizens to finance investments in energy efficiency, new heating systems and cleaner transport.  There is also the just transition mechanism, which is run by the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy, DG REGIO, which will provide targeted support to regions and sectors most affected by the transition towards the green economy.<\/p><p> We have anticipated that the adjustments will be painful in certain areas and for certain sectors.  I have referred to at least three different sources of funding that are supposed to alleviate the negative aspects of adjustment to the green agenda.  On the farming side, the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, is still one of the biggest funds we manage at EU level.  The policy will still exist.  It will be greener in the future but support for farmers is still part and parcel of what the EU does and is about.  Combined with the other funds, we should be able to shore up and support the sectors mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Nolan and Mr. Claridge.  The first issue I wanted to bring up has been dealt with to a degree.  It relates to the current difficulties concerning the Irish protocol.  I welcome what was said in that it follows on from what we have heard from Vice-President &Scaron;efovi on engaging with those who are seeking to provide solutions.  We have from the British Government, and particularly Mr. David Frost, what can, at best, be described as noise.  Very soon, we will see the colour of the British Government's money and whether it is serious or play-acting.  I welcome the fact that the relevant officials are ready to go if there is an element of good faith on the British side.  None of this is helped by the fact that there has been an element of political unionism painting itself into a corner, but I hope we can get beyond that.  The fact is that there seems to be a large number of people who just want solutions to their day-to-day problems, particularly in the North.<\/p> <p>  Has the Commission had any engagement on difficulties concerning An Post?  I am referring to the change concerning customs requirements on 1 July.  I get that the problem is partly because smaller suppliers in Britain just have not prepared for Brexit in the same way as similar companies here.  There seems to be an issue.  Any pressure that can be brought to bear to bring about a solution will be helpful.  There will be stockpiling and delays, and we are in the run-up to Christmas.  I know it is a poxy line, but the Santa Claus supply chain could be impacted by this.  Everything that can be done to mitigate the problem should be done.<\/p> <p>  On the vaccine roll-out, the Commission engaged and delivered what was a solution across every state.  Had we done what was done in other states, things would have been far worse.  There may have been na&iuml;vet&eacute; regarding some of the dealings with particular companies.  There was probably an element of the European Commission and European Union dealing with something they did not necessarily have competence in.  It shows that, in the future, we do not necessarily need constitutional change regarding delivery; we just need to be able to set out targets that states can buy into when it can be seen that the European Union and Commission can benefit all of us.<\/p> <p>  My next question is broader.  At one stage, there was serious over-and-back over the fact that none of us is safe until all of us are safe.  People talked about the TRIPS waiver and said there is no need for it and that it is a cul-de-sac.  I am not ideologically wedded to anything but I wonder where the delegates believe matters stand as regards global capacity for production and delivery.  These are what matter.  That is accepting that as we try to deliver to the developing world, there will be difficulties if there is no proper health infrastructure.  My fear over COVAX is that it is aiming to deal with, say, only 20% of the population in some of the areas.  What is the scope of HERA?<\/p> <p>  It is important that lessons be learned.  We will have to maintain an element of consistent and constant review, particularly when talking about a stimulus programme.  It really has to be targeted.<\/p> <p>  On the European chips Act, we all get the difficulty regarding semiconductors.  Could the delegates go into a little detail on how the European Commission believes it can enter the fray and make a difference concerning what is a serious supply chain problem in the sense that production was overtaken by other elements of the IT sector?  There was a need for more computers, devices and whatever due to remote working.  There was no car production for part of the time.  Now we have a difficulty.<\/p> <p>  The social climate fund amounts to &euro;72 billion.  What can be drawn down?  Could the witnesses give some detail on this?  I get that they could spend a whole hour answering every question I ask.<\/p> <p>  On defence, I must add the caveat that we all accept that there needs to be engagement; we cannot put our heads in the sand.  If we are talking about Afghanistan, however, we should call the situation what it is.  To a degree, it is a misadventure in respect of which the US would have been better reading a couple of history books rather than watching reruns of \"Rambo III\".  Trillions were spent to end up back almost at the starting point.  We do not really need the European Commission and European Union to become part of that.  What exactly do the witnesses foresee in respect of the EU&ndash;NATO joint declaration, which would frighten me somewhat?<\/p> <p>  I agree wholeheartedly that we need to consider cyberdefence.  The ransomware attack on the HSE proved that to everybody.<\/p><p>To meet that threat, we will need the capacity we have as a group rather than as individuals.  We need a capacity to disrupt the attacks, which, to some degree, requires offensive abilities.  However, I do not like the idea that cyberdefence would be included with regular defence.  As I said, I have concerns regarding a European defence union.<\/p><p> I agree with everything that has been said about the rule of law.  As much as dialogue always must come first, it is a question of what leverages we have in the toolbox.  There have been difficulties from time to time in trying to link moneys and budgets with ensuring due diligence in terms of the rule of law.  We all agree that breaches have occurred in Hungary and Poland, but in the case of the Spain, for example, notwithstanding that we get into constitutional questions, there are not many people who could say that the Spanish Government dealt fairly with some of its Catalonian elected representatives.  I suspect there is a feeling across Europe that, sometimes, the rule of law impacts on them but does not impact on some of the original funders of the EU or those who came into the family at an earlier stage.<\/p><p> We all accept the necessity of a media freedom Act to ensure the primacy and freedom of the media.  The Facebook whistleblower situation was in the news last week, with the allegation of antagonism and pursuing a \"hate sells\" approach.  That did not come as any shock to us but it is something we collectively need to deal with as we look to the future.  Sometimes it is easier to deal with issues on a European level rather that at the level of individual states.  We are talking about going toe to toe with some very serious companies but it is something that has to be done.  Whatever about the idea that hate sells, we have a wider issue in that what also sells is the really negative stuff, particularly, for instance, in regard to eating disorders.  There was an allegation that Facebook was aware of the damage that was being done to people's mental health but, because that sort of messaging was selling and there was profit in it, action was not taken.  The company would say that is not true of course, but we need to ensure there are protections in that regard.<\/p><p> If Ms Nolan can answer all of those questions in the next few minutes, I would be delighted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#G00200","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Before I do, I will address a question I missed from the previous speaker on the next steps in regard to the Northern Ireland protocol.

On the contrary, we have been the most generous in terms of giving vaccines to other parts of the word.  We are also trying to develop, with the United States, the technology for the development of vaccines in Africa, for instance, so that the manufacturing capacity is there and, in time, the continent will be able to produce its own vaccines.

There are a number of related issues.

The approach of developing manufacturing capacity, for example in Africa, is one whereby we very much want Africa to be able to produce its own vaccines.  It is a slightly different way of approaching the problem but it is not necessarily an inferior way of approaching it.<\/p> <p>  Taking away the patents from the companies that have developed these vaccines is very difficult to do.  If we have a new pandemic, a new health scare or a new horrible disease we have to have these companies ready to produce vaccines at short notice in future.  There are intellectual property issues.  There are all sorts of other issues related to it.  I am not an expert in this area myself but this has obviously been looked at extensively.  It was felt this was the way to deal with the lack of vaccines.  It is a big priority for the Commission.  None of us are safe until we are all safe.  This is the basic thing about the pandemic.

If it is okay, I would like to go back to the Brexit issue and the protocol.  I fully appreciate there are sensitivities and Ms Nolan needs to be cautious in the answers she gives.  I want to ask a question on the potential threat of the triggering of Article 16.  It gets discussed quite a lot, as though it is open to be used at any time for any reason when, obviously, it is not.  I am sure Ms Nolan will agree quite a high bar has to be reached to trigger Article 16.  There has to be a significant impact on society or an economic impact.  Ironically, given that the issue now seems to be around the European Court of Justice, even though it was not an issue before now, ultimately that court is the final arbiter of anything to do with the withdrawal agreement and the protocol.  What is the position if the UK triggers Article 16 and the European Union disagrees that the bar has been met to trigger it?  What happens at that point?  Is there a process to decide whether the EU proceed with the Article 16 procedure?  Is there something else that can happen at that point?  It is unusual that the very issue that seems to be the crux in the UK side is the European Court of Justice and ultimately that court will decide.<\/p><p>Where do we go from there on that front?  On a separate topic, Ms Nolan's introduction on the state of the Union address was very good and very comprehensive.  I am particularly interested in the Aim, Learn, Master, Achieve, ALMA, programme.  This extension of opportunities for young people to work abroad in the European Union is long overdue.  It important to have more than just Erasmus because not everybody wants to go to college or university and we should broaden those opportunities out.  Does Ms Nolan have any further details on the ALMA programme?  When might it start?  When can we start informing young people here that they can apply?  How might it work?  How does she see the reciprocal arrangements here in Ireland operating?  How will we cater for students coming from other member states?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#J01200","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I have tried not to get too drawn into the UK's threats and the sword of Damocles that is Article 16.  From our perspective, invoking Article 16 would not solve any of the challenges people and businesses in Northern Ireland are experiencing due to Brexit.  On the contrary, it would only add to the uncertainty.  It would probably further complicate the process of finding solutions.  If the UK Government's concerns are more about sovereignty and domestic policies than the actual problems on the ground in Northern Ireland, it may indeed decide to trigger Article 16.  If it does so, we will at least feel that we have done everything to avoid that situation.  We would then have to look at deploying parts of our own legal toolbox under the withdrawal agreement and the trade and co-operation agreement in response.  What are those measures?  One is arbitration to challenge such measures.  The next is to move to an infringement procedure which was launched in March but then put on ice.  We could also launch a series of new infringement procedures on, for example, chilled meats and other areas in which the protocol has been breached.  We can use measures under the trade and co-operation agreement as well.  We do not want a confrontation.  We do not want to enter such a phase but we have to prepare for that case arising.  That is where we stand on that.<\/p> <p>  On the European Court of Justice, I do not want to use the term \"red lines\" because everybody is talking about red lines, but that is a clear red line.  The European Court of Justice is the arbiter on the Single Market.  If one takes out the European Court of Justice, one cannot have access to the Single Market.  It is a chicken and egg situation.  Vice-President &Scaron;efovi said the same to the Institute of International and European Affairs last week.  He made it crystal clear how important this is.  I do not think I need to add anything to that.  <\/p> <p>  The ALMA programme was just announced by the president last month.  Colleagues in either the employment or the education Directorate General - I am not sure which - are now preparing it.  We have to wait to see when that proposal comes through but the idea is that this is not for the higher education area but more for young people who may have fallen through the cracks to some extent, in that they are not in employment, education or training.  As soon as I have more details on that programme, I will be happy to share them with the Senator.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the Senator for participating in our event on the state of the Union on the day the president made her speech because she had to react in real time.

I apologise for being late.  I thank the Commission representation's staff, including Ms Nolan and others, for their work.  It is invisible but really important.  I put that on the record.  Many of the issues have already been dealt with.  I will not go back over the same ground but I have a few comments and one or two questions.<\/p> <p>  When Deputy Calleary spoke about Poland he said that, in his view, the Commission needs to be stronger.  I sat listening to debate in the European Parliament for many years.  Those on the extreme left were saying that we were not doing nearly enough and those on the extreme right were defending certain states.  It is a double-edged sword because, as soon as the Commission acts decisively, it is seen as the European elites acting.  It is a really difficult issue.  Perhaps the Commission is, to some extent, waiting for a change of government in certain member states because that often changes the dialogue.  Despite people's frustration and deeply held beliefs that the Commission should act and that it is not good enough that it is not doing so - and we can all say that - there is another aspect to it.  I can see why the Commission acts in the way it does.  <\/p> <p>  I have one small question.  I do not want to throw an incendiary device in here but there was a ruling from a German court some time back which showed certain similarities to the ruling of the Polish courts.  I do not know the details but this is an example of why we sometimes have to stand back.<\/p> <p>  In the state of the Union address, the Commission President spoke about social fairness and a European care strategy.  Ms Nolan has already answered a question on the ALMA programme.  I would like to hear anything she has to say on that care strategy.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the protocol at length.  All I can say is that the EU has demonstrated extreme patience and that I hope it continues to do so.  My personal view is that there are those who simply want to try to force the European Commission to introduce some kind of land border on the island of Ireland.  For many, that is the outcome they want to see.  In that context, the stance and the patience of the Commission has been really important.  I expect that will continue.<\/p> <p>  There has been some discussion on the European Green Deal, just transition and how people feel it is not working for them.  I heard Ms Nolan mention the CAP and I believe we have a real problem here.  The CAP is meant to support the production of quality, traceable food.  It must comply with a whole ever-increasing raft of European legislation on everything from veterinary matters to soil, the environment and animal welfare.  That is fine but, with the new CAP, 25% of Pillar 1 money is dedicated to eco-schemes.  Farmers have to do more to get that part of the money.  The issue here is that year on year and CAP on CAP, the requirements on primary producers are constantly increasing.<\/p><p>Yet they have to sell in world markets, certainly in the European market.  We now have the issue of carbon tax, a greater cost to access Pillar 1 money and the threat to the national herd.  For farmers today, it is okay to hear about the social climate fund but what is that?  How does it impact farmers and what they do?  We have a massive job to do on this issue.  Last Thursday night, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, was in Carrigallen in south Leitrim.  I sat for three hours in a mart and listened to what farmers were saying.  There is a sense that they are seen as the problem and there is no proper dialogue on how they can be part of the solution.  There is talk of further requirements, cutting the herd and carbon tax.  I understand there has to be change but if people feel outside of that, as they do, then we have a huge job to do there.  Farmers in general tend to be quite pro-EU in their views and I would not like to see that changing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#K00400","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I know she has in her long experience of the European Parliament seen many attempts on the rule of law and how difficult it is to build a consensus around that issue.  On the care strategy, this is a new announcement in the state of the Union address.  It is being drawn up.  I do not have any details but as soon as I have I am happy to share them with Deputy Harkin.<\/p> <p>  On the protocol, the EU has stood firmly with its principles in terms of supporting no border on the island of Ireland and respecting the Good Friday Agreement and other objectives of the peace process.  We will continue to do that.  That is the number one issue here.  We have not caused this problem.  It has been caused by the extreme version of Brexit that was chosen by the UK Government.  That is why we needed the protocol, which is the solution and not the problem.<\/p> <p>  On the green deal, I do not disagree with anything the Deputy said.  It will be hard on certain groups in society.  Ireland has a lot of ground to make up, in terms of not taking green measures earlier.  It will be a difficult transition across the EU for different sectors, such as coal in Poland and so on.  There are different issues in different states in relation to the green deal but we are trying to save the planet.  That is the bottom line and we all have to make our efforts.  I take the Deputy's point that we need to engage more with the farming community on these issues and reach out to explain the direction we are going with the green deal but the bottom line is that much of the pollution in Ireland comes from transport and agriculture.  These are areas where we have to reduce the carbon footprint.  I do not think we can get away from that but I agree it needs to be done in a way that people feel included and listened to in the difficult adjustment process ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I am not all that satisfied with that response.

When it is said that \"We're in it together\", the question, which I do not ask Ms Nolan to answer, is \"Who is this we?\"  Let us see who they are and what they are contributing.  It is not so much that we have to tell farmers the direction we are going; it is a question of involving and bringing people with you.  If that is not done, people stick their heels and all you will hear about is data centres and tax on aviation fuel.  Those are legitimate concerns.

I thank members for their questions, observations and input and thank Ms Nolan and Mr. Claridge for their participation.  There is so much going on.  We are all waiting with bated breath for what will come out this evening in relation to the Northern Ireland protocol, which is something in which this committee takes a keen interest.  We are following that closely and we are also being proactive, meeting up with Vice-President &Scaron;efovi in early December in Brussels.  A date has been secured and we will work a programme around that.  Any guidance or signposting the witnesses can give us for that trip would be most helpful.  It is a very comprehensive programme and the clerk has been working on that already.<\/p> <p>  The state of the Union address by Ursula von der Leyen focused a lot on health.  We had a successful programme in the end with vaccination.  There were initial concerns around the distribution of vaccines but that co-operation was positive.  It is not new because the European mobility directive for health has been an important foundation for such co-operation.  We can look at other ways to be proactive and creative in breaking down borders in terms of healthcare.  This committee is keeping a close eye on the future of Europe.  We are focused on what is going on in Poland and are looking at those areas specifically.<\/p> <p>  It was good to see the Commissioner in Killybegs recently.  Ms Nolan attended and would have picked up on a lot of frustration in the fishing industry.  She would have been struck by the heightened level of frustration.  It is a contradiction because while rules and regulations are controlled by our Government, they are often introduced against a backdrop of what the Commission says and proposes.  A fundamental of the European project and the big principle of interest to many on this committee is the principle of subsidiarity.  What more subsidiarity could one get than part-time farmers in south Donegal who will do part-time work in Killybegs for fishing vessels landing with mackerel?  Because of the rules, in the last few days many of these boats are landing outside the EU.  They are not landing in Killybegs and all that work is lost.  If we are looking to build communities at a local level, we need to grapple with the tension that is there, where the fishing industry feels its Government is not representing it and the administrators or people involved at an official level in Government are constantly quoting stuff coming from the Commission.<\/p><p>The rules that are in place are not workable for the fishing industry.  Everything has to be done properly and people will point to this not being done in the past.  The fishermen I deal with and the fishing vessel owners want to work within the rules but they have to work within something that is practicable and workable.  I just wanted to mention that point and I am not expecting any feedback on it.  I acknowledge the fact the Commissioner was in Killybegs in County Donegal because it is important for him to see and hear where the real tensions are.  If any guidance or direction can be provided on that front, we would be open to hearing that.  <\/p><p> Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe agus gu&iacute;m gach rath orthu.
