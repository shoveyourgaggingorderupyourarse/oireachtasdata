The Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s mission is to protect and improve the environment as a valuable asset for the people of Ireland and to protect against the harmful effects of radiation and pollution.  The EPA has a wide range of responsibilities as environmental regulator, knowledge provider and advocate.  Specifically related to water quality, the EPA&rsquo;s responsibilities include: co-ordinating and implementing the national monitoring programme to assess and report on water quality; assessing the impact of human activities and pressures on the status of water; and providing advice and assisting in the establishment of environmental objectives, programmes of measures and river basin management plans.<\/p> <p>  The nitrates directive is implemented in Ireland via the good agricultural practice regulations.  Under these regulations, the EPA&rsquo;s statutory functions relate to reporting to the European Commission on water quality in the context of the implementation of the directive.  We provide the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with an annual and independent assessment of water quality in Ireland as part of its annual derogation report.  Every four years, the EPA compiles an assessment on the implementation of the nitrates directive.  The EPA is a member of the nitrates expert committee, which is co-chaired by representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p> <p> Water quality in Ireland is not as good as it should be.  Our rivers, lakes, estuaries and groundwaters continue to be under pressure from human activities.  Just over half of surface waters are in a satisfactory condition, which means that a large number are not in good ecological health.  An overarching message in the EPA&rsquo;s State of the Environment report, published at the end of 2020, is that the water environment needs to be improved and water pollution must be tackled locally at a water catchment level.  The evidence shows that agriculture is the most significant pressure on water quality.  The most widespread problem is excess nutrients from animals and fertilisers which have resulted in elevated levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in our waters. <\/p> <p>  Nutrient levels impact the ability of these waters to sustain healthy ecosystems and cause nuisance algal blooms.  High nitrogen levels in drinking water that are above the drinking water standard can pose a risk to human health.  In particular, nitrogen pollution is causing a pressure in parts of the south, south east and east of the country.  A combination of freely draining soils and relatively intensive farming means that the risk of nitrate leaching is high.  Rivers such as the Bandon, Lee, Blackwater, Suir, Nore, Barrow and Slaney have high nitrogen levels with significant implications for the marine environments they flow into.  <\/p> <p>  On other agriculture impacts, pollution from phosphorus run-off, causes a pressure around the country on land where the soils are poorly draining.  There are also problems arising from excess sediment from run-off and stream bank erosion, drainage impacting on physical habitat condition, as well as pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals in waters.  Overall, the message is that protecting water quality is an issue for all farmers, not just those that have the largest or more intensive farms. <\/p> <p>  The nitrates action programme, NAP, is an important implementation mechanism to drive improvements in water quality and to meet our water framework directive objectives.  However, the evidence shows that the fourth NAP has not protected water quality from nutrient pollution from agriculture.  The EPA supports the range and breadth of proposed measures in the fifth and next NAP which, if implemented as proposed, will strengthen the protection of the environment.  <\/p> <p>  A one-size-fits-all approach will not be adequate to achieve the outcomes that we need.  Therefore, measures must be targeted to achieve water quality objectives.  They need to be targeted and specific to the soils, activities and risks on the farm.  The EPA has developed maps, called pollution impact potential maps, that show the highest risk areas for losing phosphorus and nitrogen in the landscape.  We have also recently published an assessment of the amount of nitrogen reduction needed in the key catchments of concern along the south and south east.  These tools can help policymakers, farmers and their advisors to target actions to reduce nutrient losses from farms. <\/p> <p>  Measures in the nitrates action programme must be consistent and aligned across agricultural and other environmental policy to achieve multiple environmental benefits.  The EPA welcomes the acknowledgement in the consultation document that better cross-policy integration is needed.  We also welcome the inclusion of measures for ammonia losses and greenhouse gas emissions as a means of joining up policy.  It is clear from the consultation to date that there are issues with achieving compliance with the European Union (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations.  Securing compliance with all existing and new regulations needs to be given priority, using the full suite of tools from support and advice, incentives and a strengthened enforcement and inspection regime. <\/p> <p>  In summary, agriculture is the most significant pressure impacting on water quality.  Trends are going in the wrong direction.  A reduction in nutrient emissions to water is essential to achieve improvements in water quality and protect our coastal waters.  The fifth nitrates action programme is an opportunity to reduce pollution from nutrients, which will also bring multiple benefits for health, climate, air quality and biodiversity.  Targeted, consistent and substantial measures are needed as a matter of urgency, using the full suite of tools from advice, incentives and a strengthened enforcement and inspection regime to support compliance.  The EPA is committed to working constructively and collaboratively with relevant Departments and agencies to provide the evidence base for assessing water quality and the wider environment, as well as assisting in developing plans and programmes that will protect and restore Ireland&rsquo;s natural environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021101300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eimear Cotter"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Cotter.

I will try not to go over what everybody has said previously.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the nitrates concentration map in figure 1 in their report, if I draw a diagonal line from Belfast towards Kerry, it is telling that the bulk of the issue with nitrates is in the south and south east, as they rightly allude to it.  You could probably think that maybe farmers on the western side of that line would feel somewhat aggrieved that they are being tagged with the issue.  I appreciate there are issues with pesticides on the western seaboard.  It probably comes back to a point the Chairman was trying to get at at the outset.  The EPA has assigned 85% of the source of nitrogen to agriculture and yet, in its own report, it states there are significant issues with the Tolka and the Liffey river basins on the eastern seaboard as well as others in the south east.<\/p><p>By contrast, the majority of the nitrates in the Liffey and the Tolka catchment, which incorporates Dublin city, are from an urban wastewater.  It would be remiss of me not to articulate a well-held view of farmers, that is, that because they operate such a large land base, it is not fair to compare them in the way they are compared in the EPA's reports.  Statistics are like lies; they can be interpreted in different ways.  The map in figure 1 is telling.  There is a higher concentration of farming there but there is also a significant concentration of population and industry on that eastern seaboard.  I hope it is not intentional but there is perhaps a tone in the EPA's submission, as well as in those from the two Departments, that the nitrates issue is very much one of farming  only, but it is not and farmers will pay a heavy price.

They stated that the nitrates action programme is important for improving water quality and meeting the water framework objectives.  The fourth NAP, however, has not protected the water from nutrient pollution from agriculture.<\/p><p>The EPA supports the fifth NAP, which it believes will help to tackle the failure of the fourth one.  It says the measure is designed to target specific soils as the best way to go.  I have a few questions about that.<\/p><p> Do the witnesses think that the current system, whereby only farmers who require a nitrates derogation stocking rate of over 170 kg of nutrient per hectare or above are required to fence off watercourses at a minimum distance of 1.5 m, should be extended?  Also, is there not a case to be made for farmers with a stocking rate at or below 100 kg of nitrate per hectare not to have to fence off watercourses?  I am asking this because the committee met with Mr. Joe Condon of the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, recently, who warned that if an extension of this requirement happens, many farming hills and commonages would be forced out of cattle.  With the budget fresh in our minds, it should be noted we are here today discussing measures to ensure, quite correctly, an improvement in our watercourses, and these measures will involve increasing environmental obligations on farmers, who, I must note, have been given hardly any new support.  They have been disregarded.  In the meantime, we consistently see farmers being targeted for blame for these problems.  They are effectively being told to shoulder the burden of the changes needed.<\/p><p> We have to note that many farmers are getting the blame for the sins of just a few.  What appears to be missing regularly from the argument is how the environment and economic sustainability can be married and work together, because the way this issue is being addressed is that one side is being pitted against the other, with the consensus being family farms will have to make changes and take the pain.  We discussed the issue recently in the committee with representatives of the INHFA and they spoke of how a broad-brush approach to regulation does not take into account the different impacts of different types of farms.

However, given those trends and given the ambition we must build to reverse those trends, we see the full suite of measures in the fifth action plan delivering a greater level of protection for the environment.  They will have to be implemented, of course, and fully tracked and monitored to see they are working and having the impact on the environment that is necessary.<\/p> <p>  On the framing of the argument, it is not meant to be blame.  Like everybody else, we can see the importance of the agriculture sector from an economic perspective and socially.  It is people's livelihoods.  The Deputy talked about farms.  We are acutely aware of this.  However, changing expectations, including consumer expectations, and the changing environment in terms of tackling greenhouse gas emissions and protecting the environment mean the agriculture sector will have to address the trends we are seeing in the environment, which are currently going in the wrong direction.  The expansion of the sector has happened at the expense of the environment in respect of water quality, air quality and greenhouse gas emissions.

Many of the issues I was curious about at the start of the meeting have been addressed by other members, so I will not go back over old ground.  I have two questions.  The second is one I will probably have to make a statement on to explain what I am coming at, but I stress I want the witnesses' opinion and it is a question.<\/p> <p>  First, I realise the witnesses are concentrating today on nitrates and phosphorous on the agriculture side because this is the relevant committee on agriculture.  Have the witnesses encountered any or many issues with water quality or issues in watercourses that have emanated from road run-off or soiled water from roads?  I ask that question as somebody who lives in a very rural part of Ireland and I hear farmers complaining about the fact they are only allowed to put out slurry or soiled water on land a certain distance from a watercourse and at certain times of the year, yet all the run-off from the road is directed straight into the stream with no filtration system.  Have the witnesses come across many or any issues in watercourses that they could track back to soiled run-off water?<\/p> <p>  The second question probably seeks the witnesses' opinion.  I appreciate the witnesses have explained, both in their opening statement and in many of their answers today, that the EPA is basically the organisation that surveys and monitors and then the information it collects is fed into the policy process.  It has an input into the writing of the policy in that regard in that it feeds into it.  With that in mind and in regard to slurry spreading and the prohibited periods, I would like the witnesses' opinion on restriction by calendar.  Do they think that is the most effective method being used when it comes to the regulations?  I will explain what I mean by that.  Do they think it is more damaging to spread slurry in a very wet February when you are not allowed to do it in what could be a very dry October?  Could our policies or our prohibited periods be changed based on climate more so than by a date in the calendar?  We can never predict whether it is going to be a wet fall, winter or spring.  It has happened in numerous years that, although the spreading of slurry is prohibited from mid-September, the months of October and November were the two driest months of the year.  Every tank in the country is full once the prohibition lifts and farmers have no choice but to get it out onto what can then be saturated land in February and early March.  Which is the worst for the quality of the water?  How would the witnesses propose we might change that scenario to gain the best benefit for our water quality?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021101300002#H00400","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I can take the second part of that and Ms Gurrie will take the first question.

We are not involved in writing the policy.  To get into the details of the measures is not where our expertise lies.  We are looking at what is happening in the environment.  We will provide that information to any decision-maker that needs it, but it is the experts in the agricultural sector, and perhaps the committee's discussion afterwards, that would be more focused on the measures.

Many of my questions have already been asked.  Everybody has to be very concerned about the quality of our waters and we have regulations in place.  The funny thing is the witnesses said at the beginning that the problem is mainly caused by human activity.  My belief is that the problem is the lack of human activity.  I can bring the witnesses around west Cork any time they are free and show them raw sewage going into the tide from towns and villages.  I can only speak for my constituency in west Cork, but it is not because of lack of effort by local people in towns and villages, whether it is Castletownshend or Goleen, and I can name a good few more, to try to turn it around.  They have made superhuman, gallant efforts to stop this from happening and to bring the people who own the properties around the table with the council, Irish Water and others, but nothing happens.<\/p> <p>  It looks to me that if the farmer makes an infringement, the heavy weight of the law of the land will be brought down on him but if the local authority, Irish Water or whoever is breaking the rules, we publish its name on some paper.  Publishing names on papers is not good enough; we want action.  We want our towns and villages to have clean and clear water.  Some of these towns and villages are the most beautiful places in which to live and holiday in the world.  This is a sad reflection on society.  The finger is continuously being pointed at the farmer when raw sewage is pumping into the tide from outdated wastewater plants, which were probably built in the 1940s and 1950s and were never capable of carrying what they were supposed to.  Unfortunately, those plants are being overlooked.  Their names are being published but nothing else is happening.  We are drifting towards 2027 with the whole thing out of control and no solutions being put forward.  If a farmer creates an infringement, there are many laws, rules and regulations around.  What are the laws, rules and regulations if Irish Water or a local wastewater plant is pumping raw sewage into the tide continuously, year after year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021101300002#J00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":159,"content":"<p>There are 34 towns and villages throughout the country from which raw sewage is being released.

Does that take her all over the country and does it allow her to engage with communities on the work she is doing?<\/p> <p>  We have a significant number of group water schemes throughout the country.  They do wonderful work on water quality programmes.  In fact, they are now being funded by the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Do the witnesses engage with those schemes?  Their work is sometimes not recognised in the media.  They are doing outstanding work on the quality of water schemes and they are all over rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Are the witnesses aware of other projects on herbicide contamination, again involving group water schemes?  In some parts of the country, herbicide detection has halved on certain streams and rivers because of a group water scheme that includes local farmers.  It simply involves replacement certification provided gratis by the group for water schemes with individual farmers meeting the costs of any additional parts that are required and servicing the boom sprayers.  This fantastic work is going on under our noses in rural Ireland.  It would make perfect sense - maybe this happens - to have an engagement between those groups and the EPA.  I commend the EPA on its work because it has been very important in parts of the country in speaking up on issues that were wrong, but is that engagement there?

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Donal Grant, who is a water policy adviser with our Department and co-chair of the nitrates expert group.<\/p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s nitrates action programme must protect surface waters and groundwater from pollution arising from agricultural sources.  Under the terms of the nitrates directive, Ireland must review and update our national nitrates action programme by the end of this year.  Our review must take into account the recent trends in water quality.  We have conducted a broad public consultation and held discussions with key stakeholders including farm organisations and non-governmental organisations.  Our department is working closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on this review and on related agri-environmental policy measures.<\/p> <p>  Our water quality is under increasing pressure.  The  EPA has reported that almost half of our water bodies are not in satisfactory condition.  The most significant pressures on water are from excessive nutrients, namely, phosphorous and nitrogen, siltation of waterways and changes to the physical habitats of our rivers.<\/p> <p>  People need clean water to drink, for sanitation and for swimming.  Our food industry trades on Ireland&rsquo;s image as a clean and green source of sustainable food production.  Ireland&rsquo;s tourist industry relies on our image as a green island with well-stocked, healthy fisheries with unpolluted estuaries without green algae and with clean beaches next to good quality bathing waters.  Our biodiversity needs unpolluted water.  All of this requires well-protected water catchments.<\/p> <p>  While I am focusing my comments today on agriculture, I want to assure the committee that our Department is also taking action right across the full range of significant water pressures to protect and enhance our waterways.  Ireland has binding obligations under the water framework directive to protect all water.  We are obliged to prevent the deterioration of water status and we must bring all water to at least good status by 2027 at the very latest.  At present, we are a long way from this objective and water quality trends in many of our water bodies are going in the wrong direction.  The situation is urgent and requires collective action across a number of policy areas to halt and reverse this deterioration in water quality.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, recently published a draft river basin management plan for the period 2022 to 2027 for a six month consultation period running until March of next year.  We have given copies to the Chairman for members, which we can pass over if necessary.  The final plan will be published in mid-2022 following this consultation period.<\/p><p>This draft sets out over 100 proposed measures to address all pressures across water bodies from different activities and sectors.  The nitrates action programme and the associated agricultural sustainability support and advice programme, ASSAP, are two of the key measures for mitigating agricultural pressures.<\/p><p> The nitrates directive dates back to 1991.  Ireland has had a long and often difficult history with the implementation of this directive.  In 2004, the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, issued a judgment against Ireland following its failure to fulfil its obligations under this directive.  There is a binding requirement in the nitrates directive that each member state must set a general limit not exceeding 170 kg nitrogen per hectare.  Ireland has requested a derogation up to 250 kg nitrogen per hectare, where conditions permit.  We are looking to review this derogation.  Ireland&rsquo;s dairy industry relies heavily on this derogation facility.  However, securing the derogation depends on Ireland demonstrating a robust nitrates action programme that shows that we will achieve the obligations and objectives of the nitrates directive.<\/p><p> An initial public consultation on the next programme was open from November 2020 until January 2021.  The expert group then developed a draft programme.  We held a second public consultation on this draft from August until mid-September of this year.  This is in addition to, and in parallel with, various stakeholder events, webinars and an ongoing dialogue with key stakeholders.<\/p><p> The proposed draft measures for the next programme were set out in detail in the consultation document.  The measures are now being adjusted and finalised, having regard to the issues, suggestions and concerns raised by people during the consultation period.  The draft measures for the next programme include new requirements for slurry and soiled water storage and management; revised livestock excretion rates; proposals for a dairy industry nitrogen reduction initiative; new controls on chemical fertilisers; a chemical fertiliser register; green cover on tillage ground; new requirements on grazing land management; a commitment to review compliance assurance activities by local authorities; and enforcement by local authorities.  The draft also includes a commitment to address the sustainable reuse of sewage and industrial sludge, as well as measures to help address ammonia emissions from agriculture. <\/p><p> Finally, both this next programme and the draft River Basin Management Plan 2022-2027 propose to expand the ASSAP to work directly with farmers, industry and advisory services to protect and deliver improvements in water quality.  In order to protect water quality, individual farmers will need support from their industry.  The Irish agrifood sector depends on our clean, green image.  Our dairy processors, in particular, rely on the derogation facility in the directive.  Environmental sustainability also needs economic sustainability.  Industry needs to provide farmers with a reasonable economic return for operating sustainably within the limits of their land.  Farmers will need programmes that include both economic returns for doing the right thing and ready access to practical farm-level advice.  <\/p><p> I will finish with a note on the next steps.  It is expected that, following a review of the consultation responses, we will have the draft regulations text within the next few weeks.  This will then be presented to the European Commission for agreement.  We anticipate that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, will publish a final action plan by the end of December, along with new good agricultural practice regulations.  With regard to Ireland&rsquo;s application for a derogation, if the Commission decides to grant Ireland a derogation, the terms of the decision will be presented at a meeting of the EU nitrates committee in mid-December.  Member states will then vote on the derogation decision.  If the vote is successful, the derogation will be published as a Commission decision as soon as practicable after that.  It will be transposed into national legislation thereafter.<\/p><p> I thank members for their attention.  We will be happy to take any questions and we will take account of members' views when we finalise the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021101300002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak with it on the topic of the nitrates directive and Ireland&rsquo;s new nitrates action programme 2022.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Bernard Harris, who is an agricultural inspector with the Department and a co-chair of the nitrates expert group.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is fully engaged in developing and supporting a new revised and strengthened nitrates action programme and nitrates derogation in 2022.  This is a key commitment in the programme for Government.  From the Department's perspective, the agricultural sector is committed to stabilising and improving water quality.  The review of the nitrates action programme provides a timely opportunity to review the impact of agriculture on our water environment and support agriculture's ambition to stabilise and improve water while seeking as many co-benefits for climate, air and biodiversity as possible.<\/p> <p>  The Departments involved have built strong relationships to collectively develop a cohesive policy response in delivering and implementing policy to improve water quality to coincide with the delivery of the next river basin management plan.  The Departments also work closely with the Environmental Protection Agency in reviewing water quality monitoring and water quality trends and investigating and understanding the pressures from nutrients, pesticides and sediment losses from agriculture.<\/p> <p>  To develop future agricultural measures for the protection of the environment, Teagasc was asked to review and model the impact of potential measures.  This work concluded that a number of additional measures will further minimise nutrient losses to the environment.  The nitrates derogation, which is 250 kg of nitrogen from livestock manure per hectare, was considered environmentally safe, based on Ireland&rsquo;s grass-based system of production.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been at the forefront of assessing the regulatory baseline for agriculture.  It has been proactive in reviewing and balancing measures to minimise the impact of agriculture on the environment.  Ireland has been a leader in the EU in protecting the environment through a strong nitrates regulation that includes both nitrogen and phosphorus, unlike most other EU member states.<\/p> <p>  The Department initiated the voluntary review of the nitrates derogation in 2019.  The nitrates derogation covers 7,000 farmers.  It is an important facility for the livestock sector.  The review introduced additional measures to improve on-farm efficiencies and help reduce agriculture's impact on the environment.  Additional measures have been introduced for a further 5,000 farmers in 2021.  These measures are being targeted to farmers to improve environmental efficiencies.  The Department has been aligning agriculture policies and strategies to ensure we arrive at a coherent approach to meeting agriculture&rsquo;s commitments to the environmental challenges of climate, air, water and biodiversity.<\/p> <p>  Agriculture has a significant role to play in meeting our environmental targets.  The strong support and work being delivered by farmers to address our environmental challenges must be acknowledged.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for its attention and time today.

The figures we have produced are an accurate reflection of what is on the ground.  Since 1993, at the time of the first rural environment protection scheme, REPS, we used a limit of 85 kg.  That was revised in 2019 to 89 kg to reflect the type of cow that is in Ireland now.  A total of 12% of milk is produced at the low band by 24% of suppliers, but two thirds of suppliers are in the middle band and about 11% are in the high band with 17% of the milk.  The Commission asked us whether all cows in Ireland are the same size and why, in Denmark or the Netherlands, there is variation, and in the UK, there were bands as well, whereas we stuck with a single figure.  This is a much more accurate reflection of what is on the ground.  If we did not go down this road, we would end up increasing the nitrogen excretion rate every year because it is based on milk yield.  The limit is 89 kg now.  It would increase to 92 kg, however, and within a year or two, it would be 94 kg and everybody would have to change.  This way, people will be able to look at their system and see where they will slot in.  The Department will be able to make that information available to them and they will be able to plan around it.

On the derogation, we heard earlier from the EPA that we are in quite a chronic situation with respect to nitrates and phosphorous pollution of watercourses throughout the country, and particularly with respect to nitrates in the south and the east.  There seems to be a correlation between the farms that are granted the derogation and the watercourses that are severely affected.<\/p> <p>  My question relates to the process.  If Ireland applies to the Commission for a derogation in December, how will we in turn decide which farms will get the derogation?  I have to hand a copy of a map showing all the farms in the country that got a derogation in the past, and another map that shows the severely deteriorated areas.  It shows in the south and the east of the country the very badly impacted watercourses.  If we get the derogation in December, how will we manage which farms in Ireland get it?  It seems there is a strong correlation and much of the intensive farming in that part of the country is leading to a deterioration of our water quality, which we simply have to address.  I do not want to put words in the mouths of our guests from the EPA, but they effectively said we were not on course to reach the 2027 objective of achieving good status throughout our watercourses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021101300002#M01100","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":190,"content":"<p>It is important to recognise that all farmers, of both extensive and intensive farms, have a key role in protecting water quality, whether that is from a nitrogen or a phosphorous perspective.  Nitrates have been increasing in the south and the south east but there are many contributing factors.  Soil type, the climate and weather events have key roles in that area.  There is a correlation but I might refer to a key example, which I am sure the EPA went through.  Within the Barrow-Nore-Suir catchment, 85% of nitrogen loss comes from agriculture.  It is estimated, however, that 30% of that comes from tillage area.  There is a combination effect from all sectors around this and it is not all from the intensive livestock sector.  We have to look at this as a whole across farming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021101300002#M01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Harris"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>The principle of the derogation is that it is allowed for within the directive that was signed in 1991.  Even at that time, there was a recognition that different soil types and conditions within a country could allow farmers there to apply more livestock manure than the standard safety limit.  An article in the directive states that if there is a long growing season, high net rainfall, as we have, and high denitrification capacity in the soil, the member state is eligible to apply for a derogation.  Ireland meets those scientific criteria and that has been agreed by the EPA, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Teagasc and us.  We have applied every four years since 2006 and we have been successful.<\/p> <p>  There has definitely been an increase in the loss of nitrogen over recent years.  That is why we took pre-emptive action in 2019 with a voluntary review of the derogation.  That did not take place in any other member state and was not pre-empted by the Commission but we took the action to cause change on farms.  Earlier this year, we approached Teagasc in Moorepark - we are in consultation with it all the time - and asked it to model a series of measures and predict what their outcome would be.  I presume that when the EPA was appearing before the committee, it referred to the total nitrogen reduction rate that is needed in each catchment to bring it to good water status.<\/p><p>Teagasc has modelled the measures the Departments have proposed in the consultation document.  If these measures are allowed on to farms and they are successful, we can reverse the trend and facilitate high stocking rates.<\/p><p> As we get more information, we will need more targeted measures on farms because certain parts of a field, never mind a farm or a parish, behave differently from other parts as regards soil type, and there will be more losses.  These are called critical source areas and in the future we will have to home in on those more.  We also know that if every farmer in a catchment has a high stocking rate, it will be difficult for water quality to thrive.  The Deputy was probably at the Teagasc open day in Moorepark, at which Teagasc told farmers they can reduce their surplus from an average of 180 kg per hectare to 100 kg per hectare and increase their nitrogen use efficiency from 25% to 50%.  The price of fertiliser is nearly double what it was this time last year.  That will have a major impact.

We only have six years to do that.  Realistically, are we going to get there?  As far as I understand it, the EPA is saying we will not.  Accepting that the fifth nitrates action programme provides for a range of measures that might take us in the right direction, will it get us there quickly enough and will the measures be implemented?

The first is for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage officials.  This issue was raised with me by a frustrated farmer who is abiding by all the conditions.  His land abuts the road and there is a stream going through it.  The local authority rocked up and started shoring the water directly from the road into the watercourse or stream.  Is there any directive from the Department to local authorities or any policy on avoidance of that scenario in the future?  The representatives of the EPA confirmed that they have encountered and discovered numerous issues in watercourses and streams that they could track back to water run-off.<\/p> <p>  The final question is for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine officials.  Again, it seeks an explanation.  With regard to the prohibited slurry spreading periods, do they think we are getting the maximum mitigation or value from a calendar-based prohibited period?  As I said in the last session, the reason I ask is that our climate seems to have changed.  We are told we cannot spread slurry during the months of October, November and December.  They could be the three driest months of the year and there could be a wet spell in January, but the farmers are back out because they have no choice.  I acknowledge what the officials said about getting the maximum growth quality and maximum return from slurry, but there could be a situation where the capacity is full to the brim and the farmer has to get some out.  Has the Department done any surveys or has it any results on what would be the maximum mitigation process for prohibited periods?  Is there any way it could be done based on ground conditions rather than just a date on the calendar, when we have no idea what the weather and ground conditions are going to be during that period?  It might be safer for our water to spread slurry on dry land during large portions of that period rather than having to spread it the minute the prohibited period is over due to capacity issues, when land conditions could be at their worst for the acceptance of slurry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021101300002#P01900","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":266,"content":"<p>To address the road run-off, the same obligations apply across the board.

As regards surface run-off, obviously its nature would be different from run-off from a farm area if it was coming from a road.  However, if it is causing an issue, it has to be dealt with.  Urban run-off, which may be slightly different, is probably the nearest information we have to the situation the Senator described.  Approximately 150 water bodies out of the 2,800 are at significant pressure at present.  It is certainly an issue that features, although probably not as highly as the agricultural issues.

There was a study by Professor Nick Holden of University College Dublin, UCD, on soil moisture deficit which looked at applying slurry based on when the land could take it and a tanker could travel.  That showed that one should be spreading less than what is allowed in the open period.  It is 8 p.m. now and it is dark outside.  If this was May or June it would probably still be bright and warmer.  Temperatures have dropped now.  Applying slurry on a dry day in November is going to do a lot more harm than applying it next spring.  One is getting no value out of it and paying the same amount of money for spreading it.  The Teagasc agricultural catchment programme shows that when there is high rainfall, regardless of the time of year, there are going to be losses.  Up to 50% of the losses from agriculture can occur during the closed period and when there is rainfall or storm events throughout the year.<\/p> <p>  Farming by calendar definitely annoys people because they are being told what to do.  However, what the Senator said goes to the heart of the issue.  People are stuck in January.  No cattle are in a shed yet.  This is the middle of October.  If I had 16 weeks' storage, which I need in this part of the country, it would get me up to the middle of February.  Why are people spreading in the middle of January?  The reason is that they do not have enough storage.  They look at the legal minimum in the regulation and say they will get by.  However, they are not getting by, and that is causing many of our water problems.

They have to attend training, focus on nutrient management and perform grass measurement.  A small number of farmers in Ireland were measuring grass through PastureBase, the Teagasc system.  The most efficient thing that can be done in Ireland on much of the land is to grow grass but one must be able to measure it to manage it and get the details.  That has also become compulsory.  Liming has become compulsory on derogation farms.  The issue of soil health has probably already been discussed.  We have not focused enough on soil in Ireland and getting the pH level right, the calcium-magnesium balance right.  If the pH level is correct - which is dependent on lime - the fertiliser can be used 50% more efficiently.  That has been a positive influence.  It has been a good back-end of the year and lime sale levels are up.  They are not where we need them to be as of yet, but they are on an upward trend.  That is probably as a result of that measure.<\/p> <p>  Derogation farmers have to fence off bovine access to watercourses, which is a positive measure because it prevents E. coli.  Teagasc did a study with Dundalk Institute of Technology, the Cosaint project, that showed that animals in the watercourse leads to E. coli in drinking water.  Removing that is an excellent measure.  We made the use of low emission equipment compulsory, which Mr. Harris covered.  We also made a reduction in crude protein in dairy diet, which is important.  We looked at a suite of measures.  If animals consume excess crude protein, it will come out in their urine, is a waste of money and damages the environment.  We introduced these efficiency measures, the results of which are probably only being seen in the water now or will be seen next year.  They definitely will have a positive impact on water quality as long as they are taken on board.<\/p> <p>  We also introduced the measure that no run-off from farm roadways - the area where animals walk - is allowed into a watercourse or drain because there can be sediment loss or, for the first 100 yd from when the cows come out of the parlour, a lot of slurry.  That change is also positive.

I should have added that we introduced the compulsory use of clover if a farmer is reseeding grassland.

The drought of 2018 showed up in water quality test results of 2019.  Depending on the soil type, it can have a quick effect and might be noticeable in the next couple of years.  We need, however, to get a high level of uptake of these measures.  We have a good package of measures that stand up to those across Europe in comparison but they need to be taken on board by farmers as standard practice, rather than being driven by regulation.  Mr. Flynn raised the issue of industry earlier.  We need the industry to drive change.  In Holland, farmers get an extra payment for a litre of milk if they have more than the standard biodiversity on their farm.  They receive a cheaper loan from Rabobank if they have more than the standard biodiversity.  One of the co-ops in the south west has extra payment for having an animal health plan and milk recording in place.  It would be great to see industry taking the lead and pushing on by bringing people with it.  As well as regulations, the Common Agricultural Policy is also an incentive.

We are doing some work now with the EPA through what is called the NIECE network, which is the network of local authority enforcement, and looking at targeting the inspections and resources we have at the areas of highest risk for water quality.

It works individually with farmers on a confidential basis.

It is part of the review process, but the logic behind it is that the crop has died off early and nitrogen is available there.

I am aware that the Deputy has previously covered this, but what we are looking for across Government is a sector that can and will deliver for the environment.  I agree wholeheartedly that farmers should be rewarded for that.  This would mean farmers would have an income from what they produce, what they do for the environment and from subsidies as well, but we are not there yet.  The consumer has a major role to play here, as does industry, to reward farmers for change on their farms such as keeping hedgerows better.  <\/p> <p>  If one looks at any of the feedback on this review what one will note is that many farmers are pointing to a minority and other farmers are not accepting that anymore.  They have done a lot for the environment in terms of the many hedgerows that have been planted over the past 20 years.  There are people who still want to trim hedges in the summer or who cut down the hedge such that it is just a grassy bank while others would let it grow.  There is a European innovation project in Waterford known as Biodiversity Regeneration in Dairying Environment, or BRIDE, under which intensive dairy farmers are doing as much for the environment as many very extensive farmers.  We need to be careful not to differentiate too much between intensive and extensive farming.  Although they can deliver differently for the environment, they can all deliver.  That is the message that the Department wants to get across.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021101300002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jack Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Mr. Nolan is saying that the solution is for extensive farmers to look at intensifying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021101300002#T00400","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":326,"content":"<p>No.  What I said is, everybody has something to offer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021101300002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jack Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I have a difficulty with that.

They have maintained biodiversity on their grounds, they do not use artificial fertilisers and, as I said earlier, they have pristine water conditions.

Deputy Carthy asked about grant aid.  Contractors are an important part of the farm structure.  That they are not grant-aided to purchase some of this slurry equipment needs to be looked at.  A significant number of farmers will use contractors for the new low emissions slurry spreading.  That should be looked at.  <\/p> <p>  I would also ask that the Department give careful consideration to the medium output cow not being penalised such that people would be encouraged to go back to the low output, high solid cow.  There are too many downsides to that from a sustainability point of view.  I accept that is a decision for farmers individually, but I would like the bands to be examined.  I take the point that a significant number of cows fall into the second category, but for the cross-bred cow, in terms of sustainability, there are a lot of issues there.  I would not like to see the good friesian cow with a medium output being penalised.  <\/p> <p>  On grant aid for the slurry accommodation that will be brought forward, it was stated that farmers have made a decision to increase numbers, why the Department would grant-aid it and also that the polluter should pay.  We all want to see water quality maintained and improved.  When we last did a major investment in farm infrastructure, we had a 60% grant rate with a far higher ceiling that we have now under TAMS.<\/p><p>That had a very significant impact on water quality.  Water quality improved after it.  I ask that there be some consideration.  We know the way the cost of building is going at the moment and the ceiling of &euro;80,000 for the TAMS is not realistic.  We need a far higher ceiling.  I would like consideration to be given to a far higher ceiling than the 60%, for younger farmers who have taken over a farm, for example.<\/p><p> The other thing really bugging me is slurry technology.  There is an awful lot of advanced technology with slurry out there at the moment.  We have not invested in it at Government level.  I have had a number of stakeholders come to me with technology and projects that are not economically viable at present without some kind of grant aid but whose benefit can be huge.  We are talking about people who can distil the water from slurry, take away the solid part and give you back a pelleted organic fertiliser.  The benefit of this can be huge.  We see it operating in Northern Ireland in the intensive pig farms and poultry farms.  We have been very neglectful in not having more pilot schemes on the slurry technology that is there.  I have had seven or eight entrepreneurs who have the technology approach me but it is not economically viable.  The benefit that would be there for everyone is immense.<\/p><p> I regret this technology has not been advanced further before we go into this derogation debate.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion here but the derogation is hugely important for our dairy industry, which would be crippled without it.  It would have a huge financial impact on a constituency like my own which is hugely dependent on dairy.  It is imperative we keep it.  I am not going into a blind tunnel.  I accept we must recognise we must protect water quality as well and the derogation must come with conditions but it is hugely important it is preserved and that it does not affect our cost of production as well.  I make these points as an individual, not as Chairman of the committee but I wanted to make them.  I do not mind whether the officials respond or not as it is getting very late.  They are just points I would like them to take on board when they are formulating our programme to go to Brussels for acceptance.

I know I keep coming back to it but industry needs to help as well to cause change on farms because otherwise it is not going to work.

I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Emily de Grae, Ms Marie Dempsey and Ms Emma Hanrahan.  We very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to the committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the scheme and to assist it in any way we can.  I intend to outline the context for introducing the scheme and then set out its main provisions, after which we look forward to hearing the members' views and answering questions.<\/p> <p>  This scheme gives effect to two EU directives on contracts for the sale of goods and contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services.  In order to implement parts of a third EU directive, namely the better enforcement and modernisation directive of 2019, the scheme also proposes to revoke and replace the 1995 Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations and the European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013.  It also updates and consolidates the existing legislation on consumer rights and remedies.  Finally, it also makes amendments to the Consumer Protection Act 2007, an element of which will be to strengthen the enforcement powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.<\/p> <p>  A comprehensive, consolidated consumer rights Act along the lines proposed in the scheme provides a legislative framework that is more appropriate to present day conditions and requirements and is simpler to understand, creates clearer rules for businesses and strengthens consumers' rights.  The scheme of the Bill now under scrutiny by the committee was approved for drafting by the Government on 20 April 2021.<\/p> <p>  As my speaking time is limited to eight minutes, it is my intention to summarise the main provisions of the scheme.  The scheme contains ten parts in all.  With limited exceptions, Parts 2, 3, 5 and 6 transpose maximum harmonisation directives, which give member states little discretion on implementation.<\/p> <p>  Part 1 deals with matters common to legislation, namely citation and commencement, interpretation, application, regulations, repeals and amendments.  It also contains generally applying provisions, including those related to the making of contracts, preventing traders from attempting to restrict the statutory rights of a consumer and the jurisdiction of court to order remedies.<\/p> <p>  Part 2 focuses on the rights of consumers under sales contracts and on the remedies available to consumers where goods do not conform to those rights.  It gives effect to the sale of goods directive of 2019 and it incorporates the provisions applying to consumer sales contracts in the Sale of Goods Act 1893.  It also gives effect to Article 18, delivery of goods, and Article 20, passing of risk in goods, of the consumer rights directive of 2011, as well as the delivery provisions at sections 30 and 31 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893.  Part 2 also deals with consumer guarantees.<\/p> <p>  Part 3 gives effect to the digital content directive of 2019 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services.  Its provisions set out the rights that apply under such contracts and the remedies that apply where digital content or digital services infringe upon those rights.  As digital content and digital services are relatively new, consumer contracts for their supply have not previously been the subject of specific statutory regulation.<\/p> <p>  Part 4 will replace Part IV of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 for services contracts between a consumer and a trader.  It deals with contracts for the supply of a non-digital service.  It expands the rights of consumers in respect of such contracts and establishes a scheme of statutory remedies that will apply where a service does not conform to these rights.<\/p><p>Part 5 re-enacts, with substantial amendments, the provisions on consumer information and cancellation rights in the consumer rights directive 2011, as given effect by SI 484\/2013.  The Part also implements the significant amendments to the consumer rights directive made by the better enforcement and modernisation directive of 2019.  As Part 5 deals with key aspects of consumer contract rights, its incorporation in the scheme is in the interests of regulatory clarity and accessibility.  Its incorporation in primary legislation also permits the application of some provisions to contracts previously excluded from the scope of the secondary legislation.<\/p><p> Part 6 repeats consumer rights contained in the consumer rights directive of 2011 and given effect in SI 484\/2013 relating to payment fees, additional payments, charges for calls to customer helplines and inertia selling, that is, the sending of unsolicited goods to potential customers in the hope of making a sale.<\/p><p> Part 7 makes several important changes to the provisions of the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995, which transposed EU Directive No. 93\/13\/EEC.  As the directive is a minimum harmonisation instrument, member states are free to extend its provisions to excluded terms and to add to the protections it provides.  The changes made to the regulations include extending the scope of the unfair terms provisions to include contract terms that have been negotiated between the consumer and trader, strengthening the transparency requirements that apply to contract terms, narrowing somewhat the exemption from assessment for unfairness of core contract terms and expanding a grey list of consumer contract terms presumed to be unfair and introducing a blacklist of terms that are automatically unfair.  The Part also gives effect to the new penalties provisions inserted in the directive by the better enforcement and modernisation directive of 2019.<\/p><p> Part 8 sets out the enforcement powers and penalties under the scheme.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, will have enforcement responsibilities for consumer contracts under all Parts of the Act.  The Central Bank will continue to have an enforcement function under Part 7 in respect of unfair contract terms in consumer contracts with regulated financial services providers.

The fact that there was no specific legislation to cover digital goods and services did not mean they were not covered under sale of goods and services legislation anyway.  However, it was important to modernise legislation to try to meet the peculiarities of digital content and digital services.  For example, one of the things we are trying to cover here is that people can sign up to a digital service and, instead of paying for that service in monetary, they supply personal data, almost as a payment.  As such, it is important to try to ensure that a consumer's rights are protected where is no monetary payment being made but the payment is in the form of data.  That was not necessarily covered in the existing legislation.  That is not to say that consumers did not have rights under existing legislation, but it was important to try to future-proof those rights in the context of the digital world we are in.  Digital content includes computer games and the famous digital platforms that offer streaming film and television services.  It was about making sure that consumers are protected regardless of whether a physical payment is made or consumers are just giving access to their data by way of payment.  I hope that answers the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McNamara"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McNamara for the response.

We have been factoring in the responses to it in the drafting.  As members are aware, the Bill was approved for drafting in April, so the drafting has been continuing apace since then.  We have been taking into consideration several of the responses that were received.  Respondents to the public consultation included the likes of the CCPC, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, the Consumer Association of Ireland, IBEC, ComReg, the Alternative Operators in the Communications Market group, the Bar Council, the Law Society and the Irish Dental Association.<\/p> <p>  The responses to the consultation were generally very supportive.  Concerns were raised regarding Part 4, particularly in respect of the supply of professional services.  For instance, the Bar Council of Ireland suggested that in the event that barristers are permitted to provide services directly to consumers, those services should be exempted from the application of Part 4 of the scheme, relating to contracts for the supply of services.  Although the matter is somewhat academic at present, we do not see any compelling reason, in principle, for the exclusion of legal services provided by barristers from the scope of Part 4 in terms of the protection of consumer rights.  The Irish Dental Association argued, for example, that the provisions of Part 4 and the fitness of a service for a particular purpose or result are inappropriate in the context of dental services.  As these provisions only apply to a purpose or a result accepted by a service provider, we think it is proportionate to offer adequate safeguards to the providers of dental or other services.<\/p> <p>  We are engaging with other Departments with responsibility for redress schemes, for example, in areas such as property or legal services.  We are engaging with bodies such as the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, the Residential Tenancies Board and the like with a view to making sure that, without impinging on consumer rights, we avoid regulatory overlap.  We do not want any overlap or confusion.  We are grateful to all the respondents to the consultation.  We might not necessarily agree on some of the points of concern raised, but all of the observations have been analysed and they will inform the onward drafting of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McNamara"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Overall, Ms McNamara would say the feedback from the consultation was very positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#B00700","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Yes, it was.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McNamara"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I will leave it at that for the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#C00100","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>The next member who has indicated to speak is Deputy Louise O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#C00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McNamara and her team for the comprehensive presentation.

There has been an imbalance in consumer rights legislation in the past, between goods and services, and we are trying to rebalance that in this Bill.  We are increasing consumer rights and remedies whereby they will have automatic rights and remedies laid out in the legislation in instances when goods or services are not in conformity.  As the drafting of the Bill proceeds, we will consider timelines that will be afforded to traders, particularly in regard to digital services, to bring them into conformity.  When a person's broadband is not working, how much time should the trader be afforded to correct that before the person can seek a reduction in price of what has already been paid, or be allowed to cancel the contract and seek a remedy from the trader?  That will be built into the legislation.  We are also giving the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, more powers to pursue traders if they do not meet their obligations in regard to the remedies.

They could be considered questionable if they appeared in a contract.  An example of this would be a term in a contract that has the object or the effect of making an agreement binding on a consumer whereby the provision of services by the trader is subject to a condition where realisation depends on the trader&rsquo;s will alone.  This would put more obligation on the consumer than the trader providing the service.  Another example would be a term that has the object or effect of requiring a consumer, who decides not to conclude or perform the contract, to pay the trader a disproportionately high sum of money in compensation for services that have not been supplied.

First, this legislation is going to create new rights for consumers, and, in particular, around remedies.  For example, the specific remedies that are now available to consumers that were not in place before will be around the whole area of digital content and services and where a service that does not comply with the requirements of the Act, the consumer will have the right to the digital content and service free of charge while the service is brought into compliance and within a reasonable time and without any significant inconvenience to the consumer.<\/p> <p>  If that right is not complied with, the consumer can go to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.  This commission has a number of powers.  It has the power, first of all, to accept a written undertaking from a trader to rectify the failure or the refusal to comply.  It can issue a compliance notice to the trader, setting out the actions to be taken and it can apply to the Circuit Court or the High Court for a declaration or an injunction regarding the failure or refusal.  Bear in mind that there are fines also for non-compliance under the Fines Act.  <\/p> <p>  Further to enforcement, we are bringing rights that consumers have not had before by way of remedies that are available to them and we are giving the CCPC the power to pursue those rights and remedies.<\/p> <p>  I did not quite understand the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the labelling of products and I am not sure if my colleague did.  I might ask the Deputy to repeat that question please.<\/p> <p>  On consent, we have all been there where there are hundreds of pages to read through, particularly in the case of signing up to social media, for example, and one is agreeing to rather than reading the hundreds of pages.  We would always say to consumers that they should be reading what they are signing up to.  As to whether we are dealing with any of this, specifically, I will ask my colleague, Ms Hanrahan, to answer that particular question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McNamara"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Good morning members.  Under the digital content directive, there is this new idea because previously data, or the provision of personal data to a trader, did not amount to consideration under contract law.  The digital content directive has introduced this because many digital services - and we know this happens with some of the larger platforms - provide this service that appears to be free but they are doing this in exchange for personal data.  Essentially, this would mean that consumers will now have a contract with these service providers and, going forward under the Act, they will have remedies should there be a problem with the contract.  Obviously, the provision of personal data, if it is just in order to provide the service to the consumer or if it is to comply with legislative requirements, is an exception under the Data Protection Act, which means that this essentially would not amount to consideration.  If the data, however, is processed beyond that by a trader - for instance, if they use a person&rsquo;s data to target that person for another product - that would be considered good consideration and a contract would have been formed once the scheme is enacted.<\/p> <p>  In this regard, an issue arose around personal data and we consulted with the Data Protection Commissioner about the right to withdraw data etc., and it is set in stone that the consumer can withdraw the right to access their data.  As to how that would work effectively, we said it would be governed by data protection law and we do not intend to wade into that side of things because we do not have the expertise required.  The best thing to do there is to refer to existing data protection law which governs what would happen in those instances.

It took a row with the phone provider to sort it out.  My argument there was that they said that she had given consideration but I made the point that she was a juvenile and legally, as such, she should not have been bound by a contract.

These discussions are on illegal online content and the Department of Justice would be involved in an interdepartmental group that is looking into that legislation.  Other legislation in that area is within the remit of the Department of Justice.  The digital unit of our Department, which is not my unit, is engaged in this.  On the further enforcement of sanctions, it is important to point out that this Bill is transposing three EU directives, two in full and most of the third one.  These were negotiated over a four-year period in Brussels.  We, that is Ireland, were very involved in those negotiations as to the enforcement, the sanctions, the rights and remedies of consumers.  <\/p> <p>  It is also important to point out that this Bill has been a long time coming but the Sales Law Review Group, for example, produced a report back in 2011 that talked about Irish consumer legislation being somewhat disjointed and difficult for consumers to navigate and understand.  As well as transposing the three EU directives here that very strongly increase consumer rights, we are consolidating existing legislation to make it easier for consumers to access, understand and have everything in one place so that it can be easily found.  We are also increasing the enforcement powers, while we are doing this.  <\/p> <p>  EU legislation can be transposed by secondary legislation in accordance with the 1972 European Communities Act or it can be transposed by primary legislation.<\/p><p>If one transposes it by secondary legislation, one has to stick to the scope of the directive rigidly and cannot go outside it.  There are some pieces of EU legislation whose scope we could not go outside because we transposed them by secondary legislation.  Since we are using primary legislation in this context, though, we can increase the rights because we can go outside the scope of the directives in a way that we were not able to in the past.<\/p><p> The Department has been considering this matter since the sales law review group's report in 2011.  We did not produce legislation to consolidate the area because we were waiting to see the outcome of the three EU directives, which ended up taking longer to negotiate than we could have anticipated.<\/p><p> I hope I have answered most of the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021101300002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McNamara","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":417,"content":"<p>That has been helpful.

All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this meeting from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  For people watching this meeting, Members of the Oireachtas and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee room or of joining the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to the constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any members participating via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making a contribution to the meeting, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If members are attending in the committee room, they are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and leave at least one seat vacant between themselves and others attending the meeting.  Attendees should also maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.<\/p> <p>  I am sorry about that.  Our time is nearly up at this stage, although we might have a few minutes left.

This speech is an annual exercise by the European Commission to lay out its stall for the next year.  It tends to be quite forward-looking and basically sets the agenda for legislation and other activities, setting the priorities for the Commission for the next year.  It was the president's second State of the Union speech and was entitled, \"Strengthening the Soul of our Union\".<\/p> <p>  She looked back a little on the Covid-19 experience.  It is difficult not to look at that because it has been such a cathartic experience for Europe and the world.  She also looked ahead and set priorities and new initiatives for the year ahead.  On the pandemic, she acknowledged the speed and magnitude of events which, initially, had been very difficult to grasp.  Europe's initial response with the vaccine roll-out was slower than expected due to production bottlenecks.  All members have seen the various toings and froings in that regard.  Nonetheless, Europe very much caught up and, indeed, was one of the best performers in the world in the roll-out of the vaccine.  Every part of Europe got the same access to lifesaving vaccines.  Big and small member states were treated the same.  If we remember the scramble for vaccines, this was not necessarily guaranteed at the outset.  If there had been a free-for-all and everybody had tried to do their own thing, it was not necessarily guaranteed.  Europe coming together ensured that, regardless of the size of the member state, equal access to the vaccines, equal distribution and so forth were very beneficial to all.  There is no room for complacency.  The pain of Covid is very much still felt, but we have reasons for confidence in the future.  Europe achieved its objective by the summer of vaccinating over 70% of adults, with Ireland, of course, in the vanguard, which is very impressive.<\/p> <p>  The EU digital certificate, which was developed and implemented in a period of three and half months, has also helped to get lives back to normal and get free movement flowing again, which is one of the fundamental benefits of EU membership.  The president underlined the need to strengthen our pandemic preparedness and announced plans for a new health authority, called HERA, who I think was a Greek goddess.  Members of the committee who know the Classics might be able to tell me more.  It is planned to get this new health authority up and running.  This new authority will address serious cross-border health threats, monitor medical countermeasures and reinforce global health emergency preparedness in case a similar situation ever arises again.<\/p> <p>  Looking beyond its borders, Europe has shared half of its vaccine production, more than 700 million doses, with the rest of the world from the outset.  Other countries kept their production for themselves, but from the outset Europe shared the production of the vaccines in the European Union.  It has also been a key supporter of COVAX, which is the global facility to procure vaccines for low and middle income countries.<\/p><p>There is still a lot to do, and global vaccination remains a big priority.  The president announced a new vaccine donation of 200 million doses by the middle of 2022 on top of the donation of 250 million doses being given this year.  She underscored the need to boost vaccine production capacity in Africa.  There are measures to set up facilities in Africa so it can produce its own vaccines.<\/p><p> On the economic and social protection front, there has been a lot of hardship over the past year.  Nevertheless, when the pandemic struck, the EU's response was quick and effective.  It is fair to say lessons have been learned from the way in which the economy was handled during the financial crisis, and I know that will be welcomed in Ireland.  The EU supported more than 31 million workers and 2.5 million companies across Europe through its SURE programme, which stands for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency.  Ireland is drawing down &euro;2.5 billion in loans under the SURE facility.  A robust rebound of the EU economy is under way, and Ireland's recent excellent growth forecasts are clearly good news in that regard.  The continued easing of virus containment measures has helped propel a higher-than-expected GDP growth.  A significant element of Europe's response has been its NextGenerationEU programme and the positive impulse provided by the recovery and resilience facility.  In an unprecedented step, the EU is borrowing from the financial markets to help lay the basis for short-term recovery and longer term growth.  Ireland's own recovery and resilience programme, which was at the heart of the visit by President von der Leyen to Ireland in July and her meeting with the Taoiseach, has a significant role to play in that regard.  There is roughly &euro;1 billion for Ireland in that facility.  Another focus of the address was digital Europe, with the president describing it as \"the make-or-break issue\".  There are now plans to develop a European chips Act which would aim to link together Europe's world-class research, design and testing capacities and to tie that in with the production of semiconductors, which, as all members will be aware, are in great shortage at the moment and are holding up a lot of production.  Looking back, we could compare this forward-looking attempt on the chips Act with the time when the Galileo satellite system was being developed a couple of decades ago.  There was a lot of scepticism and even derision as to why the EU was putting money into that, but, looking back at it today, it now provides the navigation system for more than 2 billion smartphones.  We want to try to get ahead of the curve with the semiconductors operation.  Supporting young people, particularly those who have fallen through the gaps and are not in employment, education or training, was another big theme.  Europe needs to do more.  The Commission will shortly propose to make 2022 the European year of youth and will put in place a new programme called Aim, Learn, Master, Achieve, ALMA, to help young Europeans find work experience abroad.  We are therefore not just focusing on Erasmus or higher education students; we also want to help young people in difficulty to have experience of working abroad.<\/p><p> There have been many activities in respect of the green deal over the course of the past year.  The EU has high ambitions on climate change and environmental protection, including the target of at least 55% emissions reduction by 2030.  The Fit for 55 package which, unfortunately, sounds like some kind of exercise programme but is not meant to sound like that, published in July contains a very broad and ambitious set of interconnected measures to achieve this.  We want to get that package adopted and implemented.  That is a key objective of the coming months and year.  The president underlined that the green transition must be socially just and fair, and the proposed new social climate fund is intended to tackle energy poverty and provide support to vulnerable households.  For the moment the amount earmarked for that is &euro;73 billion.  With climate change and environmental protection being issues that require a global response, the president announced a doubling of external funding for biodiversity, in particular for vulnerable economies.  She also set out plans to propose an additional &euro;4 billion for climate finance until 2027 and called for the US and other partners to work closely with Europe on this issue.<\/p><p> Turning to the global dimension, the president was clear on the EU's commitment to the Afghan people and the need to do everything to avert the risk of famine and humanitarian disaster.  Yesterday the committee may have seen that the Commission announced a &euro;1 billion support package for Afghanistan in order to avert such a humanitarian crisis.  We are already hearing stories of malnutrition and even starvation come out of Afghanistan, where there appears to be a total breakdown in the functioning of the state.  Defence was another theme of the address and one that drew some attention here in Ireland.  The president reflected on the painful events in Afghanistan and the need to reflect on how the Afghan mission could have ended so abruptly.  Co-operation with NATO is vital, and the EU is investing great efforts in this direction and working on a new EU-NATO Joint Declaration.  The president said Europe can and clearly should be able to do more.  For example, we need to provide stability in our neighbourhood.  We need to be able to tackle the evolving nature of threats - for example, cyberattacks.  To quote the president, \"You no longer need armies and missiles to cause mass damage.\".  All you need is a laptop to paralyse administrations.  We have seen this happen to some extent in Ireland with the cyberattack on hospitals earlier this year.  <\/p><p> Cybersecurity is a big part of defence.  The president set out the ambition not just to be satisfied to address the cyber threat, but also for Europe to become a leader in cybersecurity.  She called for a European cyberdefence policy which would help ensure that Europe has the capacity to develop cyberdefence tools.  She also called for legislation on common standards under a new European cyber-resilience Act.  A European defence union does not mean a European army.  It is a matter of the need to develop effective measures to respond to crisis.  It is a matter of the ability to have a common assessment of threat to gather information and anticipate attacks.  It is a matter of strengthening our resilience, overcoming capability gaps in the EU and working effectively with partners.  This will be taken forward under the next Presidency of the Council of the European Union, which is the French Presidency starting in January of next year.<\/p><p> Finally, rule of law, democracy and common values are a subject very much in the news at the moment.  On the rule of law, on which this committee has engaged productively with Commissioner Reynders, the president pointed to worrying developments in certain member states, saying that dialogue always comes first but that dialogue is not an end in itself.  There is a need for a dual approach of dialogue and decisive action.  As part of a strengthening of the Commission's rule of law reports, including for Ireland, from 2022 those reports will come with specific recommendations to member states, a bit like the European semester in the past.  In the field of fundamental rights, the Commission will also propose by the end of this year a new law to combat violence against women.  The president noted that the pandemic has been particularly terrifying for those with nowhere to hide, and action is needed from prevention to protection and effective prosecution.<\/p><p>Finally, as a means to protect those who create transparency and defend democracy, the president undertook to deliver a media freedom Act in the next year.  This is in response to some rather alarming developments in relation to journalists, even the murder of journalists, in the EU, and the need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of the press.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Ms Nolan.

Thank you for the opportunity.  I thank our guests for joining us in person today, which is a novelty that we will get used to in due course as we, hopefully, all get back to normal.<\/p> <p>  It is great to hear the summary of what was a very ambitious state of the Union address.  There is a couple of areas I will pick on and perhaps ask a few questions, based on the President of the European Commission, Dr. von der Leyen's comments and, indeed, some comments she did not make.  It was an address talking about looking forward but I want to look back initially.<\/p> <p>  Ms Nolan mentioned the pandemic response and some of the supply chain and delivery issues of vaccines at the outset.  I must state frankly that the citizens of the European Union were grossly let down by certain drugs manufacturers.  I wonder if Mr. Nolan can provide an update on what actions are ongoing or will be taken by the European Commission against those companies that let the people of Europe so badly down when they needed them most and caused quite a lot of concern and heartache, particularly in this country.  I am not an expert on the classics but the new health body is certainly an area where there is huge potential.  In our engagement in relation to the future of Europe and our discussions, particularly with the Irish MEPs, this was an area that consistently came up.  There is huge scope for the European Union as a collective to do so much more providing that connectivity.<\/p> <p>  In relation to new plans for security and defence co-operation, this is something that we in Ireland need to wake up to.  We are not immune to the threats that the European Union faces on a daily basis and we have felt them, as Ms Nolan so rightly said, in the growing threat of cyberattacks, which are merely a fact of life these days.  We need to be realistic, domestically, in terms of our investment in security and defence and on a European scale, on what our responsibilities to our European Union membership are.  That does not mean a European Union army.  It does not mean abandoning neutrality.  However, we need to be much more realistic about what is required.  It is nominally such a small part of the European budget but it is one that has so much impact.  I would dread to think that one day in the future we would say that maybe we should have engaged a little more with our neighbourhood partners or committed a little more.<\/p> <p>  In relation to one of Ms Nolan's last points on the future of the rule of law, specifically, to the current situation in Poland, personally, I was cheered by the scenes in Warsaw on Sunday night to see tens of thousands of people taking to the street in defence of common European values.  Ms Nolan might provide an update on what actions the European Commission is taking in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Two areas were not covered in the President of the European Commission's state of the Union address but I will take a liberty and raise them.  The first is in relation to eurobonds and the future of eurobonds.  One of the great achievements we should take from the pandemic is the ability of the European Union finally to come together and deliver on this mechanism that will benefit every citizen of this Union.  In the post-pandemic era, it is one of the great learnings.  How do we retain that ability and how do we use it to the best of every citizen, particularly in the more deprived and socioeconomically challenged areas?<\/p> <p>  Lastly, I refer to the current situation - it has been ever thus for the past five or six years - of the European Union's relationship with our nearest neighbour and former member, the United Kingdom.  I appreciate your indulgence on this, a Chathaoirligh.  Lord Frost's speech yesterday in Lisbon was extremely disappointing.  I look forward to Commission Vice-President, Mr. &Scaron;efovi's announcements this evening.  No doubt they will be generous and reactive to what the people of Northern Ireland want.  I would be interested to get the European Commission's take on what are the next steps.  Are we dealing with a trustworthy partner any more, and if we are not, how do we react going forward?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#E00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":456,"content":"<p>There were some very painful experiences in the course of accessing the supply of vaccines.  We were let down by one particular producer.  I would say it did not deliver as was agreed and this caused problems.  Fortunately, there were alternatives.  Indeed, the EU had spread its orders and had ordered supplies from several companies.  At least, that was able in time to make up the shortfalls that we experienced.  There are lessons that have been very much learned by the Commission in the management of that.  We will have to make sure that we have a spread of suppliers in the future and that we are not overdependent on any one particular company.  In a way, all is well that ends well to some extent.  Look where we are now.  Who would have believed it?  This time last year we did not even have a vaccine.  All in all, it was a good experience in the end but I agree with the Deputy that over-reliance on any one supplier clearly is not the way to go.  Indeed, the creation of this new Health Emergency preparedness and Response Authority, HERA, will help us have a better overview in the future and to be ready for something like this, which was a black swan moment in a way which nobody was expecting.<\/p> <p>  On security and defence co-operation, I am glad the Deputy said it is not an EU army.  It is not.  A lesson has been learned from the Afghanistan debacle where, for example, we were reliant on the United States to evacuate our citizens and we did not have the capacity to get people, or even refugees, out.  This is not new as in a way, this reflection has been going on.  Also, there was reflection about there being a lot of defence expenditure in the member states which is not necessarily linked up, using economies of scale, or being smart about what they purchase or pooling resources.  There are many issues in relation to better co-operation on defence.  This is the reflection that is going on at present.  It will look at probably issues such as crisis management, our resilience as the EU, capability development and better development of partnerships between the member states and between the EU and other parts of the world.  This is on the drawing board.  When we think of issues such as cybersecurity, that is also a question of defence.  We must further develop our cybersecurity protection against these attacks that are now happening on a daily basis across the world.  These are the kind of issues that we will look at.  As I said, this debate on a defence union will be kicked off under the French Presidency.<\/p> <p>  On eurobonds, I take note of the Deputy's comments but I do not have anything substantial to add to that today.<\/p> <p>  Let us get to the protocol.  Obviously, today is a big day for the Commission.  The Commission will unveil a package.  I was listening to RT&Eacute; radio this morning and I heard a very good summary of what is coming down the tracks from RT&Eacute;'s Brussels correspondent, who is very well informed.  The Commission Vice-President, Mr. &Scaron;efovi, came to Ireland and Northern Ireland a month ago.  He spent two days engaging with stakeholders, citizens and people on the ground from different walks of life - human rights, business, NGOs, those who benefited from PEACE funding etc.  He has taken careful note of the real problems on the ground that people are being confronted with as a result of the protocol.  The Commission is trying to find practical solutions to practical problems.  What will be announced later today will be a very far-reaching response to what the Commission Vice-President has heard and to the British command paper and will further build on a package that was already put on the table by the Commission on 30 June last, which passed without particular engagement but is there and we will build on.<\/p><p>It is intended to stretch our response to the absolute limits and try to address the problems on the ground.  We do not want to escalate the rhetoric or engage in political brinkmanship.  We want to find practical solutions to practical problems and ease any particular issues about goods moving from the UK to Northern Ireland.  That is the purpose of the four papers coming out today.  The idea is our officials will immediately travel to London and start to engage on this.  That is where we are at and we are trying to keep the noise from the sidelines out for the moment and focus on coming up with practical solutions to practical problems.<\/p><p> On the rule of law, the Commission is carefully studying the ruling from the Polish courts.  It is a serious challenge to the EU structure and the primacy of EU law.  This is what the EU is built on and there cannot be a situation in which national courts start to overrule EU law.  The arbiter of EU law is the European Court of Justice and that is a fundamental point.  We have a number of tools which we have been using over the past years for breaches of rule of law and fundamental rights.  We have the infringement procedure, the rule of law mechanism and Article 7.  We have a rule of law toolbox and we also have the recommendations that will be in the annual rule of law report.<\/p><p> We will not rashly respond at this stage.  We have seen Polish citizens coming out on the streets very much demonstrating their support for the European Union and their belief in it.  This is heartening for us all.  We want to see how we can engage with and deal with this, but I do not have much more to bring to the table on this issue because we are studying this ruling from the Polish courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":458,"content":"<p>The committee is taking a keen interest in that ongoing issue.

He has engaged with this committee and is willing to engage with us again.  I also acknowledge the work of Ms Nolan and her team.  They do not get thanked enough, especially in the past number of years, when it has been pretty clear they have been fighting and elbowing our interests.  We should acknowledge that and I thank her and her team for doing so.<\/p> <p>  I note Ms Nolan's phrase that the Commission will stretch its response to the limit.  I suggest that all of us will have our patience stretched to the limit in the coming days.  I agree with Miss Nolan on not commenting much.  What timeline does she anticipate for this issue as it begins to come to a head?<\/p> <p>  Miss Nolan mentioned what the EU is built on.  It strikes me that many of the principles on which the EU is built are being undermined, not just by member states but by geopolitical trends, inadequate response to crises and a shift away from the values on which the Union was built, namely, solidarity and a commitment to peace and individual and human rights.<\/p> <p>  Ms Nolan mentioned there is a toolbox available but it needs to be used rationally.  This drift has been under way for some time.  We all looked askance at the US in 2016 but when it was happening here, not just in Poland but in other member states such as Hungary, we were shrugging our shoulders and the Commission was slow to respond, especially in the case of Hungary.  That may have emboldened those in Poland and other countries to go the road they are going.  I am absolutely with Ms Nolan in her view that the Commission wants to respond rationally but at some stage we have to open the toolbox and use the tools, rather than having it gather dust.  If we continue to soft-soap the response to this, it will worsen.  Yes, there were millions of Poles on the streets at the weekend, but that was people-led.  That was led by communities and people throughout Poland, not by politics.  The Commission needs to be far stronger in defending the principles of the European Union and not allowing member states to go as far as some are going.  <\/p> <p>  The ambition for the European Green Deal is very high.  We have to collectively support it get behind it, but what about those communities feeling left behind, especially fishing and agriculture?  Our fishing community would not recognise the current European Green Deal and what is being done to them as socially just or fair.  How do we ensure those communities get buy-in to the programmes and resources Ms Nolan indicated are being made available?  There is a sense of a disconnect between these communities and the negotiation as to how those resources are delivered to and within member states.  There is a sense that the interests of these communities are not being reflected.  The Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries visited some of the communities a number of weeks ago, but there is a serious disconnect, especially in our fishing communities and very much growing in our agricultural communities, from many of the aspirations of the European Green Deal.  I will leave that with Ms Nolan and thank her for her time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#F00300","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":460,"content":"<p>The Deputy referred to an inadequate response.  The Commission has been doing its best.

All of those cases are very sensitive and delicate and take a long time to prepare, but they are extremely important because we are defending important principles.  There have also been Article 7 proceedings, as the Deputy probably knows, but Article 7 requires unanimity of the member states and we do not have that when it comes to these situations.  There have been several processes and attempts to rein in the excesses but, so far, it has been more piecemeal than we would have liked, but we are using everything we can.<\/p> <p>  We also have this rule of law mechanism since last December where EU funding can also come into play.  If there is a breakdown of rule of law or a situation where we are not happy that EU funds can be managed in the correct way, EU funding can be stopped.  As I said, there is a toolbox and I do not want to pre-empt what the Commission will do because it is studying the situation.  There will be a comprehensive response in time to this challenge to the supremacy of EU law.<\/p><p> On the green deal, it is correct that there may be winners and losers to some extent, but several funds are being put in place to help to alleviate some of the negative effects on certain groups.  First and foremost is the Brexit adjustment fund, whereby Ireland will get the lion's share among member states.  Some of the funding is to go to fishing communities that have suffered quota cuts as a result of the Brexit deal, for example.  We will also have a climate adjustment fund, which is also supposed to help with the adjustment to climate change.  It is to help people with retrofitting, for example.  It will help those in energy poverty or those suffering from some of the side-effects of going green.  The social climate fund will have around &euro;72 billion.  It is to help citizens to finance investments in energy efficiency, new heating systems and cleaner transport.  There is also the just transition mechanism, which is run by the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy, DG REGIO, which will provide targeted support to regions and sectors most affected by the transition towards the green economy.<\/p><p> We have anticipated that the adjustments will be painful in certain areas and for certain sectors.  I have referred to at least three different sources of funding that are supposed to alleviate the negative aspects of adjustment to the green agenda.  On the farming side, the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, is still one of the biggest funds we manage at EU level.  The policy will still exist.  It will be greener in the future but support for farmers is still part and parcel of what the EU does and is about.  Combined with the other funds, we should be able to shore up and support the sectors mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Nolan and Mr. Claridge.  The first issue I wanted to bring up has been dealt with to a degree.  It relates to the current difficulties concerning the Irish protocol.  I welcome what was said in that it follows on from what we have heard from Vice-President &Scaron;efovi on engaging with those who are seeking to provide solutions.  We have from the British Government, and particularly Mr. David Frost, what can, at best, be described as noise.  Very soon, we will see the colour of the British Government's money and whether it is serious or play-acting.  I welcome the fact that the relevant officials are ready to go if there is an element of good faith on the British side.  None of this is helped by the fact that there has been an element of political unionism painting itself into a corner, but I hope we can get beyond that.  The fact is that there seems to be a large number of people who just want solutions to their day-to-day problems, particularly in the North.<\/p> <p>  Has the Commission had any engagement on difficulties concerning An Post?  I am referring to the change concerning customs requirements on 1 July.  I get that the problem is partly because smaller suppliers in Britain just have not prepared for Brexit in the same way as similar companies here.  There seems to be an issue.  Any pressure that can be brought to bear to bring about a solution will be helpful.  There will be stockpiling and delays, and we are in the run-up to Christmas.  I know it is a poxy line, but the Santa Claus supply chain could be impacted by this.  Everything that can be done to mitigate the problem should be done.<\/p> <p>  On the vaccine roll-out, the Commission engaged and delivered what was a solution across every state.  Had we done what was done in other states, things would have been far worse.  There may have been na&iuml;vet&eacute; regarding some of the dealings with particular companies.  There was probably an element of the European Commission and European Union dealing with something they did not necessarily have competence in.  It shows that, in the future, we do not necessarily need constitutional change regarding delivery; we just need to be able to set out targets that states can buy into when it can be seen that the European Union and Commission can benefit all of us.<\/p> <p>  My next question is broader.  At one stage, there was serious over-and-back over the fact that none of us is safe until all of us are safe.  People talked about the TRIPS waiver and said there is no need for it and that it is a cul-de-sac.  I am not ideologically wedded to anything but I wonder where the delegates believe matters stand as regards global capacity for production and delivery.  These are what matter.  That is accepting that as we try to deliver to the developing world, there will be difficulties if there is no proper health infrastructure.  My fear over COVAX is that it is aiming to deal with, say, only 20% of the population in some of the areas.  What is the scope of HERA?<\/p> <p>  It is important that lessons be learned.  We will have to maintain an element of consistent and constant review, particularly when talking about a stimulus programme.  It really has to be targeted.<\/p> <p>  On the European chips Act, we all get the difficulty regarding semiconductors.  Could the delegates go into a little detail on how the European Commission believes it can enter the fray and make a difference concerning what is a serious supply chain problem in the sense that production was overtaken by other elements of the IT sector?  There was a need for more computers, devices and whatever due to remote working.  There was no car production for part of the time.  Now we have a difficulty.<\/p> <p>  The social climate fund amounts to &euro;72 billion.  What can be drawn down?  Could the witnesses give some detail on this?  I get that they could spend a whole hour answering every question I ask.<\/p> <p>  On defence, I must add the caveat that we all accept that there needs to be engagement; we cannot put our heads in the sand.  If we are talking about Afghanistan, however, we should call the situation what it is.  To a degree, it is a misadventure in respect of which the US would have been better reading a couple of history books rather than watching reruns of \"Rambo III\".  Trillions were spent to end up back almost at the starting point.  We do not really need the European Commission and European Union to become part of that.  What exactly do the witnesses foresee in respect of the EU&ndash;NATO joint declaration, which would frighten me somewhat?<\/p> <p>  I agree wholeheartedly that we need to consider cyberdefence.  The ransomware attack on the HSE proved that to everybody.<\/p><p>To meet that threat, we will need the capacity we have as a group rather than as individuals.  We need a capacity to disrupt the attacks, which, to some degree, requires offensive abilities.  However, I do not like the idea that cyberdefence would be included with regular defence.  As I said, I have concerns regarding a European defence union.<\/p><p> I agree with everything that has been said about the rule of law.  As much as dialogue always must come first, it is a question of what leverages we have in the toolbox.  There have been difficulties from time to time in trying to link moneys and budgets with ensuring due diligence in terms of the rule of law.  We all agree that breaches have occurred in Hungary and Poland, but in the case of the Spain, for example, notwithstanding that we get into constitutional questions, there are not many people who could say that the Spanish Government dealt fairly with some of its Catalonian elected representatives.  I suspect there is a feeling across Europe that, sometimes, the rule of law impacts on them but does not impact on some of the original funders of the EU or those who came into the family at an earlier stage.<\/p><p> We all accept the necessity of a media freedom Act to ensure the primacy and freedom of the media.  The Facebook whistleblower situation was in the news last week, with the allegation of antagonism and pursuing a \"hate sells\" approach.  That did not come as any shock to us but it is something we collectively need to deal with as we look to the future.  Sometimes it is easier to deal with issues on a European level rather that at the level of individual states.  We are talking about going toe to toe with some very serious companies but it is something that has to be done.  Whatever about the idea that hate sells, we have a wider issue in that what also sells is the really negative stuff, particularly, for instance, in regard to eating disorders.  There was an allegation that Facebook was aware of the damage that was being done to people's mental health but, because that sort of messaging was selling and there was profit in it, action was not taken.  The company would say that is not true of course, but we need to ensure there are protections in that regard.<\/p><p> If Ms Nolan can answer all of those questions in the next few minutes, I would be delighted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#G00200","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>Before I do, I will address a question I missed from the previous speaker on the next steps in regard to the Northern Ireland protocol.

That will be the start, we hope and expect, of a period of intense discussions with the UK Government over the coming weeks.  The idea is to move immediately on the package we are producing today.  To be clear about the timescale, there is no long wait involved here; we are moving as fast as we possibly can.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s question about vaccines, the EU, as I have said, has been falsely accused of not being in favour of vaccines for the world.  On the contrary, we have been the most generous in terms of giving vaccines to other parts of the word.  We are also trying to develop, with the United States, the technology for the development of vaccines in Africa, for instance, so that the manufacturing capacity is there and, in time, the continent will be able to produce its own vaccines.

There are a number of related issues.

As we know, Ireland has donated more than 1 million vaccines, which is commendable and worth noting.  The TRIPS waiver was also mentioned.  It sounds like it is not going anywhere.  Perhaps it is very difficult to open it up to developing countries and give them the patents for the vaccines.  Will Ms Nolan give us an update on this?

If it is okay, I would like to go back to the Brexit issue and the protocol.  I fully appreciate there are sensitivities and Ms Nolan needs to be cautious in the answers she gives.  I want to ask a question on the potential threat of the triggering of Article 16.  It gets discussed quite a lot, as though it is open to be used at any time for any reason when, obviously, it is not.  I am sure Ms Nolan will agree quite a high bar has to be reached to trigger Article 16.  There has to be a significant impact on society or an economic impact.  Ironically, given that the issue now seems to be around the European Court of Justice, even though it was not an issue before now, ultimately that court is the final arbiter of anything to do with the withdrawal agreement and the protocol.  What is the position if the UK triggers Article 16 and the European Union disagrees that the bar has been met to trigger it?  What happens at that point?  Is there a process to decide whether the EU proceed with the Article 16 procedure?  Is there something else that can happen at that point?  It is unusual that the very issue that seems to be the crux in the UK side is the European Court of Justice and ultimately that court will decide.<\/p><p>Where do we go from there on that front?  On a separate topic, Ms Nolan's introduction on the state of the Union address was very good and very comprehensive.  I am particularly interested in the Aim, Learn, Master, Achieve, ALMA, programme.  This extension of opportunities for young people to work abroad in the European Union is long overdue.  It important to have more than just Erasmus because not everybody wants to go to college or university and we should broaden those opportunities out.  Does Ms Nolan have any further details on the ALMA programme?  When might it start?  When can we start informing young people here that they can apply?  How might it work?  How does she see the reciprocal arrangements here in Ireland operating?  How will we cater for students coming from other member states?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#J01200","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I have tried not to get too drawn into the UK's threats and the sword of Damocles that is Article 16.  From our perspective, invoking Article 16 would not solve any of the challenges people and businesses in Northern Ireland are experiencing due to Brexit.  On the contrary, it would only add to the uncertainty.  It would probably further complicate the process of finding solutions.  If the UK Government's concerns are more about sovereignty and domestic policies than the actual problems on the ground in Northern Ireland, it may indeed decide to trigger Article 16.  If it does so, we will at least feel that we have done everything to avoid that situation.  We would then have to look at deploying parts of our own legal toolbox under the withdrawal agreement and the trade and co-operation agreement in response.  What are those measures?  One is arbitration to challenge such measures.  The next is to move to an infringement procedure which was launched in March but then put on ice.  We could also launch a series of new infringement procedures on, for example, chilled meats and other areas in which the protocol has been breached.  We can use measures under the trade and co-operation agreement as well.  We do not want a confrontation.  We do not want to enter such a phase but we have to prepare for that case arising.  That is where we stand on that.<\/p> <p>  On the European Court of Justice, I do not want to use the term \"red lines\" because everybody is talking about red lines, but that is a clear red line.

I will not go back over the same ground but I have a few comments and one or two questions.<\/p> <p>  When Deputy Calleary spoke about Poland he said that, in his view, the Commission needs to be stronger.  I sat listening to debate in the European Parliament for many years.  Those on the extreme left were saying that we were not doing nearly enough and those on the extreme right were defending certain states.  It is a double-edged sword because, as soon as the Commission acts decisively, it is seen as the European elites acting.  It is a really difficult issue.  Perhaps the Commission is, to some extent, waiting for a change of government in certain member states because that often changes the dialogue.  Despite people's frustration and deeply held beliefs that the Commission should act and that it is not good enough that it is not doing so - and we can all say that - there is another aspect to it.  I can see why the Commission acts in the way it does.  <\/p> <p>  I have one small question.  I do not want to throw an incendiary device in here but there was a ruling from a German court some time back which showed certain similarities to the ruling of the Polish courts.  I do not know the details but this is an example of why we sometimes have to stand back.<\/p> <p>  In the state of the Union address, the Commission President spoke about social fairness and a European care strategy.  Ms Nolan has already answered a question on the ALMA programme.  I would like to hear anything she has to say on that care strategy.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the protocol at length.  All I can say is that the EU has demonstrated extreme patience and that I hope it continues to do so.  My personal view is that there are those who simply want to try to force the European Commission to introduce some kind of land border on the island of Ireland.  For many, that is the outcome they want to see.  In that context, the stance and the patience of the Commission has been really important.  I expect that will continue.<\/p> <p>  There has been some discussion on the European Green Deal, just transition and how people feel it is not working for them.  I heard Ms Nolan mention the CAP and I believe we have a real problem here.  The CAP is meant to support the production of quality, traceable food.  It must comply with a whole ever-increasing raft of European legislation on everything from veterinary matters to soil, the environment and animal welfare.  That is fine but, with the new CAP, 25% of Pillar 1 money is dedicated to eco-schemes.  Farmers have to do more to get that part of the money.  The issue here is that year on year and CAP on CAP, the requirements on primary producers are constantly increasing.<\/p><p>Yet they have to sell in world markets, certainly in the European market.  We now have the issue of carbon tax, a greater cost to access Pillar 1 money and the threat to the national herd.  For farmers today, it is okay to hear about the social climate fund but what is that?  How does it impact farmers and what they do?  We have a massive job to do on this issue.  Last Thursday night, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, was in Carrigallen in south Leitrim.  I sat for three hours in a mart and listened to what farmers were saying.  There is a sense that they are seen as the problem and there is no proper dialogue on how they can be part of the solution.  There is talk of further requirements, cutting the herd and carbon tax.  I understand there has to be change but if people feel outside of that, as they do, then we have a huge job to do there.  Farmers in general tend to be quite pro-EU in their views and I would not like to see that changing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#K00400","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I know she has in her long experience of the European Parliament seen many attempts on the rule of law and how difficult it is to build a consensus around that issue.  On the care strategy, this is a new announcement in the state of the Union address.  It is being drawn up.  I do not have any details but as soon as I have I am happy to share them with Deputy Harkin.<\/p> <p>  On the protocol, the EU has stood firmly with its principles in terms of supporting no border on the island of Ireland and respecting the Good Friday Agreement and other objectives of the peace process.  We will continue to do that.  That is the number one issue here.  We have not caused this problem.  It has been caused by the extreme version of Brexit that was chosen by the UK Government.  That is why we needed the protocol, which is the solution and not the problem.<\/p> <p>  On the green deal, I do not disagree with anything the Deputy said.  It will be hard on certain groups in society.  Ireland has a lot of ground to make up, in terms of not taking green measures earlier.  It will be a difficult transition across the EU for different sectors, such as coal in Poland and so on.  There are different issues in different states in relation to the green deal but we are trying to save the planet.  That is the bottom line and we all have to make our efforts.  I take the Deputy's point that we need to engage more with the farming community on these issues and reach out to explain the direction we are going with the green deal but the bottom line is that much of the pollution in Ireland comes from transport and agriculture.  These are areas where we have to reduce the carbon footprint.  I do not think we can get away from that but I agree it needs to be done in a way that people feel included and listened to in the difficult adjustment process ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021101300002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I am not all that satisfied with that response.  It is not that anything Ms Nolan said was untrue but we have sustainable production here, grass-fed beef production etc.  It is unusual at a farmers' meeting to hear people talking about data centres and aviation but they were.  When it is said that \"We're in it together\", the question, which I do not ask Ms Nolan to answer, is \"Who is this we?\"  Let us see who they are and what they are contributing.  It is not so much that we have to tell farmers the direction we are going; it is a question of involving and bringing people with you.

Her intervention on that issue no doubt has a lot of support in rural parts of the country, not just in one sector of farming but across the board.  I thank members for their questions, observations and input and thank Ms Nolan and Mr. Claridge for their participation.  There is so much going on.  We are all waiting with bated breath for what will come out this evening in relation to the Northern Ireland protocol, which is something in which this committee takes a keen interest.  We are following that closely and we are also being proactive, meeting up with Vice-President &Scaron;efovi in early December in Brussels.  A date has been secured and we will work a programme around that.  Any guidance or signposting the witnesses can give us for that trip would be most helpful.  It is a very comprehensive programme and the clerk has been working on that already.<\/p> <p>  The state of the Union address by Ursula von der Leyen focused a lot on health.  We had a successful programme in the end with vaccination.  There were initial concerns around the distribution of vaccines but that co-operation was positive.  It is not new because the European mobility directive for health has been an important foundation for such co-operation.  We can look at other ways to be proactive and creative in breaking down borders in terms of healthcare.  This committee is keeping a close eye on the future of Europe.  We are focused on what is going on in Poland and are looking at those areas specifically.<\/p> <p>  It was good to see the Commissioner in Killybegs recently.  Ms Nolan attended and would have picked up on a lot of frustration in the fishing industry.  She would have been struck by the heightened level of frustration.  It is a contradiction because while rules and regulations are controlled by our Government, they are often introduced against a backdrop of what the Commission says and proposes.  A fundamental of the European project and the big principle of interest to many on this committee is the principle of subsidiarity.  What more subsidiarity could one get than part-time farmers in south Donegal who will do part-time work in Killybegs for fishing vessels landing with mackerel?  Because of the rules, in the last few days many of these boats are landing outside the EU.  They are not landing in Killybegs and all that work is lost.  If we are looking to build communities at a local level, we need to grapple with the tension that is there, where the fishing industry feels its Government is not representing it and the administrators or people involved at an official level in Government are constantly quoting stuff coming from the Commission.<\/p><p>The rules that are in place are not workable for the fishing industry.  Everything has to be done properly and people will point to this not being done in the past.  The fishermen I deal with and the fishing vessel owners want to work within the rules but they have to work within something that is practicable and workable.  I just wanted to mention that point and I am not expecting any feedback on it.  I acknowledge the fact the Commissioner was in Killybegs in County Donegal because it is important for him to see and hear where the real tensions are.  If any guidance or direction can be provided on that front, we would be open to hearing that.  <\/p><p> Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe agus gu&iacute;m gach rath orthu.

I have the pleasure to introduce this motion, which has been referred by the D&aacute;il to this committee, on the approval of the EU-Singapore Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.  Deepening our engagement and our presence in the Asia Pacific region is a key strategic goal for the Government.  Our dedicated Asia Pacific strategy to 2025 sets the framework for growing our economic and people-to-people relationships in the region.  Agreements between the EU and Asian partners, such as this partnership and co-operation agreement with Singapore, are an important part of that ambition.<\/p> <p>  Recognising the increasing political and economic importance of south-east Asia, Ireland has opened three new embassies in the region in recent years in Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila.  In this broader context, Singapore is an influential voice within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, region and an important partner to Ireland and the EU.  Like Ireland, Singapore is a small and exceptionally open economy, which relies on the rules-based global trading system.  It has successfully positioned itself as the gateway to south-east Asia and as an attractive location for foreign direct investment in the region.  It is an important base for Irish companies and our State agencies operating in this dynamic and opportunity-filled region.<\/p> <p>  The EU-Singapore Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is an important framework agreement to further strengthen co-operation and dialogue across a broad range of bilateral, regional and multilateral issues.  This includes many priorities for Ireland in the region, such as health, climate change, energy, education, science and technology and transport.  The EU has also has recently upgraded its relationship with the ASEAN region to a strategic partnership.  In economic terms, Singapore is a major centre for finance in the region and is also a major trading partner and priority market for Ireland and Irish businesses in the Asia Pacific region.  Trade in goods and services with Ireland in the region in 2019 was more than &euro;10 billion.<\/p> <p>  Despite disruptions resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, trade in goods between Ireland and Singapore rose by a quarter during 2020, highlighting the benefits of the existing free trade agreement, which creates jobs here.  The partnership and co-operation agreement before the committee will facilitate further opportunities for Irish companies in areas such as energy, aviation and education.  In Singapore, our embassy and officials operate alongside Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, and IDA Ireland.  With this strong team Ireland presence, I am optimistic we will see continued growth in our relationship in the coming period.

The Minister of State might comment on that if he can.  In a recent election, one party took 83 out of 93 seats.

Maybe when we are discussing the possibilities in agreements that are not yet ratified we should look at what has happened in previous agreements but that is a separate issue and I will get the Deputy an exact answer on that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanton is correct to raise the human rights issues and they are of concern to us.  He also mentioned Singapore's Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, which is a concern.  Human rights issues are taken into account and this particular partnership agreement gives us a platform to engage with and influence Singapore on these issues.

This year, France celebrated the 40th anniversary of abolishing the death penalty and it is approximately 20 years since Ireland officially abolished the death penalty but there are many countries with whom we trade that have a death penalty, and there are some famous examples.

I know that it does not influence the laws of Singapore as such but it gives us a direct platform so we can sit around the table and discuss these issues with Singapore.<\/p> <p>  The question that we have is: does we simply ignore these issues or try through trade agreements to improve the situation?  Trade agreements have a benefit in terms of employment and have a practical influence on the ground.  However, if we stopped trading with every country that we have human rights concerns about, trade would reduce dramatically.  The EU tries to apply its values-based trade approach to the global world.  We must try spread our influence in terms of the values that we hold dear, such as democracy, human rights, etc. through trade and, in many cases, that can be tied into agreements.  In this case, we feel that our influence will be stronger because of this agreement.

I give that as one example of where we said \"No\".  In addition, one could not discuss those issues and it was time to go.  We hope to have agreements with Malaysia and Thailand as well.  The agreement with the Philippines is a good example.  The agreement was signed in 2011 and entered into force in 2018.  It has allowed for the creation of specialised subcommittees, which are similar to the EU-UK specialised committees and subcommittees.  The agreement has allowed for both sides to be represented in terms of the following: development co-operation, trade, investment and economic co-operation, good governance and the rule of law, and human rights.  The agreements give the EU an opportunity to influence countries.<\/p> <p>  We need trade for our own economic prosperity but, quite frankly, we need to ensure less developed countries trade, and I emphasise that Singapore is a well developed country.  Agreements help trade to flow and that, in turn, brings wealth to other parts of the world thus greatly benefiting the lives of people.  Part of the global migration problem is due to reduced economic benefits.  One of the ways to reduce migratory pressures is to help economies to grow in parts of the world that are developing, which is one of the benefits of trade agreements.  All of the areas I listed are dealt with in the trade agreement with the Philippines.<\/p> <p>  As my official, Mr. Boucher, has reminded me, the Philippines has agreed a moratorium on the death penalty in this presidential term.

I will not read my statement, which I forwarded to the committee earlier in the week.  I would make one or two fundamental points.  As far back as 2006, I was commissioned along with one of my colleagues, Dr. Raj Chari, to investigate the possibility of the Irish State putting in place regulations on lobbying, which over a decade later led to the Regulation of Lobbying Act under the last of the Fine Gael-Labour Governments.  The implementation of that Act was seismic with respect to what it was trying to do, which was to make sure the architecture around probity in public life was strengthened.  If we take that alongside the Ombudsman legislation and the Freedom of Information Act, the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015, which covers pretty much the whole spectrum, it was a signal step forward for the Irish State, as I said in my statement.<br\/><br\/>It was worth mentioning that because we have had two general elections since that Act was implemented.  Many of the members of this committee of this committee would have changed since 2015.  We in the Irish State find ourselves part of a much wider arsenal of democracies, which have lobbying regulations. When I started out it was only the United States, Canada, the European Parliament and Germany, which had regulations, some of which were basically not worth the paper they were written on.  The 2015 Act made a substantial difference to public life in Ireland, but it is not perfect.  The regulator will speak later about difficulties she has had.  I am of the view, as I said in my statement, that the 2020 supplemental Act, should be enacted in its entirety.  I do not see any plausible reason for the State to resist the recommendations put forward by Deputy Pearse Doherty and Mair&eacute;ad Farrell.  More openness, accountability and transparency are better.  As I said in my statement, the Irish State for too long operated covertly and in secrecy.  It did not need to tell its citizens what it was doing in their names.  I do not have to go through the examples and I deliberately did not do that in my statement.  We know of public policy decisions taken in private which have spectacularly backfired on this State.  I wrote a phrase the regulator uses on her website, namely, lobbying is about the public knowing &quot;who is lobbying whom about what&quot;.  That goes to the heart of it.  This new Bill is important in that it strengthens the legislation with its additions in terms of that principle.  <br\/><br\/>Regarding the cooling-off period which is a fundamental part of the Bill, I heard Deputy Doherty when he first mooted the idea of this new Bill speaking of extending that period from one year to two years.  It was supposed to be two years in the Regulation of Lobbying Bill, but when the Bill became an Act, that period was reduced to one year.  Internationally, two years is the minimum.<b><\/b><\/p><p>I have written two books about the regulation of lobbying and I have spent too long thinking about it and all the evidence points to a two-year minimum because of the revolving door.  The regulator herself made this point in her last report and we saw it with a former Minister of State seeking legal advice before going to the regulator over a year ago.  He then took up a position where he would have been a lobbyist for that group.  That is just too short of a cooling-off period.  The idea of a cooling-off period from the Oireachtas is that we do not have the perception that insiders are trading on access and in that context I am in favour of all the regulations.<\/p><p> There has been a lot of discussion about section 22 and it beggared belief when I read it the first time.  Failure to comply with the section which dealt with the issue was not considered to be a relevant contravention of the Act.  That was odd and I could not understand why the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform resisted that in the first place.  I would strongly encourage that to happen.  Regulators need teeth and Bills and Acts need teeth.  There need to be sanctions for not obeying the law and in that context I am strongly in favour of all the proposals put forward in the Act.  I am happy to answer any questions later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Gary Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to share my observations on this Bill on behalf of Transparency International Ireland.  I should start by briefly explaining what interest we have in this issue, before moving on to some preliminary observations on the Bill and some broader recommendations that might further strengthen the Act and its implementation and operation.<br\/><br\/>In 2009, Transparency International Ireland identified the regulation of lobbying as one of six key recommendations aimed at preventing corruption arising from our first national integrity systems study.  Since then, we have undertaken research and produced three publications on the topic, including an overview of voluntary lobbying standards and practice among public relations firms in Europe, and we published Responsible Lobbying: A Short Guide to Ethical Lobbying and Public Policy Engagement for Professionals, Executives and Activists.<br\/><br\/>Earlier this year, we looked at the disclosure practices of 30 of Ireland&rsquo;s top companies across a range of indicators including responsible political engagement and found some companies showing leadership on this issue.  However, it is important to note that most companies did not disclose a policy on responsible lobbying or political engagement and the highest score achieved on this dimension was 57%.  Moreover, 28 out of 30 companies did not publish rules or policies dealing with revolving doors, namely the movement of staff from the public sector to companies or vice versa.<br\/><br\/>It would be churlish to not acknowledge some of the progress made since we began work on this issue.  The 2015 Act in particular has regularised the practice, setting boundaries and standards of conduct that were not always clear.  In doing so, it has raised public expectations of both lobbyists and policy-makers and I would speculate that the term &quot;lobbyist&quot; carries a degree more respectability than was the case before the Act was passed.  Nonetheless, the Standards in Public Office Commission has recommended reforms, which have yet to be adopted, and a small number of cases appear to have undermined the reputation of the profession since 2015, both of which appear to have influenced the publication of this Bill.  The only cases that I am aware of that stirred public controversy surrounded the movement of former senior advisers or public officials to roles in public relations firms or in business associations.  I am unaware of any more serious compliance failures or offences committed since then.  It is welcome therefore to see a provision in the Bill for an extension of the cooling-off period for officeholders moving to the private sector from one to two years.  We also welcome the proposed requirement for a designated public official, DPO, to cease communicating with a lobbyist where he or she is aware that the person or body carrying on lobbying activities has failed to comply with the Act.<br\/><br\/>We agree with the sponsors of this Bill that the most effective way of encouraging compliance would be to deny those who refuse to comply with the Act the opportunity to lobby public officials, and in the same way to penalise those companies that hire public officials in contravention of statutory cooling-off periods.  While the broad approach may be sound, we might suggest a small number of technical amendments that could avoid any potential confusion or unforeseen consequences which I am happy to address after these remarks.  In addition, we would recommend providing the Commission with the power to impose financial penalties on those persons, including DPOs, who fail to follow a direction from the Commission to comply with the Act.<br\/><br\/>I should draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to what we see as the primary goals of lobbying regulation.  The first is to prevent trade in influence; the use of personal connections or intermediaries to secretly influence policy.  The second is to improve the quality of public policy by allowing the public and policy-makers full sight of the information used to influence that policy and to determine whether the policy is in the public interest.  If the Act is to meet its first purpose, there should be a requirement to disclose not just the source but the amounts of funding received or fees charged by lobbyists with the lobbying regulator.  This would allow enforcement agencies, including the Commission and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to evaluate information that could assist with any future investigation into allegations of breaches of the Act or attempts to trade in influence, an offence created with the passage of the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018.  Without a disclosure requirement it is difficult to know who has paid what to an intermediary or whether he or she has done so lawfully, and it is equally difficult to determine whether anyone has sought to illegally influence policy.  Such a requirement has been instrumental in detecting corruption or trade in influence in other jurisdictions.<br\/><br\/>The second purpose could be fulfilled without requiring an amendment to the Act.  Instead, the online register could allow for much easier download and third-party analysis of data stored on the register.  It could allow for lobbyists to voluntarily upload information or to provide live external links to those documents.  It could also provide links to legislation moving through the Oireachtas or relevant information held by public bodies, such as rezoning decisions, on the website.  This would make it easier for the public to access information shared with policy-makers in the course of lobbying.  It would also help reduce the volume of freedom of information, FOI, requests and encourage others to be more open about their lobbying activities.  It could also provide for a comprehensive and accessible legislative footprint that could simultaneously make the most of existing digital platforms and help make the legislative process more open and accountable.

The Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill 2020, which is sponsored by Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and I was introduced by Sinn F&eacute;in to strengthen the lobbying regulations and close that revolving door between vested interests and Government.  The witnesses sum up what is important in transparency where lobbying takes place.  The interests of workers and families should be at the heart of Government and for too long we have had insiders and those with power and money able to influence Government decisions without public knowledge of same.  That can have a corrosive effect on ordinary workers and families as they come out as the losers.  This is an attempt to change that, to shed some light on areas where it has not been shed in the past and to strengthen the legislation that is in place.<\/p> <p>  I want to begin my asking Mr. Devitt a number of questions.<\/p><p>The legislation before us sponsored by Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and I basically comes from standards in public office in the main.  There are some additions to that but these are all recommendations, some of which go back as far as 2016 or 2019 to which the Department has responded on a number of occasions.

I also speak as a registered lobbyist.  I have found that generally speaking, the Bill is relatively easy to comply with for want of a better phrase.  The information provided there is relatively comprehensive.  If the Deputy has to ask me about any specific technical details related to this Bill, I might suggest that the wording in section 4 be tweaked to specify that where a lobbyist is failing to comply with the Act under proposed section 16(A)(1) that the DPO is required to cease any further communication.  The current wording mentions \"where a Designated Public Official is aware that a person or body carrying on lobbying activities has failed to comply with the registration of lobbying activities\".  I suggest that this wording be amended to \"is failing to comply with the Act\", such that those who employ a retired public official who is not in compliance with cooling-off periods is also captured by this section.  Therefore, in essence, changing the tense from the present perfect to the present continuous would make it easier for the commission to enforce and would also afford the lobbyist an opportunity to comply with the Act.  A minor contravention might be a failure to file a return on time.  If a lobbyist refuses or declines to file a return, he or she will be considered to be in material breach of the Act and I would imagine that it would be relatively easy to determine that he or she is not in compliance with that particular provision.  It would also mean that the failure to comply is an objective rather than a subjective test and that it is not open-ended.  This would also deal with proposed section 16(A)(4) in respect of where a body has been guilty of a contravention.  I suggest changing the wording of this to \"is in contravention\".<\/p> <p>  Guidance might be needed for the commission on determining the duration of the cessation.  We would advise against leaving that open to any potential arbitrary decision making such that the commission has clear guidance on the length of time that the person is precluded from lobbying.  I would imagine that statutory guidance or a statutory instrument may be required to help interpret certain provisions of this Bill unless they are provided for in primary legislation but, again, I am happy to come back to the Deputy on this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Devitt"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

However, we have seen how a former senior Minister discussed an issue that came under his responsibility with a lobbyist and said it was a personal view.  That cannot happen in a proper democracy where the Minister has responsibility for the issue in question.  I cannot see how one can have private views regarding something one is in charge of publicly.  That is what I was getting at in respect of the idea that some people have not quite got their heads around the regulatory framework.  This is not extraordinarily onerous.  The 2015 Act was not extraordinarily onerous.  Mr. Devitt spoke about the possibility of finance being included - in other words, how much was spent on lobbying.  That does not exist but it exists in other states.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the question about the cooling-off period, I visited the state of Washington 15 years ago.  The cooling-off period there was five years.  I gave a presentation to PRII where I mentioned this.  You can imagine that the faces were aghast.  That is a very long time - probably too long.  A year is too short.  I think two years is reasonable.  The whole idea is to stop those who implement policy going back as lobbyists within a very short period of time to those implementing the policy.<\/p><p>That is why one year is simply too short.  If it was anything over two years, issues could potentially arise with regard to individuals trying to make a living.  As we know, there is a constitutional requirement in that regard.  I believe two years is reasonable.  Some of the states in the United States got into difficulties with the period being simply too long.  Five years is an extraordinary amount of time.  To the Deputy's final question, it is my view that the more information that is given to the regulator and ultimately the public by those who lobby, the better.  I include text messages in that.  That is where I stand.  It goes to the heart of the principle.  I do not believe any democrat or elected representative could have difficulty with the idea of those who act for the public having to be open to the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Gary Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I thank the guests for coming before the committee this afternoon.

I will ask Professor Murphy one question in that regard.  The commission has indicated that one of the things it would like to see captured in legislation is lobbying by unpaid officeholders, directors of businesses and advocacy groups.  In his opening statement, Professor Murphy spoke about the unusual localism of Irish politics.  Would he be concerned about changing the manner in which politics operates if unpaid advocacy groups were required to register engagements with elected officials for the purposes of achieving their objectives?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#E00200","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":560,"content":"<p>No.  I wrote that phrase very carefully.  I have been teaching about the localism of Irish politics for a long time.  Nobody working on the regulation of lobbying is trying to stop people going to elected representatives' clinics to make representations.  That is not what this is about at all and it was not the case in 2015 either.  I am in favour of voluntary lobbyists registering and allowing people the opportunity to see what they are lobbying for because it all goes to the heart of public policy.  If we start drawing distinctions as to whose lobbying counts and must be registered and made public and whose does not, there is the potential for a slippery slope that would allow people to say they did not realise they had to register or make a disclosure.  I do not believe it is too onerous, which is a point I made to Deputy Doherty.  To reiterate, I believe the 2015 Act and this subsequent Bill get it right for the most part.  When I wrote that report and gave some <i>pro bono<\/i>advice to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the period from 2013 to 2015, the questions Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has just asked came up.  I reiterate the point that we have a relatively small polity.  It is not a matter of forcing people but of changing the mindset so that people know that, if they lobby, they register, their engagements get uploaded and that is the end.  That is how I feel it should be.  I hope that makes some sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Gary Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Murphy for that.  In fairness to Deputies Doherty and Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, their Bill does not propose that unpaid advocacy work should fall within the definition of lobbying.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Devitt a question in respect of section 4 of the Bill.  He has spoken about this briefly already.  This section relates to the duties of designated public officials.  One of the benefits of the legislation at present from the point of view of people such as Members of the Oireachtas and members of Government, who are designated public officials, is that it does not place an obligation on us.  The nature of Irish politics is such that you meet people a lot.  The advantage of the Act as it stands is that it is for the lobbyist to register their interests.  Does Mr. Devitt have any concerns about what is contained within section 4 and the proposed new section 16A, which puts obligations on designated public officials and which makes it an offence for such officials not to carry out certain activities in certain circumstances?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#E00400","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":562,"content":"<p>No, I do not have any concerns other than those I have already highlighted in respect of the wording.  I believe it would be easier to enforce that particular provision if it was clear that it would only arise or be enforced where a lobbyist is in contravention of the Act.  It would then be clear that, where someone is lobbying but has not registered or has failed to file a return, designated public officials, DPOs, should not engage with that person.  This approach was taken by the European Commission some time ago when European Commissioners agreed not to meet with lobbyists who were not registered on the EU's transparency register, so it is an approach taken in other jurisdictions, most notably the institutions of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  I will address the issue of the potential burden posed by the regulation of lobbying by not-for-profit organisations, if I may.  We have not found this particular Act particularly cumbersome but related legislation, the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, has posed enormous difficulties for the sector.  This imposed restrictions on political parties but also imposed the same restrictions on what are known as third parties.  Where organisations are in receipt of a donation of more than a given amount - I believe it is &euro;100 or &euro;200 - they are obliged to register as a third party with the Standards in Public Office Commission and are then subject to draconian restrictions on funding such that they are unable to receive more than &euro;1,000 in any one year from any individual or any donations at all from overseas, including from overseas trusts and charitable organisations.  This has placed a disproportionate and unforeseen burden on many organisations in the sector.  <\/p> <p>  It has also resulted in a degree of confusion as to what triggers compliance with the Act.  If a non-profit organisation is in receipt of donations to lobby for reform, it is unclear whether it has to register under the Act.  A similar requirement is not placed on businesses that are lobbying, but this requirement is placed on organisations that receive charitable donations.  As I have said, this has posed a particular challenge to the sector and could be addressed by making it clear that, where an organisation is compliant with the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015, it does not also have to comply with the Electoral Acts 1992 to 1999, unless it is campaigning around an election or referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Devitt"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":563,"content":"<p>That would obviously require amendments to the Electoral Acts, would it not?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#E00600","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":564,"content":"<p>It would.

There is a cooling-off period which could be longer.  There is an independent regulator.  It has some teeth, but I would argue it should have more and this Bill goes some way towards that.  I believe the British system has grievous faults.  The pass system in the European Parliament is difficult.  It has become very contentious in the United States ideologically.  Republicans are now strongly against any regulatory system while Democrats are for it.  There was a much more bipartisan view up to the last decade.  Washington state was a great exemplar.

As the witnesses know, this Bill would enact a number of the recommendations made by the Standards in Public Office Commission.

Many of the reforms are also technical in nature.  Generally, policy like this is driven by a crisis or controversy.  If we look back at the history of reform in Ireland from the 1990s, many of the most meaningful reforms came on foot of public controversies, tribunals of inquiry and the collapse of our financial system in 2008, which led to a raft of reforms, including the Protected Disclosures Act, the Regulation of Lobbying Act and reform of the Freedom of Information Act.<\/p> <p>  This Act should not be seen as a silver bullet or a panacea.  It is not the one means by which we should or can open up government or policymaking to greater scrutiny.  It is unfortunate that the Public Sector Standards Bill which was sitting on the Order Paper for almost three years stalled and then fell following the last general election.  That would have been an opportunity to address some of the concerns and risks that this Bill will address.  I would recommend, for example, a broader cooling-off period for designated public officials moving into the private sector and not just entering the lobbying profession where that appointment either poses a material or perceived conflict of interest and requires a designated public official to seek guidance and permission from the Standards in Public Office Commission before assuming a role which may pose a conflict of interest after retiring.<\/p> <p>  In much the same way these reforms should be seen as part of an ongoing process of reflection, review and reform of not just the Regulation of Lobbying Act but also of the Freedom of Information Act.  It is important to see this in an holistic way aiming at making government more open and accountable.  There is an opportunity to look at this in a strategic play with the forthcoming national plan for the Open Government Partnership.  Ireland is expected to present a plan to the Open Government Partnership secretariat soon.

There was a famous example a number of years ago where a Minister said he had been approached by a person with an access pass and they discussed an issue, and the Minister then went on radio to say that he did not consider this lobbying at all in any way, shape or form.  I wrote about this publicly.  I could not get my head around it.  I think it goes to the heart of what we are trying to do.  When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I am using a sort of royal &ldquo;we&rdquo;.  What the State should be trying to do is ensure that the citizens of the State are equal and, as the Deputy rightly points out, not everyone has an access pass and not everyone has access to political parties or to representatives, and that is what I am getting at.  While it is beyond the purview of this Bill, maybe it is something that should be considered.  I have long been of the view that things like access passes which allow lobbyists, potentially former officeholders, to have quiet words does not do anyone any favours.  It certainly does not do the political system itself any favours and I do not think it does the citizens of the State any favours.  It goes to this idea that someone can have a quiet word with a Minister and the Minister says, &ldquo;Yes, that is a very good idea&rdquo;, or someone can have a quiet word with a senior official and that does not get registered.  I am deeply concerned and have been for a while that this needs to be looked at.  That is all I was suggesting.  It is an important point because either the citizens of the State are equal or they are not.  If there is a potential favour being granted by access, that has to be looked at.

First, I agree entirely on the necessity for openness and transparency and that everybody should be represented, and the citizen has that particular right.  As Members of the Oireachtas, and even as members of local authorities, we have all promoted ideas at one time or another that became the law eventually.  I wonder if there is a danger that it might prevent people from expressing their views in such a way as to bring about change that may be of benefit to the constituents, which is what we do as legislators, and I mean all of the constituents without exception.  Professor Murphy referred to issues that were raised in the House and that did not fall to be answered in the House, for one reason or another.<\/p><p>I felt at the time that if they had been fully investigated and answered in the House, that the inquiries that subsequently followed would never have needed to happen.  I am also concerned about the freedom of information process taking the place of the parliamentary inquirer.  Under our Constitution, the parliamentary inquirer comes first, and should come first.  Otherwise, there is no sense in the public delegating responsibility to their public representatives to represent them.  Our system gives that right to the elected members.  It does not apply in other countries because some of them have different systems.  It is possible in some other countries for people who were never elected anywhere to become influential.  A different system is in operation and that aspect concerns a different quote.<\/p><p> I turn now to a suggestion that in some cases there is a necessity for secrecy in the context of the EU legislation which has come upon us in recent times.  It is oppressive in respect of how we do our job.  I refer to the suggestion that we may have to ask the permission of a constituent to raise an issue of interest to the constituent and-or of public interest.  I have a strong view on that topic.  I do not believe anybody has the right to put an embargo on or erect an obstacle to the right of public representatives to raise questions.  The simple reason is that the question, and its subject matter, being raised by the public representative may not favour the position taken by others.  How would it be possible to look for permission to raise an issue from a person who might, for example, be engaged in criminal activity?  One can hardly go to a criminal, inform him or her that one would like to raise a question about his or her activities and then ask him or her if it will be okay to do so.  That does not and cannot apply.  Those are a few of the things that I feel must be borne in mind.  I refer to how to best ensure that the activities of elected public representatives are not restricted to such an extent that they cannot do their jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#G00900","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I agree completely.

This legislation has also made it possible for Members of the Houses to better hold to account those making these decisions.  We are aware of numerous cases where freedom of information requests made by individuals, civil society organisations or journalists have prevented wasteful spending and averted future scandals.  That was the purpose of the original legislation when it was enacted in 1997.  It came on the back of a succession of public controversies and expensive tribunals of inquiry.  On reflection, it has saved the taxpayer a great deal of money that otherwise would have been wasted or potentially abused.  As I said, to the best of my knowledge, or I am certainly not aware of any evidence in this regard, the range of reforms enacted since 1997 have not interfered with citizens' ability to engage with their public representatives or public officials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Devitt"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I should tell the witnesses that some of us have had experiences over many years.

The question, though, may be refused as inappropriate under this heading and it may be stated that it is necessary to seek the information via a different route, which I do not accept at all, of course.  Subsequent to the question being put, however, even though it was never answered, action might well have been taken to address the issue immediately.  What does that tell us?  I agree with the witnesses entirely.  I and many other members put down countless parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il about all the issues which ended up in the public arena.  They had not been raised before because they were not allowed to be raised.  I have a strong aversion to that, as do all public representatives, including the members who have contributed today.  We must be fair about this.  We cannot be one-sided or unfair about this subject.

There has been a sea change there.  The United States has onerous regulations, including the cooling-off period of five years in some states and all payments made having to be registered, as was mentioned.  There has been significant kickback against that regulation in the last decade or so.<\/p> <p>  My final point, which I like to think is an important one, is the cost.  The Washington State Public Disclosure Commission had a staff of 28 people.  It was then gutted in a cost-cutting exercise.  I remember mentioning that to a senior civil servant that that office had a staff of 28 people.  He blanched at that, but I was not saying that SIPO should have a staff of 28 people.

I would first like to get the witnesses' perspective on two concerns I have about the lobbying aspect, and then ask them whether they feel this proposed legislation will address them or could it be strengthened in that regard.  My first concern arises from a scenario involving lobbying in the context of the membership of the business community or of a business group.  I recall the discussion in another committee in which I was temporarily sitting during the scrutiny of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, between Canada and the EU.<\/p><p>That committee heard from a witness representing the Ireland Canada Business Association.  Although the witness was clear that he was there on behalf of a business representative body and with a business mandate, he declined to clarify who all the other members of the body were.  This issue relates to transparency in respect of from where an individual is coming and the body or group he or she is representing.  Do we need to do more to ensure transparency in respect of the fellow membership, effectively, of a business representative lobby group or a coalition of business interests?  It struck me as totally inappropriate that only two or three members of a coalition of business interests chose to state their membership while several other members remained anonymous.  At the time, the general data protection regulation, GDPR, was inaccurately invoked in the context of declaring who were the members of their business lobby group.  Will the Bill address that issue?  I know it looks at individuals and their actions but I am wondering about bodies and their lobbying activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#H00900","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

We have no idea who is funding several highly influential think tanks in London.  We have not encountered that problem to the same degree in Ireland, although there will always be business representative groups the membership of which are not made public.

I thank the members of the committee very much for the invitation to appear before the committee today.  As the Vice Chairman said, I am head of ethics and lobbying regulation with the Standards in Public Office Commission.<\/p> <p>  For those who may be less familiar, the commission was established in 2001 and oversees the operation of legislation governing ethics in public office, political finance including donations, election expenses and the expenditure of Exchequer funding as well as the regulation of lobbying.  The commission is supported by a secretariat, which I lead.  I was hired in spring 2015 as head of lobbying regulation to oversee the implementation of the Act on behalf of the commission.  The Act was signed into law in spring 2015.  Most of the Act&rsquo;s provisions, including the requirements to register and submit returns, as well as the Act&rsquo;s post-employment provisions, commenced in September of that year.  It has therefore been in operation for just over six years.  The Act&rsquo;s enforcement provisions, however, commenced in January 2017, and the code of conduct for persons carrying on lobbying activities, which was developed by the commission on foot of stakeholder and public consultation, came into effect two years later in January 2019. <\/p> <p>  During the past six years, the commission has undertaken extensive communications and outreach activities to raise awareness of the Act&rsquo;s provisions and obligations.  These include presentations to stakeholder groups, open house information sessions, print and radio advertising, the publication of articles in trade journals, the launch of a wide-ranging website, guidance tools and information notes, and promotion in mainstream and social media.  During the past 18 months, outreach work has continued online and in virtual forums to continue to build knowledge and understanding of the Act. <\/p> <p>  I am pleased to say that on the whole, the Act is operating well, which is evidenced by compliance statistics.  At the first reporting deadline after the Act commenced in January 2016, the register had roughly 1,000 registrants and 2,500 returns in the system.  Today, we have more than double that number of registrants &ndash; more than 2,200 - and nearly 60,000 returns in the system.  Registrants come from all across Ireland, and some from abroad, representing all sectors of the Irish economy.  The returns on the register show that lobbying is a profoundly important mechanism by which individuals, businesses and interest groups seek to shape policy, programme, legislative and funding decisions.<\/p> <p>  While the Act is largely operating well, our experience in its administration since its commencement has identified several areas where we believe the Act may be strengthened, clarified and made more effective.  The commission has made recommendations for amendments to the Act in all three legislative reviews conducted to date &ndash; in 2016, 2019 and the review just concluded this year.  In its most recent legislative submission, the commission made 22 recommendations for change.  I will not try the committee's patience by listing them all, but I note some are more technical in nature and are aimed at improving the Act&rsquo;s clarity and efficient operation.  Some, however, are more substantive and include recommendations to strengthen the Act&rsquo;s post-employment provisions by broadening the scope of their application, and allowing for investigation and enforcement of non-compliance; to require public officials to close their doors to non-compliant lobbyists, and giving the commission the power to direct public officials to cease communications with non-compliant lobbyists; to broaden the Act&rsquo;s application to cover informal coalitions of businesses lobbying on issues of mutual or sectoral interest; to capture lobbying by unpaid officeholders or directors of businesses, representative bodies or advocacy groups, currently not covered by the Act; and, finally, to introduce an anti-avoidance clause in the Act to make it an offence to take deliberate action aimed at avoiding the Act&rsquo;s statutory obligations.  The commission is of the view that the implementation of these recommendations would further enhance transparency around lobbying, slow down the revolving door and allow for more effective enforcement. <\/p> <p>  I thank the members for their attention and look forward to any questions they may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sherry Perreault"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Perreault for that.

I will not read them out.  The relevant matter could consist of \"the award of any grant, loan or other financial support, contract or other agreement\".  If I was lobbying for financial support, a contract or other agreement for myself, that would not be considered lobbying; however, if I did so as a third party paid to communicate on behalf of a client, it would be lobbying when it is with a DPO.  Does that definition need to be broadened?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#L00400","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":618,"content":"<p>There are a few things in there to pick apart.  First, where a person falls within the scope of the legislation and makes a communication to a designated public official about a relevant matter, that is considered lobbying for the purposes of the Act.  The Deputy is correct that the person has to fall within the scope of the legislation and, the way the Act is structured, it is largely targeted at business or business interests as well as representative and advocacy bodies.  A person with more than ten employees, a business, a representative body or an advocacy group, as long as it has at least one employee, falls within scope, as would any third party paid to lobby on their behalf.  Even if a consultant is lobbying, their client has to fall within the scope of the legislation as well for that to be a registrable lobbying communication.  If I lobby as an individual and do not fit within the scope of the legislation, that lobbying also would not fit within scope if a third party was lobbying on my behalf.  The primary client has to be within the scope of the legislation as well and it has to be about a relevant matter and to a designated public official.<\/p> <p>  Whether that needs to be expanded is a matter for debate.  I am of the view that the Act's exemptions provide for things like private affairs being outside of scope and one would have to be cautious in terms of how the Act was reshaped to capture any matter that dealt with, for example, public funding and not to capture an individual's private affairs.  For example, under the current legislation, if a constituent contacts their local TD and seeks assistance with a passport, their spouse's immigration status or a medical card for a family member, such communications are outside the scope of the legislation and not captured.  If they were to communicate about something like a passport, it still involves public funds but it is not in the same way that seeking a contract with the Government would be.  If there was a desire to expand that, it would have to be done carefully so it does not capture regular constituent communications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Sherry Perreault"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":619,"content":"<p>Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe.

I will pick up on the last point.  Under the definition of lobbying in the legislation as currently drafted, an individual who is not operating on behalf of a third party and does not have more than ten employees can only lobby if it is deemed to be about land rezoning.  We have had a huge controversy about former Minister, Katherine Zappone and whether she lobbied for a position paid for from the public purse.  I will not go into detail on that but, as earlier commentators mentioned, we sometimes get better legislation, unfortunately, after an event has taken place.  The legislation allows me, potentially, as a former TD, to phone a Minister and say I am desperate and would love to be appointed to a position that would tide me over with &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 per year.  Under current legislation, I have not contravened any lobbying Act and have no requirement to register that in the lobbying register.  I cannot be deemed to be lobbying a Minister even though I would be getting a public contract worth &euro;40,000.  Indeed, it could be millions of euro, hypothetically, and would not fall within the scope of the Act.  Is that not something we need to deal with?  The difficulty and challenge that has been laid out is how to define that to exclude somebody looking for assistance to get a grant for their roof because it is leaking and they need State support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#L00700","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I will not comment on any individual's compliance or compliance matters relating to an individual.<\/p><p>There are obviously certain matters that fall outside the scope of the legislation.

Individuals could theoretically fall within the scope of the legislation if they are employers, but not in their capacity as individuals.  With regard to the question raised about business interests, there is a distinction to be made, for example, between people lobbying for a contract for a business to deliver something and people communicating in respect of employment.  Other legislation outside of the remit of the Standards in Public Office Commission may be involved.  I cannot speak to that.

In respect of one matter, the cooling-off period, it has asked to be shown examples.  We have a very clear example now.  I will not go into specifics but there was a controversy recently.

The commission then expressed its view that there were areas of the Act that should be amended in order to address some of the commission's recommendations.  That remains the commission's position.  The commission has done extensive outreach around the Regulation of Lobbying Act in particular, in addition to outreach around the other areas of its remit.  We have a wide-ranging website which features significant amounts of published guidance and the answers to frequently asked questions.  We conduct open house information sessions on a regular basis and do outreach to targeted sectoral communities, including through published information notices and lists of the top ten things people need to know.  The commission has produced, and continues to produce, extensive and wide-ranging guidance and education material.  We are, therefore, of the view that we are responding to any requirements for more information that have been identified.<\/p> <p>  To address some of the other issues, we remain of the view that it is only through legislative amendment that some of these shortcomings in the legislation can be addressed.  The most prominent example is that of the enforcement of post-employment provisions.  There is currently nothing to allow the commission to enforce those provisions.  There are also other areas I have already touched on such as anti-avoidance measures and capturing informal business coalitions and so on.  It is only through legislative reform that these matters can be addressed.  We are hopeful that this reform will occur.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the Department's engagement, there has been another legislative review of the Act.  This was launched late last year, only months after the previous review had concluded.  I will not speak for the Government but, with this review, it has already gone on the record to indicate that it intends to carry out some reform with regard to the post-employment rules in particular.  It is also looking at operational amendments to the Act.  My understanding is that the review is concluded and that Government is bringing a general scheme to the Oireachtas at some point in the coming months for legislative amendment.

The commission has not ranked the priority of the recommendations it has made but it has commented on the issue of post-employment provisions and the lack of enforcement powers in that regard on a number of occasions.  That presents a real dilemma for the commission as to how it can effectively oversee the administration of those provisions.  All of the other key provisions of the legislation, including the requirement to register and to submit returns, are enforceable.  The commission has certainly undertaken enforcement activities, where necessary.  With regard to the post-employment provisions, I am pleased to say that we have had numerous applications to waive or reduce the cooling-off period.  The commission notes that those people who have approached the commission seeking such a waiver or reduction are complying with their obligations under the Act to seek the consent of the commission.  That is heartening.<\/p><p>The fact is that where a person fails to comply either with the application process or with the provisions of any consent given or refused by the commission, there is nothing in the commission's powers, under the legislation currently, that will allow it to enforce the legislation.  It remains the view of the commission that that is a key priority area for amendment in the Act.<\/p><p> In respect of an anti-avoidance clause, it would probably operate in conjunction with other potential offences under the legislation.  Somebody who is investigated for non-compliance, lobbying without registering or failing to disclose all of their lobbying activities in a return, for example, might obstruct the investigation in some way or fail to comply with a order of an officer, which are already offences under the current legislation.  An anti-avoidance provision captures the aspects that do not currently fall within any of the other provisions of the legislation.  For example, where somebody set up a company in order to ensure it does not meet the qualifying provisions of the legislation, it would, therefore, fall outside of scope.  Somebody could target their activities through an organisation so that would deliberately fall outside of scope or they could ask their unpaid officeholders to conduct their lobbying activities instead of their paid employees and so on.  There are activities or actions that people may take to avoid their obligations.  We are of the view that those should be captured where it is a deliberate attempt to circumvent the purposes and transparency that is sought by the legislation.<\/p><p> In respect of the question on email accounts and violations of the code of conduct, that would be outside of the scope of the Regulation of Lobbying Act.  The Act is meant to make lobbying activities transparent.  The onus is on the lobbyist, the person who conducts the lobbying activities, to register and submit returns.<\/p><p> Designated public officials are subject to other legislation, including freedom of information, which is outside our remit and not something I can comment on.  Those are things that are for a different conversation on another day in terms of how those could be captured.  At present, there are no obligations directly on designated public officials in the legislation.  One of the recommendations we have made is that designated public officials should have the obligation to refuse further communication with somebody where they know that person to be non-compliant.  If somebody is non-compliant, or fails to register and submit returns of their lobbying activities, then their access to decision-makers should not be unimpeded in the way people who are compliant have unimpeded access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Sherry Perreault","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":630,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing the first minute of the reply by Ms Perreault and if my next questions have already been answered.

I am grateful to my colleague, Mr. Murray, for pointing out to me that I overlooked the Deputy's question on the proposed increase of the cooling-off period from one to two years.  The commission does not have a particularly strong view on that.  The current one-year cooling-off period is on the shorter end of the range compared with some international jurisdictions.  For example, in Canada, there is a five-year cooling-off period that applies not only to certain designated public officials but to all civil and public servants once they leave office.  There are then explicit provisions that apply to ministers of cabinet who are not allowed to lobby their former cabinet colleagues, are not allowed to switch sides in a negotiation and are not allowed to use insider information.  Those provisions do not exist in Irish legislation.<\/p> <p>  I am of the view that that aspect of the legislation could be strengthened in terms of the applicability of the post-employment provisions.  They should not only be restricted to certain designated public officials but also capture communications.  The commission, as commented in a previous annual report, believes that provisions should extend to individuals with whom they might have contact not just the public by whom they were employed.  The provisions might also extend to include communications between Cabinet colleagues, for example.  There are ways in which the legislation could be strengthened.<\/p> <p>  There is not a particularly strong view on increasing the period from one to two years.  Whatever the period the legislation needs to be enforceable and that is the priority.  Rather than worrying about the duration of a cooling-off period it is more about whether the legislation has teeth.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Doherty asked about staffing and resources, and then about investigation costs.  In terms of our operations, the commission oversees the Regulation of Lobbying Act, the Electoral Act of 1997, the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Activities) (Amendment) Act and the Ethics in Public Office Acts.  All of this legislation has significant processing, returns, advisory and guidance functions for the commission as well as outreach and investigation activities.  The commission has a broad mandate.  Our secretariat is provided by the Office of the Ombudsman.  Currently, we have 20 full-time positions in place within the secretariat and that includes myself, to oversee, on behalf of the commission, the day-to-day operations of all of those pieces of legislation.<\/p> <p>  In respect of whether we have sufficient staffing for our operations under the Regulation of Lobbying Act, yes, our operational unit, under the current legislation, is sufficient to manage the registration and returns requirements.  We also have an investigations unit that looks at investigations under both the electoral and ethics legislation, so the work is divided.<\/p> <p>  Within the broader secretariat and our broader remit, there are some challenges in respect of staffing levels and resources.  Members will have seen comment in the public domain, and most recently by the Hamilton review group, about staffing and the potential need for a capacity review of the commission to determine whether we are sufficiently staffed.  The short answer is \"yes\".  I believe that we have sufficient staff to manage the lobbying side.  In respect of whether we have sufficient staff to manage the breadth of the commission's mandate, that requires some study and we will look at whether there are ways in which we might be able to either streamline our requirements, maximise our resources or, potentially, add to those resources.<\/p><p>The Deputy also asked about investigation costs.  I will not comment on any individual or the content of that particular investigation, although there is a published investigation report, as the Deputy rightly pointed out.  In that particular instance, it is not fair to characterise those as investigation costs.  The investigation itself was not a particularly lengthy or onerous process.  However, a number of court challenges were taken against the commission in respect of the procedure by which the commission would conduct its hearing and the use of official languages in that regard.  As a result, there was a High Court challenge and judicial review.  I think it also went to the Court of Appeal, although I may have to double-check that because I was not the secretary to the commission at that time.  Most of the costs the Deputy cited are associated with court actions and not the investigation.<br\/><br\/>Most investigations that are conducted by the commission under the ethics Acts, as that particular investigation was, are largely done on a complaints basis.  If we receive a complaint, then the commission conducts a preliminary inquiry, which is usually conducted by an in-house inquiry officer.  It might involve taking some statements or gathering documents.  The inquiry officer then forms a view as to whether there is <i>prima facie<\/i>evidence of a breach that sustains the complaint.  That report is brought to the commission, which will determine whether to proceed to investigation.  The investigation is, generally, just a hearing.  It often lasts for a day or less than a day.  All six members of the commission and the respondent attend.  The respondent may or may not have legal representation.  Witnesses may be called, although it is usually only a couple.  It is a day's work.  The actual investigation costs per day would then comprise stenography, counsel to represent the commission and present the case against the respondent, plus the costs of any commission attendance on the day.  The costs for each investigation are not onerous but where court challenges are taken, they inevitably bring with them other costs and that is what can be seen in that particular investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021101300002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Sherry Perreault","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":638,"content":"<p>We accept the regulations that might apply to remunerative positions post employment.

There is nothing in the Regulation of Lobbying Act that would impede the role of the public representative in that regard.  I am aware that there are instances where a public official may be lobbied by an organisation that shares the views of the public representative.  If the representative is engaging in lobbying on behalf of that organisation, by which I mean the organisation has explicitly asked the public representative to raise a matter with a Minister or departmental official, the organisation that is engaging in that lobbying must submit its returns and name the public official it has to asked to do that.  If, for example, the Vice Chairman is asked to engage on behalf of a charity with which he has worked, the charity needs to name the Vice Chairman on its returns.

I am here to reflect on some of the concerns of staff and volunteers and on the experiences of individuals and families who have been supported by Alcohol Forum Ireland over the past 18 months.  Alcohol Forum Ireland is a charity that provides a range of supports and services to individuals and families across the Border counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal.  We also work at the wider level to support communities across Ireland in changing and challenging Ireland's problematic relationship with alcohol.  As such, I will also reflect on the work of the Irish Community Action on Alcohol Network, ICAAN, which comprises member organisations from 14 regional and local drugs and alcohol task forces, including some of the colleagues appearing from Ballymun.<\/p> <p>  The theme of this meeting allows us to reflect on and, I hope, respond to the challenges that have been faced by those struggling with alcohol and other drugs during the pandemic.  They have struggled considerably, largely in silence, throughout the past 18 months.  That cannot be overstated.<\/p> <p>  There is little doubt that alcohol is a major public health issue in Ireland.  Before we all go to bed tonight, at least another three people will have lost their lives as a direct result of alcohol-related harm.  Alcohol is implicated and present in more than 50% of all completed suicides in Ireland and in more than one third of all self-harm presentations.  As a carcinogenic substance, it is a risk factor for at least seven different types of cancer.  Unfortunately, we have the dubious record of being among the top five countries internationally for foetal alcohol spectrum disorders, which are lifelong and permanent disabilities that result from exposure to alcohol during pregnancy.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on a small number of areas.  Since it is difficult to point to a significant health or social issue in Ireland in which alcohol does not play a role, I will limit myself to the impact of Covid-19 on alcohol consumption, the challenges that have been faced by family members, including domestic violence, and the increased challenges for those living with alcohol-related brain injuries and their families.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the wider picture, we are seeing emerging research that acknowledges that alcohol is an immunosuppressant and that people with substance use disorders are particularly vulnerable to contracting Covid, more likely to suffer from a greater psychosocial burden, and at a greater risk of worse Covid-19 outcomes in the long term.  At grassroots level, we were hearing early on that local services were concerned by the volume of alcohol that was being consumed by clients, which was associated with anxiety, isolation and deteriorating mental health.<\/p><p>We were also concerned about the proliferation of drink delivery services and how deliveries, particularly those from 24-hour drink delivery services, were contributing to high-risk drinking occasions and about youth access to alcohol.<\/p><p> According to the Revenue Commissioners, alcohol consumption in Ireland decreased by 6.5% during 2020.  That is a relatively small decline when one considers that on-trade sector was fully closed for five months and wet pubs were closed for nine months.  Off-licences were classified as an essential business and remained open throughout the most strict period of Ireland&rsquo;s lockdown.  There was a steep increase in off-trade alcohol sales with sales data from Nielsen showing that within the first four weeks of lockdown we spent &euro;158 million on take-home alcohol.  That was an increase of 44% on the same period in 2019.  What is important to highlight is that there was no single one way in which people&rsquo;s drinking behaviours were impacted by the pandemic.  Some evidence is emerging that many reduced their consumption or stopped drinking entirely.  What we have seen emerging is a worrying picture of increased bingeing and increased consumption among certain groups, although it is too early to say what the long-term impact on our drinking behaviours in Ireland will be.  In my written statement I outlined a number of studies which estimate that between 20% and 30% of people reported either reducing their alcohol consumption or stopping drinking entirely during the pandemic.  Therefore, questions arise about those who were drinking and drinking significantly more.<\/p><p> In April 2020, the CSO carried out a survey which reported that 22% of those who consume alcohol said their consumption had increased.  The highest increases were reported among those who felt downhearted, depressed or lonely at least some of the time in the previous four weeks.  In May 2020, the Irish Community Action on Alcohol Network, ICAAN, and the Alcohol Forum Ireland undertook a Red C poll.  We found one third of adults reported they had increased their consumption.  Most worryingly, 37% of those with children said they had increased their consumption and 9% of those, roughly one tenth of families, said that they had increased their consumption significantly during this period.  That raises concern about children's increased exposure to alcohol consumption in the home and what the long-term impacts of the period will be on their health and well-being.<\/p><p> In September 2020, the Global Drug Survey indicated that half of people had been drinking more frequently, earlier in the day and had increased the number of days on which they drank.  Some 20% of those people said that was because they felt lonely or depressed and 30% said they were drinking more as a way of coping with the pandemic.  While it is still to early to tell the full impact of this what we are seeing emerging is an increase in home drinking, which is unregulated with no closing hours and increased exposure to children of alcohol consumption in the home.  Very worryingly, we are seeing an increase in drinking that is associated with stress, loneliness and isolation.<\/p><p> Drink deliveries have been a concern in Ireland, even at a policy level, for more than a decade, but the speed with which this practice grew during the pandemic could not have been predicted.  During the past year, ICAAN network members have raised concerns relating to underage access, with young people having alcohol delivered to lockdown parties, parks and beaches without any effective age verification.  Concern is also growing about the use of these services by people who are drinking alone and by those who have alcohol dependency issues.<\/p><p> It is important for members to note there is no definition of drink deliveries in Irish licensing law and while on- and off-licences can legally deliver alcohol to customers there are loopholes in the existing code, which mean age verification and the responsibility of licence holders not to sell to those who are so intoxicated they could be a risk to themselves and others are difficult to ensure in a drink delivery situation.  Section 9 of Public Health (Alcohol) Act states clearly that alcohol must be sold, paid for and the contract completed before it leaves the licensed premises, which means, in effect, licence holders have to sell the alcohol before they have eyes on and can verify the age or lack of intoxication of the customer.  While Irish licensing law is very clear on the hours when alcohol can be sold, there is no stipulation in alcohol licensing law around the hours at which it can be delivered.  Within this unregulated environment, we have also witnessed the growth of unlicensed 24-hour dial-a-drink services that are widely advertised online, operating outside the law and hiding in plain sight.  It is very easy to look at Facebook or a range of other social media platforms and find quite a number of these on any given day in Ireland.<\/p><p> I wish to refer to the impact increased alcohol consumption has had on families.  When parents misuse substances it can and does cause serious harm to children and it is extremely important parents experiencing difficulties receive timely, compassionate and non-judgmental support.  Not all parents who misuse substances experience difficulties with parenting capacity and not all children exposed to parental substance misuse are affected adversely either in the short or long term.  However, most children exposed to parental alcohol misuse will need some form of support.  Unfortunately, children are often the silent witnesses to domestic violence.  Lockdowns and social restrictions came with heightened risk of children witnessing, experiencing and, very worryingly, perpetrating violence and abuse.  Alcohol is a factor in one in three of the most serious domestic violence cases in Ireland.  It is not the cause of domestic violence, but it can act to remove inhibitions in carrying out the abuse and can be used by perpetrators as an excuse for their behaviour, a way for denying responsibility.  There is also international evidence that alcohol use increases both the frequency of violence and the and severity of intimate partner violence.  While we do not have any Irish research in this area to date, a study in Australia found that 51% of its support services working with victims of domestic violence reported increased involvement of alcohol as a stressor in family violence situations since restrictions were introduced.  In Ireland there has been much concern about the increase in reported domestic violence incidents during Covid but the role of alcohol has received relatively little attention.<\/p><p> In our family programmes we saw the duration of time family spent together increased during the pandemic, substance use increased, peers, friends, colleagues and other professional support was limited to virtual or to no support.  The primary reasons for referral to our family support services during the pandemic were substance use, violence and mental health.  Particularly prevalent was parent to parent violence but also significant was child to parent violence.  Alcohol Forum Ireland has been using the non-violent resistance response, NVR, since 2018.  NVR is a brief, systemic and cognitive behavioural response to child to parent violence.  During Covid we have also seen that the isolation and shame parents who are experiencing violence from their children increased.<\/p><p> in 2020, Parentline noted a significant increase in the number of calls in which it was reported that anger and aggression from a child was the main reason for the call.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Leonard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I interrupt to advise Ms Leonard she has two minutes remaining.

Parentline received 211 calls in 2019 and 428 in 2020.<\/p> <p>  Alcohol-related brain injury refers to a group of conditions that arise due to changes in the structure and function of the brain resulting from the long-term consumption of alcohol.  My colleague, Dr. Helen McMonagle, hopefully, will get to speak more about this later.  The lack of provision for people with alcohol-related brain injuries became all too clear and was magnified during the Covid-19 pandemic. We have seen among high-risk dependent drinkers a significant shift in drinking patterns and a sharp shift towards home drinking.  That resulted in alcohol intake rates far beyond what we had seen in this service in more than a decade of work.  In the case of people with alcohol-related brain injuries currently being supported by family members, family members often become the full-time carers for people with such injuries as a way to avoid their loved ones living their lives out in nursing homes for older people.  The caring role is significant and often involves intensive 24-hour a day support.  The isolation those families experienced reached a tipping point during this period.  In the case of people with alcohol-related bring injuries currently residing in inappropriate settings such a nursing homes, the impact of the pandemic on residents of nursing homes was devastating.  As many as 70% of people with severe alcohol-related brain injuries will end up resident in a nursing home environment due to the lack specialised rehabilitative and assisted living services.<\/p><p>For these individuals, the Covid-19 pandemic compounded further the inappropriateness of these services for this young client group, with a lack of physical contact with their families and little or no stimulation beyond the confines of the nursing homes environment, which was a further assault on their desire for independence.<\/p><p> Today, I have focused narrowly on a small number of issues and challenges arising from the pandemic but I am going to use the remainder of my speaking time focusing on what we need to see happen.

To do this, we consulted with a range of the different partners we work closely with in the Ballymun area.  They were very happy to provide their experience of what it has been like over almost two years of lockdown in trying to provide services to an already overloaded community.  The Ballymun local drugs and alcohol task force is a partnership that works with statutory services, local people, local services, voluntary agencies and local public representatives to provide a cross-cutting response to drug and alcohol issues in the local community.  It represents a broad range of experiences all coming together to address drug and alcohol issues in a local setting.  The information conveyed is garnered from a range of different services, such as youth services, community drug services and homeless services all working together.  The issues that were presented are similar to some of the issues mentioned by Ms Leonard earlier and they are also reflective of feedback that was garnered from different drugs and alcohol task forces throughout the country by the Department of Health recently, and a paper is being presented soon by the Department on some of the difficulties experienced by those services.<\/p> <p>  In terms of an overview of the key issues, as I said, we work in an already overloaded community where there is a large concentration of intergenerational drug and alcohol use and, in some cases, some families are experiencing their fourth generation of people getting involved in serious and problematic drug use.  Covid, which nobody could have legislated for, then came on top of that.  What we found was that this added extra loads onto already overloaded families in the community in general.  We have broken the issues down under various headings, as follows: connecting, connections and support; risk, safety and danger; coping and stress responses; access to service provision and engagement; drug and alcohol behaviour and patterns; and maintaining service delivery and practices.  I will try to paraphrase my speaking notes as much as possible in order to keep my speaking time short.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to connecting, connections and support, considerable work has been undertaken by all of the services in an ever-changing environment to provide supports to clients, their families and the local community.  There was an increase in client needs and that resulted in a whole range of different things, with much higher and more dangerous levels of drug and alcohol use and people who had been doing very well relapsing because of the lack of daily contact with local services.  It took a while for services to reorientate and to provide online and phone support and so on.  Those were the overarching issues.  We saw that where people had already experienced high levels of trauma in their family environments when growing up and in their current family environments, the isolation and the unknown factors led to that coming out in all sorts of negative ways for people.  There was a serious rise in anxiety and stress, and this resulted in issues like domestic violence and so forth.  Individuals using drugs and alcohol services indicated the resurfacing of feelings of loneliness, emptiness and abandonment.  That led to heightened levels of stress and anxiety, social anxiety and depression, and there was a lack of structured connection with their peers and with the services people relied upon.<\/p> <p>  Parenting issues came to the fore and became much more acute, with an increase in stress in homes for both parents and children, and Ms Leonard mentioned child to adult violence.  Services reported there was a lot of difficulty in emotional regulation when dealing with children&rsquo;s stress.  For children who were being cared for by other family members, such as siblings and grandparents, the separation for both child and parent was challenging, with people experiencing lost opportunities and missed milestones, and we have all seen the missing of things like communions, school graduations and similar milestones.<\/p> <p>  I will turn now to risk, safety and danger.  Vulnerability within home environments or family dynamics associated with increased drug and alcohol use surfaced in regard to issues like financial debt, intimidation, loss of employment and relationship breakdowns.  There have been increases in reports of suicidal ideation among those using alcohol or drugs, which did not feature too much as a self-identified concern pre-Covid.  Family members experienced more conflict within the home as their loved one&rsquo;s drug and alcohol use increased.  They experienced constant pressure for money due to reduced income, which led to issues like food poverty, although services tried to respond as best they could to some of those issues.  Family members&rsquo; awareness and anxiety was heightened in terms of their loved one&rsquo;s increased use due to greater visibility from them being out of work, working from home or being constantly at home.  There was increased aggression and domestic violence, and a rise in support in regard to seeking barring orders and protection orders.  There was experience of inconsistent or non-use of mental health medication during Covid, which is linked to patterns of drug and alcohol use, disconnection from supports, limitations on phone support or regular reviews or both.  Physical health issues also emerged as an issue.<\/p> <p>  Young people who were being groomed for various criminal activities became much more susceptible and vulnerable due to the withdrawal of key supports, such as youth supports.  Anecdotally, there was an increase in the number of young people holding drugs and weapons for organised gangs and getting involved in low-level dealing for very little money.  We are currently seeing the consequences of this, with a palpable increase in reports of coercion, violence and so forth.<\/p> <p>  In terms of coping and stress responses, there was a fear of Covid transmission, especially in families where their loved ones were still out on the streets, doing their drug dealing, drug scoring and so on, in that there was a fear of what they were bringing to the door.<\/p> <p>  Outreach services engaged with young people reported difficulties with young people understanding the ever-changing situation, although that was the case across the country and there is nothing unique in that.  It was also observed that people were sharing coping techniques and responses with one another.  For example, those in contact with services were sharing the support they received, such as breathing techniques and so on.<\/p> <p>  With regard to access to service provision and engagement, delays in access to residential treatment due to Covid became a real issue as there was reduced bed capacity in the residential treatment services.<\/p><p>Appointment dates were either delayed or extended thus making it difficult for clients to maintain progress and motivation.  There were experiences of undertaking detoxes without the same support systems in place making things very problematic.<\/p><p> Ongoing issues with access to adult mental health services and long waiting lists for the adolescent service were exacerbated during Covid.<\/p><p> The phone supports were not always suitable.  There was a reluctance to use, or unsuitable technology available, in terms of people accessing online services.  Some people reported that they had low self-esteem or confidence so did not like seeing themselves on screen and, therefore, chose not to avail of the support.<\/p><p> There were also tech literacy issues, Wifi issues and a lack of devices.  A big issue was people having little or no privacy in the home environment.  People had nowhere to avail of supportive services because of overcrowding.<\/p><p> Individuals with addiction and homeless issues found it difficult to access personal care arrangements such as showers and safe sleeping environments.  All of this had a negative impact on self-esteem and increased stigma.<\/p><p> There was a decline in motivation and goal setting was disrupted which made care and case management processes more difficult.  People were anxious arising from court dates being rescheduled and delayed.  Not knowing the situation and an inability to plan also increased anxiety.<\/p><p> In terms of drug and alcohol behavioural patterns, drug use increased.  There were particular concerns about the rise in the use of stimulants, particularly crack cocaine, which increased in a much bigger way during the last couple of years.<\/p><p> We witnessed among young people a rise in the use of party-type substances such as nitrous oxide, which reflects the trend that happened in other areas of the country.  We note that the sale of nitrous oxide is completely unregulated.<\/p><p> As Ms Leonard said, there was an increase in the frequency and quantity that people were drinking.  People made all sorts of local arrangements to facilitate drinking.  This was exacerbated by the free and easy delivery of drink to local parks, local shebeens, etc. at any time of night.  It  was reported that there were consequences on people and their families because of this changed use.<\/p><p> There was feedback that there was isolation, boredom and worry, which was attributed to a large level of relapse.  The people in recovery found it difficult to remain drug free without the support of things like their fellowships and local support services.<\/p><p> As has been mentioned earlier, there was a big increase in reports of service users being attacked and beaten up in connection with drug-related debts.  At the beginning of lockdown when Garda checkpoints were visible on the roads many dealing networks were denied a lot of their income so called on people to collect debts, which led to a large level of increased violence.<\/p><p> In terms of maintaining service delivery and practices, a number of services developed new ways to engage with their client groups.  This included the creation of walk and talk sessions, garden games, balcony chats and food distribution.  In terms of the latter, a lot of services thought that they understood the needs of individuals and families but when their staff called to people's doors they were shocked at the level of need.  When the front door opens and one sees the state in which children and families are living, it becomes a completely different animal.<\/p><p> Once restrictions eased everyone welcomed the resumption of one-to-one sessions, in-house group work for indepth personal work, and the efforts to restore and rebuild shared feelings of belonging, hope and resilience.  The stop-start engagement highlighted unmet needs and increased vulnerabilities for many.<\/p><p> Funding was challenging.  With the ongoing restrictions and new environment in which we work there is need for capital funding to be provided so that premises can facilitate more specific service provision, and separated service provision.<\/p><p> I have given a snapshot of the feedback from a range of different local services that work in partnership on the Ballymun local drugs and alcohol task force.

My opening statement will be brief in comparison with earlier.  It is fair to say that our experience is very similar to what both Ms Leonard and Mr. Greaves have shared with us this morning.  Some of the challenges posed by the last 18 months are familiar and resonate.<\/p> <p>  The Rutland opened in 1978 in Walkinstown before moving to Knocklyon in 1983 where it remains today.  In April of last year, the centre was forced to close for the first time in 42 years due to the challenges presented by the pandemic that was impacting on all our lives.  Thankfully, clients who were engaged in early recovery at that time were supported online and maintained regular contact with the service until the centre reopened in mid-June after two very challenging months for the management, staff and clients.<\/p> <p>  The centre had to undergo extensive changes to adapt to the protocols recommended by the HSE to provide a safe and supportive working environment for both residents and visitors to the service.  Today, the programme again provides a 16-bed residential facility, and an outpatient support group for eight individuals and their families.  At present, the centre has between 240 and 280 individuals in our aftercare and continuing care programmes.  The centre was forced to adapt to the changes and challenges that Covid-19 created.  In fact, having to move online allowed us to reach out to more individuals who may have struggled to access support and recovery options.  Many changes had to be made to the service, including providing secure online platforms, extensive training programmes for on-site staff and changing the daily programme in order to follow all the guidelines recommended.<\/p> <p>  Since reopening in June 2020, the centre has been extremely busy responding to the volume of calls and demands for places in all of our programmes.  Without a doubt families have been affected by the confinement and, for many, issues have been magnified by the lockdown.  Alcohol remains the issue that creates most problems for individuals and families who are desperately looking for help.  Among those seeking intervention and support for drug and substance use cocaine is still the drug of choice for the majority of those presenting.<\/p> <p>  Regarding process addictions, we have seen some increase in calls for help to tackle online gambling and pornography, which may in time translate to a greater demand for these services.  The lack of support for families is a particular concern and an area that requires urgent resources and attention.  From a practical point of view, it has been a real challenge to support families as before with the restrictions to visiting and physical meetings on site at the centre.<\/p><p>It is also important to mention that the past 18 months have also noticeably brought a growing number of more complex cases among those presenting for help due to the closure of services elsewhere.  The Rutland is eager to continue to build relationships with the HSE in order to respond to the request for places for public beds.  We believe that treatment should be readily available and accessible to all.<\/p><p> While it has been a very challenging time at Rutland, the staff remain highly motivated and determined to continue to provide a supportive environment for those who continue to seek help.  Early intervention and the possibilities of providing much-needed support for families before, during and post treatment remain high on our list of priorities, and these are the areas that can perhaps be supported most urgently by those in a position to influence policy and funding.  We are always happy to engage with other services and share our experiences to create greater awareness of the presenting challenges that we suspect all addiction services face at this time.  We would welcome questions and are happy to share our thoughts and experiences on any of the issues raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cooney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":661,"content":"<p>I thank all our speakers.

There was really good information in their presentations.  As someone who has worked in addiction services right across Dublin for most my adult life, I hear their pain in some of the stuff they mentioned.  I was also on the board of the Clondalkin drugs and alcohol task force for a long time and one of the problems we had was budgetary constraints, which led to us being more reactive than proactive.  As much as we tried to fight against that, it led to reactive measures.<\/p> <p>  One of the things I picked up from the witnesses representing Ballymun is the grooming of young people by criminals.  I have seen that in my area.  Mr. Greaves said it was anecdotal but it is quite prevalent across all areas of high poverty.  Young people are attracted to the flash cars, the money, the new runners, the so-called being a somebody - all that stuff.  I notice that the Ballymun local drugs and alcohol task force's report states there has been an increase in the number of young people holding drugs and weapons and getting involved in low-level dealing for very little money and that the task force is seeing the consequences of that with increased coercion and violence.  What actions does the task force see that can be put in place to combat this?  Would multi-annual funding be part of that solution?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#E00300","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":663,"content":"<p>A number of things were recommended.

One thing people are worried about is that while drug use is spreading across the country, and cocaine can be found in most towns and villages across the country, in certain areas there is still a complete overload in terms of frequency.  That is reflected in opiate use as well.  As for Dublin, the Rabbitte report of 1996 identified 12 areas.  Those 12 areas are still the areas with the highest level of problematic drug use and the areas where you see the grooming of young men.  It is not confined to those areas.  It has spread to other cities, including Cork, Limerick and Athlone.  We all know that.  If we look into the various estates where this is happening, we can predict fairly accurately what kinds of estates it will happen in.<\/p> <p>  We have looked for a number of different things.  From the point of view of Ballymun, we have looked for a huge rise in community policing.  There has been an increase in drug policing, which is covert and undercover and is based on seizures and so forth, and that is very welcome.  What the local community is looking for is visible policing.  For example, when a garda arrests someone with an amount of cocaine on them, it takes two garda&iacute; to process that.  They are off the street for a couple of hours while they process that person.  There has to be someone in the cell to supervise the search and so on.  That might result in a garda being removed from the community for up to a day or maybe even two days, depending on the size of the seizure and so on.  The local community then misses that garda for those couple of days while he or she does that really important drugs policing work.  What they really want to see is high-visibility policing and people walking around the area.  People might have seen the \"Prime Time\" programme that looked at drug dealing in the Ballymun area recently.  What people were really looking for from that was visible policing that discourages people from gathering and disperses crowds and so on.  That is one thing.<\/p> <p>  Another thing is that we know that some attempts have been made at grooming legislation to make it an offence to groom people for criminal offences.  We would like to see that go further if possible and be much more specific on the offences surrounding organised crime and drug dealing in that area.  Those are two things straight off.<\/p> <p>  In addition, a lot of money has been removed from youth services funding since 2008 and there has not been any particular visible increase in that funding.  That needs immediate restoration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Greaves"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":666,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Greaves for that.  We have been calling for community policing.  The community garda&iacute; in my area are really good; there are just not enough of them.  When they are out on the beat they engage and have conversations with young people but they cannot be everywhere at the same time and there are just not enough of them.  The garda&iacute; themselves are feeling that frustration.<\/p> <p>  Residential services were mentioned.  One of the things is the continuum of care.  You know yourself: if there are gaps in services, people will fall through those gaps.  Cuan Dara is a primary methadone detox service down the road from me, in Dublin 10.  People were moving from Cuan Dara into the Keltoi unit in St. Mary's, in the Phoenix Park.  Keltoi closed during the Covid pandemic and has not reopened.  There is no timeframe for it to be reopened.  Have the witnesses seen that or seen a lack of rehabilitation services as a barrier for people from exiting addiction?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#E00700","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":667,"content":"<p>If its okay, I will ask Ms MacAndrew to answer that.

In Ballymun many of our staff were redeployed.  We tried to leave core staff in the services but it was very hard.  As for case management, we could not even get hold of other agencies, particularly early on, until things got sorted out, so there was an absence.  It was a feeling of tumbleweed, in that everyone had gone.  Clients were trying to access services.  They were trying to come into recovery or trying to address their drug use.  It was really difficult to take new referrals.  We had clients coming into us saying they had gone to X, Y and Z but could not get a hold of people, so there was confusion.  There was definitely a sense of everything closing.  It was not until a little later that we were told we were essential services.  That was a bit unclear at the beginning.  I understand why but there is a big lesson to be learnt from this that we are essential services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Katy MacAndrew"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":669,"content":"<p>One of the problems is that such services have closed and have not been reopened yet.  There should be no reason they should not be reopened now.  People are finding that really difficult.  As the witnesses will be aware, there is sometimes only a small window of opportunity when somebody is at that moment in time and ready to look at their addiction in a worthwhile way.  I thank Ms MacAndrew for her response.<\/p> <p>  I have a little time left so I will speak to the representatives from Alcohol Forum Ireland.  We had a similar initiative in Clondalkin on combating alcohol abuse when I was out there.  I know Ms Leonard did not get a chance to discuss her recommendations at the end because of time constraints but one of our findings was the saturation of alcohol advertisement that was going on, especially in sports.  For example, during the last Six Nations match between Ireland and Scotland, there were 690 alcohol ads, one every 15 seconds.  I read Ms Leonard's report before this meeting.  She said one of her recommendations was to implement the Public Health (Alcohol) Act in full but does she see a reduction in alcohol advertisement as part of the solution?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#E01000","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":670,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  We know that alcohol advertising has a huge impact on people's consumption patterns and the decisions they make.  It has a particular impact on young people.  Young people are particularly susceptible to the lure of alcohol advertising.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Act contains some measures on alcohol and advertising, some of which have been introduced.  They are really welcome and we very much support them.<\/p><p>In the case of alcohol, we know it is necessary to do many things at the same time.  Things must happen in the area of alcohol advertising, but we also must see the introduction of minimum unit pricing, which is scheduled to come in early next year.<\/p><p> The other worrying thing regarding alcohol advertising concerns the provisions in the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018.  Senator Black will be all too familiar with those and she worked hard on that agenda for many years.  Our worry is that those provisions relate to place-based and physical advertising and advertising in traditional media, such as on television.  Alcohol advertising, however, has moved online rapidly and our children are living digital lives.  As a member state, Ireland has an opportunity, until November, to support measures in the new global alcohol action plan and we must see intergovernmental action on agreements to address children's exposure to alcohol and alcohol advertising online.  These are interactive and attractive advertisements, and young people share them.  We must, therefore, see that this issue is dealt with.<\/p><p> Another worrying thing regarding what is having an impact concerns the recommendations in the report of the night-time economy task force.  I refer to a proposed extension to the hours in which alcohol can be sold and that it may be made easier for certain venues to access an alcohol licence.  Those aspects do not relate directly to alcohol advertising but they are things that all members present and all Members of the Oireachtas should consider and have a position on when the proposed sale of alcohol Bill comes before the Houses for debate early next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#E01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Leonard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Leonard.

Gambling services are using their own buildings.  They are well aware that they are breaching planning permission regulations, but these advertisements are temporary and there is plenty of time to take them down within the confines of the current legislation.  This is an ongoing issue.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cooney brought up the next issue I wish to address.  I refer to the intersection of alcohol, gambling and addiction.

There is no regulation of age range online and young people can open accounts.

When we look at these issues at a community level, it is sometimes possible to see things not visible at a national service level or in a psychiatric service.

I am here to represent the needs of people affected by alcohol-related brain jury.  Our experiences of the Covid-19 pandemic brought into sharp focus the extensive health and social care inequities that exist for this group.  While many other groups experience reductions, changes or delays in services being delivered, for the vast mast majority of people with alcohol-related brain injury the pandemic highlighted further the absence of any specific resources for the group across the island of Ireland.  That is perpetuated by a lack of specific provision for this group of people who have dual needs in the area of addiction and around early identification, management and rehabilitation of their brain injury.  There is a dearth of services that meet both of those needs simultaneously.<\/p> <p>  We know from models of best practice internationally that multidisciplinary neuro-rehabilitation teams are best placed to meet the needs of people with alcohol-related brain injury.  That involves intensive input from addiction services and input from psychology, occupational therapy, social work and neuropsychiatry.  We do not have that capacity at the moment.  Those difficulties are reinforced by the lack of a specific policy or strategy that recognises the needs of people with alcohol-related brain injury.  We spoke before the health committee in 2019 and made a recommendation for the establishment of a multi-directorate national working group that could come together to tease out the barriers we experience extensively in relation to alcohol-related brain injury across the island of Ireland and try to find a means of moving forward in mapping out clinical care pathways for this condition, identifying resources required, putting business plans together, getting them funded and getting services up and running.

They have given a stark outline of the impact of alcohol and drugs on people, including young people.  I represent rural and regional areas in Roscommon and east Galway but there is a lot of alcohol and drugs in towns and villages around Ireland as well as in our urban centres.  I lived for many years in Dublin.  I lived on the North Circular Road close to Summerhill and worked in Glasnevin.  I went to the swimming pool in Ballymun and worked part-time job in Finglas many years ago.  I worked with communities there and know the strength of community and the pride in that area.  I also understand the immense challenges that face so many people, including young people, in that area.<\/p> <p>  Ms Leonard spoke of the impact of 24-hour drink delivery on young people.  The culture and attitude to alcohol can be dangerous.  I have checked and confirmed, as Ms Leonard mentioned, that a new scheme of the sale of alcohol Bill will be published by the year end.  Ms Leonard raised restrictions on delivery and easy access to alcohol and those are key points.  I know they are considering those in putting the Bill together.  We will probably have more opportunities to discuss that later this year.  She also highlighted the global alcohol action plan and the World Health Organization.  I think she mentioned the SAFER initiative.  Those are all key points.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Greaves mentioned the breakdown of family connection during the lockdown.  The influence that older members of families such as grandparents had on younger people has been crucial.  Maybe those connections have been lost.  I am sure grandparents play a huge role with young people, through childcare and everything else, from a very young age.  He spoke about safe community spaces to study and access to devices.  Funds have been allocated through the education and training boards, ETBs.  I am curious about how that is being promoted within the area.  Are families able to access any of that?  How do family resource centres operate in Ballymun and other urban areas?  How are those linkages happening?<\/p> <p>  Ms Leonard spoke about domestic abuse, the parent helpline and coping mechanisms.  It was said the evidence is the rise in requests for barring orders.  Now that society is opening up again, are changes under way or is domestic abuse continuing at the same level?  Are we seeing the same rise in barring orders and engagements with the Garda?<\/p> <p>  Dr. McMonagle mentioned the multidisciplinary area.  I worked in health innovation and so on.  How is she linking in with public health under the community healthcare organisations, CHOs?  I assume it is CHO 1 in her area.  I have had loved ones who have gone through alcohol abuse.  Locally, I am working with somebody whose partner increased their drinking throughout the lockdown and is now dealing with early onset alcohol-related dementia, which is incredible.  That person is probably in their late 50s and it is having such a toll on the family, as well as the person enduring this.  Dr. McMonagle mentioned the national working group and talked about mixing addiction psychology and neuropsychiatry services.  Will she expand on that a little bit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#G00600","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":691,"content":"<p>On ETBs and promotion of increased tech facilities, I could not answer that question.

It is really important to acknowledge that as part of Alcohol Forum, I delivered across the Border counties with the exception of Louth.  It encompassed Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.  Those counties along the Border necklace in the Republic of Ireland have twice the national rate of poverty according to the new spatial data that has come out.  The poverty rate is roughly 22%.  There were downsides, include isolation, increased drinking and problematic drinking.  We do not know what the long-term outcomes of this will be as a result of Covid.  However, there were also some innovations.  We talked about the balcony chats.  Probably not many people in our area had balconies.  What we have seen is that our experienced family practitioners pivoted to online delivery and phone support.  One of our programmes is called HOPE, or Have Only Positive Expectations, which involved meeting with families in crisis throughout Covid.  It was a six-week evidence-based programme.  We found that we were able to deliver that programme to people in rural areas who otherwise might not have been able to attend in person.  The future needs to be blended.  We need to think about other innovations for rurally dispersed and isolated families who may experience different types of isolation so we need to look at some opportunities in the future.<\/p> <p>  It is essential that three things happen with the proposed sale of alcohol Bill.  The first is that we provide for drink deliveries.  Part of that will require us as a country to look at what proper age verification looks like.  There is an opportunity in that to also look at proper age verification for online gambling, as has been raised here this morning.  That is really important.  At what point do we do it, how do we provide information around identification and age verification online, are there secure ways of doing that and how are we protecting young people?  <\/p> <p>  I also want to talk very briefly about what we are very concerned about at a community level.  We are concerned about a number of the recommendations in the report of the night-time economy task force report.  There is a lot in it that is really welcome.  It is saying that we want to have a night-time product that is not overly dependent on the sale of alcohol or chaotic drinking.  However, there are provisions within the report that recommend an extension of the number of hours alcohol is being sold and the number of venues in which alcohol is sold.  That completely goes against the grain of all of the international evidence that the WHO would cite that basically says there is a fairly simple relationship and that if one increases the availability of alcohol, one will increase the harm from alcohol.  There will be increased hospital admissions, increases in antisocial behaviour orders and increases in night-time violence.  It is really important that after today, people consider what actually ends up in the sale of alcohol Bill and what we can leave out.  I really welcome the fact that Government is considering consolidating alcohol licensing law.  This is something that really needs to happen so that communities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and licence holders are very clear around what is in the law and what their responsibilities are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Leonard"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I think my time might be up and I am conscious that we must allow other speakers in.

Addiction services and services for brain injury or neurorehabilitation exist as distinct service entities with little cross-sectoral collaboration.  This cannot continue.  Brain injury teams and addiction teams working together could provide the core skills required to provide ongoing rehabilitation and support for this condition.  I know we are here to talk about addiction but the reality is that addiction is causing brain injury.  As many as 35% of people who are dependent on alcohol will develop an alcohol-related brain injury.  Between 24% and 50% of traumatic brain injuries are caused by alcohol.  Those of us working in the addiction sector have a really important role in advocating for better provision for people who develop brain injuries and we need to have a really strong desire to be neuro-informed given the prevalence of brain injury within our services.  We need to be willing to play a role in advocating for greater provision for people with alcohol-related brain injuries.<\/p> <p>  Brain injury and addiction services are chronically under-resourced, particularly brain injury services.  I believe the Government needs to address the chronic under-investment in neurorehabilitation as a whole, which is a persistent barrier for people with all kinds of neurological conditions, including alcohol-related brain injury.  I would mirror calls from other agencies, including the Neurological Alliance of Ireland and the Disability Federation of Ireland, to address the significant dearth of appropriate regional residential and localised neurorehabilitation services.  These specialist services constitute a really important component of recovery from alcohol-related brain injury.  What we are talking about here is a condition that has a high potential for recovery.  Over 75% of people with alcohol-related brain injury can make some degree of recovery while over 85% of people can be supported to live independently in the community.  What underpins that happening is the provision of specialist residential rehabilitation and this is best supported by joint working arrangements between brain injury services and addiction services.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the national working group.  I do not want to oversimplify the issues associated with alcohol-related brain injury.  They are complex and nuanced and are influenced by a myriad of interconnected and interconnecting systems.  Most fundamentally, that social problem is a product of a network of cause and effect between multiple different systems.  If we want to act to improve the responses for alcohol-related brain injury, we need the co-ordinated action of many people, systems and directorates working in a networked way across different organisations in different service areas.<\/p><p>That is what we need to progress with the national working group.

The last 18 months have been a significant challenge for everybody, especially for addiction and community services.  Those who were in the throes of addiction prior to the pandemic would have found the last 18 months extremely difficult.  I am sure that people found themselves addicted to something that they were not addicted to before the pandemic too.  The witnesses may have seen that manifest in the services in the community.  That could be a range of things including alcohol, drugs and gambling, in particular, because more people were staying at home.  The rules of engagement and the game have changed in the last 18 months and have probably changed everything that we experience for a considerable time.<\/p> <p>  My questions are primarily about the Ballymun task force.  Nobody has mentioned this today.  I am an advocate for having a different debate about addiction and drugs.  I am not saying that people are advocating for it here, but you cannot police your way out of the situation.  We need to have a different debate about decriminalisation of the person rather than of the drugs.  We need a debate about the regulation of drugs.  We have had an ongoing debate about decriminalisation.  It suits the political establishment to let people and communities rot, in some ways, because it does not care, since it is not on the establishment's doorstep.  That debate needs to change.  It needs to start with looking at different models, at how we treat people and the way people take drugs.  People take drugs for all sorts of reasons.  This merry-go-round of vast resources going into criminalising people and all that simply does not work in my eyes.  It is a waste of resources.  I have a question about the task forces.  How would they view the decriminalisation model?  There is evidence from Portugal that decriminalisation saves lives and takes people out of the criminal justice system, with better outcomes for everybody.<\/p> <p>  I have a question which goes beyond decriminalisation, which I think we need to go beyond.  It is about regulation of some drugs.  Criminalising people for cannabis use is a waste of time.  There needs to be a regulated system where people are not criminalised or sanctioned for cannabis use.  I would like to hear witnesses' views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#J00300","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":706,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked for the task forces' view.  I cannot give that view because each task force represents its own range of community services and local people.  There would be a general welcome of a debate.  In the recent drugs strategy, there is a health-led approach so that people with first offences for drug possession will have a health intervention rather than a criminal intervention.  A diversion system is being introduced, which is welcome.  The issues that I raised at a community level about the disruption caused by drug dealing in a local neighbourhood will not be dealt with by a discussion about criminalisation or decriminalisation.  We need community policing to make those communities feel safe, reassured and so on.  I think a discussion of it would be generally welcome.  It is a complex issue.  Even decriminalisation of cannabis presents all sorts of issues relating to psychological damage done by the strength of the cannabis products that exist.  The way they are currently sold is a concern, with cannabis edibles that people get, including deliveries from sources on the Internet of jelly babies that are cannabis-infused and so on, which has led to damage for children.  There was some publicity about that recently.<\/p> <p>  Local communities demonstrated their view of how they feel about criminalisation or decriminalisation when the head shop debate happened a number of years ago.  I remember a protest about a shop in Enfield where people voted with their feet and it closed down quickly because people saw that there was no place for it.  That is reflective of the complexity of some of the issues.  For example, if alcohol was a brand new product and was introduced in Ireland, there is no way that it would be introduced as an unregulated, free-for-all substance that anyone can access because of the damage that it does and the lives that have been lost year-on-year.  It would be introduced with strong regulation.  The issue of decriminalisation needs to be carefully debated.  We have not seen the research about what legalisation, as has happened in parts of the United States, will do for psychological health for young people in states such as Colorado.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Greaves"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":707,"content":"<p>We have started the trauma informed approach in the community in Ballymun.

I will try to keep it brief.  We are talking about the impact of Covid.  My first question is very simple.  If the witnesses could predict the future, do they envisage a bigger demand, or a tsunami of demand, on services within the next 12 months?  I ask that because when it comes to addiction and mental health problems, it takes people who are stuck in that rut time to realise they are in trouble.  Most of the time, unfortunately, it is when they are in too deep.  It is only then, if they are lucky enough to have the support of family and friends, they will try to access help.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ward mentioned alcohol advertising.  We see advertising with graphic images on packets of cigarettes to try to discourage people from smoking.  Is there a barrier, or is it due to lobbyists within the alcohol industry, to facts about the side-effects of alcohol misuse being advertised?  It is okay to have a cigarette.  People like a cigarette even though they know it is bad for them.  It gives some people peace and solace, as does a social drink.  I ask that because the educational factor is more important since prevention is better than cure.  The Samaritans were in front of the committee a number of weeks ago.  They go to concerts to give out information on drugs, drink and so on.  It is about getting information.  Do the witnesses get supports for any campaigns like that?  This is the national side of it.  Dr. McMonagle talked about supports and joined-up thinking.  What are the supports for a national body?  I take it the Alcohol Forum covers the 32 counties.  Is there a slight difference in the attitude to health, and helping and getting supports in, within the Six Counties compared with here?<\/p> <p>  The issue of supporting staff in all the centres was mentioned and it is vital.  I am glad to hear they are getting support and are looking after their staff.  I recently spoke with a Samaritans' volunteer.  As I said, we had a very in-depth discussion with representatives of that organisation at the committee a number of weeks ago, but I still did not pick up on the fact, until the volunteer said it to me, that the volunteer could be the very last person a caller at the other end of the line talks to before they die.  That is a very serious scenario.  When the witnesses talk about community-led initiatives, what is the vision?  There used to be a stigma around suicide, which is probably still there in certain sectors for obvious reasons.  How do we destigmatise the fact that people have an alcohol or drug problem, so they are not victimised when they go to seek help?  That is a major issue.<\/p> <p>  The Garda was mentioned, which is overstretched and under-resourced, including in community policing.  What about getting information into youth clubs?  How are schools dealing with this?  Are they willing to come on board?  It is a campaign where information, and letting people know, is key.  Not everybody will be stopped.  I am a smoker.  I hate smoking, but I am addicted to it.  Not everybody will be stopped but if I at least had the opportunity, a long time ago, to know the facts about it, I may never have taken it up.  I know there is a lot in that but I will not come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#K00500","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for that question.  I welcome the opportunity to address some of the issues he raised.  On whether we are facing a tsunami, we are already in one.  We certainly have seen that in the Rutland Centre with the number of phone calls from desperate people, who are desperate to get a place where they can address their addiction.  We are a 16-bed facility, so we are constantly in a state where we have a waiting list.  As part of my work there, I worked in assessments, part of which often involved ringing other services to see if there were any places or any way to help.  It is the same with those services ringing us.  We just do not have the facilities, beds, supports and infrastructure in place to deal with the tsunami that is already here.  There is a larger one coming and I am sure all my colleagues here will agree with that.<\/p> <p>  To come to some of the Deputy's other points, and it is something very close to my heart, my colleagues and I are all reacting to people who are looking to address addiction.  We are in a very reactive space much of the time.  When people come to us, we deal with them however our supports allow us to and then we send them back out into the community.  It is what happens to them then that is also falling down.  I ask the committee to also take a broader view that is not just about what we can do within the services, and the reactive response to addiction, but looks at it in a broader way.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about stigma, which is very real.  If people say they are \"in recovery\", and my colleague Dr. McMonagle used that term to refer to recovery from brain injury, that is perceived very differently than a person saying he or she is in recovery from addiction.  For example, if people say during a job interview that they are in recovery from a brain injury, they will get a very different response, I would imagine, than if they said they were in recovery from addiction.  Part of that is due to a lack of education because people do not understand what being in recovery from addiction means.  I ask the committee to consider the broader aspects of that.  Again, education is part of it.  It is really about building recovery capital at a personal, community and wider country level, so that people who have addressed their addiction and are moving into recovery have the recovery capital to allow them to continue on that journey.  Education at school level is a very basic start for that so people can understand, be educated and, therefore, addiction recovery can be destigmatised.<\/p><p> Visibility is also important.  It was National Recovery Month in September and we need a lot of visibility for such initiatives.  My colleagues said earlier that young people are seeing what drugs do and they are seeing the perceived good stuff that comes from them such as the fancy shoes, clothes and jewellery.  Recovery and what it looks like does not have the same visibility.  If there is an enticement to go into drug dealing or criminal behaviour then recovery does not have the same enticement.

They will want to live in the community, live independently and reach their full potential.  There needs to be a wider provision of personal assistant and home support hours in assisted living accommodation with wrap-around supports.  I welcome the announcement from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, yesterday of the additional 120,000 personal assistant hours as part of budget 2022.  It is paramount that those with alcohol-related brain injuries are afforded accessibility to these additional resources.  Without such support the long-term rehabilitation and the maintenance of gains made through any efforts or in specialist rehabilitation will not be sustained.  That is an area we would look for support from the Department on.  I also refer to the importance of the establishment of a multi-directorate national working group.

In the recommendations we talked about many of the people who are appearing today being in the crisis intervention and service delivery spaces and dealing with the size and magnitude of the issues that are impacting families and individuals.  The Deputy asked about what needs to happen.  If we circle back to what Deputy Gino Kenny said, we recognise that there is a need for an informed debate that is based on research and good evidence and that is not based on opinion or strong belief.  We need investment in youth work and the restitution of youth work budgets to at least what they were in 2018.  The guests from the Rutland Centre have also emphasised the need for investment in family supports and any step-down care and after-care, which are essential.  We have talked a lot about the impact on the individuals who are struggling with dependency and on the people who live around them, the people who love them and the people who care for them, and I am glad we did so.  We know there is great potential if we support families.  People have a right to recovery in their own right but families can also motivate their loved ones towards recovery and support them on that journey.<\/p> <p>  The UN has described the impact the Covid pandemic has had on children as perhaps being even more significant than the impact the pandemic itself has had in the coming years at a global, health and well-being level.  We do not yet know what those outcomes will be but we know that children in homes where there are pressures, such as poverty, social exclusion and dependency, live under huge pressure every day.  They have done so for a long period; we are 18 months into this pandemic.  We need investment in children, youth work and family support.  That needs to be a specialised family support that understands addiction.  That is important and I know a lot of the people here today understand the work that goes on in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Leonard"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":721,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

In recent years we have had money for new initiatives, which is welcome and which has led to some interesting projects being developed, but there has been no restoration of funding at all.  There are major sustainability issues for projects.

There is the matter of funding going back to 2008 levels either for task forces or youth work.  How frustrating is it for the groups here today, working on the front line, in trying to provide services?  Much of the new funding is being specifically allocated so task forces do not have autonomy to deal with matters in their local area.  The Department gives them money for a certain project, for example, but each task force needs funding to tackle problems with services specific to them.  The groups I have spoken with have been very animated and upset by this.  The task forces are key and if we support them and give them the funding and help they need, they will deliver locally in their areas.<\/p> <p>  The representatives from the Rutland Centre made some good points on addiction, particularly with regard to gambling and the various links in that respect.  Last week I introduced a Bill to the D&aacute;il that would ban the use of credit cards for gambling online and in shops.  It is only a small step and we need the Government to bring out its gambling control Bill, along with the appointment of a gambling regulator.  There was a small mention of this in yesterday's budget but it looks like the earliest that measure will be implemented will be 2023.<\/p> <p>  My colleagues and many of the witnesses have spoken about the many issues involved with this, including age verification, whether that is for alcoholic drink delivery or children going online and being able to gamble for two or three days before they must verify their age.  Over the summer I published a strategy to combat gambling and, at a minimum, there should be no advertising for gambling before the watershed.  As a father with two young children but also a person involved with GAA and youths in my community, I am aware that children are vulnerable and are being targeted by the likes of alcohol and betting companies.  As Ms Bryans spoke about this earlier, perhaps we could get some more of her thoughts on the matter.  Some of the points she made were excellent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#M00200","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":725,"content":"<p>Some of the diversion from antisocial behaviour is often into sports.

I do not know if Deputy Gino Kenny is still on the call but I represent the same area and he knows from where he is coming.

There are parts of my community experiencing trauma and they feel abandoned by a lack of visibility of garda&iacute;.  There are people selling their homes because they cannot live there any more but they cannot complete the sales because people coming to view the properties are being intimidated.  Parts of our community need enough visible community policing to solve these problems and allow people to breathe.

Through a co-ordinated approach in Ballymun there is a high uptake of community detoxification, and that can work well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#N01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Katy MacAndrew"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":753,"content":"<p>It was mentioned earlier that timing is very important.

Is it easier to access the witnesses' services than mental health services or child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS or are they having capacity issues whereby they would wish to provide more?  With regard to the marginalised people in society such as people with disabilities or members of the Traveller community, do they use the witnesses' services or is there a gap there because of information or access?  I am trying to get the picture because we want to find out what additional resources should be provided because people are, perhaps, being left behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#N02000","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":756,"content":"<p>I was recently asked by the drugs task force to talk to all our service users about accessing mental health services, what the distinction is and how those services work for them.  There is definitely a division between the two.  Their experience of accessing mental health services with dual diagnoses was that they felt like they were being treated differently.  From the interviews I did with people, I know that they definitely felt stigmatised if they were using substances.  People whose cases were more serious and who needed to be hospitalised within the mental health system felt that they were given very high levels of medication during that time, particularly if they were suicidal and so on.  It gave them and their families respite but they then had to come out and face stuff again.  The division that has always been there is still there.  I do not know if that answers Deputy Buckley's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#O00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Katy MacAndrew"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":757,"content":"<p>As I have said in other committees, particularly the Joint Committee on Health, people with disabilities are not sick but they are labelled and put into a particular section because it makes it easier to tuck them away.  These people have the exact same feelings and it is just as possible for them to develop an addiction and so on.  I hate using the word \"disability\", but when talking to people who are less fortunate, you always see that they face greater barriers and are treated differently.  Ms MacAndrew is right in what she said about medication.  A number of years ago, we were spending approximately &euro;10 million on cognitive therapy, play therapy and so on while spending more than &euro;400 million on antidepressants.  Is there a pathway to which you can point someone with a disability or who has been less fortunate in their education through which they can access services?  Is there a simple one-, two- or three-step process?  We hear people talking about online access and so on.  That is fine if you can afford Internet services and a computer and if you know how to use them but a lot of these people have been left behind over the years.  The Covid pandemic must have been absolutely desperate for them.  I keep going back to the disabilities sector but, on a normal day, people with disabilities face challenges even getting on a bus or train or crossing the road at a traffic light.  In our own town, we put in a footpath a few years ago.  It won a European mobility award because we listened to the services users and then improved the footpath.  What would be on the witnesses' wish list for changes to legislation that would make access to all the services they provide easier?  That is my final question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#O00200","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":758,"content":"<p>I am not sure I can give that question with the answer it deserves, but I will tell the Deputy where we would come from on it.  This goes back to what I said earlier about building and investing in recovery capital.  Part of that relates to the destigmatisation of recovery.  If people, and particularly those in marginalised communities, can see recovery normalised in their communities and in the country, it would go some way towards helping them to begin to access services.  In some of the forgotten communities the Deputy spoke about, there is a particular stigma attached to accessing recovery services.  If we can destigmatise that and build recovery capital for communities and personal recovery capital, it would provide more of an opportunity for people to access these services.  Again, it comes back to funding, as it has time and time again.  Do we have the wherewithal to deal with these people adequately when they access these services?  However, the problem at the moment is that they are not accessing the services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Serena Bryans"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":759,"content":"<p>To lead with a pictorial vision, Ms Bryans mentioned recovery month this year.  In Ballymun, we made the town purple by placing purple footprints in different areas, going from shops to park benches and other buildings.  The idea was to say that, wherever people's journeys start, they will be supported along the way and we will be there with them.  With regard to access, the Deputy brought up a really important point.  The nature and extent of service user involvement from the very beginning helps to define the nature and type of services that are provided to meet their needs and that are openly accessible to them.  Again, it is not necessarily about bringing people to services, but about bringing the services to the community.  Covid really put a spotlight on that.  We also need to change our practices and have those doors open.  That mirror image must be very visible in the community.  I cannot remember who, but somebody mentioned getting to people before the issue arises.  It is about the community mobilisation sites Ms Leonard referred to, about having those conversations in the community and about the community having ownership and a role in designing those interventions so that, when an alcohol issue presents itself, people will know who to go to because they will remember people mentioning different things.  The Covid pandemic presented a really great opportunity for those conversations.  Conversation was the greatest tool and resource we had.

I will be brief.  What Ms Lawless has just said about the importance of communities is really important.  Communities can identify problems and issues as they are emerging.  They can work across services and build intersectoral collaborative partnerships at the local level.  They can bring local government, An Garda, education providers, family resource centres and those working in treatment together to decide what services should look like in the community.  We can only do that by listening to people.  Ms Lawless has emphasised the importance of conversations.  The listening part of conversations is really important.  I have done quite a bit and I have learned from my colleagues this morning.<\/p> <p>  The question raised was on access to services.  The people working in the services might be better placed to discuss that.  However, there are no services for a number of alcohol-related conditions in this country.  There are no diagnostic services for children and families that have been impacted by foetal alcohol spectrum disorder.  One cannot get one's child a diagnosis of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder.  There is no specialised family support, there is no care and there are no specialised interventions for those families.  When we appeared before the Joint Committee on Health in 2019, we talked about the need for agreed diagnostic criteria, for the establishment of multidisciplinary teams and for the putting in place of support for those families who are raising children with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder.  It is really important that the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health think about the profound impact that foetal alcohol spectrum disorder can have right across a person's lifespan.  Some 50% of people who have foetal alcohol spectrum disorder will serve time in jail or will spend time in a residential drug treatment or psychiatric facility.  Some 92% of children who have foetal alcohol spectrum disorder will receive a formal mental health diagnosis in their adult lives.<\/p><p>We also know there are 428 co-occurring physical disabilities and conditions that are associated with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, including epilepsy, heart defects, compromised auditory function or hearing and compromised immunity.  It is important to talk about dual diagnosis, access to timely support and intervention for people when they are in addiction.  We also need to acknowledge and talk about the complete lack of services for people with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder.  I will ask my colleague to talk about the issue.  We have the only specialised rehabilitation service for people with alcohol-related brain injury in the country.  There are no similar services in the parts of the country other than the Donegal area in which Dr. McMonagle works.  We need to see similar services.  I will hand over to my colleague.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Leonard","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":765,"content":"<p>I will pick up on the Deputy's point about the 75% recovery rate associated with this condition.  I would absolutely mirror his enthusiasm for investing in rehabilitation when outcomes such as that are possible for what is a serious and significant condition.  In the absence of the input of rehabilitation, those issues are contributing significantly to the burden of homelessness.  For example, a study in Scotland has shown that alcohol-related brain injury affects 21% of homeless hostel dwellers.  It accounts for 10% of cases of dementia, and 12.5% of cases of dementia in people under the age of 65.  It contributes significantly to delayed discharges at a hospital level.  On the flip side of that, when financial and resource investments are made in multidisciplinary rehabilitation for this condition, between 75% and 85% of people can be living in the community.  Hospital bed day usage can be reduced by 85%.  Most significantly, the long-term relapse rate is only 10% when such an intensive multidisciplinary approach to rehabilitation is taken.  Anybody working in an addiction service or residential service will look at a 10% relapse rate and recognise it as a fantastic outcome, particularly for people towards the more complex end of the spectrum.  There are very significant cost savings to be made when we invest in this area.  The pay-offs are enormous, including for the quality of life for those affected as they go through their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Helen McMonagle"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":766,"content":"<p>I have a few comments I would like to make and a question might arise.  We have a little more time.  Some of those attending this meeting know that I feel the impact on family members is vital.  We require an holistic approach with regard to recovery for family members who have somebody that they love with an alcohol, drug or gambling problem.  That is important.  Dr. Stephanie Brown, who is one of the leading addiction professionals in the world and is based in the USA, has often spoken about children who have been reared in homes where there has been alcohol harm often grow up to be in addiction themselves or get into a relationship with somebody who is in addiction and the cycle continues.  It is about breaking that intergenerational trauma that happens for family members but it is also vital to break the cycle of addiction when it comes to approaching recovery as a matter for the whole family.  When addiction presents itself within the family dynamic, everybody is impacted.  A whole family approach is important.  As Ms Lawless said, catching addiction before it gets to a certain point is very important.  That is why family recovery is vital when it comes to the individual who is in addiction.  It can break that cycle of addiction and the intergenerational impact of trauma, going forward.<\/p> <p>  I have a question about gambling and process addictions.  We are only starting to get an understanding of it and it is a minefield.  We know about alcohol and drug addiction and, in a way, we can see it.  You will know if a person has taken a substance.  However, it is different when it comes to gambling, Internet or pornography addictions, which are going to be a tsunami.  Can our guests say a little bit about the impact of those process addictions on the individual and on the family?  It is important because people do not understand the impact on the individual who is in that dark place of gambling addiction and cannot stop.  Perhaps our guest would like to speak about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#P00300","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":767,"content":"<p>I do not mind sharing my thoughts.  Gambling is an issue with which we are very familiar.  Apart from the obvious financial implications, the impact on families, relationships and the individual is immense.  The secrecy is a big issue, as the Chairman said.  The other addictions are obvious and noticeable but because gambling is so secretive, people can get into serious difficulty before anybody else is aware it is happening.  As I said earlier, all addictions are very progressive.  What might start somewhat manageable becomes less so until it is completely unmanageable.  Early intervention, as we agreed earlier, is very important but it is very hard to achieve in the case of gambling.  It is a serious problem and we are coming across it more often.  The people concerned are becoming younger because younger people have access to online betting and smart phones have increased the accessibility of gambling compared to the way it was years ago.  There is something tangible about handing one's money over across a counter whereas tapping on a screen does not have the same connection at all.  Unfortunately, people run into difficulties at a serious level very quickly.  The Chairman is right that it is an issue that needs attention.  It needs to be addressed and acknowledged.  As is the case with everything, we need to accept that there is a problem there before we can attempt to do something about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021101300002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cooney"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":768,"content":"<p>Does Ms Leonard feel she covered everything she needed to?

The Chairman was talking about process addictions, including to gambling and pornography.  I agree with her that many people have been spending a lot of time at home by themselves with their phones.  We are not going to see the impact of that until six to 12 months have passed.  There is a significant comorbidity in relation to gambling and alcohol addiction.  The high-risk behaviours that are associated with gambling are facilitated and enabled by alcohol.  We know that alcohol reduces inhibitions around risk-taking and, therefore, the stakes can become higher very quickly and a person can get into trouble very quickly.  It is important that we have a comprehensive understanding of addiction and look at it across the board.  Some of that conversation has started today and I would like it to continue.

I am joined by my colleagues: Garret Doocey, who is leading on the development of our new sustainable mobility policy; Andrew Ebrill, principal officer, national roads, greenways and active travel division; and Dominic Mullaney, principal adviser, regional and local roads, all of whom have been providing input into our new policy framework.<\/p> <p>  As we all know, we need to transit to a low-carbon, climate-resilient society.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 commits us to a 51% reduction in our overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to achieving net-zero emissions no later than 2050.  In 2018, transport-related emissions accounted for 20% of our national total, second only to agriculture.  It is clear that the Irish transport sector faces significant challenges regarding the need to both reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.  In short, we require a fundamental change in the nature of transport.  Central to that change will be increasing the numbers of people using sustainable modes of transport, be that walking, cycling or public transport.<\/p> <p>  To achieve that increase, we need to put in place the right policy framework.  That is the core purpose of the new sustainable mobility policy.  It will replace the existing policy framework, Smarter Travel, which was published in 2009, and provide a new ten-year policy framework for active travel and public transport.  The policy review has been under way for some time, with a very successful stakeholder engagement event held at the beginning of the public consultation process and over 250 submissions received last year from a wide variety of people and organisations.  Since then, the Department has reviewed all the submissions, published a full report of the consultation process, engaged further with stakeholders and is finalising the revised policy.<\/p> <p>  The primary focus of our new policy will be to cater for daily travel needs in a more sustainable manner.  We intend to achieve this by making sustainable modes the smartest and most attractive choice.  Active travel and public transport are not only the most environmentally friendly options, but also the most socially inclusive and economically accessible.  Both are a key part of a just transition to meeting our climate goals.  Fairness demands that they should have priority.<\/p> <p>  The new policy will have two parts.  First, a ten-year policy statement which will set out the vision for the future of sustainable mobility in Ireland.  Second, a five-year action plan to deliver that policy statement.  The draft policy statement is centred around three guiding principles.  The first principle, safe and green mobility, will set out an ambitious and comprehensive set of actions for the decarbonisation of public transport.  These actions will be aligned with the forthcoming climate action plan and will position us to meet our transport emission targets.  However, it will not be enough to decarbonise public transport fleets.  We also need to increase the capacity and range of public transport services to meet the projected travel demand set out in Project Ireland 2040.  As the committee knows from its work, these transport needs are not uniform across the country and tailored solutions will be needed for urban and rural areas.  Funding for active travel initiatives in both urban and rural Ireland, together with improved and expanded public transport services across the country, is needed to reduce car dependency.  Projects like BusConnects in the cities and Connecting Ireland in rural areas will provide viable alternatives to the private car.  These will be implemented alongside a range of behavioural change measures to encourage more people to make a sustainable option their preferred mode of transport.<\/p> <p>  I emphasise that safety is an important part of our policy.  Ireland ranks second among EU member states for road safety. We cannot take that for granted.  We need to maintain and improve our existing transport assets while also providing a safe space for everyone, including pedestrians and cyclists.  Safety is an essential requirement for modal shift.<\/p><p>Unless we prioritise it and resource it, modal shift simply will not happen.<\/p><p> The second principle, people-focused mobility, looks at how we can make sustainable mobility options accessible to everyone.  While a key priority under this principle is ensuring accessibility for people with reduced mobility, we should not forget that accessibility also extends to social inclusion.  Universally accessible, affordable, and reliable transport makes a big difference to our quality of life.  If we focus on the needs of those who are most vulnerable, we can improve the experience for everyone.  This principle will also examine how we can better engage with stakeholders.  The Department is committed to working closely with all our stakeholders as we seek to deliver the new policy.<\/p><p> Our final principle, better integrated mobility, looks at better integrating transport and land use planning, as well as examining smart transport solutions.  We want to create neighbourhoods where everyday amenities can be reached easily by foot or bike.  We want to ensure such neighbourhoods are connected and develop in areas where public transport services are available to link them to larger towns and cities.  However, integration is not just about land use; it is also about innovative services that support quick and easy transfers between different transport modes.  Importantly, legislation and regulation will need to safely integrate emerging technologies like e-scooters within the transport network.<\/p><p> Clearly we need to put these principles into practice and to do that we have developed ten high-level goals for our ten-year framework.  Within that fits our five-year action plan.  We will revisit this action plan midway through the policy to measure how we are delivering on our goals.  That will allow us to take stock, update actions and add new ones if necessary.  This action plan will keep our feet to the fire and hold the Department to account for the successful delivery of the policy.  While I should emphasise that the draft policy framework remains subject to ministerial and Government approval, the publication of the finalised policy is planned before the end of the year.  However, publication is only the beginning.  Achieving the necessary shift to sustainable mobility will require both individual and collective effort.  We will continue to work with our stakeholders, at national, regional, and local levels as we carry out these actions and to support others in our collective efforts to deliver the policy&rsquo;s outcomes.  Together we can create the necessary changes in the transport sector to reduce our climate impact.  I hope my remarks have given the committee a useful overview of our work to date and I look forward to our discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenneth Spratt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":821,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Spratt and thank him for the work he does on behalf of us all.  To broaden the debate a little, when it comes to climate change there is pretty widespread acceptance that it is an important feature of life and will be important moving into the future.  While people have bought into the concept of climate change and the necessity to change, most believe somebody else's area needs to change first.  The transport sector believes it should be somebody else carrying the pain and it is the same with agriculture.  There is a dilemma.  Where I see the difficulty with the work ahead of transport is the urban-rural divide.  I am just flagging some of the issues; I do not have the solutions.  Further investment in infrastructure in densely populated areas will get a significant return on investment.  It becomes far more difficult in rural areas, such as the ones I know best.  It has been suggested that changing the planning rules or regulations will solve the problem but it is not going to do it by 2030 or 2050 because many of these areas are already settled communities.  While Local Link is a good service, it is not used to the extent that it could be or is resourced to.  We see Local Link services all over the country with relatively poor uptake.  They play an important role for some young people, people with disabilities and certain marginalised members within communities.  That is a test of public transport in rural areas and the people behind it are doing well but it is not getting the kind of uptake that would have any meaningful impact on reducing individual vehicular traffic on the roads.  I am not suggesting that Mr. Spratt is taking a one-size-fits-all approach but instead of attempting to use public transport as a system to solve all our problems would we be better off trying to encourage a greater use of electric vehicles in those regions?  Should we skew the supports for electric vehicles to areas other than the city?  When we started off talking about electric cars, Mr. Spratt always said the run-around car, the second car in the home that does 8,000 km to 10,000 km a year, could be electric because of the range.  Should our efforts be focused on looking at those electric vehicles with a broader spread of population and give special targeted supports there?<\/p> <p>  Have we looked at the emergence of hydrogen or are we looking at it at all?  The ESB has identified hydrogen as a method of storage of energy.  Part of its ten-year plan is to capture a lot of wind energy off the Atlantic Ocean and use that energy at a time the demand is not great on the grid.  It will develop or create green hydrogen, store it and use it at a later stage.  There is a lot of talk around the world about the use of hydrogen as a liquid fuel for the future.  Are we playing a part in that or looking at it?  Heavy goods vehicles, for example, are big burners of diesel.  They are significant contributors to our emissions.  The road haulage people provide good information.  The latest trucks are quite compliant and they have reduced their emissions in a big way but that has to go to the next stage.  Is that hydrogen?  We met with Bus &Eacute;ireann recently, which is testing three buses in this space.<\/p> <p>  I am a little concerned that when we talk about modal shift and the necessity of looking at the way we travel, a lot of focus is on public transport, walking and cycling.  While that is wonderful, it misses to some extent the issues from a rural perspective.  BusConnects will get a considerable measure of activity within urban areas and we can put in more rail or light rail in some of the smaller cities.  That will work but in villages that are satellites to county towns enough buses cannot be put on the road to resolve the complexity of people's transport needs.  I live in a village in east Clare, in a development of 50 houses, and each of the two people in most of the houses goes in every direction, from Tipperary to Galway to Cork to Ennis to Shannon, every day.  The Department is not going to be able to provide a bus service to Tulla that will meet the complex needs of the way people have chosen to base themselves in rural Ireland.  Close to a big city running a bus from Rathfarnham into the city centre, getting the frequency and the connections right will cover 90% of the demand.  It is a different issue in rural areas and people there get concerned when they hear the stick of trying to get cars off the road because they recognise that there is not an obvious mix.  It is not cycling, walking or e-scooters and it is not buses.  That is just my tuppence ha'penny on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#E00200","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":822,"content":"<p>There is nothing in what the Senator said that I disagree with.  We have significant challenges ahead.  It is the case that we would get much better value for money and much bigger bang for our buck in cities.  There is no doubt about that.  Our approaches to 2030 and 2050 are almost parallel.  Our approach to 2030 will be around maximising and getting as many electric vehicles, EVs, on the road as we possibly can.  We have to try to get 960,000 EVs on the road by 2030.  There will also be a bit around biofuels in terms of diesel and petrol and there will be a bit about trying to educe the demand for car journeys using internal combustion engine, ICE, cars.  The key point the Senator makes around value for money in urban areas being much better than in rural areas is true.  We will roll out the Connecting Ireland initiative.<\/p><p>The pilot projects that we rolled out in Leitrim, for example, have gone really well.  That will require a significant increase in the public service obligation, PSO, funding for rural areas.  Based on the strategic approach that we have taken to rural transport and working with stakeholders like the HSE, for example, and understanding what are the needs of people during the day, evening and night, and where do they want to get to and from where, the Connecting Ireland pilot project has gone very well.<\/p><p> We have managed to secure in the budget significant additional resources for 2022 to roll out more pilot schemes.  We will learn a lot from those.  It is our intention that we would have a Connecting Ireland facility and service throughout all of Ireland in all rural areas.  There is a strong commitment, from Government, for that.<\/p><p> I would hope that we will make very good progress and that people would, as the services are rolled out, think whether a particular service meets their needs.  There might be a need for a bit of a sacrifice and people may have to leave a little earlier or later.  We hope, however, that we can get a better bang for our buck in terms of our PSO investments in the Connecting Ireland scheme in rural areas.<\/p><p> There is an opportunity in terms of hydrogen.  We have just set up a sixth assistant secretary area within the Department.  This is something I did when I came in and took over because I felt that we needed to look at all aspects of climate action.  We are recruiting at the moment for a lead for that area.  We have four principal officers in there who are doing all of the thinking that we need to do around making sure that we achieve the objectives that have been set for us by the Government and the Oireachtas and that we do it in as just a way as possible.  One of the things that we are looking at is the establishment of an office of low-emitting vehicles in the context of private vehicles and heavy goods vehicles.  There is a significant opportunity for hydrogen, as well as compressed natural gas and biomethane.<\/p><p> The Department is responsible for ports infrastructure.  One of the things that we are doing is working quite closely with our colleagues in the Departments of Environment, Climate and Communications and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We also work closely with our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who have responsibility for the Irish Maritime Development Office and what happens at sea.  We want to make sure that ports are fit for purpose when it comes to harvesting the opportunity that presents with offshore renewable energy.  There is a very significant opportunity not just to power the country but to get into using hydrogen, particularly as a transport fuel.<\/p><p> I accept that the challenges that lie ahead in terms of rural mobility and access will be tough nuts to crack.  However, we have some good ideas on how to make progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenneth Spratt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":824,"content":"<p>We have always talked about the way that the Government works.  It is departmental and sometimes there is a silo mentality for all sorts of reasons, some of which are good.  There is an opportunity for the Department to get involved in the area of school transport.  Those of us around this table who represent rural areas spend most of August, September and October each year arguing with the Department about whether people are a mile or two miles closer to where they need to be.  If a child lives 2 yd or 100 yd closer to a school, he or she does not qualify for the school bus, he or she cannot get a ticket and he or she has to be driven to school by someone..<\/p> <p>  At some point, and it does not necessarily have to come from the budget of the Department of Education, there should be a climate change initiative to change the mindset of those who use the service and give the service free to everybody.  There would be a cost, but there are a couple of aspects involved.  There are many costs that the Department incurs in order to provide infrastructure for all sorts of other things.  The Department could make sure that every child who lives in close proximity to a school and whose house the bus passes would be collected.  Some families live 100 m too close to a school and, as a result, the children cannot get the bus.  This is despite the fact that there might be space on the bus, and there are plenty of buses out there.  If people see buses being used every day, it will get them used to the notion of using public transport right from the very start and will broaden the reach of the service.<\/p> <p>  Is there a cost?  Yes.  When you go to the Department of Education, it states that it cannot afford what is proposed because there is a need for more special needs assistants or whatever.  I suggest that the Department of Transport should look at school transport in terms of it being a climate change initiative and getting people into the habit of getting on buses.  It should seek to break down the impediments that are there are look at the matter from a long-term perspective.  The latter would result in their being a lot less traffic.  If you go to any primary and secondary school in a rural area, the big demand from the school principal will be in respect of more parking spaces or a turning bay to facilitate all of the cars used to transport children to and from school.  It would be of great if we could get that right.<\/p> <p>  There are initiatives in this regard.  Senator Garvey is not with us but she was very involved in the green schools programme before she was elected to the Seanad.  I urge the Department to work in the context of the existing initiatives from a transport perspective because there is an opportunity here to change mindsets.  It is like getting somebody to purchase an electric car.  As soon as people do so, you really have them.  They will then start looking at insulating their homes and making considerable investments on the journey towards carbon neutrality.  My suggestion is around that aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#F00200","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":825,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

I was a member D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which I think has been quite topical recently.  In 2010, I was elected the cycling champion of the county council.  That did not mean I was any good at cycling, it just meant I was supposed to promote cycling, which was far less fashionable then than it is now.  Also, I was chair of the council's transport strategic policy committee, SPC, before I was elected to the Seanad in 2016.  Therefore, I bring a certain amount of experience and knowledge to this debate.  I can talk a lot about transport, and probably not from the same perspective as Senator Dooley and other members who are based in more rural areas.  I am based in Dublin and I cycled here today.  I passed by the offices of the Department on Leeson Street, which is part of the most treacherous stretch of my journey.  I had to weave my way across Leeson Street and St. Stephen's Green before getting onto Kildare Street.  The journey in question is not for the faint-hearted, but I did it and managed to get here.<\/p> <p>  I support all of the improvements to cycling infrastructure, but I have reservations about some of them.  There was a pilot project on the road with which I am most familiar - Goatstown Road - where wands were installed and concrete strips.  A number of people have told me that they have tripped or fell over those strips or that they nearly fell over them..  Somebody was injured as a result of their being there.  I know people who been distracted or injured by the wands, which are very narrow.  They serve a purpose in parts and are very useful, particularly at traffic lights, but I am not sure we need so many of them because cyclists end up being corralled into a very narrow space.  If somebody in front of a cyclist is moving slower, then the latter is trapped and cannot get around that individual.  It is unfortunate that some people are bad drivers because it is as a result of their behaviour on the roads that so many of these wands are needed.<\/p> <p>  We should think longer term and consider what has been done in London, where there are quiet greenways through residential areas and permeability through estates that are not connected by road but are connected by walkways.  We should open up those kinds of areas and allow people who are less comfortable with bicycles to get cycling again.  I had not cycled in 20 years until I got back on a bike in 2010.  Now I cycle more often than I drive.  My national car test, NCT, last year showed that I had driven only 1,000 miles during previous 12 months.  Admittedly, there was a lockdown and I had lost my seat but I drove a very small amount and cycled far more.<\/p> <p>  In terms a modal shift, if somebody has paid &euro;70,000 for a Land Rover or some other expensive car, it is hard to argue against the person using it.  There is an element of using both the carrot and the stick here.  The most efficient way to reach Leinster House within, at a minimum, a six-mile radius, is by cycling because it is quicker.  I live in Goatstown.  I can walk to the nearest Luas stop, get a tram and then walk to Leinster House, which takes approximately 45 minutes.  Of coursed, that is if there are no delays with the Luas.  However, I can make the same journey by bicycle in 17 to 19 minutes if I am lucky.  An awful lot of people do not know that cycling is far quicker.<\/p> <p>  The bike-to-work scheme has been good, but it has meant that people have bought very expensive bikes.<\/p><p>In addition, only people within the PAYE system can use that mechanism.  People need to be aware that the amount the Exchequer would need to spend to get people to move to bicycles is so much less than the cost of a Luas line, so much less than public transport and so much less than anything else.  The more bikes we get onto the road, the more cars will be taken off the road in many cases.<\/p><p> I come from the constituency of Dublin Rathdown.  That is where I live, it is where the Minister for Transport lives, it is the constituency he used to represent, it is the constituency the deputy leader of the Green Party represents and I see a downgrading of the Luas upgrade.  The green line southbound is pretty much full already.  Pre-pandemic it was full.  We have Cherrywood coming on stream.  We have increases in Sandyford, with high-density developments, at the Central Mental Hospital and in Goatstown, Sandyford, Carrickmines and Cherrywood.  People getting on at Dundrum and going up to Sandyford had to cross over the track pre-pandemic.  I would like to know where we are going on that.<\/p><p> We will have a second round of questioning.  E-scooters are, in the context of the climate, not as efficient as pedal bikes but certainly much better in that they use much less road space and energy than a diesel or petrol car.  What is the status of e-scooters?  I have had representations from people saying the limits we are talking about are used only in Sweden and Portugal and are too low for the robust scooters that are required.  We need a modal shift.  We need people to realise that cycling is far better and far safer than they might think.  However, we also need to provide the infrastructure to train people up, to get people used to cycling and to get them confident in cycling.  We need to bring the public with us with public consultation if we are to do what was done on the coastal mobility route in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  The witnesses will have seen the controversy regarding what is going on in Deansgrange.  Equally, there is the Strand Road issue.  How do we convince people, planners and the courts that these are a good idea?  In some cases they are not always a good idea.  I have seen bus lanes proposed that were the worst in the world and were opposed by people who lived in my area and who were former chief executives of CI&Eacute; and former Secretaries General of Departments involved with public transport because they just would not work.  Sometimes a bus lane cannot fit into a particular area.  The road is too narrow and it just will not work.<\/p><p> As for quality bus corridors, I am very familiar with the Stillorgan QBC.  It was an amazing success.  The Luas was an amazing success.  People are willing to change.  There was no traffic on the Luas pre-2004.  It did not exist.  There was no one on that corridor.  It jammed every day bringing thousands of people in and out of Sandyford and all along that route, and I am very concerned about it.  How do we get a modal shift?  What is happening to the Luas green line upgrade, which is essential?  The capacity that is needed is not available..  In a post-pandemic world the Luas green line will be full, before Cherrywood kicks off properly, Carrickmines and Sandyford expand significantly and all the developments on infill sites along that line, through Dundrum, Milltown and various other parts of the line.  It is there, the people want to use it and they want to make the change.  If, however, they cannot even get on the Luas, what do they do?  They go back into their cars.  I apologise for that long rant, but it is important we convince people of that modal shift.<\/p><p> The security of bikes is hugely problematic.  I can cycle into Leinster House and leave my bike here.  It is the safest place in Ireland to leave a bike, without a doubt.  However, many people do not cycle because they do not know, when they come out of a restaurant or out of their workplace, if they will find their bike still there.  It is a major problem and needs to be dealt with in many different ways.  Employers such as restaurants and shops need to provide better facilities, for example, bike lockers and car parks, including supervised car parks where employees can register and store their bikes.  Whatever it takes, it needs to be done because we need to get people out of their cars and into other forms of transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#F00600","speaker":"1696","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":830,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleague, Mr. Doocey, to cover the green line Luas.

We looked for significantly more than that when we put in our pitch to the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance for the national development plan.

As he will probably be aware, the Luas green line capacity enhancement project finished this year.  That has expanded the capacity to the Sandyford depot, first and foremost.  It has extended all 26 existing trams to 55 m.  We have also introduced eight new 55 m trams, which extends the capacity by approximately 30%.  It is not an exact science.  There is a second phase under consideration as well.  That will extend the capacity on the Luas green line.  That is about increasing the pathways on the southern section into St. Stephen's Green.  There are probably some works required around the platforms at St. Stephen's Green.  That is a second phase, which will bring in and of itself an additional significant bonus to capacity.  I just do not have the percentage in my head at the minute.  They are the two immediate and medium-term requirements on the Luas green line.

The sustainable mobility policy, as it has been presented to us, is quite a radical document.  It really is radical in a good way.  Putting universal design principles and the hierarchy of road users central to its goals is very important.  It will be about applying them in practice.  The national development plan was launched last week.  Many of the major rows ended up being about roads, cars and congestion.  We need to have a modal shift.<\/p> <p>  I want to talk about people with disabilities and how the disability sector engages with the Department and how the Department engages with the disability sector.  It is at the very top, along with pedestrians and cyclists, of the hierarchy of the road user model.  We speak about journeys of great distance and commuting journeys.  We talk about needing to make cycle lanes.  I live in Swords.  I do not feel safe cycling from Swords into town.  Twenty years ago, I witnessed a fatality in Dublin city centre.  It had a huge impact on me and where and how I cycle.  I used to rip up and down the quays going to see my nana on Oliver Bond Street after school.  Ever since, the thoughts of cycling into town have been very difficult.  What are we doing to make it safer to cycle into Dublin city centre from distances of 23 km or 24 km away, such as where I live in Swords and areas such as the Donabate-Portrane peninsula?  Hearse Road is not a cycle friendly route.  It is the primary access route in and out of Donabate and Portrane.  What are we doing in respect of infrastructure of that nature?<\/p> <p>  Getting back to people with disabilities, sometimes the biggest challenge is just getting to the bus stop.  The dishing of a path can be a big barrier to accessing a wheelchair-accessible bus.  People cannot get to the actual bus stop.  These are the things we need to get right from the very start.  Having the disability sector included and having people with disabilities central to all of this planning is vital.<\/p> <p>  It was great to hear that MetroLink is included.  I have a problem with the use of the term \"megaprojects\".  It invites negative commentary.  Speaking about megaprojects is like some kind of Discovery Channel TV show such as \"Megastructures\"  There is the idea that they are some kind of elective and almost vanity projects.  These are all needed projects.  BusConnects, MetroLink and DART+ are vital.  They are as vital as the Luas and everything else.  I have an issue with the language used.<\/p> <p>  With regard to electric vehicles, Senator Dooley raised an excellent point on the realities of living in villages.  On Monday, I was speaking to people in Garristown and transport was mentioned.  I represent a constituency that is rural, urban and commuting.  Garristown is a rural village.  Transport was involved in every issue that came up, such as, for example, better bus services.  The reality is that people in Garristown will need their cars for many years.  We need an improved bus service.  Electric vehicle take-up needs to be incentivised because these vehicles are still very expensive.  The year 2030 will arrive in the blink of an eye.  If we are to meet the targets we need to look at scrappage schemes.  This is something the Minister has pushed back on.  I can understand this but we have to start planning for scrappage schemes to incentivise people with regard to electric vehicles.<\/p> <p>  I echo the points made by Senator Dooley.  There are villages that development plans incentivise for people to live in.  People are being told to come and live in a particular beautiful village and commute into Limerick, Ennis or Swords.  We cannot incentivise this in development plans and not provide transport by means of buses, where necessary.  If we are to move to electric vehicles, then these people and their homes should be prioritised.<\/p> <p>  The points on school transport were well made.  With regard to the welcome half-price public transport initiative announced by the Government in the budget, what will be the technical impediments to this?  Will it be a Dublin-centred scheme for people with Leap cards?  What about the vast majority of the country that does not have access to Leap cards?  We put forward a plan for a pilot scheme for free travel because we are concerned about the technical impediments of bringing on board this scheme.  Not every transport provider is linked up to the Leap card system. I will be interested to hear if Mr. Spratt can shed any light on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#H00400","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":854,"content":"<p>There was quite a bit in that.  I will touch on as many of the questions as I can and I might need some help from colleagues.  With regard to the disability sector and people with disabilities, for a number of years every public transport service provider has had make sure new infrastructure or new vehicles are accessible.  Thankfully, it is the case that all relatively new vehicles are accessible.  Some retrofitting is also being done.  We are very alert to the hard infrastructure.  It also needs to be supported by soft schemes.  We have the Just a Minute card so people boarding public transport services can give the driver an indication they need a bit more time.  We also have the travel assistance scheme, whereby assistance is provided by some of the transport service providers to people who need help embarking or disembarking.  There is also disability awareness training for all of the drivers.  We very much acknowledge that we need to up our game and we are working as hard as we can to make sure we do so.<\/p> <p>  The point on mega programmes is interesting.  I had not seen it that way.  For us, they are massive projects.  Some of the programmes involve multiple projects and huge amounts of money.  For us they are mega, but I can see were the Deputy is coming from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenneth Spratt"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":855,"content":"<p>I might be hypersensitive to it and I am aware of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#H00600","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":856,"content":"<p>It is a point very well made.<\/p> <p>  With regard to electric vehicles and Garristown, I live close enough to Garristown.  It is the case that people in north County Dublin and other rural areas around all of the cities in the country will need to use their private vehicles for some time to come.  We want to try to get 960,000 electric vehicles out by 2030.  There is a question as to how we incentivise.  A scrappage scheme is something that can be considered further.  Again, we have to make sure that we maximise value for money and that we assist those who need assistance but that we avoid assisting people who might not necessarily need that assistance and who, potentially, could buy their own vehicles without Government aid.<\/p> <p>  The point on development plans is very interesting.  What we have at present is predominantly road-based development, whereby many houses and commercial entities follow the roads.  To be perfectly honest, many roads have many political champions.  Sustainable mobility has less political championing.  What we will try to achieve is having transport-led development, whereby development, whether housing or commercial operations, would evolve around sustainable mobility projects and public transport projects.  This is something of which we are very mindful.  This is not to say that in the example the Deputy gave we are ignoring the fact people still need their vehicles.  Our preference is that if they are using vehicles that they are electric vehicles.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the technical impediments to the youth travel card, this was something raised with us quite close to the budget.  We now have to put on our thinking caps to see how we get it out to as many people as possible aged between 19 and 23 throughout the country and not just those who are in cities.  This is something we are working on along with colleagues in the transport agencies.  There are some issues with the supply of the cards, which are related to the chip industry, the global demand for chips and the shortage of supply.  This is another challenge we will have to grapple with.

I have a few questions.  I am broadly supportive of the policy intent.  In terms of climate and the role of transport, compact growth and transport-led development are concepts that we will hear much more about in future.  As such, it is an important policy area.<\/p> <p>  I wish to discuss some of the barriers encountered to date and the Department's experience.  Is it almost the case that the Department has more money than it can spend?  Was there a carry-over this year?  What has been the experience of spending the money that has been available?  Do local authorities have the capacity, culture and organisation to develop and deliver on these projects?  Is the planning system fit for purpose and well aligned with these projects?  The Minister has spoken about introducing proposals in that regard.  Are the NTA, the Department and local authorities sufficiently staffed?  While I was a member of a local authority, I saw such projects being delivered but also resistance to them from a various perspectives.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask about the challenges in the Irish context.  It was mentioned that the Department was developing some ideas that might fit the Irish context.  A number of committee members have spoken about our particular spatial distributions and the nature of our settlements, that being, urban, rural and everything in between.  As has been mentioned, the services that we currently have are underutilised in many places and do not meet their needs.  I can point to specific instances in my constituency where we fought for bus services and, although services were put on, they were not the ones for which we asked.  They went to the wrong places from the wrong places and were underused.  Where is the Department going with Connecting Ireland and how will it assess what the appropriate service for a place is?<\/p> <p>  I do not know whether the Department received a copy of the report of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  We heard from many witnesses with international experience of making progress on these issues.  There is the concept of every village, every hour.  I do not know whether that is achievable in the Irish context, but it would improve on the services currently available through Local Link - perhaps Local Link could deliver it - to the point that people could set their clocks by them.  Some services are underutilised because they do not meet the needs of the people in those areas.  If the Department reconfigured services to meet people's needs, those services would be used.  The experience with good public transport is that it is used.  We have seen that with Luas and a pile of other transport methods.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#J00500","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":865,"content":"<p>I might call on Mr. Doocey to discuss Connecting Ireland and how we will assess it.<\/p> <p>  There was a great deal in the Deputy's questions.  We will have some carry-over for next year.  At the start of this year, which is the first full calendar year of this Government, we had &euro;360 million to spend on active travel.  There was a bit of catching up to do by local authorities in recruiting human resources to do this work.  Our outturn will get close to that figure by the end of the year.  There will be a push between now and then.  We are spending significantly more on active travel this year compared with last year and a huge amount compared with two years ago.  However, there has been a struggle in recruiting the capacity to deliver active travel.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, we have done well in terms of not having underspends.  Our spending is lumpy and quite a great deal goes out between now and the end of the year, but we have done well in handing back very small percentages.  Last year or the year before, it was a fraction of 1% of our total budget.  We are not bad when it comes to underspending.  We will have a little underspend this year, but we are trying to ensure that it is as small as possible.<\/p> <p>  Regarding local authorities' culture and resources, it is now clear that there is &euro;360 million per year for the next number of years to be spent on active travel.  That is more or less guaranteed and ring-fenced.  Therefore, local authorities know that they can recruit, ramp up and roll out.  While this year will be good, the Deputy will see us getting better and better and getting every euro out the door over the coming years.  We are working closely with the local authorities to ensure that happens.<\/p> <p>  There are always issues with the planning system.  The Deputy will be aware that a review, which the Attorney General will be well resourced to carry out, is under way to examine the areas where there are not so much legislative impediments, but where legislation can be improved to ensure that, when it comes to the roll-out of important infrastructure, the planning system delivers in the way it should and in a way that protects the rights of people who want to object and have their voices heard.  That review will be sharp and focused and done in a relatively short period.<\/p> <p>  As to whether we have enough staff, all Departments and agencies have sought significant additional resources in their Estimates campaigns with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We sought a significant number of additional people for ourselves and all of our agencies.  We did not get all that we looked for, but we did okay.  We were also allowed to capitalise the human resources costs on some of our larger projects.  While the projects were not given additional current funding, they can use their capital allocations for contractors who will be required for short periods.<\/p> <p>  The Irish context is always a challenge.  We are the second or third least densely populated country in the world.  That is a challenge in the provision of public services.  We will need to work hard on the design of Connecting Ireland.  I will hand over to Mr. Doocey in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenneth Spratt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":866,"content":"<p>Connecting Ireland is very much in the vein of the contributions the Deputy would have heard at the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action on rural transportation and what needs to be done.  He is correct about the need for different approaches for rural and urban contexts, as was alluded to by Senator Dooley.  Connecting Ireland will go out to public consultation before the end of the year.  The plan is about trying to connect settlements at the smallest scale in rural Ireland into the broader network of transport between larger towns, regional growth centres and their nearest cities.  It is also about providing opportunities for people to access services, for example, shopping, leisure, retail and employment, through public transport.  It is a positive development.  As Mr. Spratt mentioned, a pilot is under way in Leitrim.  It is an example at a local scale of the intent behind Connecting Ireland.  The results have been positive in terms of passenger growth and overall numbers utilising the services.

One is pushed from Billy to Jack and people say they are not responsible for that area.  When I see that I wonder where the overall focus is.

There are a number of points I would like to make.  With regard to electric vehicles, there has been a very good discussion so far but a number of members have mentioned some of the hesitancy about buying an electric vehicle, putting it on the road and everything involved.  I will be very frank.  One of the things that puts me off is the lack of infrastructure.  I recently met a number of forecourt operators in Clare.  They tell me that fast-charging electric vehicle charge points cost in the region of &euro;250,000 per unit.  That is a substantial outlay for them to invest in as they would have to take out the old petrol and diesel pumps and put in these units.  That needs to be incentivised because it is a bit of a chicken and egg situation at the moment.  I will probably be looking at changing my car in the next number of years and while I would love to say that I will move to an electric vehicle, I do not think the infrastructure is there.  A lot of people will be a little hesitant until that infrastructure is there.  Those who are currently driving electric vehicles are almost like pioneers.  They have a good home set-up, with a good charge point at home, and most of them probably have a fairly good set-up in their workplace.  For everything in between, there is a bit of a risk element to taking off in that car and trying to head across Ireland and cover serious mileage on the road.  We will only see that seismic change in public opinion and in consumer decision-making when we have that infrastructure in place.<\/p> <p>  Like anyone, every so often I browse through DoneDeal and various online sales sites.  When looking at electric vehicles for sale there, one just does not fully know what quality of vehicle one is getting.  Of course we have the NCT and that is one metric of how good a vehicle is but maybe we need some form of certification for what is under the bonnet in terms of batteries and electrics.  This is probably a poor analogy.  I am thinking of the BER certification, where there is a grading of A to F for how good a house is in energy terms.  Perhaps we need something in that regard because batteries have a lifespan and if people are going to buy an electric vehicle second-hand, they need to know that it is not near the end of a ten-year cycle and that there are more years in it.  That is off-putting for people at the moment.  Perhaps that is something the Department might look at.<\/p> <p>  When e-scooters first appeared they were a real head-turner.  People would talk about someone passing them while whizzing down the road on an e-scooter but now they are very much part of everyday life and are here to stay.  The fabulous thing about them is that they give people of a younger age a bit of independence from their parents to go down to hurling training, pop over to their friend's house or to go to college.  It is great and legislation is coming into play now that will make it a bit safer and more regulated.  Again there is an infrastructural deficiency there for e-scooters.  There is an opportunity to have public e-scooters in larger towns and cities and I have spoken to some people about trialling them in cities, as well as in some regional towns like Ennis, where they could be used as an alternative way of nipping in around the town centre and getting to the outskirts of a town.  That is something that needs to be trialled.<\/p> <p>  At the moment, in the Government and in the Department, there is a 2:1 ratio of spending on public infrastructure versus roads.  I have my own thoughts on that.  It is very nice to load the bikes into the boot of the car and head off to the local greenway with the kids at the weekend but for Monday to Friday, getting to work and doing the school runs the road infrastructure of our country is crucial.  There are projects both within the national development plan and outside it that local authorities are going to bring to the Department's attention over the next number of years and I hope the Department will continue to push them along.  It is important that they are there.  This is not Amsterdam or the lowlands of Holland or Luxembourg where there is an immense network of public infrastructure, flat terrain and focal points of villages and towns.  Ireland by its very nature is quite scattered in how it has been developed over the years and we need a road infrastructure to bring people in from the peripheral parts of counties into town centres and up to cities.  Road infrastructure is a major part of that.<\/p> <p>  The next point I wish to raise relates to Irish Rail.  For the last eight months I have become a bit of a convert to using the train.  I will use it this evening to go back to Clare and will bike and train home.  I have a few points on that.  It is frustrating that the last trains operating in Ireland are around 8.30 p.m. or 9 p.m.  There is merit to having a late-night service for getting people from one part of the country to another.  The train would not have to be five carriages long.  It could be one carriage or two, taking off at 11 p.m. or midnight and bringing people across the country.  There would need to be a driver and an inspector on the train and someone at the other end managing the station.  It would make public transport even more attractive.  This is a small island but public transport virtually shuts down at a certain hour of the evening and that needs to be looked at.<\/p> <p>  I have rail transport sussed out now.  When I first started using the train I was paying extortionate prices for tickets but now I buy my ticket a few days in advance when the D&aacute;il schedule comes out each week.  If one is lucky one will get a &euro;13 one-way fare and it is very economical, very fast and very reliable.  Contrast that with trying to bring a family of two adults and three kids from County Clare up to Dublin Zoo at the weekend using Irish Rail.  I did a calculation of this a while ago.  To go this Saturday with a family of two adults and three children would cost &euro;177 return.  That is crazy.  That was always a rite of passage.  I do not know what it was like for people living in Dublin but certainly in the west of Ireland it was a rite of passage for the family to get on a train and there was a buzz about getting that early morning train up to the zoo and back home again.  That is now impossible, meaning more people are back in the car.  We need to look at the costing model of Irish Rail and public transport because that is simply unviable.  People could fly to Manchester or London, or even the Balearic Islands, for that kind of cost. <\/p> <p>  I am concerned about the national development plan.  There has been a debate over the last week about what will see the light of day and how long it will take these projects to develop.  I am not so concerned about the document of the national development plan, the wording of it and its structure.  What I am most concerned about is the law, the policy and the frameworks that relate to public consultations and objections, and the hold-ups for all these projects.  The Killaloe bypass is County Clare, which was mentioned yesterday in the budget speech, is in the national development plan.  That was held up for years by a man - I think I am allowed to mention his name as this is in the public domain - called Peter Sweetman, of The Swans and the Snails Limited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#K00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":871,"content":"<p>Be careful about naming someone who is not present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#K00300","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":872,"content":"<p>Of course I will be but this is factual.

If the Department were developing a BusConnects project in Dublin, I would think it would be utterly wrong for me as someone living in County Clare to hold up a Dublin project.  Yet, it is possible for someone on the other side of Ireland to hold up key infrastructure in County Clare.  That kind of process that has slowed things down has to end.<\/p> <p>  There was mention of school transport.  In July and August in whatever town or city in Ireland one can nip from one side of it to the other very quickly because schools are closed.  That tells us that most of the traffic congestion every day, more than 50%, is down to school runs.  That is at peak times.  I was a schoolteacher for 16 years.  There was a small road in Parteen that would have no cars on it all day but at 8.50 a.m. we would have 300 cars going up it.  That is crazy.  We tried to deal with that in many ways over the years.  This is just an anecdote from Parteen but this could be replicated anywhere in Ireland.  We went to Bus &Eacute;ireann and said we had 100 kids coming from the Westbury housing estate so could we get a bus to go up and down doing two collections.  Bus &Eacute;ireann came out and measured and looked at its maps and said that for various reasons we could not because there was another school nearer.  That is wrong.  The sooner the Department of Transport gets its own hands on school transportation away from the Department of Education the better because it is being viewed through one lens and it is utterly impractical.  Imagine the difference it would make to have two bus runs in the morning bringing those kids up and dropping them back.  It would free up parents to have options for getting to work or working from home and it would take so many cars off the road.  In July and August one can get around most places in the country very quickly.  We need to embrace school transportation but the Department of Transport needs to get its hands on it as opposed to the Department of Education.  I have raised a lot of issues there but I hope they can be responded to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#K00400","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":873,"content":"<p>I will try my best.  In his initial remarks, the Deputy mentioned EV hesitancy and the lack of infrastructure and charging points.  That is a challenge for us.  The electric vehicle policy pathway proposed that we establish of an office of low emitting vehicles, OLEV.  We are doing that.  We will be putting significant resources into that office.  We accept that we need to up our game when it comes to charging points.  The OLEV will look at incentives for installation of charging infrastructure for high-density residential areas.  For example, where there are apartment blocks in which there may be up to 100 residents and ten of them are owners of EVs, how we ensure that they can charge overnight is one of the issues we will look at.  We will also look at charging points in visitor attractions to ensure that we provide some incentive and cover some of the cost in order that it makes sense for that infrastructure to be put in place.  People need to know that if they choose to visit a particular place they might have to wait a short while, but they will be able to plug in and charge up.  The concern the Deputy raised is one we are alert to.  I accept that we need to make sure we address it.  The OLEV will also look at the second-hand market for EVs to give people assurances around the purchase of such vehicles, again, so that people do not have questions around the reliability of the vehicle and so on.<\/p> <p>  The suggestion with regard to e-scooters is interesting.  A company that is new to Ireland is looking at introducing some sort of e-scooter scheme similar to the Dublin Bikes scheme.  There is a market opportunity there.  Based on what I have seen, that opportunity will be harvested by the commercial market.  We will see how that goes.  On Irish Rail, the Deputy's anecdote on the cost to him to bring a spouse and children to Dublin hits home.  It is fairly compelling.  It is an issue on which we will have to engage with the CIE group of companies to see what can be done at relatively short notice to ensure that prices are not as high as they are at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned the planning review being undertaken by the Attorney General in respect of making sure that people who have legitimate concerns can raise them.  Important projects being held up by objections which, once they go through are unfounded or, at least, the final arbitration decides that they are without merit, is one all Ministers and Departments are alert to.  I expect that the review by the Attorney General would help us to address some of the issues there.  <\/p> <p>  The issue raised by Senator Dooley in his initial contribution and by Deputy Cathal Crowe as well in regard to the school run piece is coming across loudly and clearly today.  I will take it up with my counterpart, the Secretary General at the Department of Education.  There seems to be an opportunity there for us to harvest.  I will engage with my counterpart and try to figure out how we can do that better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#L00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenneth Spratt"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":874,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Spratt.  There are two areas where the Department of Transport can act, the first being school transport which he addressed.  The second is trains.  MKIV trains have been largely been purchased from Spain in recent years.  They are heavy duty trains.  In other European countries, if people are at a level crossing they will see a train with 20 or 30 carriages passing.  We do not require that in Ireland, but it is reasonable that on the weekend we would have low charging, high carrying trains of, say, ten carriages on the Ennis-Limerick-Dublin route.  There is an economy in that.  Currently, rail travel is disincentivised.  Most families in Ireland look to Ryanair when they want a break; they certainly do not look to Irish Rail.<\/p> <p>  I refer again to the car journey.  Most Senators and Deputies know exactly door-to-door what their car journeys cost because they make those journeys every day.  From my house to the D&aacute;il and back the cost of diesel and tolls is &euro;36.  The cost by train is similar but if I am accompanied by my family there is a fivefold increase.  When an all-Ireland final or concert is held in Dublin, nobody in the west considers taking public transport.  The prohibitive cost makes people turn to the car.

Everything is now predicated on getting reductions in carbon emissions.  We are putting a significant amount into active transport.  A figure of &euro;360 million per year is a substantial amount.  School transport costs approximately &euro;220 million per annum while &euro;360 million is going into active travel.  The question is whether we are getting value for money.  It is a serious amount of money.  It is approximately &euro;1.5 billion within the space of four years.  It is serious money and it is new money.  I am looking at it in the round.

Like everyone else here, I am considering whether my next car will be an electric one.  I would like it to be an electric car.  We meet taxi drivers.  If I am caught for time, I might take a taxi from Heuston Station.  A lot of taxi drivers are switching to electric cars.  The incentives are working.  It is a business for them.  It is their livelihood.  I have gone through it with them.  They have done the figures.  When we are looking at sustainable travel, how much of a focus is there on electric cars in this document?  If we got everyone to switch to electric cars in the morning, how much would we reduce carbon emissions by?  This committee will do a body of work on it.

It is a farce every year in respect of who can access it.  The Chairman mentioned students on concessionary tickets.  A child is meant to get it.

I wish to make a few points.  I remember being on holidays in Hungary some years ago and you could bring your bike into train carriages.  There were seats at either end of the carriage, and you could hang your bike up on a rack in the middle, in the same way as a coat, but it was for bikes.  I am not sure such a facility is on Irish trains at all.  There seems to be limited capacity for bikes.  People must be able to use public transport, cycle to the station and put the bike on the train without necessarily having to pay a fee for it, and be able to get off the other end and use the bike.  I am not sure we are anywhere near being able to provide that.<\/p> <p>  To come back to what we were discussing previously about the Luas, what timeline, if any, is there for the potential for the Luas and MetroLink to Cherrywood in terms of visibility?  I would like to hear a little bit more about how fast BusConnects will roll out.  I would also like to hear the Department&rsquo;s view on public consultation versus engagement.<\/p><p>The public sometimes feels that some consultation is not very well listened to, while at other times, there is more meaningful engagement.  We need to try to bring people with us.  I refer to projects such as those in Strand Road and Deansgrange.  There are many other examples and there will be more.  BusConnects was quite controversial in advance of the latest local elections.  I am absolutely not against it.  I have been around long enough to recall the Stillorgan quality bus corridor, which I mentioned earlier.  Owen Keegan, who has been quite topical in recent days, was a director of traffic in the city in the late 1990s when no one was in favour of the bus corridor yet nobody would give it up now.  There are quite a number of such interventions where people instinctively were not in favour of change, but when it happened they would not go back to the old regime.  I was a member of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in 2008 when a councillor said we should rip up all the cycling lanes because they were taking up valuable space that could be used by cars, but nobody would say that now.  That is not so long ago.<\/p><p> I would like to hear from the Department the status of both the green line upgrade and BusConnects in terms of timelines.  I wish it all the best with everything it is doing.  As for green schools, there are many schools that were not included in that survey and that have never been targeted to participate in the green school project.  There is great potential, particularly in urban areas, for a modal shift away from cars to bikes and, to a certain extent, walking.  When I was going to school, an awful lot of people cycled but a tiny percentage in comparison do that now.  That is probably because the roads are full of huge cars that people are terrified of, but if we could get more bikes on the road, many cars would be taken off the road and replaced with bikes and possibly e-scooters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#Q03100","speaker":"1696","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>I will hand over to Mr. Doocey to comment on MetroLink, the Luas for Cherrywood, BusConnects and their associated timelines.  Public consultation and engagement will be important for us indefinitely but we need to make great progress on it over the next five years in particular.  That is why one of our key people on the climate action side will be focused entirely on genuine public consultation, seeking to understand what makes people tick when it comes to shifting modes.  There will be engagement in order that people will understand that while sacrifices will have to be made by everybody, they should only be asked to make sacrifices they are capable of carrying.  People who have more to give will make greater sacrifices, while those who do not have much to give will not be asked to give more than they should.  That is why a principal officer is looking at that and will draw on the latest research, evidence and modelling in respect of behavioural science and the nudge factor.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Doocey might outline the scheduling of the projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenneth Spratt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634079600,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>To follow on from what Mr. Spratt said about the public consultation, the consultation process in regard to BusConnects, while lengthy, demonstrated a response to queries and issues raised in local communities throughout Dublin.  Those lessons will be applied as BusConnects is rolled out in Cork and the other cities.  It was a positive example of a bilateral engagement between an authority and local communities throughout the city.<\/p> <p>  As for where BusConnects and its roll-out sit within the Department, our core focus is on completing the review of the preliminary business case, which the Minister will bring to the Government.  It is at decision gate 1 in the public spending code and its approval will allow the programme to enter into the planning system.  At a project or programme level, the NTA is finalising the documentation in order that it will be good to go once the approval from the Government comes through.  That will then enter the planning system and, once that concludes, there will be a schedule of delivery.  Not all 16 bus corridors will be introduced at the same time because that would disrupt the city too much.  Instead, there will be a schedule for the programme's roll-out.  The priority on our end is to review the business case, get Government approval and complete the planning and documentation at a project level in order to be ready to enter the planning system.<\/p> <p>  The Senator spoke about his experiences with trains on the Continent.  There are different approaches on the Continent in respect of the use or carriage of bikes on public transport.  In the Netherlands, for example, which we all recognise as a country with a high uptake of cycling, there is a different approach whereby people cycle to the station do not take their bike onto the train and then pick up another bike at the other end.  There are different approaches to how to maximise that last-mile, first-mile mix.  I acknowledge that Hungary, which the Senator mentioned, and Denmark have different approaches as well.  There will be increased bike-carrying capacity on the new DART fleet, for example, although it is probably unfair to call it simply the DART fleet given that it will apply to the commuter fleet in general.  The battery electrics and full electrics, that is, those new units that will be purchased and delivered in the coming years, will have increased bike-carrying capacity as well.<\/p> <p>  As to the green line upgrade, I refer to my earlier comments on the increase in capacity that has been delivered this year.  The medium-term aspect is to increase further the Luas capacity from the south side of Dublin city into St. Stephen's Green.  That will require some works, although they are not significant.  On the longer term ambition of an upgrade and the associated timings, thoughts and considerations will be set out in the greater Dublin area, GDA, transport strategy, which will be published for review before the end of the year.  It will have a suite of background documentation relating to the analysis required by the NTA under statute and the consultation process that will take place.  It will provide an holistic view of what is needed throughout that part of the city for the next 20 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021101300002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garret Doocey"},{"type":"speech","time":1634079600,"counter":1038,"content":"<p>When do we hope the first BusConnects corridor will have been completed, with works done and operational, versus the final one?

Members will always judge a scheme based on the queries brought to them in their constituency.  Queries on this programme came to us in abundance from schools that first contacted us to state that they had applied and, second, in the context of the application being successful or unsuccessful.
