This particular measure came as a shock.  People did not see it coming.  According to the Restaurants Association of Ireland it has resulted in tens of thousands of workers being laid off.<\/p>  <p>  It is now clear that the Government&rsquo;s strategy to deal with this pandemic will involve periods of intensifying restrictions and then relaxing them.  For this to be a successful approach we need very clear communication and to understand that it means no surprises at the eleventh hour.  Above all the Taoiseach needs to ensure that the State and his Government provide the necessary supports for families, for workers and for individuals who find themselves out of work at very short notice because of public health measures.<\/p>  <p>  Last week the Government went ahead with a very mean cut to the pandemic unemployment payment and now more than 156,000 people who were in receipt of &euro;350 a week will see a reduction in their payment of between &euro;50 and &euro;100.  This cut happened precisely 24 hours before the Taoiseach announced these further restrictions on Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  I am also absolutely astounded and gobsmacked at media reports that his Government approved this morning the hiring of ten special advisers for junior Ministers, this being done at a time when he is cutting payments to people in real difficulty who have lost their jobs.  If this is the case it is outrageous and I ask him to clarify this matter.<\/p>  <p>  At a time when sectors of the economy are still closed down or are vulnerable to being closed down again, when thousands of people are out of work, this is not a time to be cutting the very payment upon which they rely to pay their bills and look after their families.  This decision needs to be reviewed immediately and reversed.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach also scrapped the eviction ban in August.<\/p> <p>He replaced it with very weak legislation that provides nothing like the kinds of protections of the original ban and, consequently, has left thousands of renters exposed.  He needs to revisit this decision also and reintroduce the original ban on evictions as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p> There are also some 37,000 households whose mortgage payment break is due to end in the coming days and many thousands of businesses are in the same boat.  This will undoubtedly cause huge hardship for families and businesses up and down the land.  If a further extension of these payment breaks is not granted before 30 September, these families and businesses will fall into default unless they are in a position to meet their full mortgage repayment.  Banks and lending institutions need to act now to ensure that these 37,000 families, and businesses, are not plunged into further financial hardship.  Deputy Martin is the Taoiseach and he needs to act on this matter because the real danger we face now is that people become more terrified of losing their job, their home and not being able to provide for their family than they are of the virus.  That would be the worse possible situation we could walk into.  <\/p> <p> In terms of my asks, I want a reverse to the cut in the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, a reinstatement of the ban on evictions and the extension of mortgage breaks without interest.  The Taoiseach said correctly that we all have to play our part.  I agree with him but the State has to lead from the front.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200003#A00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600778100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>First, it has to be said that the measures taken and announced last Friday were necessary in the public health interest to save lives and to protect people.  The vast majority of people accept the premise upon which those measures were taken and announced, on the advice of our public health doctors and NPHET.  They are necessary to get the numbers down and stabilise the number of cases in Dublin in particular, which had risen too high in recent times.  The same principle applies across the country.  We need to get the numbers down and stabilise numbers across the country.  That can be done by people adhering to the basic public health guidance.  It is important that that happens because, ultimately, we want to keep our schools open, maintain health services and keep as many people as possible at work.  Level 3 is not equivalent to the lockdown we experienced earlier this year in that many sectors of the economy are still working.  It is an important objective of Government to keep as many people working as we possibly can while keeping the numbers down.  The hospitality-tourism sector in particular, along with arts and culture, is bearing the brunt of Covid-19 because it is a disease that in many ways undermines the very nature of tourism and hospitality.  That is a key point.<\/p>  <p>  The PUP originally came in, as the Deputy will be aware, as a 12-week scheme.  We are now looking at a much longer horizon for the payment and one of the decisions we took in July was to extend it out to April of next year.  This Government has put &euro;3.5 billion into the payment; that is what it has cost.  This year alone, Government will spend &euro;28 billion on social protection.  That is an unprecedented intervention by the State and by Government in supporting incomes.  Rates have come down in line with the decision in July but they are still very closely approximated to what people would have been earning prior to coming onto the Covid payment.  The Deputy knows that is the situation.<\/p>  <p>  We now have to look beyond April and realise that the impact of Covid, particularly economically and financially, could be felt right through the entirety of 2021.  The fiscal planning and the planning around social protection budgets, therefore, has to, and will, take that into consideration.  We are very anxious to support people in every way possible.  That is why a multimillion euro initiative was taken to dramatically increase the number of places available in retraining in terms of education to enable people to take up employment in different areas and where investment is going such as retrofitting and other areas in the economy.<\/p> <p> On evictions, the Deputy is wrong in her assertions.  The Government legislation is not weak.  It is more robust than what was in place because what was in place could not be extended without breaching the Constitution.  Those are the facts.  Nonetheless, what we have put in place in its stead was a provision whereby any renter in difficulty because of Covid will not have his or her rent increased and will not be evicted.  That is unlike what has happened in Northern Ireland, for example.  The measures we have taken here could be adopted by the Government in the North.  Our protections are stronger than in the North and other jurisdictions.  That should be acknowledged.  No rent increase or eviction for renters affected by the virus will happen because of the legislation we introduced.  That legislation applies nationwide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200004#B00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600778400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The facts are these: we are now living with an ongoing crisis, there are tens of thousands of people who have not worked since March and there are thousands across the city and county of Dublin who got laid off on Friday.

There is nobody sitting in this Chamber who is on &euro;350 per week.

The further reductions in terms of the unemployment supports will be a double blow for many.  Most will worry about how they will survive, put food on the table and pay their bills and, of course, about when they might get back to work, if they get back to work at all.  As most will have little or anything in reserve, it adds to the very obvious sense of panic and distress.  At a point when it is hitting home that Covid-19 will be here for some considerable time, the reductions could hardly have come at a worse time.  For that reason, the reduction of these supports urgently needs to be reconsidered and reversed.<\/p>  <p>  A further group of people who are finding themselves with little or no financial supports are parents who have been informed by schools that their children must self-isolate.  The acting Chief Medical Officer, CMO, was upfront in advising parents there would be outbreaks in schools and he was correct.  Parents are not necessarily required to self-isolate if their children are sent home but those children must be cared for.  If a parent is not sick, he or she is not entitled to claim sick pay.  It must be understood that the impact is not isolated to the child.  As a consequence, there is an urgent need to include parents who are in such situations in the enhanced illness payment scheme.  There cannot be any differentiation between a parent whose child has got a diagnosis and children who were sent home to isolate for 14 days because they are part of a pod.  Not everyone can work from home and it is not acceptable that these parents can find themselves in the situation whereby they have no income at all.<\/p>  <p>  There also needs to be consistency of approach in schools.  The Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, has looked for a dedicated telephone line for out-of-hours calls and that should be supported.  In my constituency, at present there are three schools that have had a recent or current Covid-19 experience.  In one school, the public health doctor confirmed a case in a pupil and no restrictions ultimately were required.  A sibling of a student in the second school was diagnosed with Covid-19 and 22 students were asked to self-isolate for 14 days.  The parents are looking for explanations as to why there is a difference.  That simply needs to be done in order that they understand the rationale.  The third is a big school which had a large outbreak and which is closed.  Understandably, that is under review.<\/p>  <p>  If we are to live with this virus for the foreseeable future, temporary supports are needed that are responsive to changing needs.  I have three questions.  Will the Taoiseach review and reverse the reduction in the Covid-19 unemployment supports as a matter of urgency?  Will he extend the enhanced illness payment to parents whose children are sent home from school due to the virus?  Will he do as the IPPN is seeking and provide a dedicated phone line with the HSE where a medical professional would be on hand out-of-hours to ensure there is advice and consistency across the schools?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200006#D00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1600778700,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issues.  As I said earlier, the changes to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, last July were designed to give sustainability to it.  It was originally designed as a 12-week scheme when it was rushed into the House and introduced as an emergency to underpin incomes.  The new rates approximate closely to what people would have been earning prior to being rendered unemployed because of Covid-19.  That is still the situation and the figures show that.  In other words, people will be in receipt, certainly above, on average approximately 105% of their prior income.  Some will be lower; some will be higher and some will be very close to 100% of what they would have been earning when they were laid off as a result of Covid-19.  We have extended it out to April and the Government is conscious now that we must plan longer-term in terms of the financial and economic impact of Covid-19 on certain sectors and on individuals and their incomes.  That will be challenging.  As I said, &euro;28 billion will be spent this year, as opposed to an original &euro;20 billion, for the social protection budget alone.<\/p> <p>Originally the social protection budget represented 25% of overall allocation of resources this year.  These are very challenging situations facing the Government and the Oireachtas.  However, we provide support through the extraordinary measures we have taken with the PUP and the wage subsidy scheme which has also been extended out to April.  We also have other schemes such as restart grants, tax relief and other measures designed to facilitate employers and assist people to retain jobs.  We will also need to consider giving additional supports to specific sectors that are losing out more than most.<\/p> <p> The Deputy raised the issue of a parent who has to stay at home because a child has to self-isolate.  Looking at the national figures for that, there has been some mass testing and the figures for those testing positive are quite low.  For example, for children aged up to ten, it is as low as 0.5% testing positive.  When more than 3,000 teachers and students were mass tested, about 73 tested positive.  We need to keep a perspective about that.  Given the low numbers, I will inquire with the relevant Minister to see what can be done to help in that situation.  At this stage I cannot commit to any broad scheme on that because the implications could be significant.  A precedent could be set and it may not fit into any particular social protection scheme.  I understand the point the Deputy is raising, and I will pursue it further and come back to her.<\/p> <p> On her third point, I will also engage with the HSE and public health officials on having a dedicated phone line she feels principals may require to provide certainty on decisions that have been taken. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200006#D00300","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600779000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I agree with the Taoiseach.

Certain sectors have not had a chance, and probably will not have a chance, to get back to work, including people working in the arts, travel and tourism, and the hospitality sector, which has been badly impacted.  I saw that in my area where we recently had a high level of restrictions.  Those areas need support for longer and, as the ones most impacted by the most recent cuts in the  PUP, they need to be looked at from that point of view. <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is getting the same kinds of contacts as I am with people crying on the phone, wondering how they will survive.

A range of others are getting different social protection payments.  One must be fair to all concerned as the horizon lengthens regarding the impact of Covid.  We need to think beyond April because the financial impacts of Covid will stretch beyond April.  That relates to people's incomes.

I would like to speak briefly about University Hospital Waterford, which is a model 4 hospital in the south east.  It provides medical services and acute care services to a population of 520,000 to 615,000, depending on which report one reads.  It certainly is in excess of 500,000.  The hospital is the regional cardiac care centre and the regional cancer centre for the south east.  It provides all general surgical specialties.  It is the regional orthopaedic centre and, in fact, the busiest trauma centre in the country.  It provides cancer surgeries and breast, colorectal, head and neck, urology and dermatology services.  It also supports the south-east palliative care service.<\/p>  <p>  University Hospital Waterford's critical care bed number is totally inadequate to the needs of the region.  There are only six ICU beds in the hospital and between three and four high-dependency beds at any one time for the entire population of the south east.  The hospital needs investment in critical care beds, at least 12 ICU beds and 12 high-dependency beds that can be stepped up or down.  The Dunmore wing was a great addition to the hospital and we were very lucky it was there to provide additional isolation rooms.  However, those rooms are nearly all currently in use.<\/p>  <p>  University Hospital Waterford is the most underfunded of the eight model 4 hospitals in the country, yet it is one of the busiest in output terms.  For instance, University Hospital Limerick has a smaller patient catchment than University Hospital Waterford but has 700 more care staff.  The latter has the lowest staff to bed ratio of all the model 4 hospitals.  When will the Government recognise the budget deficits at the hospital and when will it receive a funding allocation on par with the other model 4 hospitals?  When will the Government recognise the obstruction to enhancing services at the hospital which has been going on for years, exemplified by the delay in building the new mortuary that was approved in 2014?  The remodelling of the CAT laboratory, which was supposed to take 12 weeks this year, took almost seven months to complete.  A new CAT laboratory development was announced in September 2018 but has not yet advanced to the awarding of a tender, which will supposedly happen in December this year.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a failure to implement a 24-7 cardiac care pathway for the south-east region, with University Hospital Waterford as one of five regional cardiac care centres.  On the past two weekends, patients have been transferred by road ambulance, risking the nurses and doctors who may have to travel, the patients themselves and paramedic staff.  That is unacceptable.  We have to see about restoring the modular diagnostic laboratory activity that was taking place in the hospital, providing 30 patient angiograms a week.  That service was suspended in February this year and has not been reinstated.  It could possibly be done through a service level agreement with the local private hospital.  Otherwise, the laboratory that was taken off site should be brought back.<\/p>  <p>  The current Covid pathway for cardiac care means University Hospital Waterford cannot give a service to the other south-east hospitals.  There is only one isolation bed available to the cardiac service, which means only one patient from an outlying hospital can be accommodated in the morning and one in the afternoon.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, may be aware that there were seven patients awaiting transfer to the CAT laboratory in University Hospital Waterford this morning.  Those patients are stuck in hospital beds in the meantime.  The hospital has only one seat on the South\/South West Hospital Group advisory board, even though it was promised three at the outset of this agreement.  I have raised this a number of times but it has not yet been dealt with.  When will University Hospital Waterford have funding on par with the other seven model 4 hospitals in the country and when will the Government approve funding to implement a 24-7 cardiac care service there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200008#F00200","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1600779300,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I know his commitment to this issue, about which we have had a number of discussions.  In terms of the broader issue of model 4 hospital funding, an ongoing assessment will be undertaken that will include the question of funding for Waterford and its needs and demands.  I will revert to the Deputy in that regard.<\/p> <p>As the Deputy is aware, the programme for Government commits to the delivery of a second cath lab at University Hospital Waterford.  The preferred option is a second cath lab and associated 12-bed day ward, which would deliver six additional beds on the roof of the existing cardiology department.  Covid-19 did delay the work on that but it is now intended that it will go to tender at the end of this month.  I have been assured of that not just by the Minister for Health but by the HSE as well.  Prior to that, a lot of progress had been made.  The HSE had been advised that funding was allocated in the 2019 capital plan for the provision of the second cath lab.  Planning permission was received from Waterford City and County Council in January of this year.  The disability access certificate was granted in April, the fire certificate in June and, as I said, it will go to tender now at the end of the month.  It is a two-stage process as there are main and specialist contractors.  The whole process, which is necessary because of procurement, will take about four months.  Thus the works on the new cath lab are due to commence in quarter 1 of 2021.  In the interests of being fully transparent, the build will take 12 months so the new lab should be ready by early 2022.  This will transform cardiac services in County Waterford.  The national review is still under way.  As the Deputy noted, the upgrade works to the existing cath lab were also delayed when the contractors had to close the site due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  They returned to the site in early August and the lab has been, I understand, fully operational since 14 September.  I understand that the arrangement between UPMC Whitfield Hospital and the HSE is ongoing and that the recruitment of an interventional cardiologist has been successful, which will significantly help throughput in the cardiac department as well.<\/p> <p> On ICU beds, we will assess that but broadly speaking, additional capacity was developed across the country.  In addition to that, there is the issue of potential capacity for use in the event of a surge as a result of Covid-19, for example.  It is interesting that up to 1,500 staff were trained up to work in ICUs.  ICU beds are very labour-intensive and it is not just about the bed.  It is about a 1:1 nurse to patient ratio so there are very substantial human resources behind every ICU bed that is provided.

It is unacceptable and I ask the Taoiseach to look at it.  Will the Taoiseach also see about the restoration of the diagnostic service?  Although the Taoiseach did say that there are ongoing arrangements with Whitfield Hospital, there is no service level agreement, SLA, in place at this time as far as I am aware.  Something needs to be done about the cardiac care isolation rooms in Waterford hospital because the service cannot be provided.  There are even constraints on providing it between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and something must be done about that.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to consider a further matter.  I have asked the Oireachtas Library and Research Service to do an independent review of costings and support budgets across the model 4 hospitals.  I would like the Government to conduct a full independent review of the funding of the model 4 hospitals, looking at University Hospital Waterford's primacy in the region, as well as its funding relative to that of other model 4 hospitals.

In health people have their ways of looking at issues.  We saw this in terms of cardiac services.  I do not mean that in any facetious way.  When the reconfiguration was originally announced by Professor John Higgins and his team a full 24-7 cardiac service was provided for.  That was overturned by a second independent review commissioned by the then Minister.  I had discussions with Professor Higgins after that.  I hope I do not misinterpret him but he was somewhat put out that the commitments he had made as part of the review were not fulfilled by a subsequent review.  I take the overall point.  I would much prefer to see what the immediate demands and objectives of the hospital are and make sure we meet them in terms of funding.

I will give an example of what happened in a school in my constituency, for illustrative purposes only because it is at national issue.  A member of that particular school community tested positive.  The person has other family members in the school.  It took five days from contacting the doctor to getting the results of the test.  In the meantime, all members of the family self-isolated from the time the doctor referred the person for the test.<\/p>  <p>  The test result was communicated to the principal the next morning and the principal immediately contacted the HSE.  Despite the best efforts of the principal, it took five hours, in other words the rest of the school day, for the HSE to respond.  In the meantime, the principal, naturally, was anxious and he spoke to his staff members and discussed what they would do.  When he received a call that evening from the HSE he was assured that public health was dealing with the case.  At this point, it was one week since the person developed symptoms.  He was told by the HSE that he should not inform parents and that he should not have informed his staff.  He was absolutely taken aback but the HSE insisted this was the advice.  He then asked about a template letter for parents.  Earlier, we spoke about the possibility of a helpline.  The principal contacted the INTO and received some assistance from it.  In the meantime, the rumours started.  He did not inform parents because he had been told not to but, as the Taoiseach can imagine, it was the talk of the parish.  The next day, people contacted the local radio station, which is what people do when they are looking for information.  The story was all over the place.  The principal, on the back foot, had to go on local radio and explain his actions.<\/p>  <p>  I know each situation is different, and the Minister for Education and Skills told us that public health takes over, but surely good, clear information and trust are crucial in these situations.  A basic template letter, helpline or whatever would really have helped.  If parents had received some communication from the school ensuring full anonymity and abiding by the general data protection regulation, GDPR, it would have made a real difference.  Is there any possibility of having a template letter or a national approach to dealing with cases such as this so principals are not left in the position that they just do not know how to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200010#H00300","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1600780200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  These are very important points.  The Deputy said it took five days to get a test.  That is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>I would like that checked out and the details followed through because it is not in accordance with the national average - that is not just waiting to get a test but right through - which is about 2.2 days.  Some 85,000 tests were done last week and there is a capacity to do 100,000 tests.  It is one of the better testing systems in Europe.  Right now, we are testing more people per population than most.  Some 52,000 tests were taken in the community, 20,000 in acute settings while 13,000 serial tests have been undertaken.  That is a significant amount of ongoing work.  That is why the delays in the case raised by the Deputy have to be fed back into the system to ensure it does not happen again.<\/p> <p> A letter was issued last week to all schools, together with a HSE document entitled, Schools Pathway for Covid-19, the Public Health Approach.  It sets out the approach to managing isolated confirmed cases of Covid-19 within a school community, as well as the principles which will underpin the management of outbreaks, or potential outbreaks, and the aligned testing strategy within an educational facility.<\/p> <p> It is important to note that the response to confirmed cases or outbreaks of Covid-19 in the community or in a school is responsibility of and will be led and managed by the HSE departments of public health.  It is at pains to state that all decisions as to appropriate actions following a confirmed case or outbreak will be made by its teams in the context of a full public health risk assessment.  Any actions to be taken by the school will be informed and guided by the HSE departments of public health.  School management will be informed as and when actions, such as the exclusion of children or staff, partial or full closure, are deemed necessary on public health grounds.  If the school is not so informed, it has not been deemed necessary by the HSE departments of public health.<\/p> <p> Again, the HSE has stated the definition of close contacts within a school will be variable and will be determined by a risk assessment that will take account of individual factors within each school or each class.  It will not be automatically assumed that a whole class will be deemed as close contacts.  Close contacts will be notified and advised to restrict their movements and present for testing on day zero and day seven.  Close contacts will restrict their movements for 14 days, even in the event that Covid-19 is not detected in both of these tests.<\/p> <p> There is no blanket policy to test entire classes or years.  The testing strategy will be aligned to the public health risk assessment which may recommend widespread swabbing in a class or school under HSE mass testing procedures.  Some of these have occurred.  Up to 3,000 have been done in various scenarios with a positivity rate of about 73.  I can check those figures and send them to the Deputy.<\/p> <p> A letter did go out.  A template is available.  Within that template, however, there are significant variables and discretion in terms of the risk as assessed locally on the ground by the HSE departments of public health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200010#H00400","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600780500,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is that of clear communication and that parents and staff know what is happening.

If trust breaks down between a principal and parents or staff, it is very hard to rebuild that.  I am glad we are making progress.<\/p>  <p>  There is extra pressure on teachers.  Before students arrive in the morning, right through the day and during breaks, until the students leave in the evening, teachers are constantly under pressure and have to be extra vigilant.  There is simply no let-up in the day.  I have spoken with principals, not teachers, who have said there is a real risk of burnout with some of their staff.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach work with the unions to look at the reality of managing and teaching in schools in order that, quite rightly, our schools can remain open and be safe places for the whole school community?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200011#J00200","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1600780500,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The Deputy is also correct that additional stresses and strains go with Covid, such as constantly urging students to avoid gathering together and making sure that all the various guidelines are being adhered to.  I spoke to some teachers during the past week about this.  The school environment now is more different than ever before because of all the public health restrictions in schools and how the schools are managed, broken up and so on.  That has to be acknowledged.  Equally, however, I have spoken to many teachers who are happy they are back at school and that the children at primary and students at post-primary are also back.  The learning environment is key to a child's chances in life, and prolonged absence from a learning environment or from school can be very detrimental to a child or young person's development, so we have to work with and support those involved in this regard.  The Department of Education and Skills is continuing its engagement with the partners in education, including the unions, with a view to trying to make sure we all work together to ensure that what has been a strong partnership to date continues to underpin the development of our children and students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200011#J00300","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1600780800,"counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200012#K00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1600780800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>The House has previously agreed that for the duration of the Covid emergency, the rapporteur's report on the Order of Business shall not be read out but shall be taken as read.

What additional testing and tracing measures are being considered given the direction the UK is taking? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200020#S01600","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600784700,"counter":175,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's points, peace and stability come first regarding the overall impact of Brexit, and the necessity for the withdrawal treaty and the Northern Ireland protocol to be adhered to and upheld.  The EU is solidly and constructively working with Ireland on this.  We are part of the one negotiating team that wants to negotiate a future relationship with the UK that is sensible and that results in a free-trade agreement, which is absent of quotas and tariffs and allows businesses to continue as seamlessly as they can.  Notwithstanding the impact of Brexit even with what might be called a free-trade-type agreement, nonetheless we want businesses to continue engaging, exporting, importing and avoiding a loss of jobs.  That is a key objective.<\/p>  <p>  A no-deal Brexit would be devastating for the economy and jobs in the UK.  It would be very challenging to Ireland as well, particularly in the regions and on the western seaboard, and to other member states in the EU.  Logic and common sense should dictate a sensible Brexit deal covering the future relationship between the Union and the United Kingdom.<\/p>  <p>  The internal market Bill has undermined people's confidence in the capacity to achieve that.  It has eroded trust and it has made it more difficult to proceed.  That said, the EU is focused on the end goal and objective, remaining very firm on the necessity of the UK to make amends here and to deal with the issue of the internal market Bill, representing, as it does, an unacceptable breach of its international obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Discussions have taken place at the joint committee between the UK and the European sides.  I have had discussions on the issue with the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the President of the Council, Charles Michel.  I have spoken briefly with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in the context of a wider discussion with other member states on other issues where we raised Brexit.  I will have a further opportunity this week to discuss it with European colleagues.<\/p>  <p>  Europe will not be distracted or in any way blown off course by this latest initiative by the UK.  It is very clear on how unacceptable it is and very clear that it breaches agreements previously entered into.  Whatever the motivations behind the Bill, it will not succeed in creating any division on the EU side.  European Union colleagues are very clear on the importance of the protocol and the importance of having no hard border, as is the UK Government, which still states it does not want a hard border on the island of Ireland and wants seamless trade between North and South.  It has equally stated that it wants to implement the withdrawal agreement notwithstanding the reservations as contained in the internal market Bill.  Of course, the Bill runs counter to those assertions.  I am just giving it to the House as it is.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think it is a question of a diktat from Europe.  That is not the spirit of how Europe and Ireland have been working on Brexit from the beginning.  A collegial approach has informed the engagement and relationship.  Europe has been rock solid.  It has shown commendable solidarity with Ireland throughout these issues since the British people voted on Brexit.  It is our collective desire to ensure that continues.  We will work with Europe in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  On the all-island approach to Covid, there is a memorandum of understanding between the Chief Medical Officer in the Republic and the Chief Medical Officer in Northern Ireland.  We have had ongoing contact with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister on Covid.  Northern Ireland operates to a different jurisdiction from that in which the CMO does.  We are endeavouring to harmonise insofar as we possibly can.  Deputies will recall that earlier in the summer there were issues with travel where the Northern Ireland Executive was ahead of us in liberalising travel.  I think there has been good engagement since then on a range of issues between both CMOs, which will continue.<\/p>  <p>  The British system of testing and tracing is under pressure; we are not.  Our testing and tracing system is meeting demand, with 85,000 tests done last week, comprising community testing, hospital testing and serial testing.  There have been 13,000 or 14,000 serial tests in meat plants, direct provision centres and nursing homes all with very low levels of positive results so far from the serial testing.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the Scottish authorities contacted us to see if we could help with spare capacity.  We were just not in a position to do that.  There is global competition for testing kits and the materials for it.  Testing in the UK is obviously very challenging.  So far, we are managing.  We are ahead of them and we can meet demand as it presents itself right now.  The HSE is continually looking at ways to improve capacity.  We have capacity to do 100,000.  Having the capacity to do 100,000 does not mean we have to do 100,000, but I have been assured by the HSE that it has the capacity to do 100,000; we did 85,000 last week<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200021#T00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committees","time":1600784700,"counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200021#T00300"},{"type":"question","time":1600784700,"counter":177,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[23637\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200021#T00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on housing will next meet.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1600784700,"counter":178,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[23927\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200021#T00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on housing will next meet.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1600784700,"counter":179,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[22649\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200021#T00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee that deals with housing will next meet.","asker":"1478","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1600784700,"counter":180,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[25166\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200021#T00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on housing will next meet.","asker":"1522","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1600784700,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The Cabinet committee on housing was established by the Government on 6 July 2020 to oversee effective implementation of the ambitious programme for Government commitments on housing and related issues.<\/p><p>The committee last met on 30 July and is next scheduled to meet on Monday, 28 September.<\/p><p>In addition to the meetings of the full Cabinet and of Cabinet committees, I have meetings with Ministers, including the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, on a regular basis to focus on particular issues. <\/p><p>The committee operates in accordance with established guidelines for Cabinet committees and substantive issues are referred to Government for discussion and approval.<\/p><p>Significant work is under way on each of the areas covered by the committee through Departments, Government agencies and a range of interdepartmental groups, which will be brought forward for discussion at the committee and Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200021#T00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1600784700,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Since Friday, the Labour Party has called for a ban on evictions and rent increases to be reinstated in Dublin after the move to level 3 restrictions.

This is an area I am familiar with as somebody who introduced restrictions on rent increases for a number of years.<\/p>  <p>  Similar powers were granted in other Bills.  It says everything about the Government's approach that renters seem to be at the bottom of the pile as far as it is concerned.  We need emergency legislation.  We need to have foresight on this.  This will be a real issue.  Debts will start to be crystallised.  People will be out on the streets.  We want a ban on evictions.  We want the Government to do something on this quickly.  The changes the Minister introduced will only give protection until January for those who can prove they have been financially impacted by a limited set of circumstances.  It is quite a complicated process.  I ask the Taoiseach to look at this.  We need to protect these people.  We cannot have people being thrown out during this time.  I ask the Taoiseach to examine the circumstances affecting the legislation that was introduced and amend it.  In effect, the Government can do it through that process.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government recently announced &euro;40 million to refurbish 2,500 vacant properties, voids.<\/p> <p>There are a significant number of properties, as I know from researching the matter, that have been left vacant for a considerable period of time.  Why were they left vacant for so long?  The target for social housing construction this year is 7,736 units, inclusive of housing provided by local authorities and approved housing bodies, under regeneration schemes and under the Part V provisions.  What is the Taoiseach's projection as of today's date for how many council homes will be built?  It was also proposed to buy 800 properties and lease 2,631 properties, for a total social housing target of 11,000 units.

I am sure all of us, as elected representatives, are very well aware of the kinds of pressures people are under in our communities.  There is a very particular burden and pressure on those in the rental sector.  Thousands of workers are now without employment.  The reality for many people in Dublin, for example, is that they lost their shirt overnight.  Whereas their household income has fallen, rents continue to rise, albeit now at a lower rate than before.  Renters need the assurance that they will not be evicted and that the roof over their head is secure in these very uncertain times.  We have fared better than some of our European neighbours in this crisis but the fall in Ireland's GDP is the sharpest on record.  The Taoiseach will know that in terms of job losses, we come second only to Spain in the second quarter of this year.  A terrifying prospect of unemployment rates of eye-watering proportions is before us.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach told us originally that the Government's argument for lifting the ban on evictions and rent increases was that the economy was opening up and the crisis was receding.  That is clearly and manifestly not the case.  The situation in Dublin is the most immediate evidence of that as it has moved to level 3 plus in terms of restrictions.  There is the real possibility that many other counties could join the capital in the near future.  The Taoiseach argued that he could not justify constitutionally a ban on evictions or rent increases because of the opening up of the economy and because the crisis had receded.  The crisis has not gone anywhere and the Taoiseach's argument is a very flimsy and unacceptable excuse for not protecting people who rent from the prospect of eviction or a rent hike.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200022#U00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1600785300,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Unless the Taoiseach reinstates the eviction ban, he will be throwing thousands of renters to the wolves in the worst of all possible circumstances.  We opposed the Government's decision to lift the eviction ban, which had been very successful, as we said it would be, in reducing the numbers going into homelessness.  In removing that ban, the Taoiseach betrayed his previous support for the anti-evictions Bill my colleagues and I introduced in the last D&aacute;il and, in so doing, performed one of the first U-turns of this Government.  Whatever about all that, in the current circumstances, where people's pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, is being cut, new restrictions are being imposed and fewer people are going to have the income necessary to pay rents, the possibility of people being made homeless is simply unacceptable.  It is totally incompatible with protecting public health in the context of Covid-19.  The Taoiseach must reinstate the eviction ban.

We know Covid infection rates are on the rise and we have a lot of anecdotal evidence that evictions are increasing.  Next week, the official figures for the numbers in emergency accommodation at the end of August will be announced.  I expect those figures to confirm that evictions are on the rise, possibly in a dramatic fashion.<\/p>  <p>  The Government weakened the anti-eviction legislation.  No amount of bluster will hide that fact.  At the end of July, in the D&aacute;il, the anti-eviction provisions were weakened, with effect from 1 August.  A ban remains for those who face eviction because they were in arrears that are directly related to the Covid crisis.  That certainly is the case.  However, evictions are now allowed on grounds of sale of property, refurbishment of property or to allow a relative to move in.  In other words, they are allowed on grounds which Threshold tell us are the majority reasons for evictions in this State.  The prospect is opening up of people having to traipse around to find accommodation in our towns and cities in the middle of a pandemic and at a time when the incidence of the virus is on the rise.  That cannot be allowed.<\/p>  <p>  The change in July was justified on the basis that a retention of the existing provisions would not be on sound legal ground.  The Taoiseach said earlier today in the House that this is a fact.  It is not a fact; it is an opinion.  It is the opinion of the Attorney General but it is one which is becoming weaker by the hour as infection rates rise.  Has the Taoiseach asked the Attorney General whether the latter still thinks there are legal grounds for weakening the ban and not reinstating it?  Clearly, the case for reinstating the ban immediately on public health grounds is overwhelming and unanswerable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200022#U00400","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1600785300,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I will use the short time remaining to give the Taoiseach an example of what is happening.

This loss of income is the underlying reason that the landlord wants her gone.  However, the reason the latter gave in the eviction notice - which was inadequate, and that is why the landlord is now saying, after people protested, that it was a misunderstanding - was not that she is unable to pay the rent due to a loss of income but because the landlord wants to move a relative in.

It protects them from rent increases and eviction.  It is a more specific Bill than that which preceded it.  The reason the blanket ban could not be continued is that, fundamentally, it was unconstitutional.  We were no longer at the time and are no longer now in a lockdown situation.  Dublin is not in lockdown.  Level 3 is not lockdown.  All sectors are open, bar the hospitality area generally and some areas of arts, culture and entertainment.  Manufacturing is open, retail is open and construction is open.  Significant sectors of the economy are still operating in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  We hope it does not happen but if we were to move to level 4 and level 5, one would have to consider what additional measures one could bring in to support people in situations like the Deputies have described.  For now, the advice is very clear in respect of level 3.  The Minister is of the view, in accordance with the legal advice, that level 3 does not merit the reintroduction of the blanket ban that was there for some months during the lockdown and all that went with the lockdown in terms of restricted mobility throughout the entire country.  There is a significant difference between the two.  Of that there is no doubt and it must be accepted.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Deputy Kelly's question on voids, the Government has only been in office for three months, give or take a week or two, but we have taken the initiative in this regard.  It is the case that for some time there have been a number of empty houses and homes that were not refurbished quickly enough.  I made that point to the new Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Secretary General of the Department that local authorities need to move quickly when houses are vacated to get them back into operation without delay.<\/p> <p>The length of time it can take to get a house that has been vacated back up and running with a new family or person in it is ridiculous.  We all hear anecdotally of cases where all the furniture in a house is taken out and it is boarded up.  That is not acceptable in a housing crisis where people are desperately looking for houses.  The Minister with responsibility for housing and I took the initiative to provide substantial moneys from the July stimulus to get voids back in use quickly.  Some 2,500 voids will be delivered back into the housing stock as a result of that initiative, which was taken weeks after the Government was formed with a view to doing something concrete about voids quickly with the resources allocated to it.  The Minister, with the local authorities, has put a lot of energy into trying to realise those particular targets.<\/p> <p> I dealt with the issue Deputy McDonald raised on level 3 restrictions versus a lockdown.  Even looking at the August return, one can see that, bar some specific sectors, significant sectors of the economy have come back fairly strongly since the reopening.  We suffered a lot with construction unemployment and other areas because of the severity of our lockdown in March and April.  A number of articles have been written on that but, nonetheless, that lockdown had the effect of suppressing the virus so one must look at this in the longer term.<\/p> <p> The same point I articulated on the legislation we have brought in applies to the question put by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  As I said, the Minister is examining what additional targeted measures may be required in the event that an area is subject to level 4 or level 5 restrictions in line with Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19 and we will continue to examine that.<\/p> <p> On homelessness, the Minister has been very committed from the get-go to working with the various non-governmental organisations involved in homelessness, providing supports to those who intervene in homelessness to get the figures down, create additional accommodation in emergency accommodation in particular and keep downward pressure on homelessness as much as we possibly can.  That is continuing across a range of initiatives the Minster has taken on a short-term, medium-term and long-term basis, with a view to getting additional capacity for emergency accommodation in the short term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200022#U00600","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committees","time":1600785900,"counter":190,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200023#V00150"},{"type":"question","time":1600785900,"counter":191,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[23685\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200023#V00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the role of his Department in the development of the forthcoming plan for dealing with Covid-19.","asker":"1628","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1600785900,"counter":192,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[23764\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200023#V00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on Covid-19 will next meet.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1600785900,"counter":193,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[25001\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200023#V00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on Covid-19 will next meet.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1600785900,"counter":194,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[25395\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200023#V00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the Covid-19 oversight group; the terms of reference for the group; and if a list of the standing membership will be provided.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1600785900,"counter":195,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[25609\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200023#V00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the role of his Department in the development of the forthcoming plan for dealing with Covid-19.","asker":"1478","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1600785900,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I propose to take Question Nos. 8 to 12, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The Cabinet committee on Covid-19 was re-established by the Government on 29 June to continue to assess the social and economic impacts of the potential spread of Covid-19 and oversee the cross-Government response.

The plan was drawn up by officials on a cross-departmental basis co-ordinated by my Department and the Department of Health.  It was considered at length by the Cabinet committee and approved by Government.<\/p><p>The framework is designed to allow individuals, families, businesses and services to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures the Government might introduce to stop escalation of the transmission of the disease.  It recognises the need for an incremental, stepwise approach which takes account of the societal and economic impacts of the response to infection outbreaks.  These measured responses are aimed at ensuring that the impact of restrictive measures on the lives of people in Ireland will be kept to the minimum necessary.<\/p><p>The plan is framed to account for periods in which there is low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to periods where there is high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally.  It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible.  Each level contains a basket of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering the risk of transmission in alignment with the risk level at that time.<\/p><p>The plan also sets out our medium-term approach and priorities for managing and living with Covid in a range of areas, including prevention of infection and protection of vulnerable groups, health system response and resilience, approach to international travel, continued resumption of public service delivery, including non-Covid health and social care, protective services and access to justice, and developing economic, community and personal resilience.

This is a time when people need support from the State to deal the coronavirus rather than punishment.  How on earth can the Taoiseach justify slashing the supports to workers who have lost their jobs due to Covid when we have a second wave of the coronavirus and a second wave of restrictions which means more workers are going to lose their jobs?  When this was done before the Government accepted that people should not be driven into poverty or homelessness for following public health guidelines.  That is why we had the &euro;350 per week payment and the ban on evictions.  Now however, precisely when people will need these protections the most, the Government has removed the evictions ban and today it is cutting the Covid payment.  I believe the Taoiseach is paid &euro;550 per day from the public purse, yet he is slashing the income of people who are already struggling to get by to &euro;203 per week in some cases.  It would take them 1,000 weeks to receive what the Taoiseach makes in a year, yet they are the ones who are being asked to take a cut.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200023#V01300","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1600785900,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I will make three quick points.  First, I learned from the Cabinet meeting's response today that the Government is proposing a six-month review of the Sick Leave and Parental Leave (Covid-19) Bill 2020 the Labour Party will introduce tomorrow.  Six months is frankly stupid.  This is a Covid measure.  Is this a laugh?  We are proposing this Bill to help.  The Taoiseach often criticises the Opposition.  This is a constructive measure, as he said earlier.  Today we found out from Tusla that there have been 63 cases of Covid-19 in early years services.  These are some of the lowest paid workers in Ireland.  They must make a choice between going to work with a symptom and not getting paid.  That is what the Bill addresses.  I ask the Taoiseach not to do this tomorrow.  I am saying this in a constructive way.  We need sick pay legislation to fight Covid-19.  We are one of only five countries in the world that does not have it.<\/p>  <p>  Second, will the Taoiseach indicate what the criteria are for walk-in testing centres?  We had one in Rathkeale, for instance.  The northern part of Limerick city has a 14-day average of 126.8 Covid infections per 100,000 population.  That is higher than counties Louth, Waterford, Leitrim or Donegal.  It is one of the most deprived areas of the city.

The disability services submitted their funding requirements to the HSE in mid-June.  I understand the HSE collated and verified these submissions in July.<\/p> <p>The submission set out the additional funding required to enable those services to meet their additional costs to operate during this pandemic for the remainder of 2020 and the projected costs for 2021.  I cannot overstate the deep sense of abandonment and frustration that citizens with disabilities and their carers and support services feel.  It is to their very great credit that these organisations and families have battled on through the crisis, despite the huge challenge and the collapse in revenue for them.

This is grossly unjust and a serious danger to the collective social solidarity that is absolutely critical to defeating Covid-19.  If the Government loses the faith of the people and punishes those who have lost their jobs and income as a result of its restrictions, it will lose the dressing room.

In July, the new Government decided to extend it to April.  The rates were reduced but they are still at levels closely approximate to what people were earning before being laid off as a result of the pandemic.  This was to make it more sustainable over the long term.  A total of &euro;3.5 billion has already been allocated to the pandemic unemployment payment.  The social protection bill has gone from &euro;20 billion to &euro;28 billion.  We must look beyond April and plan accordingly because the impact of Covid financially to the end of 2021 could be far more severe on us as a country than we anticipated.  Someone at some stage has to deal with reality in terms of the overall implications.  This also applies to the wage subsidy scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The PUP worked in the initial phase.  It has been refined.  Originally, 600,000 people were on it and it is now down to 200,000 people.  Alongside these 200,000 people are 213,000 people on the jobseeker's allowance of &euro;203 a week.  These are people who were made unemployed in January or February and never received the PUP.  We have to try to achieve a balance somewhere along the way.  We must also do everything we possibly can to create alternative jobs, give additional supports in terms of reskilling and try to facilitate people back into the workplace where work is available.<\/p>  <p>  The idea that the Government is trying to stick knives in people is nonsense and rubbish.  The Government has made the most unprecedented intervention in underpinning income in the history of the State.  This is understandable and it is the correct thing to do because of an unprecedented global pandemic.  Some of the language emanating from Deputies opposite in this regard is unfair.  We have to think ahead.  All of this is being borrowed on behalf of the taxpayer.  We have to work ahead and make sure we can sustain it for an indefinite period.  We do not know when a vaccine will arrive.  Various projections are made from time to time and there can be setbacks.<\/p>  <p>  We have opened up the pandemic unemployment payment to new entrants to cater for where severe restrictions are brought in.  Originally it was going to be tapered off.  That is no longer the case and it is being opened up again for people who are rendered unemployed as a result of decisions taken to introduce localised restrictions in given areas.  A range of other supports is being given to people in various sectors to try to keep jobs going and keep the enterprises intact to maintain jobs.  This is the overall objective.<\/p>  <p>  To answer Deputy Kelly on sick pay, there is the Covid illness benefit.  It is very unfair to make the points he made.  The Government does recognise the exceptional challenge faced by employees during the Covid-19 pandemic and the lack of a statutory sick pay regime.  This is why a six-month period is being given.  The Government is reacting constructively to the Labour Party's Bill.  We are saying to come on and let us get sense.  We need to talk to the various Departments.  We also need to talk to employers because the Labour Party proposes they would to take the brunt of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200024#W00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1600786500,"counter":209,"content":"<p>The CMO-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200024#W00400","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1600786500,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Let me speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200024#W00500","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1600786500,"counter":211,"content":"<p>The CMO, the chief executive officer of the HSE and the chief clinical officer all want this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200024#W00600","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1600786500,"counter":212,"content":"<p>We also need to talk to the unions so that we get a comprehensive sustainable sick pay regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200024#W00700","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1600786500,"counter":213,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach says he is listening to public health advice.

The purpose of this legislation is to transpose the criminal justice elements of the fifth EU anti-money laundering directive, Directive 2018\/843.<\/p>  <p>  Targeting money laundering is central to fighting organised crime.  Those who commit crimes such as drug trafficking, human trafficking and fraud depend on hiding and converting the proceeds of those crimes.  By pursuing those proceeds, we can bring those responsible to justice and meaningfully reduce the incentive to commit the crimes in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  Part of that effort is through the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.  However, preventive measures are also essential.  In the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, and before that in the Criminal Justice Act 1994, the Oireachtas both criminalised money laundering activities and required those whose business activities can be used to facilitate money laundering to help prevent it.  On a practical level, this means knowing one's customers and doing appropriate due diligence before starting a business relationship.  It means having proper processes in place to deal with suspicious transactions, while reporting suspicious transactions to the appropriate authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Money laundering and terrorist financing are global issues.  Criminals routinely move the proceeds of crime from one country to another and exploit inconsistencies and weak links.  Accordingly, a coherent global approach is needed and the EU has long had legislation in the area.  Internationally, the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, FATF, are applied by 37 member jurisdictions and inform the global approach.  FATF monitors and evaluates compliance by those 37 members.<\/p>  <p>  EU legislation and the FATF recommendations are frequently being updated to reflect new developments, as well as to ensure they are still relevant.  This process of continuous improvement is a feature of the regime.  This Bill, which amends the 2010 Act in line with the fifth directive, is the second significant amendment of that Act.  In 2018, the Act was amended to give effect to the fourth anti-money laundering directive.  The new regime adopted a more risk-based approach, where entities must take steps within a defined framework to identify and manage the risks in individual business relationships.  It also adopted an increased focus on transparency of beneficial ownership, a measure further developed in the fifth directive.<\/p>  <p>  Other enhancements in 2018 included a fitness and probity regime for the owners of private members&rsquo; gaming clubs, new provisions in respect of customer due diligence, new powers for the financial intelligence unit and more stringent requirements around politically exposed persons.<\/p>  <p>  The fifth directive, implemented by this Bill, continues this process.  It addresses the challenges presented by complex legal structures that can obscure the true owners of assets.  It brings virtual asset service providers and custodian wallet providers into the scope of anti-money laundering regulation.  It improves safeguards for financial transactions to and from high-risk third countries and sets new limits on the use of anonymous prepaid cards.  It also brings several new designated persons under the existing legislation, including property services providers, as well as dealers and intermediaries in the art trade.  It enhances the customer due diligence requirements of the existing legislation.  It prevents credit and financial institutions from creating anonymous safe-deposit boxes.  It provides for ministerial guidance, which will clarify domestic prominent public functions.<\/p>  <p>  The measures specific to the criminal justice system in the fifth directive are primarily implemented in this Bill.  However, a significant element of the fifth directive is improving the transparency of beneficial ownership of corporate and other legal entities to help address the use of complex legal structures for money laundering and terrorist financing.  It also provides for the establishment of a national bank account register.  This important ongoing work is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  My Department works closely with the Department of Finance on these and other non-criminal justice measures.<\/p>  <p>  Enacting this Bill will enhance the range of measures countering money laundering by reflecting modern developments.  It will also help to bring us in line with our EU obligations.  Members may be aware that Ireland is late in transposing this directive, the deadline for which was January of this year.  The European Commission commenced the first stage of an infringement process, the issuing of a letter of formal notice in May of this year.  While this Bill is not the only element of the transposition, enacting the Bill is an essential step in bringing our regime up to date and ensuring that Ireland is in full compliance.<\/p>  <p>  I expect, however, that this area of law will continue to evolve as crime becomes increasingly sophisticated.  Ireland has opted in to Directive 2019\/1153, which enhances the use of financial information by giving law enforcement authorities direct access to information about the identity of bank account holders contained in national centralised registries.  In addition, it gives law enforcement the possibility to access certain information from national financial intelligence units, including data on financial transactions.  It also improves the information exchange between financial intelligence units, as well as their access to law enforcement information necessary for the performance of their tasks.  These measures will speed up criminal investigations and enable authorities to combat cross-border crime more effectively. <\/p>  <p>  As Members are aware, there are already robust and extensive anti-money laundering laws in place in Ireland.  The existing Act, as amended, runs to almost 150 sections, with the majority of those sections concerning designated persons and their obligations.  However, at its heart, is the offence defined in section 7(1) of the 2010 Act.  A person commits a money laundering offence if he or she, among other things, uses, conceals, disguises, transfers, acquires, convert or removes from the State, the proceeds of crime.  This applies if the person knows or believes that he or she is handling the proceeds of crime, or is reckless as to whether he or she is doing so.  It is important to bear this offence in mind.  While the other aspects of the regime support the prevention and detection of money laundering, and apply in a differentiated way to specific cases, it is open to no one to recklessly facilitate money laundering. <\/p>  <p>  This legislative framework is supported by a strong operational capability.  There is a range of bodies active in combating money laundering and terrorist financing, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s National Economic Crime Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Central Bank and my Department.  The anti-money laundering steering committee brings together the relevant Departments and agencies to co-ordinate the national response to risks relating to money laundering and terrorist financing.<\/p>  <p>  In its most recent evaluation report for Ireland, the FATF found that Ireland has a generally sound and substantially effective legal and institutional anti-money laundering framework.  This new legislation will update and enhance that framework, while addressing many of the remaining gaps identified in the evaluation.<\/p>  <p>  Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, contain provisions which update various definitions in the principal Act to bring it into line with the definitions used in the fifth directive.  In particular, section 3 provides for the definitions of the new entities that will be considered designated persons under the Act.  This includes new definitions of property service provider, virtual asset service provider and custodian wallet provider.<\/p>  <p>  Section 4 amends section 25 of the 2010 Act and brings the new entities under the designated person provisions who are required to apply anti-money laundering measures in the course of their business.  These new designated persons include letting agents, virtual asset service providers and high-value art dealers and intermediaries in that trade.<\/p>  <p>  Section 5 amends section 33 of the 2010 Act and provides for a number of technical amendments, including an obligation to carry out customer due diligence when required to contact the customer under any other enactment.<\/p>  <p>  Section 6 amends section 33A of the 2010 Act and provides for lowering the value limits for carrying out simplified due diligence on e-money instruments.  This means that a person supplying e-money instruments, such as a prepaid card, will be required to conduct customer due diligence when the value of the requested card is &euro;150 or higher.  The existing threshold is &euro;250. <\/p>  <p>  Section 7 amends section 35 of the 2010 Act and provides that where a designated person is entering a business relationship with another entity, that person must take steps to obtain the relevant information from the register of beneficial ownership of trusts, corporate entities or financial vehicles, as appropriate, and must not engage in that business relationship until the relevant information is obtained.  By way of derogation, a financial institution is allowed to open an account ahead of obtaining the information but cannot allow any transactions on that account. <\/p>  <p>  Section 8 amends section 36A of the 2010 Act to give effect to a technical amendment to the wording of the directive in respect of which transactions require further examination.<\/p>  <p>  Section 9 amends section 37 of the 2010 Act to provide for the Minister for Justice and Equality, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to issue guidance to competent authorities on the prominent public functions that will give rise to a person being designated as a politically exposed person.  The amendments will also allow a designated person to continue to monitor someone who was previously designated a politically exposed person, so long as a money laundering risk exists in connection with their previous designation. <\/p>  <p>  Section 10 makes a technical amendment to section 38 of the 2010 Act to more clearly define the relevant relationship.<\/p>  <p>  Section 11 amends section 38A of the 2010 Act and provides for a detailed list of enhanced due diligence measures that the designated person is required to apply when dealing with a customer established, or residing, in a high-risk third country.<\/p> <p>Section 12 makes a technical amendment to section 40 of the 2010 Act in respect of information to be received from a relevant third party.<br\/><br\/>Section 13 places a requirement on the financial intelligence unit, FIU Ireland, to provide, where practicable, feedback in respect of suspicious transaction reports made to them.

I wish him all the very best in that post.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation emanates from a 2018 European Parliament directive, which I understand we are a little late in bringing into vogue in Ireland.  However, better late than never.  Many people around the country have, unfortunately, borne the brunt of this issue.  The manner in which the banks handle situations where fraud has taken place has been a long-term problem for many people.  We have seen this in recent times.  There was a large scam going on whereby people's bank accounts were being plundered.  I came across many students who had their savings taken completely from them and had to put up a notorious fight to get the banks to compensate them for that.  One of the issues that immediately springs to mind in that regard is how this can be done under the watch of banking authorities where proper due diligence is supposed to be in place to ensure that the people who are transacting accounts do so in the proper way.<\/p>  <p>  There are clear issues in this regard, and many of the measures in this legislation seek to deal with them.  The legislation is quite detailed.  I read the debates that took place in 2018 on the amendments that were brought to the 2010 Act.  The legislation before the House is an expansion of that in the context of a moving, changing society and the world of finance and money.  Now we have virtual money, bitcoin and all sorts of transactions taking place, which would seem strange to the layperson on the street but which have become the norm, unfortunately, and have been used by criminal elements all over the world.  It has always struck me that, particularly in a European Union context, we have talked about the free movement of people, labour and work and so on but a lot of this is about the free movement of capital and the fact that capital can move in and out of two jurisdictions, not just across Europe but across the world.  This has opened up opportunities for very smart and tech-savvy people who are able to use this to their advantage and to the advantage of a criminal underworld that can profit greatly from it.  There have been other recent scams.  I heard on, I think, \"Morning Ireland\" - I am not sure whether it was yesterday morning or last week - that there is this issue of money mules, whereby people are being conned into allowing their bank accounts to be used for the processing of large sums.  If this happens, they are enticed into some kind of financial award, which is highly illegal.  The State needs a strong arm to make sure that this does not happen.  Unfortunately, and this is one issue at the core of everything in our society, as long as we have poverty and as long as there are people who have no prospect of a bright new future for themselves, any way of making a fast buck is very tempting to them.  Those involved in this activity are inclined to use that and, unfortunately, some people fall into and get caught in that trap.<\/p>  <p>  We, as a society, and particularly the banking institutions through which these processes are put in place, have an absolute obligation to protect everyone, including the ordinary citizen out there and the unfortunate person who may be tempted to go down this road because of the financial enticement involved.  There have been many international examples.  The world of high finance and banking have known for decades of the movement of large volumes of capital and the movement of illicit funds through various accounts, and not only have they done nothing about it but they have not even attempted to report it in many cases.  There is a view among not just the ordinary people out there but the people I speak to in this profession that there is a lot of playing fast and loose with the rules.  This legislation goes somewhere on that.  It may not go all the way, and there is a lot more to be done on all this.  One measure that could be expanded on is what level of sanction there is for the banks if they are seen to break these rules.  I know there is some element of this in the original legislation, but it would be important to tease that out and illuminate further what more could be done about this.  Unless there is a very strong sanction in place against the banking institutions for allowing this kind of thing to happen, they will continue to do so.  We have seen them do so, in fact, with their own account holders.  On many occasions, people have been overcharged and have not even been able to get a refund.  The banking institutions inhabit a very murky financial world where an awful lot of white-collar crime happens under our very noses and, unfortunately, with the co-operation of very many people within those institutions.  The regulatory authorities that are meant to be keeping a very close eye on this and to be doing something about it have very often failed, and those failings are brought to bear in all this.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is appropriate.  It will warrant adequate debate here, as I am sure it will over the coming days.  As we move forward we need to make sure we hold to account the people who have in the past wrecked communities and the lives of so many people around the world.  This happens not only in Ireland; unfortunately, it is a global phenomenon and we need to be part of a global solution to it.<\/p> <p>Transposing this EU directive into law is a first step in making that happen.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200027#AA00200","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600788600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire St&aacute;it nua.  I congratulate the Minister of State on his first appearance in this House.  As an aside, I have spoken to him about the importance of improving Tralee Courthouse and I look forward to a longer conversation regarding keeping it in mind and in the town centre.  I wish him the best of luck with that.<\/p>  <p>  As has been said, there are already robust and extensive anti-money laundering laws in place in Ireland and, having worked as a solicitor for a few years, I am well aware of the extensive money laundering compliance and due diligence that solicitors are obliged to undertake on an annual basis.  As the Minister of State said, money laundering and financing of terrorism are global issues and a coherent global approach is needed.  I submitted a parliamentary question which was answered at the beginning of the month in which I asked when this legislation would be brought forward.  At the end of the response to that question, it stated: \"It is also proposed to future proof our approach, by introducing amendments, to the published Bill, that will address our obligations as a member of the Financial Actions Task Force (FATF)\".  Will the Minister of State confirm that has been included? <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the dark money networks, we have seen over the past couple of days the role banks and other financial institutions have played in laundering money.  There is a race between tax authorities and some owners of private capital, who will seek any place to put their money to escape tax.  This Bill is welcome, insofar as it recognises this by putting obligations on various new designated persons to carry out anti-money laundering administration.  Allowing assets and cash to be hidden from tax authorities deepens inequality and weakens states.  There is a danger that cryptocurrencies could become a new frontier in this battle.  I commend the Bill's regulation of certain other relevant professions through sections 17 and 21.  Only a tiny minority of people in these professions engage in untoward behaviour but it is important there is legal recourse, as I see is provided for in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill increases some of the administrative obligations on credit unions but a new Act for the credit union sector is needed and better impact assessments should be carried out.  Credit unions are important institutions which we should not lose.  Around the country and in County Kerry, they are being forced to close or merge and the burden of regulation is one of the things that is causing this developments.  In many parts of County Kerry, some credit unions are so small they cannot afford to hire extra staff to cover all the necessary regulatory requirements.  If they merge, that helps to scale up their operations but it may deprive communities of a vital service.  Will the Minister of State consider a proper credit union Bill?  They are subject to different rules to the banks and they should be given a break at the moment.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to online fraud, the Bill is welcome.  There is serious evidence that online fraud is rising during the pandemic, having already been on an upward trend.  In the first three months of 2020, there was an increase of 15% in fraud compared to the same period in 2019.  In Kerry, fraud increased from 2018 to 2019 by 75%, according to Garda statistics.  Many categories of crime decreased in Kerry, I am glad to note, but fraud increased.  Cryptocurrencies are part of the growth in online fraud and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be properly resourced as recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  That report states the capacity and expertise of the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau should be substantially expanded as a matter of urgency and personnel appointments in that field should be fast-tracked by the Department.  Legislation alone is never enough and the Government needs to make good on its promise in the programme for Government to rapidly implement these recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, Sinn F&eacute;in supports this Bill, which we have called for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200028#BB00200","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1600788600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>The Bill is in many ways a step in the right direction and banks and financial institutions need to be held accountable for protecting their customers and for being scammed and facilitating illegal activity.  As previously stated, this Bill is intended to transpose this fifth EU anti-money laundering directive into Irish law.  The directive represents improvement in exposing the secretive ownership structures often used for tax evasion and other illegal activities.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the progress made, the proposal was weakened before it was agreed at EU level.  When offshore structures are protected, so too are other criminal activities.  Despite that, the original directive had its teeth removed.  The most important area in which the original directive was watered down relates to the issue of beneficial owners, which basically means the real owners of companies.  The idea was to stop cases where an offshore company could have a nominee director.  Such an individual could be hired in name and down as the owner for thousands of companies.  The Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers and other leaks have repeatedly shown that shelf companies with complex ownership structures allow for tax evasion around the world on an industrial scale.  We desperately need laws to address these secretive structures that allow company owners to be completely hidden.  It is one of the biggest challenges we face in making the wealthiest in society pay their fair share.  Yet, when this directive came back from the negotiations between the European Commission and the European Council, public access to the information was weakened and the proportion someone could own of a company while remaining hidden was increased.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill gives the public more transparency regarding who owns what company but people are right to ask why the information we are working with is still so limited.  The threshold for beneficial ownership is far too high at 25%.  Tax justice and transparency advocates argue that a single share should be enough to constitute beneficial ownership and I believe most ordinary people would agree.  Senior managers will still be allowed to be listed as beneficial owners, maintaining another important loophole.  We still will be obliged to prove legitimate interest to access details of beneficial ownership of trusts.<\/p>  <p>  On 10 August 2020, the Bill was agreed by the Cabinet.  The EU directive was agreed upon almost two years ago.  Ireland, like all member states, was given until January this year to pass legislation on it and this legislation should have been brought forward in 2019.  It was only after the European Court of Justice imposed a &euro;2 million fine on Ireland for delays, however, that action was taken.  First it was watered down and then it was delayed.  Why was this not introduced in 2019?  Why has it taken more than two years to bring forward this important legislation?  We should be bringing in stronger laws than those agreed at EU level.  We know the extent and the impact of the problem throughout this State but we have seen successive Governments resisting reform and blocking transparency into ownership structures and tax evasion.  While I welcome this Bill, which will go some way towards addressing that, there is a lot more to be done.  I urge the Government to put its citizens first and to do everything possible to stop the wealthiest hiding behind structures.  We need more transparency; it is only through transparency that we can have accountability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200028#BB00300","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1600788600,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I too congratulate the new Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, my constituency colleague, Deputy Browne, and I wish him every success in his appointment.  It is a demanding role and a demanding Department.  I was spokesman in the area in the past and one spends a lot of time in this Chamber because half of the legislation that comes though these Houses comes from the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p> <p>We should look at that situation, because it is not possible to give priority to all the areas under the remit of the Department.  Previously, we set up a Department of Equality and Law Reform.  Perhaps that is what is intended by offloading some of the work of the Department to the new Minister with responsibility for integration.  I cannot use the opportunity, as Deputy Daly did, to lobby for a new courthouse for Wexford, because that has, thankfully, been provided.  I wish him well in his endeavours and Tralee would be an ideal location.   <\/p> <p> I welcome this Bill.  It is an extraordinarily important area of focus and a very complex one.  Many people do not know the minutiae of world finance or how capital and money flow seamlessly across the globe.  Humanity, as a body, needs to have control of that flow and to understand what is going on.  We can only act internationally on these types of issues.  There is no point having domestic law that does not have a wide scope, and that is why it is important that we use the institutions of the European Union to act in concert with the other member states so we can control this menacing area.  <\/p> <p> In his contribution, the Minister of State spoke about the process of continually updating.  That is very important, because money laundering is a worldwide crime that is evolving all the time, with new mechanisms being devised because the profits are so enormous.  Bluntly, the mechanisms we use to counteract it are not up to the mark and have not been to date.  Across the globe we see kleptocracies, where regimes rob the raw resources of their own people.  In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, we saw how individual citizens became multimillionaires at a time many people were impoverished.  Much of that money was anchored offshore.  It travelled all over the world and was put into various mechanisms and financial vehicles.  It continues now from a variety of international sources, from criminal sources in the drugs trade and terrorist sources.  We must apply ourselves to ensuring that we are as agile as legislators and law enforcers as is the criminal community.  <\/p> <p> I welcome this Bill.  It is technical, and one of these Bills where it is necessary to read the anchoring legislation to cross reference the amendments and changes being made.  I add my voice, however, to the words of criticism of the Bill.  It is unfortunate that we are in breach of the timeline set out in an EU directive and have been fined &euro;2 million.  We could do with spending that &euro;2 million in many better ways than being fined for our own tardiness in a matter such as this.  That is particularly the case when it is absolutely in the interests of Ireland that this legislation be enacted, and no Administration that we have had would not have been highly supportive of the provisions of this legislation.  <\/p> <p> The EU regulations are designed to introduce transparency, as the Minister of State has set out, on the ownership of companies.  This is one of the areas we must delve into deeply to find out who are the beneficial owners, because it is possible to have offshoot companies anchored in offshore companies that are anchored in holding companies, which are designed to make the real beneficial owners as opaque as possible.  The regulations also reinforce surveillance requirements, and that is important.  We know from our economic collapse that the institutions we trusted to have oversight of the banking system here were not up to the mark.  Considering how important financial services are to Ireland, we must ask whether the resources now being deployed and the oversight bodies that exist are up to the role that Ireland wants to play as a major international hub for financial services.  <\/p> <p> Firms located in Ireland provide financial services to every major economy.  We are a small island and we have a small cohort of people involved in oversight of financial services, but the financial services we provide on this island are of an enormous scale, one we would not have envisaged a few decades ago.  According to Industrial Development Authority Ireland, IDA, financial services employ 42,000 people in Ireland.  The sector contributes &euro;2.3 billion in taxes annually to the State.  It is not confined to Dublin, as the Minister of State will be aware.  We have financial services companies in Wexford and they operate all the way up to Donegal, although the hub is obviously in Dublin. <\/p> <p> Some 250 leading financial services firms operate out of Ireland and half of the world's top 50 banks have representation in, and transact business, in Ireland.  The sums involved are staggering.  More than &euro;1.8 trillion in funds are administered from Ireland.  Considering the capacity of Ireland and the throughput of the economy - and I know that gross domestic product, GDP, is now an abused term and it would even take several people to explain what modified gross national income, GNI*, is - these funds under administration are multiples of that figure.<\/p> <p> According to Enterprise Ireland, the Irish Stock Exchange is the world leading listing venue for fund and structured debt products.  We are not, therefore, small players in international financial services and we must have oversight mechanisms that protect our reputation.  In the past, Ireland's reputation has been dented by measures such as the \"double Irish\" and particular mechanisms used to attract foreign direct investment, FDI.  We must be crystal clear that we will provide an oversight mechanism equal to the capacity of these financial services to operate on our island into the future.  <\/p> <p> In that regard, I refer to the resources now available.  Despite what I read in one recent tweet from Fine Gael, the former Deputy and Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, set up the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, in 1996, after the shocking murders of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and Veronica Guerin.  Those murders shocked the nation to the core.  The CAB has been a very successful mechanism.  The old adage is that Al Capone was put away for tax evasion and not for all the murders and other awfulness in which he was involved.  Taking away the assets of people who cannot prove that they acquired them properly has been an effective mechanism. <\/p> <p> Turning to the operation of financial services, we now have the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, GNECB, formerly the Garda Bureau for Fraud Investigation, GBFI.  The GNECB is now the main entity overseeing the implications of this legislation, although the CAB and other agencies will also be involved.  Is the GNECB adequately resourced for the task?  I ask that question given the scale of the financial entities existing on this island.<\/p> <p>The reply to the most recent parliamentary question I asked stated that the full complement of the GNECB is 72 garda&iacute;, 19 civilian staff, plus three accountants.  I thought it striking that three accountants are a part of the bureau,  The complement of accountants has not been greatly enhanced since the GBFI operated in this space even though the throughput of cash and resources flowing through Ireland has increased immeasurably and, to put it bluntly, is likely to increase further with the advent of Brexit.  The IDA and the Government are looking to have resources, including banks, insurance firms, reinsurance companies and so on, relocate to Ireland rather than to Luxembourg or Frankfurt if they are to leave London and need a European home.  If we are going to be proactive in looking for that business, we need to be equally proactive in ensuring that the oversight is there to ensure that all that business is above suspicion, like Lot's wife, and is seen to be.  It must be clear that we have a patent and clear capacity within our oversight bodies to ensure that is the case.<\/p> <p> Other Deputies have talked about the move to cryptocurrencies.  That is an area that is directly dealt with in the directive and lends itself particularly to the area of fraud.  There can be incredible movement in the value of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin over a short time.  Others have touched on the impact of this on ordinary people in our society.  The most recent example in the media has been the issue of money mules, where young people, often students, have been inveigled into allowing their bank accounts to be used to launder money, to be frank, and are given a token payment, a pittance, for that.  We need to alert people to the consequences of doing that.  Money laundering is a serious offence and carries a jail term of up to 14 years under legislation enacted by these Houses.  It could also be ruinous for somebody's life.  A conviction under legislation such as this would preclude people travelling to many countries.  They need to be alerted to that.<\/p> <p> We are moving fast towards a cashless society and the advent of Covid-19 has accelerated that in a clear way.  Many people are not comfortable with that but people did not, and do not, want to handle cash at the moment so all of us are using our cards and an awful lot of people simply do not carry cash.  I thought how fast we have already moved in that regard when I saw somebody begging on the street and taking cards.  A cashless society will intensify the requirement for oversight because we will never see our money and, in the future, it will always be figures generated on our mobile phones.  All of that will require us to be personally vigilant and to have assurances from State authorities that the failure of oversight that led to the economic collapse of 2009 and 2010 will not recur and impoverish people yet again.<\/p> <p> There are a few references in the legislation that people who are relatively new to politics may find a little jarring.  There is the concept of a politically exposed person, PEP.  We are all PEPs and require particular monitoring and surveillance.  This was recently brought to my attention by somebody who had been elected to the national executive of the Labour Party, and I am sure the same happens in every other party.  That person was notified by their bank that they are a PEP.  \"What is a PEP and what does it mean for me?\", they asked.  I told them that it means that there is particular scrutiny on people who have political roles and authority.  Some of the antics of the past have made that a necessary requirement.  That can be seen to be absolutely true when one looks at obvious corruption around the world.  While we can condemn corruption and decry kleptocracies that rob the resources of their own people, we in the West often provide the wherewithal for those same robbers to hide their money in our banking and financial systems.  We must be clear about that, set our faces against that and expose that in a co-ordinated, international way.<\/p> <p> This legislation is a significant step on a continuous road because we are never going to be done with this.  Just as the clever brains of those who are involved in money laundering will develop new strategies, we must develop new laws to combat that.<\/p> <p> I will conclude by talking about what money laundering and terrorist financing are.  For money laundering to occur, the fraud involved must generate funds that are the proceeds of crime.  Money laundering is the processing of the proceeds of crime.  For terrorist financing to occur, the source of the funds is not relevant.  Even if the sources of the funds are legitimate, it is a serious criminal event that needs to be addressed if they are obviously being used to fund terrorism.  <\/p> <p> I believe we can enact decent law, evolve and be relatively agile in our legislation but my overarching concern is that, as in many areas of public business, we construct elaborate legal frameworks without the wherewithal to ensure that they are properly, effectively and extensively resourced.

A rate of &euro;250 will apply to those who previously earned between &euro;200 and &euro;300 per week and the rate of &euro;203 remains unchanged for those who had prior earnings of less than &euro;200 per week.<\/p> <p>For people on the new rate of &euro;250 per week, the payment will equate to between 83% and 125% of prior earnings and, on average, 105% of prior earnings.  One of the reasons it is necessary to recalibrate the PUP is so that we can extend its availability while being mindful of the cost to the State.  While we can borrow money now, ultimately these borrowings will have to be repaid by young and future generations of workers.  The income related rates of payment are a fair and equitable way to make the necessary adjustments and facilitate the extension of the scheme to the end of March next year.  My Department is advising those people affected of these rate changes and is setting out for them the basis for the decision in each case.  <br\/><br\/>The PUP has been extended until end of March 2021 and will continue to provide support to workers from sectors facing extended periods of closure, including the entertainment industry.

This represents a 58% reduction from 14,200 claimants in that sector at the peak in May.  This reduction in the numbers of people in receipt of the PUP is in line with reductions seen in other sectors and indicates that some people working in the sector have been able to return to work as the public health restrictions were relaxed.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, I am acutely aware that many of workers in the live events sector are still reliant on the PUP and that two factors in particular distinguish the challenges faced by workers in that sector.  First, the performing arts sector is still more heavily restricted than most other sectors.  Second, working patterns in the performing arts sector, which tend to be gig based, do not lend themselves to a clear delineation between being employed and unemployed.

The Government is committed to protecting vulnerable households from the impact of energy costs through a combination of supports, energy efficiency awareness initiatives and investment in programmes to improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to income supports, my Department provides a range of schemes to assist with energy costs.  These include the fuel allowance, which is a payment of &euro;24.50 per week for 28 weeks from October to April, giving a total of &euro;686 per annum.  It cost in the region of &euro;261.35 million in 2020 for payments to an average of some 352,000 low-income households.  Payments for the 2020&ndash;21 fuel season will start to issue under this scheme next week.  Also included are electricity or gas allowances under the household benefits scheme, at an estimated cost of &euro;194 million in 2020; a special heating supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme; and exceptional needs payments, to help meet an essential once-off cost that an applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources.  Owing to the Covid-19 emergency, the fuel allowance 2019&ndash;20 season was extended by four weeks from 10 April to 8 May 2020 to help protect the vulnerable during the lockdown phase of the national response. <\/p>  <p>  As committed to in the programme for Government, the ESRI is carrying out a study on how best to minimise fuel poverty in the context of carbon tax commitments.  The programme for Government has committed to hypothecating all additional funds raised by the carbon tax into a climate action fund, which will be utilised, in part, to provide for targeted social welfare initiatives to prevent fuel poverty and ensure a just transition.  This was done in the last budget when &euro;21 million was ring-fenced from the approximately &euro;90 million being raised from the carbon tax increase to fund an additional &euro;2 per week in the fuel allowance and to add an additional &euro;13 million to the warmer homes scheme allocation.

We must acknowledge that cost is a factor.  We have the fourth highest electricity costs in Europe.  The same applies to gas.  Taking out the taxes and charges, suppliers in Ireland are charging a fortune, way above the EU average, for electricity and gas.  We must couple this with the fact that Electric Ireland has announced it is increasing its charges from October.  Carbon tax increases were introduced in May, despite our being in the midst of a global pandemic, and we are aware that the PSO levy is due to increase in October.

As the Deputy knows, carer's allowance is a means-tested payment for carers who, on a full-time basis, look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention, where the carer's income falls below certain limits.  At the end of August 2020, there were 87,733 people in receipt of carer's allowance and the projected expenditure is approximately &euro;919 million.<\/p>  <p>  The means test for carer's allowance is probably the most generous in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to earnings disregards.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  A couple earning up to &euro;37,500 per year can qualify for the maximum rate and a couple earning &euro;49,750 can, due to the tapered withdrawal approach, retain a payment of just under half-rate.  A single person may keep a full-rate payment while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000 and keep a payment of just under half-rate while having an annual income of &euro;25,400.  The means test conditionality for carer's allowance is consistent with the overall rules that apply to social assistance payments.  The system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need, with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency, be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.<\/p>  <p>  The application of a means-test not only ensures that the recipient has an income need but also that scarce resources are targeted to those with the greatest need.  Any changes to the means for carer's allowance would have implications for overall spending and would need to be addressed in a budgetary context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200038#MM01100","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1600795200,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I am not comfortable with the phrase the Minister used about this being the most generous income disregard.

If it is a child or adult with a profound disability, the savings are multiples of that on a weekly basis.

The PUP was introduced as an emergency measure to provide an income support to those who had lost their employment as a result of Covid.  A flat payment rate was introduced to ensure that the scheme was simple and accessible for the unprecedented number of applicants.<\/p>  <p>  On 26 June 2020, the PUP moved to two rates of payment.  This change more closely linked the rate of payment to the amount that individuals previously earned.  For employees, the greater of their gross weekly earnings in either 2019 or January to February 2020 was used to determine the rate of payment.  For self-employed people, a different approach was required, based on their average weekly income for 2018 as this was the latest tax year for which verifiable data on self-employed income was available.  As the Deputy will be aware, I subsequently asked my officials to ensure that where self-employed income for 2019 was available, this was also taken into account.  We wanted to make sure people received as much support as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Those who felt that the assessment of their earnings, based on returns submitted to Revenue, was inaccurate could ask for a review of their case.  To date, 1,064 individuals have had their rate of payment increased.  In addition, a detailed examination of all cases was undertaken by the Department to take account of updated income details where these had become available.  This identified a further 3,885 currently awarded claims where the rate of payment should have remained at &euro;350 from 26 June 2020.  Arrears will issue to these customers this week.<\/p>  <p>  A further 11,815 claims, which are now closed, have been identified for examination as arrears may also be due in those cases if payment extended beyond 26 June.  Once this examination is complete, the payment of rate change arrears will be addressed.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The officials and staff in the Department have done Trojan work.

This issue not only affects the length and breadth of Dublin but other urban centres across the country.  My colleague, Deputy Gould, has highlighted the issue in his area in Cork city.<\/p><p>The use of fireworks began as early as June this year, much earlier than in other years.  Our elderly residents are afraid of their use.  Business owners have been targeted and have considered closing their shops and premises earlier.  Families and workers have had their quality of life impacted.  Children on the autism spectrum who are more sensitive to noise and light are terrified.<\/p><p>Fireworks are, however, the symptom of a larger problem.  Antisocial behaviour is on the increase, along with open drug dealing and scrambler bikes becoming more prevalent in our areas.  A report I received from Dublin Bus showed a 200% increase in bus service curtailments due to antisocial behaviour in July and August this year compared with the same time last year.  This includes missiles and fireworks being aimed at buses, putting driver and passenger safety at risk.<\/p><p>Why is this happening?  Community Garda numbers have decreased with Dublin seeing 45% fewer community garda&iacute; in 2020 than in 2010.  Last March, the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, issued a directive which placed community garda&iacute; on a contingency roster.  That meant that there were no community garda&iacute; working in our communities after 7 p.m.  Our communities have been abandoned and left vulnerable, as well as unsafe, by this decision.<\/p><p>One does not have to be a rocket scientist to work out the connection between a decreased Garda presence at night and an increase in antisocial behaviour and criminal activity.  There is a sense of lawlessness within some of our communities.  A Sinn F&eacute;in councillor on Dublin City Council, Daith&iacute; Doolan, recently tabled an emergency motion calling for a fireworks task force to be formed.  This was unanimously supported by all parties and none on Dublin City Council.  This motion is calling for a restoration of community Garda numbers to 2010 levels.  We are also calling for the Garda Commissioner to immediately reverse his decision and allow community garda&iacute; to work in our communities after 7 p.m.<\/p><p>Operation Tombola, which is launched every year in the run-up to Hallowe'en, did not begin this year until 4 September despite the issues being visible from June and July.  Operation Tombola needs to be more flexible and brought forward.<\/p><p>This is a common-sense motion.  It is common sense to want safe communities, that the elderly should be protected and that our families and workers have a better quality of life.  However, common sense is not very common when it comes to Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  I am asking all parties and none to put aside political differences and let common sense prevail by passing this motion to allow safety to be restored in our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200040#OO00400","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1600796400,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague and constituency partner, Deputy Ward, for tabling this important motion.  We have had lots of discussions in our society about how Covid-19 has impacted various sections of our population but we probably have not discussed enough the very negative impact it has had on our young people.  It is really important we do not as a society demonise young people because the past seven months have been exceptionally difficult for many of them.  The closure of schools, the temporary loss of youth services, the closure of sporting clubs and the suspension of other activities have put an enormous strain on young people, particularly the younger cohorts.  This does not in any way excuse antisocial behaviour, no matter its level of seriousness.  However, when we have spoken to hard-working community garda&iacute; and youth workers on the front line, as I am sure other colleagues have, they tell us they have noticed that Covid-19 has had an impact on a wider section of young people than we would often talk about in these debates.  The loss of structure and routine in their lives has left many young people vulnerable to forms of activity which would not necessarily be the way they would ordinarily behave.  Front-line youth services in particular are chronically underfunded.  I see in the House Deputies from a range of Dublin constituencies and in every one of them, from Finglas and Ballymun to the north inner city to the south inner city and to Deputy Ward and me in the west, our front-line services do not have enough funding to provide good quality activity for young people to be involved in.  The National Youth Council of Ireland is calling on the Government to increase the youth work services budget in budget 2021 significantly.<\/p>  <p>  We have incredible sports facilities run in the main by voluntary groups.  In my constituency there is the Esker boxing club, Clondalkin Celtic FC, Knockmitten United FC and there are all our Gaelic athletic clubs the length and breadth of the country.  Again, however, they are chronically under-resourced because our local authorities, one of the main sources of community funding, are themselves underfunded in this area of activity.  I wish to make very clear that the very best antidote to antisocial behaviour, particularly for the vast majority of young people who might be tempted to get involved in it, are positive, pro-social activities within their communities, properly resourced with the infrastructure, the full-time staff and the support for volunteers.  That needs to be part of the focus.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Ward, is absolutely right that our other problem is the lack of proper investment in community garda&iacute;.  What is important about community garda&iacute; is that they are not the heavy hand of the law; they are the soft, proactive, preventative community policing.  Young people get to know their community garda&iacute; and engage with them on the streets through inter-league soccer matches etc. to address these problems.  I therefore urge Government Deputies to support the spirit and letter of this motion to ensure we get that additional investment.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to make an appeal to young people and their parents.  I ask them to be mindful of their neighbours, the pensioners, the children with special needs and people with pets, all of whom are wholly negatively affected by this phenomenon.  I ask them to have respect for the people in their communities because if we work together we will ensure a better quality of life for everybody: more investment in youth services, more investment in sports and more investment in community garda&iacute;.  Let us look after one another and not make one another's lives more difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200041#PP00100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1600796400,"counter":367,"content":"<p>My constituency of Dublin Bay North is no different from that of the previous speakers.  Since August of this year fireworks, rockets and bangers have been going off morning, noon and night.  People are afraid.  Our elderly people have had bangers put through their letterboxes.  Fireworks have been aimed at people and moving cars.  People's property has been damaged and children are afraid to go out to play.  This is also causing huge distress to our pets.  It needs to stop.  Our communities need assistance and supports.  It is unfair on everyone living in these areas and they should not have to put up with it.  We all know fireworks are illegal, but somehow my community has been flooded with them and those selling them need to cop on.  We need the Garda to intervene.  On top of this, we have seen an increase in antisocial behaviour, which is reflected in communities all across Dublin that are having problems with drugs and gangs.  This has all been well reported on but it remains the same.  Is it any wonder when we have 230 fewer community garda&iacute; than we did ten years ago?  I raised in June the lack of community garda&iacute; with the Minister's predecessor as well as the lack of community resources and supports for the Garda in my area.

We now have only 11 assigned to the region.  That is disgraceful, but I am not surprised because Governments have neglected our communities for decades when it has come to policing resources.<\/p>  <p>  We need to get a grip on this because we are still a month out from Hallowe'en and I can only imagine this behaviour getting worse as Hallowe'en approaches.  People in these communities have been tormented and they have a right to feel safe in their homes and their communities.  They need the Garda to be resourced properly so it can respond to this.  I know that many people will be watching this and will be hoping the Government will support these communities that are crying out for help.  I call on all Deputies across all parties and none to support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200041#PP00200","speaker":"1464"},{"type":"speech","time":1600796400,"counter":368,"content":"<p>Community safety is not just an empty concept.  The Government has to look at it and invest in it.  It needs to invest in community garda&iacute; and I will come back to that.  It needs to invest not only in youth services and community facilities but also in CCTV cameras and the courts.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, this motion is not aimed at demonising young people, but there is a responsibility on many people, the youth included.  The main responsibility, however, lies with the State to ensure that it properly invests in, helps and encourages the youth to go about their activities safely in order that they enjoy themselves.  Facilities must be available to them in order that we do not end up as we do year on year coming up to Hallowe'en with absolute chaos in some parts of this city.  This year the chaos started a lot earlier and comes on top of the issue of scramblers, the open drug dealing, attacks on people along the canals in my area and elsewhere and damage to playgrounds.  Every single day since the middle of August, I have had constituents writing to me asking me to get the Garda to react to the targeting of their houses, their cars and other properties.  Buses have been targeted with fireworks, which are very loud and very damaging.  There has not seemed to be a proportionate response, or any response some nights, to any of these activities.  People, especially the elderly, are in absolute fear and anxiety.  Their dogs are fretting.  Panic sets in.  It is unbearable for many.  In some cases people are targeted as they walk down the street because they have had the decency to ring and ask for help from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Still there is no response when they come under attack.  Sometimes the roads are taken up with people firing fireworks at one another.  In other cases people are targeted with bangers thrown at them and their children as they watch football matches.  That is not good enough and the State has to act and defend the citizens who feel they are under attack.  They do not just fear being under attack; in many cases they are under attack.<\/p>  <p>  There is a reason this is happening.  The cuts in Dublin South-Central had a consequence.  Once there were 99 community garda&iacute;.  That dropped to a low of 28 two years ago.  A police service cannot be run with such a low number of community garda&iacute;.  I therefore appeal to the Minister not just to support this motion but to act on it quickly in order that we do not end up seeing this problem escalate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200041#PP00300","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1600796400,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I have a copy of the Minister of State's speech.

It was July or August in my area.<\/p> <p>The explosive noise of the bangers seems to be louder than in previous years and I do not remember them ever starting this early.  There seems to be greater availability of them.

One man said a blast went off at about 2 a.m. or 3 a.m.  It set off alarms, dogs were barking and it terrified people.  People talked of the impact it has on the elderly.  In one area, the playground was used as a launching pad and the remnants of the rockets landed on the houses of the senior citizens in the area.  One can imagine lying in bed and this stuff hitting the roof.  In another area, I know of a man who is seriously ill and rockets hit the back window of his house.  One can imagine the terror in that house and this man is terminally ill.  There is all that evidence out there.<\/p> <p> We are asking for a different response. The Minister launched a campaign today but this has been going on for months in our communities.  People are looking for answers and the idea for tonight's debate is to have the Government focus on it and to look for action that will come as a response from the Garda.  I appeal to the Minister of State to perhaps go off his script and address some of the issues affecting our communities.  This is not an anti-Garda motion.

In my constituency of Dublin North-West, we have been plagued by individuals letting off bangers and rockets on a continual basis during the day, in the evening and at night for nearly three months.  People are at the end of their tether with these incessant and at times deafening daily explosions.  They are causing a great amount of distress to residents, animals, pets and the elderly.<\/p>  <p>  What surprises me most is there seems to be an endless supply of these fireworks.  If the past three months are any indication, there does not seem to be any obstacle to people's ability to get their hands on them.  I am aware there is an increasing number of incidents where individuals have used them in a dangerous manner by targeting people's homes, shops and transport.  Fireworks have also been aimed recklessly at people, children and animals and as a result some have had serious injuries.  This places an additional and unnecessary burden on our already hard-pressed emergency and hospital services at a time when resources should be focused on combating this pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  With such large quantities of fireworks available, I fear for what will happen at Hallowe'en and in the build-up to it.  I expect a serious escalation in the use of these illegal fireworks to the detriment of our community.  We need a strong Garda response to this issue now.  The Garda needs the resources to tackle this antisocial activity, which has gone far beyond being a nuisance and is a daily torment for our community.  The reality on the ground is that community garda&iacute; are being released from duty each evening at 7 p.m., at a time when this sort of activity more likely to occur.  More members of the Garda should be made available to safeguard communities from this scourge.  This can happen more readily if the Garda overtime ban is removed, particularly from those areas most affected by this problem.  I have spoken previously in the D&aacute;il about the effect of the illegal use of fireworks, particularly on those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, or on those with sensory sensitivity issues such as children with autism.  They, like older residents of our communities, are feeling terrorised on a daily basis with these fireworks.  They feel trapped in their homes and the noise levels are so high at times that it is impossible to drown out the noise of this latest generation of bangers and rockets.  Our communities are now feeling the effects of cuts to policing, which plays a vital role in combating antisocial activity.  Until these cuts are reversed and real recruitment begins, this antisocial behaviour will continue.<\/p>  <p>  Every year, Finglas and Ballymun have their own fireworks display and Dublin City Council has done a marvellous job in bringing communities with them and in reducing the number of fireworks in the area.

<\/blockquote>  <p>While it is not possible for the Government to support the Private Members&rsquo; motion tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in, I welcome the opportunity to update the D&aacute;il on the ongoing proactive work the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are doing to both raise awareness of the dangers and illegality of fireworks and to combat their importation, sale and use.  An amendment setting out the current and future work of the Government in this regard has been tabled and moved and I will, with the agreement of the House, take it as read.<\/p><p>At the outset, I assure Members that the Government is committed to ensuring Ireland is a safe and secure place for all.  The well-being of our communities is a priority and we want members of the public to be confident and secure in going about their lives at all times of the year.  I share the concerns raised about the misuse of fireworks.  Deputies will appreciate that at this time of year, combating the abuse of fireworks presents additional challenges for authorities.  But I can assure Deputies that these challenges are factored into annual work plans and appropriate resources are in place to address them.  That said, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and I are all too conscious of the numerous incidents and, sadly, some serious accidents arising from the use of illegal fireworks. <\/p><p>Every year in the run up to Hallowe'en, my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, together with local authorities and the emergency services, engage in additional work to try to keep everyone safe and to raise awareness of the dangers associated with improper use of fireworks.  Just today, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, launched the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s annual fireworks awareness campaign.  We are asking people thinking about using and buying fireworks to think again and not to add to the problems already faced by so many in our communities during this pandemic. <\/p><p>Our emergency services are battling Covid-19.  We owe it to them this Hallowe'en not to unnecessarily increase the pressure they are facing by filling emergency rooms with preventable injuries caused by the use of illegal fireworks.  Our elderly neighbours, who already are worried about the pandemic and who have cocooned and restricted their movements, do not need the extra worry of fireworks going off near their homes.  When it comes to fireworks, we are asking people to not add to the problem. <\/p><p>Nobody disagrees with the fact that fireworks are explosives which can maim and even kill.  Nor will anyone contest the fact that fireworks are dangerous in untrained and unlicensed hands.  They also cause serious distress for pets and livestock.  What we cannot agree with is the suggestion that the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not proactively addressing these issues.  It is not correct to infer that the increased use of fireworks is as a result of lacking resources or action on the part of Garda authorities or that members of the Garda are not working closely with local communities to deal with this in an appropriate way.  We have strong legislation dealing with the importation, sale and use of illegal fireworks.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already has launched its Hallowe'en policing plan, Operation Tombola.  This year, it was launched a month early in Dublin in recognition of the increased use of fireworks.<\/p><p>The sale or use of fireworks by unlicensed people is not only incredibly dangerous, it is illegal.  Government policy restricts the availability of all hazardous fireworks to the public.  Licences under the Explosives Act are issued by the Department of Justice and Equality only for the importation of fireworks to be used in organised displays conducted by professional and competent people.  The penalties for misusing fireworks go right up to fines of &euro;10,000 and five years in prison.  The penalties are high because the dangers are real. <\/p> <p>In addition to the power to make arrests for the possession of unlicensed fireworks, the Garda has available several strong legislative provisions to combat antisocial behaviour more generally.  These include the Criminal Damage Act 1991; the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994; the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.<\/p> <p> Deputies should acknowledge the significant efforts made all year, but redoubled at this time, by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat the importation, sale and use of illegal fireworks.  Operation Tombola runs across the country until the end of October.  It focuses on combating the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks and ensures appropriate policing plans are in place over this period.  Each district has its own plan, focusing on preventing public disorder and antisocial behaviour through the deployment of resources, including Garda public order units to augment local plans, as appropriate and necessary.<\/p> <p> As well as recognising this work, I ask the House to also recognise the close and ongoing co-operation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Mechanisms are in place that provide a good overarching framework for co-operation between the two forces, support law enforcement efforts and allow the policing services to identify the appropriate and most effective response in all matters, including the movement of illegal fireworks across the Border.  In fact, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, was informed by the Commissioner that this specific issue will be discussed at a strategic level at a forthcoming meeting of the cross-border joint agency task force strategic oversight group in the coming days.<\/p> <p> Regarding Garda resources, it is important to note that the Commissioner is responsible for managing and controlling An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the allocation and efficient use of Garda resources.  This includes decisions regarding the allocation and deployment of Garda personnel nationwide.  The Commissioner and his management team are best placed to make the expert judgments necessary about where to place Garda resources.  It would not be appropriate to substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner and his management team.  That said, I assure Deputies that the Government is committed to continuing to train and induct new recruits into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na annually.  Funding has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in budget 2020 for the recruitment of up to 700 garda&iacute;, and additional Garda staff, the balance of which will be for the Commissioner to decide, based on identified operational demands.<\/p> <p> The programme for Government gives priority to more visible policing in rural and urban communities and the removal of Garda members from administrative, technical and other non-core duties to allow them focus on core policing matters.  A key commitment in the policing reform plan, A Policing Service for the Future, is the roll-out of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's new operating model, which reorganises resources around the delivery of front-line policing, placing an increased emphasis on engaging with communities and supporting the victims of crime.  This will strengthen further community policing and engagement and will provide a more localised, responsive policing service for each division nationwide.<\/p> <p> I also draw attention to the Government's plan to bring the full range of community-based youth justice interventions together in a way that allows for them to be tailored to the needs of local communities and the specific challenges posed by young people in those communities.  The youth justice strategy will set out specific commitments, and it is intended that it will be brought to Government before the end of the year.<\/p> <p> We all agree that fireworks present more dangers than many seem to realise.  These include dangers associated with explosion, which can injure, main or even kill, not to mention the negative impacts on the well-being of our communities.  In light of Covid-19, the Government is aware that now, more than ever, it is particularly important that all steps are taken to prevent additional strain on the resources of hospitals, such as those which could result from preventable firework-related injuries.<\/p> <p> The Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are committed to combating the sale and use of unlicensed fireworks and to addressing related antisocial behaviour.  We are working proactively together to do this - this year more than ever - and I ask the House to support the Government's amendment moved to reflect this intention.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy McEntee, will address the issues raised by the Deputies in her closing remarks later this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200042#QQ00300","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600797600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I will be supporting the Government's amendment to the motion, and I urge the Opposition to do the same, in order that we can send a strong message from this House that the type of activity taking place in Dublin in recent months is unacceptable and this House rejects it.  I agree with other Deputies who described the problem, which dates back to July, of people with pets, people with children with special needs and older people being terrorised in their own communities.  The difficulty is that in communities such as mine, people often look out the window and see scrambler bikes and open drug dealing going unchecked by the powers that be.  Then they hear the bangs of fireworks and do not even bother reporting them.<\/p>  <p>  It was in that context that I wrote to the Garda Commissioner.  When he was appointed, he said \"Crime is not like rain, it does not fall evenly on us all\".  Community policing in my area is being undermined by this activity.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe said that this motion provided us with a focus with which to deal with this issue.  I suggest that the Deputy is late to the party.  I have been dealing with this matter with the Minister and the Garda Commissioner since August.  I was pleased last week to receive correspondence from the assistant commissioner stating that Operation Tombola has been brought forward by a month.  That will be a necessary intervention.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcomed the public safety campaign on fireworks also being brought forward by one month.  I had the great pleasure to launch it last year when I was the Lord Mayor.  This year's campaign was launched today by the Minister, one month earlier than last year.  The Commissioner has assured the new Government that these measures are already having an impact on the ground.  I am not sure people in my area believe that yet, but we have time.  We must deliver before Hallowe'en, because if we do not life will be unbearable in communities such as mine.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200043#RR00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1600797600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I am not sure which Deputy from Sinn F&eacute;in is speaking, but he or she has ten minutes.

Two weeks ago, a young woman in the park in Ringsend was hit in the forehead by rocket.  When I say there was a hole in her head, I am not exaggerating.  It was horrendous.  It was an image that could not be unseen and was hard to get out of one's mind.  It was traumatic, I imagine, for the poor woman.<\/p>  <p>  This year, the community development section in Dublin City Council has not been able to plan community activities around Hallowe'en, as it has done in recent years.  The fireworks seem to be particularly bad this year.  They seem stronger in their power, the people using them are being more reckless and they started to let off these fireworks in June and July.  I do not think it is a coincidence that we have a particular problem this year.  The Garda used to have a community schools programme but that is no longer running.  That would be an effective way of addressing this issue, although it might not be as trendy or fashionable as looking for social media influencers. <\/p>  <p>  Dublin City Council community development section has developed amazing projects in recent years.  Those projects have effectively turned what in many ways were no-go areas around Hallowe'en into locations with really exciting and enjoyable activities, in which there was major engagement by local communities.  It is also important to recognise and acknowledge the positive work community garda&iacute; do.  I mentioned the schools programme but I know that the Cabbage Garden, not too far from here, at Kevin Street, was a no-go area for years, especially in the run-up to and during Hallowe'en.  The work of the community development team in Dublin City Council and the community garda&iacute;, however, made last year a real success, turned around all the antisocial behaviour, drug dealing and trouble for residents and made Hallowe'en a very enjoyable experience.  The same goes for Ringsend, where Dublin City Council developed a great community project that really made a difference to everyone in the area. <\/p>  <p>  To offer something positive and a possible solution, therefore, I believe that if Dublin City Council's community development team had the funding, it would be possible to ensure that more great projects could happen and that problems, such as the events we have been experiencing this year, would not be so prevalent.  The community projects developed by Dublin City Council must be resourced.  The inner city has been forgotten about for long enough and we must provide proper resources to that area.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200043#RR00400","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1600797600,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Three speakers remain and just six and a half minutes.

The Minister has heard that our communities sound like war zones because of the number of fireworks that have been going off for the past number of months and their power.  Dozens of messages and videos about this issue have been sent to me through Facebook by people from across Dublin West, from the Navan Road, through Tyrrelstown and down to Ongar.  I was walking my dog in the Millennium Park, next to where I live, and I could turn 360 degrees and see fireworks going off in every direction.  They were everywhere and the sound of them was deafening.<\/p>  <p>  Sadly, a number of young people have been injured, some by accident and others because fireworks were fired at them.  There is no doubt that the pandemic and the situation we are in have led to an increase in the number of young people on the streets.  They would usually have supports available to them, including schools, community services, For&oacute;ige, youth services and community garda&iacute;.  Those kinds of people would ordinarily have been around and engaging with young people but they have not been around as much recently.  They are doing much of their work through Zoom and that is not effective.  Young people need a one-to-one connection and I hope we can start to return to that in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  There are two major issues with Garda resources.  The first is that we do not have enough of them.  There were 88 community garda&iacute; in Dublin West in 2010 and today there are 79.  The loss of nine garda&iacute; may not sound like a lot but, in the context of Dublin West, that is a huge resource.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue is that community garda&iacute; do not feel as valued as other members of the Garda because when a crime takes place, whether a shooting, a robbery or another incident, and the Garda needs somebody to conduct door-to-door inquiries, community garda&iacute; are the first group to be pulled away from their duties to do that type of work.  That stops them from engaging with local communities and young people.  That needs to stop.  We need community garda&iacute; to be completely valued like every other unit in the force.<\/p>  <p>  Before I let my colleagues in, I wish to strike a good note.  Every year in Fingal and Dublin 15, For&oacute;ige, the Blanchardstown community policing forum, Fingal County Council, the Garda and the community have all come together to provide wonderful community projects.  I hope they can be resourced even better this year.  We need these projects even more this year because of the events of recent months.  I hope the Minister listens and we get those extra resources for communities, youth services and the Garda to deal with this matter.  It can be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200044#SS00100","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1600798200,"counter":379,"content":"<p>The remaining Sinn F&eacute;in speakers have a minute and a half each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200044#SS00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1600798200,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I will keep my contribution short.  At this time of year, everyone in this House receives a stream of phone calls from their communities with reports of fireworks, bangers and bonfires.  It is nothing new, but I have noticed that reports are coming in earlier every year.  It has now got to a stage where fireworks are being let off all year round and not just at Hallowe'en.  They are disruptive, dangerous and being purchased and used illegally.  The problem persists, so clearly there is something wrong with the efforts to combat it.<\/p>  <p>  One of the problems is the lack of significant numbers of community garda&iacute;.  This antisocial behaviour is happening at a time when the number of community garda&iacute; in the State has fallen from 1,182 in 2010 to 710 in July 2020.  In the Tipperary division alone, the number has fallen from 108 to 79 in the same period.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that I am running out of time.  Something needs to be done.

I heard the Minister's backbench colleague tell us that we need to send a strong message and indeed we do.  I also heard him say that he has been dealing with this matter for years, which highlights the effectiveness of the measures taken to counter this problem.  Everywhere we go, the skies are lit up at night and pets, children with special needs and elderly people are terrified.  People are afraid to go out.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said we have strong and robust laws in place to deal with this issue but, with the greatest of respect, we must not be using them because if they were strong, robust and effective, people would not have unlicensed fireworks.  Fireworks would not be going off in the Ballast Pit, beside where I live, or in Balbriggan, Swords, Lusk, Rush and right across my constituency if the law was being applied.  Part of the problem is that we do not have sufficient numbers of community garda&iacute;.  Due to reassignments, there are only 11 community garda&iacute; in my area in north Dublin.  That is the crux of this matter.<\/p>  <p>  We must be careful not to demonise young people because they have been left without services and with nothing to do.  Their schools were closed for a long time.  It is important that, instead of focusing on the trauma, damage and everything else, we focus on enforcing the law that is in place and resourcing the Garda to ensure it can do that.  With the greatest of respect to the Minister's colleague, if the House wants to send a strong message, Deputies will back the motion.  That will send a clear message that garda&iacute; must be resourced and our young people can be on the street and have the kind of fun they should have but not in a way that causes torture and torment to other people, including the elderly and other neighbours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200044#SS00400","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1600798200,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I will be sharing time with my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith.  The Labour Party will support Deputy Ward's motion.<\/p>  <p>  I have sympathy with what the previous speaker said about not demonising young people and, indeed, particular areas.  There is an area in my constituency which is having a particular issue at the moment.  The Minister knows that because I wrote to her, the Garda Commissioner and the local Garda station about it.  I do not want to name the park in question but I met residents of the area on Friday evening to discuss the issue.  Concerns about fireworks and antisocial behaviour are so serious that local residents, who are proud of their area, feel they cannot go into the park after lunchtime.  That is a particularly distressing message to get as a public representative.  The park has been well resourced and people feel proud of it but it has now come to a stage that residents feel they cannot go into it after lunchtime.  We are still in September and, as other speakers have said, this problem is only going to get worse.<\/p>  <p>  A Garda station has been promised for Dublin 13 and Dublin 17.  It was announced by the assistant Garda commissioner in May 2019.  I raised a Topical Issue matter about it only last week and was not encouraged by the response I got.  Every time we speak about antisocial behaviour or policing, I am going to raise this issue.<\/p>  <p>  A crime task force was also promised for the north side of Dublin during the general election campaign on the basis that, as is the case in the north inner city, we cannot police one's way out of crime.  We must speak to young people and talk about youth development, oral language, literacy, employment and health.  A wide range of issues must be considered when we speak about crime, disadvantage and antisocial behaviour.  The Government cannot police its way out of the problem.  I have made this case every time there has been a shooting, gun crime or murder.  I have said that we need a Mulvey-style commission or task force on the north side of Dublin and another in Drogheda.  That was agreed when the general election was called.  I want delivery of those task forces and I do not accept that we must wait for the Covid-19 emergency to pass before we can start to move on it.  We can see that antisocial behaviour, disconnection and disengagement are still issues.  The incidence of firework crime and antisocial behaviour has increased in September and is likely to increase further in October.<\/p>  <p>  I mean what I will say next with the greatest of respect to all speakers and am not in any way questioning the bona fides of anyone who has spoken on this motion from Government or Opposition parties.  It is really not good enough to come into this Chamber and speak of resources that Dublin City Council needs for its work in community development and estate management and to adequately secure parks when members of parties in government and opposition last night joined together to cut &euro;12 million of Dublin City Council funding which could have been used to tackle the very issues we are talking about.<\/p> <p>Politics can be difficult and means making hard choices.  With the greatest of respect to those who have spoken about resources, development and investing in communities, I ask them to speak to their councillors because yesterday at a Dublin City Council meeting, a number of parties in government and opposition voted to rob my city of &euro;12 million that could have gone a long way towards addressing the issues that we are talking about today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200044#SS00500","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600798800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>That is taxpayers' money, not yours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200045#TT00200","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1600798800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>While the Minister is here I will recap-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200045#TT00300","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1600798800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Let the Deputy speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200045#TT00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1600798800,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I did not interrupt Deputy Donnelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200045#TT00500","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1600798800,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Be truthful about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200045#TT00600","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1600798800,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I am being truthful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200045#TT00700","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1600798800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Through the Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200045#TT00800","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1600798800,"counter":391,"content":"<p>To recap the points I have made, I have written to the Minister regarding the particular park I have a concern about.

It is really good, and could and should have gone unamended.  I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, who made the opening statement, referred to the awareness campaign that has been launched.  A number of Deputies and Ministers in the Chamber are of my generation or are a few years younger or older than me.  The Minister of State and Deputies Gannon and Ward all grew up with awareness campaigns in the newspapers or on television.  Growing up, the message about the dangers of fireworks was hammered home for decades, including the fact they are illegal, etc.  To have this stated at the beginning and end of the opening remarks does not carry much weight in tackling this issue. <\/p>  <p>  I want to point to a reply to a parliamentary question received by my colleague, Deputy Sean Sherlock.  It refers to the amount that has been spent on these campaigns over the past four years.  It puts in context the lack of real effort and urgency that has been put into this issue over the past number of years.  In 2016, &euro;34,680 was spent while in 2017, &euro;36,676 was spent.  In 2018, the figure dropped to &euro;29,090.  In 2019, just &euro;17,000 was spent, less than half of what was spent in 2017.  The money was mainly spent on newspaper ads, and in the past couple of years the spend moved towards social media.   Every Deputy will have experience of taking out newspaper ads and knows the cost of a quarter, half or even full-page advertisement in a local newspaper in their town or constituency.  I am not sure how far &euro;36,000 would have gone in spreading awareness about the danger of illegal fireworks.  I am not convinced in any way, shape or form that there has been a shift in urgency, despite the very impassioned contribution by Deputy McAuliffe who I know feels strongly about this.  He is a Government backbencher and has done work locally on this.<\/p>  <p>  The work locally is not being reflected in any kind of increase in Government action or funding on this issue.  We have never had an August or September like this in north county Dublin in terms of fireworks, and the same has been reflected all over the city and county of Dublin.  Fireworks were an issue when I was growing up.  They were around, but they were not easy to get.  They were not everywhere.  They would always make an appearance very close to Hallowe'en. <\/p>  <p>  All of the work that local authorities are doing, including the fireworks displays, organised events and costume events, do a great job in terms of reducing the number of illegal bonfires and other activities leading up to Hallowe'en.  That is now all being undone.  Other Deputies referred to community Garda resources, which we have discussed in previous debates and will discuss again.  The proof will be in the pudding in five weeks in the budget.  We will see how much the Government really values increasing resources for garda&iacute; and getting our garda&iacute; where they need to be.<\/p>  <p>  This is about more than just garda&iacute;; it is about our customs.  It is about stopping the importation of fireworks at source.  Where are they coming from?  Are they coming from Europe or the UK?  We need more detail on where they are coming from so that we can stop them from coming into the country.  It cannot just be down to community garda&iacute; to deal with this issue.  What has been a problem for years has become a crisis.  I again thank Deputy Ward for bringing the motion forward.  I look forward to supporting it in the vote tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200045#TT01000","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1600798800,"counter":393,"content":"<p>The Social Democrats will support the motion and commend the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy for bringing it to the floor.  It is an eminently sensible motion and does not lend itself to a grandiose speech.<\/p>  <p>  Most of us who live and operate within the city are brought to our senses several dozen times a day with the reverberations of fireworks and all that that entails.  We can feel lucky we are not those with sensory issues who have been really impacted by them.  As has been said several times, while fireworks have always been a feature of life in cities, this year they have appeared earlier and they are louder and more prevalent.  That suggests there is an underlying problem.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to touch on some of the positive initiatives I know of that could be used to counter this but that have been eroded over the past couple of years.  I refer to policing in the north inner city and across Dublin as a whole.  Democracy is a forum and works best when State agencies, community leaders and the community that is impacted sit around a table to have discussions and look for solutions.  That has worked very well at times in Dublin, through the community policing initiatives and meetings that happened over the past couple of years.  They were running out of steam because things were getting more angry before now.  Covid is being used as an excuse not to have such meetings. <\/p>  <p>  Community policing meetings came to a complete stop during the Covid pandemic.  There has been no attempt to use innovation or hold Zoom meetings.  In the south inner city, for example, the latest community policing meeting was held in October 2019.  In my constituency, Dublin Central, the community policing forum was one of the first of its kind in Europe and had good intentions at the start.  I was critical of how it developed, but its original intent was fantastic in the sense that it had an office in the heart of a constituency, which had an often troubled relationship with the garda&iacute;.  It was designed so that community leaders could be an interface between a community that was distrustful of the garda&iacute; and the garda&iacute; themselves.  It worked very well for a time.  Last year, for no apparent reason, it was defunded.  It closed up shop and was not replaced.<\/p>  <p>  The meetings that were held in schools around the area where communities could get together with garda&iacute; and thrash out problems simply stopped.  The pandemic exists, but if community leaders were organising Zoom meetings in residential areas to get together with the community garda&iacute;, some of these issues would be dealt with.  It was never the case that young people attended the meetings, but community leaders, such as leaders of local boxing clubs, youth clubs and those who organised pool sessions and talked to young people, would attend.  <\/p>  <p>  People would be able to rely the fact that when some people had a bit of craic and let off a banger that affected children with autism or sensory issues or increased anxiety in a woman whose dogs were going berserk, they could be spoken to.  We no longer have such meetings.  We need to demonstrate a little leadership in getting those structures back because they have been lost.<\/p>  <p>  There has also been a breakdown in the relationship between the garda&iacute; in my constituency and, I am sure, the rest of Dublin.  We had community policing, which was about engaging with young people.  When that was at its best, garda&iacute; knew the names of Johnny or whomever and could have a conversation with him or her.  As we have eroded community policing to the detriment of those relationships, those relationships are gone.  Fireworks are now going off and nobody knows the names of the young people who are doing it.  That is a recent departure because there was a time where if young people were at risk of getting into trouble and were engaging in some sort of deviant behaviour, there was always somebody who knew their names and could call and have a chat with them.<\/p> <p>We all canvassed in the past six months and one of the things candidates heard from older people was that they no longer saw local garda&iacute; around.  That is great shame in the sense that it increases anxiety among the older population and makes them feel less safe.  <\/p> <p> There was a fantastic initiative, with an unfortunate acronym, in the north inner city called the small area policing initiative, which operated for a couple of years under a former Garda Commissioner.  It involved garda&iacute; knocking on every single door and having a chat with residents, most of whom were older people.  That initiative is gone.  A modern police force is in a sad state when it cannot engage constructively with our constituents in a manner that we know works and has positive outcomes. <\/p> <p> With regard to those who let off bangers, I always ask who is benefiting from this noise and the infiltration of fireworks into our communities.  I promise that for every banger going off or rocket taking off, somebody is making a profit.  I do not believe there has been any moralising in the Chamber tonight.  I would not suggest there has been and previous speakers have been considerate in not doing that.  However, I have heard moralising in some of the conversations about this issue in the radio.  What we are not hearing about are the gangs that are clearly benefiting and making exorbitant amounts of money by smuggling in these fireworks.  I know Operation Tombola is taking place in communities and on the streets but is it effective and is it able to take the head off the snake?  I am not convinced that is the case.  <\/p> <p> On an issue that has been raised several times in this debate, in the absence of the structures that have been put in place for Hallowe'en in communities across Dublin in recent years, Hallowe&rsquo;en night this year will be like no other before it.  I am talking about people who organised parades and fancy dress and worked with kids in youth clubs for months in advance of Hallowe'en and helped them make up their costumes and build little warehouses that could be turned into fun factories.  If all of that stops, we will go back to the scenes we witnessed four or five years ago when communities were effectively under siege and there were running battles on the streets.  That was always a genuine fear on Hallowe&rsquo;en night but, through extraordinary community leadership, we were able to combat it.  That is under threat this year.  Since July, we have seen a build-up, which will reach a crescendo if we do not take ownership of the problem now.  That must start in the Department and work its way down through all Deputies.   It must allow us to engage with the local authorities which are the funding mechanism for these initiatives.  We must try to ensure we can be positive, rather than waking up at the start of November realising that we have missed an opportunity and the community has suffered as a consequence.  We still have time to solve this and I hope we can act up that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200045#TT01100","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600799400,"counter":395,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Theachta Gannon.

I will say what many people are saying to me tonight and it is not based on prejudice.  It is very obvious that if this was happening in Foxrock or Dublin 4, it would have been sorted out by now.  That it is happening predominantly in working class communities speaks volumes.  It speaks of the sort of containment policy inside working class areas that dominates every aspect of this Government's, and previous Governments&rsquo;, attitude to services that are needed at local level.  The Minister is shaking her head but she has to answer many questions as to why the Garda does not respond to calls by members of the community, garda&iacute; are never seen on the streets and garda&iacute; do not respond despite repeated calls to Garda stations, both physically and by telephone.  Communities need answers to those questions. <\/p>  <p>  I do not fully accept the argument made by Sinn F&eacute;in that this is all about community garda&iacute;.  The motion states that the number of garda&iacute; assigned to the Dublin metropolitan region in August 2020 was 4,059, which remains below the 2010 figure of 4,160.  That is a difference of just 101.  If one balances that against the argument I will make about resources that do not go to young people and which have not been restored to our communities, we can focus on where this is happening.  We have a policy of containment in working class areas, which are being flooded with fireworks that were not bought and used for celebrations during the Covid-19 period.  Instead, now that the market insists that it must get rid of these fireworks, they are being dumped in working class areas.  There seems to be no attempt to address this problem.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the Minister will explain Operation Tombola, which we keep hearing about, in greater detail.  The Minister of State said it is all about combating the importation and sale of fireworks.  We do not see the importation and sale of fireworks being combated.  They are being sold everywhere.  <\/p>  <p>  Last night, I understand an 18-year-old man from Ballyfermot had a finger blown off.  The kids who are letting off fireworks are frequently much younger, with many of them ten, 12 or 14 years of age.  The stuff is being sold to them for a song.  Despite that, somebody must be making money because they are not doing this for the good of their health.  Clearly, there is an abundance of explosives on the market.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda make political decisions as to where they allocate resources.  The issue is not one of tabling a motion stating the Garda should be recruiting an extra 800 garda&iacute; per year because we do not have enough of them.  Political decisions are being made.  This motion is imbalanced.  Despite Deputies saying they were not having a go at young people, the motion read likes it is having a go at young people.  I will use this opportunity to address that issue.  I have tried at the Covid-19 committee to have special sessions on how Covid-19 has impacted on our youth.  I also submitted a Topical Issue matter on this issue three times last week and each time I was refused, as were other Deputies.  It is about time we had a full and frank conversation about what is going on with young people in working class areas.  <\/p>  <p>  A study by Am&aacute;rach, a reputable research company, under the title, Generation Pandemic, surveyed youth workers in 700 youth groups, after-school and sports clubs.  It found that half of all youth workers believe the pandemic and lockdown will have a massive impact on the mental health of our young people.  Some 47% of respondents indicated that children are behind in their studies and 21% of children, they believe, will not return to normal schooling.  <\/p>  <p>  Another survey carried out by the National Youth Council of Ireland found that 53% of children already have mental health issues, 35% are falling behind in school, 39% experience isolation, and one in five is living with family conflict.  We then have overcrowding in housing, with young boys and girls growing up sharing the same bedroom, not only with their sisters but sometimes with their aunts or mothers.  We have young children coach-surfing and homelessness among young people is growing, not to mention the youth unemployment rate, which now stands at 45.4%.  The youth are particularly impacted by drastic and draconian measures, including the slashing of their unemployment payment which has never been restored.  <\/p>  <p>  One has inequality in the way the social services deal with young people, and inequality in housing and education.  We then have the cuts to the youth services.  Funding was slashed by a third in 2010 by the then Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.  That cut has never been fully restored.  While some of it was restored, the catch is that this was done through a mechanism called value for money, which is basically a neoliberal economic measurement that could have a serious detrimental impact on youth services, and indeed all community and addiction services.  However, I am talking about the youth tonight.  This is about measuring everything through a neoliberal framework and not on the real actions and outcomes for young people.  There will be serious problems in trying to deliver these outcomes, particularly when one combines that with generation pandemic and the impact the pandemic is having on them.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will receive a submission from the National Youth Council of Ireland.  It seeks serious engagement through more youth workers in our communities.  We really need them.<\/p> <p>They cannot take young people inside.  Discos, dancing clubs, boxing clubs, youth clubs that would be open as drop-in centres and caf&eacute;s are all shut because of the Covid-19 restrictions.  They do not have enough resources to do outreach with the young people in a meaningful way and yet we seem to be loading the blame on them.  I am not saying they are angels by no manner or means.  I know many of them who live around me but the solution is not to impose more garda&iacute; on society; the solution is that the Garda and the Minister need to make decisions that do not have that class bias of containment in working class areas.  Fundamentally, the most important action to take right now is to deploy garda&iacute; to stop the importation and sale of these fireworks.  If there was not the supply, there would not be the use.  That is a very obvious statement to make.<\/p> <p> The other issue I want to talk about is the huge amount of voluntarism in the youth services and only for that voluntarism and those magnificent workers who organise football and other activities with the children, there would be nothing available.  It is a serious deficit that needs time in this House to be examined, combined with the rise in youth unemployment levels and the overcrowding and lack of housing I mentioned earlier.<\/p> <p> When I moved to Ballyfermot in the early 1990s, there was a very serious riot in a place called Gallanstown.  At that time, I do not believe Gallanstown did not have a youth centre, a school or a community centre.  Due to sensible intervention following the riot, we now have those facilities.  Mind you, the area still only has one shop.  It does not have a post office, caf&eacute; or pharmacy.  There are no community facilities in that area.  The containment issue is a real one and unless policy decisions are made to develop those on an equal level as with other areas, it will continue to happen.  The main point I want to make is that in those days when the riots happened Gallanstown was flooded with garda&iacute;.  I never saw as many garda&iacute; in my life.  There were garda&iacute;, Saracens and all sorts of modern equipment but that did not solve the problem.  Garda&iacute; in and of their own are not the solution.  Sinn F&eacute;in's demand to increase the number of garda&iacute; by 800 a year will not be the solution.  The political decisions that are made by the Minister's office in how it deploys garda&iacute; has to be seriously questioned, and the Garda have a lot to answer for.<\/p> <p> In conversation with a recently-appointed superintendent in my area he commented that the solution to this problem is investment in youth services.  Garda&iacute; going in and arresting ten, 12 and 14 year old children, throwing them in a cell and then bringing them home does not get rid of it.  Let us deal with the supply of these explosives and go after the bowsies who are flooding the streets with them.  Let us interject in the communities where they need the resources and recognise that the severe austerity cuts have impacted disproportionately on working class areas and continue to do so.  The policies must change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200046#UU00300","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600800000,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I am sharing my time with Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, although he is not here yet.<\/p>  <p>  Fireworks are often at the centre of antisocial activity around Hallowe'en but what is shocking is the fact that in Ireland today more than 500,000 people have their lives disrupted by antisocial behaviour throughout the year.  A report published recently by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, showed that one in eight adults in Ireland said their lives had been affected by such activity at some stage last year.  If we apply that to the adult population as a whole, it means that the lives of more than 400,000 people in our country aged 18 and over are being adversely affected by antisocial behaviour and for almost 70,000 of them it has made their lives a misery being affected to a greater extent, according to the CSO report.  It found that the greatest impact was on people in their 30s and 40s.  If we add their children to that whose lives are also being upset, the numbers of those affected would be more than 500,000.  It is happening in every county in Ireland, which means that in my home county of Galway, it could be having an impact on 30,000 people.<\/p>  <p>  antisocial behaviour is a growing problem in many areas where a small majority of people, and I am not just talking about teenagers, make life hell for the rest of the community.  It can range from rows between neighbours and constant noise to vandalism, intimidation, drug dealing and everything in between that has a detrimental effect on other people living nearby.  It is a problem that is enormously difficult to tackle, in part due to the fact that a lot of antisocial behaviour goes unreported because people are afraid of reprisals.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the greatest weakness in our current laws, our local councils and garda&iacute; need more power to act quickly and effectively to stamp out antisocial behaviour.  Council officials can find their hands tied.  Current legislation is not an effective deterrent.  It can take years to bring misbehaving tenants, for instance, to court as there are so many hoops to be jumped through.  <\/p>  <p>  Bad behaviour is not confined to local authority estates.  Landlords also need to be given greater scope under the law to act against tenants in private rented property who are engaging in antisocial activities.  There are laws in this area but they tend to be clunky and difficult to apply in an effective way.  <\/p>  <p>  There is a major role to be played by the community garda&iacute; if we had enough of them walking the beat in the areas worst affected.  Ten years ago, we had almost 1,200 community garda&iacute; in Ireland.  Today, that number is down to 710.  Back then, in the county of Galway we had 22, most of whom were based in the city, but that number is down to just 13 today.<\/p>  <p>  A community garda meeting people in their own neighbourhood day in, day out will have a great feel for what is going on in their area and be in a position to take steps when they see problems developing.  A garda who is a familiar face in an area can help nip small-level crime in the bud before it becomes something more serious and a youngster's bit of devilment turns to crime.  They can talk directly to the young people and their parents and, for instance, try to stop easily-influenced children being led astray by criminals.  It is far more effective in many instances than bringing young offenders through the courts process where they barely get a slap on the wrist and learn little of benefit from the experience.<\/p>  <p>  To return to the main subject of this motion, the message is not getting through to people that fireworks, while exciting and entertaining, are dangerous explosives that should never be in the hands of anyone other than trained and licensed professionals.  Every year around Hallowe'en, and long before that in many cases, we read reports from across the country about young people losing fingers, the sight in an eye or suffering other serious and life-changing injuries as a result of handling fireworks.  Not only is that message about the danger not getting through to them, it is also not being taken seriously by their parents in many cases.  I refer to those adults who either know their children are playing with fireworks and do nothing about it or who set a bad example themselves by acquiring illegal and dangerous fireworks for use as a centre point of a Hallowe'en house party.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned earlier, fireworks can also be at the centre of antisocial activities that leave people in fear around Hallowe'en.  If we can succeed in removing them from the festivities, it might also help stop the spread of antisocial behaviour throughout the rest of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200047#VV00200","speaker":"1576"},{"type":"speech","time":1600800000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak to this very important issue.  I heard previous speakers talk about Dublin but antisocial behaviour and fireworks are not confined to the city.  Deputy Grealish mentioned Galway.  In my constituency of Galway East we have antisocial behaviour through different strands.  We have it on local authority estates where the local authorities are not capable or do not have the resources to manage the estates properly.  We have it on private estates that have rental accommodation where a few people make life very difficult for a large number of people.<\/p>  <p>  antisocial behaviour and all that goes with it, and the fireworks which are part of all of that, can destroy communities and housing estates, with very few involved in it.  It can also downgrade the value of the homes of people who borrowed money to take out a mortgage only to find they may have the neighbours from hell living beside them.  It can also be soul-destroying for the residents on those estates who are trying to keep them in a well-kept manner.<\/p> <p>It goes back to one thing in my book: education.  It is a question of educating people on what is right and wrong and of their parents taking their responsibility seriously.  Unfortunately, not all families get this education.  There is a major downgrading of standards when people get away with antisocial behaviour.  Something than starts off in a very trivial way can snowball very fast, resulting in a major problem.  How do we deal with it?  To answer this, we should consider our approach to Covid.  When the garda&iacute; are out trying to enforce regulations, they first engage with people and explain to them what is right and what they have done wrong.  They explain to them how they can move forward and do things right.  They provide enforcement if necessary.  From my experience, in the time between something happening and the taking of action, many barriers are put in the place of garda&iacute;, local authorities and community groups.  The law seems to be stacked in favour of the perpetrators of crimes.  The hands of the local authorities are, therefore, tied, as are the hands of the Garda.  Until people ask the difference between right and wrong, we will not deal with this.  It comes back to education.  We need to change people's attitudes.  The one way of doing so is to ensure that those who do something wrong know they will be punished.  If those who are continually brought to court for antisocial behaviour or importing and using dangerous fireworks come out without any consequence for their lives, we must ask how we can improve the attitude.  One way we can do so is by increasing the resources of the garda&iacute;.  We should have more community garda&iacute; on the ground and walking the streets.  We must take preventative measures rather than try to enforce.<\/p> <p> I do not believe there is anyone in this House who would condone antisocial behaviour.  In our constituencies, we all have had experiences of what can happen when something goes wrong.  The last thing we want is to come back here to talk again about somebody who got seriously injured by fireworks or who got seriously injured because of antisocial behaviour.  We need to ensure that those who engage in antisocial behaviour realise they will be subject to the rigour of the law and that they think before they do something.<\/p> <p> Deputy Grealish mentioned the issue of people living in fear, afraid to report activity to the Garda or social housing authority.  We must give these people courage and backup.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200047#VV00300","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600800600,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I, too, support this motion.

We should do this but I am aware there are major problems with antisocial behaviour.  Other Deputies have referred to it.  The only answer is community policing.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  Community policing, Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch are the answer.  People have the confidence to talk to garda&iacute; who stand in their kitchens when they are rung.  No police force in the world can police without the support of the public.<\/p>  <p>  I salute Superintendent Denis Whelan, Sergeant Ray Moloney, Garda Jenny Gough and others in Cahir Garda station.  I salute those in Clonmel, under Superintendent William Leahy.  I salute Sergeant Kieran O'Regan, Garda Claire Murphy and others all over County Tipperary.  They are in community policing sections and they do outstanding work.  They are on call nearly all the time.  Many people, including politicians, can contact them by mobile phone.  We try to work with the communities and bring them along.  Those I have mentioned do tremendous work.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has taught us one thing, that is, that in the middle of all the drama, grief and horror, community police have come into their own.  They may be found in people's kitchens.  They bring in firing for them and hang out clothes for people.  They have been bringing people messages from the shops.  They have proven themselves.  That is what real policing is all about.  It is about earning the trust and confidence of the people, young and old.<\/p>  <p>  Not only are fireworks going off but they are doing damage to guide dogs and all other dogs, as sheep farmers will confirm.  Sheepdogs are affected.  Everyone is frightened of fireworks.  Reference was made to rockets and to the sale of many types of illegal products.  I wonder where they are coming from and what kind of illicit and illegal trade is taking place.  Who is importing the products?  They are plentiful and easily available.  The county councils do their business well with the environmental officers to try to have preventive measures in place for Hallowe'en and organised events.  This is happening in Thurles, where great work has been done.  I salute a former councillor there whose name eludes me.  Great work is done in the communities.<\/p>  <p>  There are also issues with shooting ranges, the lamping of animals and guns being fired.  The guns might be legally held, and some might be illegal.

We must go back to the root of problems as it is mainly our youth who involve themselves in these mindless acts.  Not all youth are involved in disruptive behaviour, however.  This can be seen from the Garda youth awards in west Cork.  Year after year, we see great young people win awards for their excellent work in their community, thanks to the encouragement given to them by great community garda&iacute; such as Damian White and Brigid Hartnett.  All crime can be nipped in the bud by the deployment of more community garda&iacute;.<\/p>  <p>  Garda stations in every part of Ireland need to be manned, not closed, as was done by previous Governments.  Previous Governments saw fit to shut the doors of so many stations in west Cork.  This was a terribly bad decision.  I commend the people of Ballinspittle who fought the decision.  Their station was closed but they won the battle and it was reopened.  Many more should have been in the same situation.  The local garda&iacute; saw dangers well in advance and talked to young people and their families.  In 99% of cases, potential problems were nipped in the bud and sorted.  The 1% who fell through the cracks in our community were blessed to have youth centres in west Cork, such as Cara Lodge, which caters for boys who have gone wrong in their lives and need help.  I have spoken to users of the lodge, which is located in Ahiohill, Clonakilty.  The assistance given to the youth and their families at such a crucial time represented a massive turning point in their lives.  Astonishingly, the HSE has now seen fit in the past few weeks to stop funding this vital service.  The centre faces closure, with the loss a vital service and 27 jobs.  I am told the reason for the closure of the excellent service, which is the only one of its kind in west Cork, is that the HSE wants to change to a new model of care.  This may be a good idea but surely the new model of care can be rolled out in Ahiohill in west Cork in the same way that it would be in any other county.  I have asked the Minister of State at the Department of Health to intervene.  I have asked the Taoiseach, who opened the centre a number of years ago, to intervene, and now I ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to save it for the young people of west Cork who desperately need it and for the truly great staff, who have provided a top-quality service for so many years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200048#WW00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1600800600,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I, too, support this important motion.

How do we protect our families, pets and farm animals?  An organised effort is needed around Hallowe'en events.  Perhaps a licence should be applied for.

The other thing that solves all problems is garda&iacute; having local information and knowing where they are going, knowing families and knowing their surroundings.  How does one prevent crimes and children getting involved in the wrong activities?  It is not always the person who buys the fireworks who gets injured.  It is often the person who is easily led.  How can we help these people?  We can help them by providing community garda&iacute; and by policing.  The Garda has made a serious effort in recent years to get involved in communities.

I also support the call by the National Youth Council of Ireland for more investment in youth services.  That call is set out in the amendment tabled by Solidarity-People Before Profit.  This issue is not only one for now but is a general issue about youth services and how they are funded and supported.<\/p>  <p>  I concur with the point made by many Deputies on the impact of illegal fireworks in the community.  Depending on who is using them, these fireworks are used to target houses, people, dogs and other animals.  It seems they are used differently depending on who gets their hands on them.  The widespread use of fireworks has created a general belief in communities that people are able to get and use them with impunity.<\/p>  <p>  I have had reports about an incident in a local park at the beginning of September where fireworks were used against families and children in a playground.  The families were forced to flee.  I am regularly contacted on social media by people who have been targeted with bangers while walking their dogs in the park.  Some of them believe these are attempts to disorientate the dogs and then entrap them if they run off.  We have animals, elderly people and people with sensory issues who are stressed in their homes.  That this is happening creates a general disquiet in the community.  That is the mood in communities and there is a view that this not being dealt with.  This is happening all over Dublin.  I have seen it in St. Anne's Park, on the north side and south side, in the Liberties up to Rialto and Ballyfermot and into Drimnagh and Crumlin.  It is taking place all over my constituency where there is not one area that has not been impacted.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that Operation Tombola, which involves the local authorities and takes place before Hallowe'en every year, was brought forward to 4 September.  That was a positive development but many people who contacted me are not positive that the Garda response team is dealing with the situation because it continues night after night.  It has been going on every night since the second last week in August.  It is happening on an industrial scale.  The number of fireworks being set off in communities is quite staggering.  It has been said that many fireworks are being sold across the Border in Northern Ireland because there is an abundance of them left over from 12 July.  I support the call to establish a joint task force between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, under Operation Tombola to combat the distribution and sale of illegal fireworks and bangers if they are coming across the Border.  That is specifically mentioned in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  I was a bit concerned to read in the Minister of State, Deputy Brown's, contribution that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, had been informed by the Garda Commissioner that this specific issue would be discussed at the strategic level at a forthcoming meeting of the cross-Border joint agency task force and strategic oversight group in the coming days.  I would have expected this matter to be discussed a month ago rather than in the coming days because it has been going on for so long.  I am disappointed it is only happening now.  <\/p>  <p>  The distribution and sale of fireworks must be tackled.  That is how one stops it.  It must be interrupted and stopped and intelligence must be gathered on where fireworks are being stored.  I contacted our superintendent in Kevin Street Garda station who said there had been arrests and follow-up.  Every night, however, we still hear fireworks and bangers going off at the same level.<\/p>  <p>  I will make a particular point on the National Youth Council of Ireland and its pre-budget submission.  It makes the point there is youth employment of over 37.8% arising from the pandemic.  It points out that the numbers of young people aged between ten and 24 in the State continues to grow so demand for youth services grows.  The youth population is expected to grow by 4.6% by 2025 and reach more than 1 million.  That figure is taken from the census.  The submission states that while there have been limited increases an investment in recent years, funding for youth work in 2020 is 15% below what it was in 2008.  That is a terrible indictment of the austerity cuts over that period.  Funding amounts to just &euro;1.23 per young person between the ages of ten and 24.  The submission further states that only 2% or &euro;12 million of the additional &euro;574 million allocated to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs between 2014 and 2020 has been provided for youth work.<\/p> <p>It is calling for an additional &euro;4.7 million to be provided for youth services in the budget for 2021.<\/p> <p> The number of parents of young people who have contacted us over the past six months has been phenomenal.  These families are living in overcrowded conditions and the Covid restrictions, which tie them to their homes, have made living at home unbearable.  They are literally begging to get a house from the housing list.  There is nothing we can do because houses are not being built in the numbers that are needed.  All these economic issues are coming to bear.<\/p> <p> The Government must invest in youth services and youth workers to support young people.  The Government must also invest in more community policing.  This is one of the areas of policing that has worked very well.  It is outrageous that only 710 garda&iacute; are involved in community policing across the State now as compared with 1,180 in 2010 and in the Dublin metropolitan region the number of community police has decreased by 45% from 508 in 2010 to 278 now.  We are now seeing the consequences of not having that community policing working with the community and community groups, and not having the task forces allowing people to know what is happening locally in the area.  Community policing was probably the most successful part of the work of the Garda.<\/p> <p> In Dublin South-Central, as has been mentioned already, we had 99 community garda&iacute; ten years ago and we are down to 28.  We have a number of issues in the area with open drug dealing along the canal, etc.  When we only have 28 community police in the whole Dublin South-Central area, it does not work and we need those resources in the area.<\/p> <p> The Government's amendment states that under Operation Tombola, the Garda has put in place local operational plans to tackle the sale of fireworks, including through high-visibility policing and utilising the divisional public order units as appropriate.  The Minister is clearly not living in the community because that is not happening.  I live in Inchicore and I am not aware of visibility of police in the area.  I have not seen an increase over the last month.  It is not happening because the resources are not there; they are stretched on the ground.  That needs to be looked at.  The Sinn F&eacute;in motion makes the point that we need people moved from behind desks to being out in the community.  We need more community policing.  I support the motion, particularly the emphasis on what is needed in our youth services and the youth facilities in the communities which have been drastically reduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200049#XX00300","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600801800,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies who spoke for their contributions this evening.  Although I cannot support the Sinn F&eacute;in motion, I think we agree on several important issues.  Most of us agree that this is not just an issue that impacts on a certain area in Dublin; this is an issue that affects communities in towns and villages and in our rural communities.  I can attest to that as somebody who represents a constituency that is both urban and rural.  We can also agree that fireworks are much more dangerous than people seem to realise.  In particular our younger people do not seem to realise the significant threat they can cause.  Those can even be life-altering threats.  This evening, Deputies have outlined some such incidents that have happened in the last 24 hours.<\/p>  <p>  We all agree that the illegal use of fireworks and, in particular, the associated antisocial behaviour that accompanies it is causing considerable stress and anxiety across our communities much earlier than usual for some reason.  This is something that is happening not just in Ireland.  There is an increase across Europe and we have seen this type of behaviour much earlier this year.  That is why today, with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Dublin Fire Brigade, Ann Losty who is a member of the community in Dublin 15 and in association with the youth diversion programme, we launched the Government's annual fireworks awareness campaign.  This was done a month early, acknowledging that this is an issue we need to deal with now.<\/p>  <p>  Through that campaign, we are asking people, who are thinking of buying, handling or using fireworks, not to add to the significant problems already faced by our emergency services and front-line workers, who are battling against Covid-19.  As many Deputies have outlined this evening, we are also asking people to think of those in their community, including people who have rallied around together in recent months and elderly members of the community who are already anxious, and to think of the impact that can have on them and their pets.<\/p>  <p>  Intensive efforts to spread our message will continue in the coming weeks coming up to Hallowe'en to encourage people to stay safe.  Many people have mentioned An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this evening and in particular Operation Tombola which was brought forward by a month, acknowledging that work needs to be done earlier this year.  It very much focuses on the incremental deployment of resources.  This includes public order units to try to deal with issues locally, engaging with local councils and communities.  Some Deputies mentioned lack of engagement with younger people.  There has been a challenge this year.  As the Garda acknowledged this morning, garda&iacute; cannot go into schools and talk face-to-face to young people as they would normally like to.  From next Monday, garda&iacute; will engage through a Zoom programme.  We all acknowledge that is not the same but they are trying to engage where possible with our younger people in schools to highlight the damage this can cause and encourage them to move away from engaging in any such activity.<\/p>  <p>  Special attention will be paid, in particular, to the Dublin metropolitan region, acknowledging that is a particular issue in this area.  I am informed that throughout that region An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Dublin Fire Brigade and the crime prevention officers will work to raise awareness. <\/p>  <p>  I share the view held by everybody in this House that the use of illegal fireworks, despite the extremely strict policy on the matter, continues to be a problem in certain areas.  However, we are committed to ensuring our towns, villages and communities are safe places to live.  The well-being of all our communities is a priority for the Government.  An antisocial behaviour committee to be chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, is being established.  A draft youth justice strategy was recently put out for consultation.  Submissions have been received from across the country and we will take them into account before bringing the strategy to Government by the end of the year.  A considerable amount of work is going on in my Department and obviously the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy O'Gorman, will do his own work in that area.<\/p>  <p>  We are committed to combating the use of unlicensed fireworks.  The legislation governing their use is particularly strict with a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;10,000 or imprisonment of up to five years if people are caught.  I engaged with the Garda Commissioner on this issue this week and was advised that a large number of seizures have been made already this year.  I assume that number will continue to increase.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda has strong engagement with the PSNI.  Their co-operation goes across many areas.  People have asked how we can prevent the sale of fireworks and from where young people are getting them in the first place.  There are many measures, including a cross-Border policing strategy, an annual cross-Border seminar on organised crime and the joint agency task force, which was mentioned by one of the Deputies.  It does not meet monthly but will be meeting in coming days when this issue will be very much on the agenda.  Parallel investigations happen and joint investigation teams operate continually throughout the year.  There is significant engagement by garda&iacute; with their counterparts in the North to try to address this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Several Deputies raised broader policing issues and have suggested that the resources are not there.  I acknowledge the fantastic work done by our garda&iacute; in engaging with our communities in recent weeks and months through the Covid pandemic.  We are being held up as an example and many countries are looking to us because of how our garda&iacute; have engaged on the ground with communities.<\/p>  <p>  I am not sure where the figures in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion came from.  In addition to the 4,059 garda&iacute; assigned to the Dublin metropolitan region at the end of August 2020, a total of 429 Garda civilian staff were also assigned to this region.  This is an increase of 184 on the figure in 2010.  There has been an increase in every county across the board of front-line garda&iacute; working in our communities and the civilian staff supporting them in the background.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200050#YY00200","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1600801800,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for working with the Garda to commence Operation Tombola one month earlier this year, which I welcome.<\/p> <p>This move will have a positive impact in places like Clondalkin, Lucan and Palmerstown in my constituency.

It is not news that hospital admissions increase year after year at Hallowe'en.  Both children and adults present with injuries, some minor but the vast majority presenting with severe burns.  The consequences of using fireworks and starting bonfires in unsupervised open public spaces are beyond dangerous, irresponsible and hazardous.  Now is not the time to be flooding emergency departments with patients with fireworks injuries.  It is not a time to add to the problem.  It is time to recognise and respect the people on the front line and to protect capacity in our health service.<\/p> <p> A single spark from a bonfire on an item of clothing can set it alight in a matter of seconds, potentially causing lifelong and life-changing injuries.  In many cases, bangers and fireworks have blown up in people's faces.  Just this evening, there were reports of a teenager in Palmerstown who suffered injuries to his fingers when a firework exploded in his hands.  Fireworks are being set off in many areas weeks and sometimes even months before Hallowe'en, terrorising neighbourhoods.

There is a lot of agreement on its provisions across the House but not total agreement, which is why I will be supporting the Government amendment.  We can all agree that the scourge of fireworks has come earlier and to a greater extent this year than ever before.  This is clearly linked to the cancellation of many festivals, bonfires, parades and other celebrations throughout the island.  I take issue with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, who is no longer in the Chamber, for trying to make this into a class issue.

I would ask them how those young people spent the &euro;10 they were given.  What are their children doing in the local field?

It is timely and important, particularly for the people living in the areas most affected.  It is fair to say that these issues present in different ways in different places, some at the more extreme end.  The solution is the same in all cases and it is clearly outlined in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  It is about ensuring there are sufficient Garda numbers for prevention and deterrence and adequate community resources, both physical and human.<\/p>  <p>  I am a Deputy for Meath East, as is the Minister.  Our county has the lowest number of garda&iacute; per head of population in the State.  One of our new towns, Ratoath, is the largest town in Ireland without a Garda station.  We have the youngest small towns in the State in Stamullen, Enfield and Longwood and the youngest large towns in Navan and Ashbourne, according to census data.  These towns have it in common that they have grown rapidly in the past two decades and have been victims of the Celtic tiger.  It has been all about houses and more houses.  County Meath has the lowest number of playgrounds, public green spaces, community centres and youth facilities.  In the case of the latter, if one does not play GAA or soccer, they are non-existent.  There are residents in one particular area in Ashbourne who have spent years trying to protect the last remaining patch of green space for their children to play.  They have presented their case to Meath County Council and An Bord Plean&aacute;la time and again only to have the rug pulled from under them in the past week.  In trying to provide a decent environment for their families to live, they are doing the State's work.  Instead of being supported, they are being impeded at every hand's turn.<\/p>  <p>  In ten years' time, when the same issues are being debated again in this House, the Deputies representing County Meath will, if they are honest, be saying that things have got worse.  We will all know why that is the case.  I am contacted on a regular basis by residents in Kells, Stamullen, Ashbourne and Ratoath, among other places, about nuisance and antisocial behaviour.  The Minister knows well that such activity is regular and to an extent that warrants address.  Some people are being terrorised in their own homes.  We see the evidence of it on every community Facebook page and it must be stopped.  I urge the Minister and all other Deputies to support the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  The Minister must increase the Garda presence for prevention and deterrence and increase community infrastructure, both physical and human.  That is what is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200051#ZZ00300","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1600802400,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies from all sides of the House for their contributions to the debate on this motion.  It has been a worthwhile discussion and there is a general consensus that there is a problem which must be addressed.  I am disappointed but not surprised that the Government does not propose to support the motion.<\/p><p>I have gone out and met people in my constituency who are experiencing these problems.  The people I spoke to gave me a different take from what my constituency colleague, Deputy Higgins, has presented.  I will take the opportunity to read out extracts from some of their testimonies, as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAt night the bangers sounds like we live in a war-torn country...  My curtains were burnt by fireworks because I sleep with the window open...  It was 3 o'clock the other day when they started.  I might have to close my shop earlier...  I have a little son who is on the autism spectrum.  Hearing is one of the things for him that is very heightened.  He has an anxiety disorder as well, so things around noise and flashes and bangs really cause him anxiety.  This causes sensory overload in my child.  I have to hold him at night-time on my sofa while the bangs and noises outside are going on, and this is on a nightly basis...  My dog has been frightened since July.  I can't get him to walk in the park because he is that fearful...  This is going on since the end of July and it is not even Hallowe'en yet.  It is only going to get worse...  I can't let my young fella play in our local playground...  This is beyond crazy.  Where are the guards? <\/blockquote>  <p>These are just some of the things said by the many people who have got in touch with me.<\/p><p>I would hate anybody to think I am being overcritical of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this matter.  That is not the case whatsoever.  Community garda&iacute; are not the heavy hand of the law.  They are there to build relationships within communities.  The garda&iacute; know the community and people in the community know the garda&iacute;.  I have seen at first hand how well this is working in Ronanstown, Lucan, Clondalkin and Rathcoole.  I commend the community garda&iacute; in that station on doing the best they can, but they seem to be doing it with one hand tied behind their backs because of the lack of resources.  The Minister mentioned figures.  The figures I have in front in me are those I got in response to parliamentary questions I submitted to her Department.  They show that since 2010, community garda numbers have dropped dramatically, with a 45% decrease in Dublin.  Neither the Minister nor the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, mentioned the decision by the Garda Commissioner to prevent community garda&iacute; from working after 7 p.m.  It means that when all this activity is going on at night-time, there are no community garda&iacute; around.  This leaves our communities abandoned and the people who live there vulnerable and at the mercy of crime and antisocial behaviour.  This decision must be reversed immediately and people must see garda&iacute; back on the streets in their communities.<\/p><p>There was something the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, said which shows how out of touch the Government is with what is happening in communities.  We have no community garda&iacute; on patrol after 7 p.m., as I outlined.  The Minister of State said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWhat we cannot agree with is the suggestion that the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not proactively addressing these issues.  It is not correct to infer that the increased use of fireworks is as a result of lacking resources or action on the part of Garda authorities... <\/blockquote>  <p>It is hard for the Garda authorities to act at night-time when there are no or very few community garda&iacute; around.  I invite the Minister to walk around Clondalkin, Lucan, Rathcoole, Saggart, Palmerstown, Brittas or anywhere else in my neighbourhood at night-time to see the reality of what is happening there.<\/p> <p> I have changed what I was about to say.  I will read out the motion and the Minister should feel free to stop me at any time if she disagrees with what we are putting forward.  I would welcome that.  We are calling on the Government to ensure that the frequency of Garda patrols in communities most affected by these actions is immediately increased and to commit to restoring the number of garda&iacute; to 2010 levels by the end of 2021.  We are calling on the Government to increase the recruitment of Garda civilian staff to help facilitate an increased Garda presence in our communities, which the Minister herself mentioned.  We are also asking the Government to commit to a minimum recruitment of 800 garda&iacute; per annum with priority deployment in the area of community safety.  We are calling on the Government to immediately establish a joint task force between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI under Operation Tombola to proactively work to combat the distribution, sale and use of illegal fireworks, which the Minister also mentioned.  We are also looking for the establishment of a confidential and dedicated telephone line to allow members of the public to report instances of the misuse of fireworks.  We call on the Government to immediately roll out a public and school awareness campaign incorporating Dublin Fire Brigade and the Garda, including engagements with schools, communities and youth organisations.  We are also asking the Government to commit to providing a report on Operation Tombola to the Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of the year, identifying areas for improvement in resourcing and making recommendations in that respect.<\/p> <p> That is what our motion is calling for.  I would like to know what in that text the Minister does not agree with.  She can revert to me if she wants to.  As I said, this is a common-sense motion.  The communities that I, the Minister and all Members of the House represent want to see if Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party will take the common-sense approach and support this motion in its entirety without amending it or watering it down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200051#ZZ00400","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600803000,"counter":416,"content":"<p>To be fair to the Minister, there is no provision for her to speak again.

Some people came to believe that certain Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers, along with a cabal of Irish Army officers, attempted to import arms for the IRA through Dublin Airport.  A trial involving four defendants opened exactly 50 years ago today.  All were acquitted.  An account of these events, which was provided a decade later by the late Peter Berry, then Secretary General of the Department of Justice, made it clear that the Special Branch had a source inside the IRA who had access to the deliberations of the IRA's army council.  Colonel Michael Hefferon, the director of military intelligence in G2 in 1970, knew the Special Branch had two paramilitary sources, one in the IRA and the other in Saor &Eacute;ire.<\/p><p>In his 2016 memoirs, the Minister for Justice in 1970, Des O'Malley, revealed that the Special Branch had received a tip-off about the incoming arms flight at Dublin Airport that foreshadowed the arms crisis.  The informer has now been identified as Se&aacute;n Mac St&iacute;of&aacute;in, a member of the IRA army council, in a new book to be published tomorrow, <i>Deception and Lies The Hidden History of the Arms Crisis<\/i>by David Burke.  The author reveals that Mac St&iacute;of&aacute;in exploited his position to create mischief for his arch rival, Cathal Goulding.<\/p><p>In August 1969, Mac St&iacute;of&aacute;in convinced the Special Branch that the army council had struck a deal with the Government, led by the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, to assist a campaign of violence in Northern Ireland.  This was untrue.  In October 1969, Captain Kelly of G2 hosted a meeting of the citizen defence committees of Northern Ireland at a hotel in Bailieborough.  It was called to discuss the defence of Catholic communities and the possibility of arms being supplied to them by the Government.  The ranks of the defence committees including priests, lawyers, a former SDLP Minister, Paddy Devlin, as well as some IRA veterans.  Yet, Mac St&iacute;of&aacute;in portrayed the Bailieborough gathering as a gathering of the IRA in furtherance of Goulding's alleged links with Fianna F&aacute;il.  During November and December 1969, Mac St&iacute;of&aacute;in told the Special Branch that Fianna F&aacute;il was channelling funds to Goulding via Captain Kelly.  This was also untrue.<\/p><p>As we know, the IRA split into the Provisional IRA and Official IRA in 1969.  In March 1970, Mac St&iacute;of&aacute;in, who joined the Provisional IRA, discovered that G2 was about to land an arms shipment at Dublin docks.  It was destined for a monastery in County Cavan and earmarked for release to the citizens defence committees - not the official IRA - in the event of a pogrom.  Even then, the guns were only to be released after a vote at Cabinet.  Mac St&iacute;of&aacute;in sent a Provisional IRA unit to hijack the weapons.  In the event, the arms were not on the boat and the hijack was called off at the last minute.  This demonstrates that Mac St&iacute;of&aacute;in was not a genuine informer and that the guns were not destined for the Provisional IRA.<\/p><p>By April 1970, the Provisional IRA had established its own arms supply from America and did not need the inferior arms that G2 was now arranging to fly into Dublin.  Deviously, Mac St&iacute;of&aacute;in told the Special Branch that the guns were on their way to Goulding's Official IRA.  This sparked the arms crisis.  It is clear that the Special Branch had what it believed was a genuine source of information at the highest reaches of the IRA but that he was peddling misinformation.  Des O'Malley, the then Minister for Justice, was aware of a tip-off to the Special Branch about the arms flight.  Regrettably, the House was misled about how the State came to learn of the imminent arrival of the arms flight.  It was told that it had been discovered by civil servants who were concerned about certain aspects of the paperwork associated with the flight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200053#CCC00100","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1600803300,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for submitting this matter for debate.  I understand, of course, that it is of particular importance to the families of those involved.  The period in 1970, and the arguments surrounding the Arms Trial, was an important time in our history, the repercussions of which continue to reverberate to this day.  It was one of the most significant political controversies in the history of the State and remains of abiding interest despite the passage of 50 years.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the National Archives Act provides that departmental files are subject to consideration for release to the National Archives, where appropriate, and open to public inspection.  I understand that many of the records relating to the Arms Trial were released to the National Archives in 2000.  While the Deputy will appreciate that some of the records could not be released because they contain sensitive Garda reports or potentially defamatory information, it should be noted that these files are subject to periodic review, including as to whether they should be released.  As the Deputy is also aware, related matters were also the subject of reviews by the Attorney General and the then Minister for Justice in 2001.  They were also debated in the House at that time.<\/p>  <p>  Any fresh insights into the Arms Trial are bound to be not just of historical interest but of contemporary interest, particularly to the family members of those involved.  It is not surprising that these events have attracted considerable interest and, no doubt, they will continue to do so in the coming years.  This is all the more so when it is inevitable that as further accounts come to light explanations may be provided but further questions may also be posed.  At this stage, given the long passage of time, it is difficult to see how differing accounts can be validated or adjudicated on at this remove, particularly where most of those who were involved are no longer in a position to defend themselves.

It was then claimed that the scheduled flight had been discovered by accident by civil servants who were concerned about certain paperwork issues.  An incorrect version has remained on the record of the House since.  It is not satisfactory that the official record of any event, let alone one as important as this, should be misleading.<\/p> <p> Crucially, the D&aacute;il record can only be set straight if the State confirms that the tip-off about the flight came from Se&aacute;n Mac St&iacute;of&aacute;in.  I hope the Minister appreciates that the continued concealment of Mac St&iacute;of&aacute;in's tales as an informer is tantamount to endorsing and perpetuating his agenda, which was to disrupt and undermine democracy, assist the growth of the Provisional IRA, ensure that this House continued to be deceived and belittling and defaming the memory of Captain James Kelly, an honourable soldier, who should never have been put on trial.  The same also applies to the late Colonel Michael Hefferon, who was director of military intelligence at the time.<\/p> <p> These files could be looked at, perhaps by a High Court judge.  This informer was not serving the State.  These files can be redacted.

Will the Minister listen carefully to what I have just requested?  If there are files, 50 years later they can now be declassified in order that this saga can be brought to an end.

People in Drogheda want to know if they can have a testing centre there.

They have been offering in excess of 750 appointments on individual days.  Persons from Drogheda are currently being referred for testing in Dundalk and Slane.  At present, there are no plans for a pop-up testing centre in Drogheda.  However, referral demand in any area is subject to ongoing review by the HSE and evaluation against available capacity.  Actions are continuously evaluated by the HSE to ensure capacity meets demand, including the extension of opening hours and the addition of testing stations to existing sites.<\/p> <p>The HSE advises that current demand nationally and in the Dundalk and Slane centres is being met.  This is a clear example of action being taken in the form of a response to demand.  On 16 September, for example, 761 appointments were offered across the two facilities, whereas two weeks previously the two centres offered a combined 450 appointments per day, approximately.  Further actions, including the standing up of pop-up testing centres, have been initiated in other areas where the above actions were not deemed sufficient to meet demand.<\/p> <p> The HSE is now finalising a future service model for testing and tracing.  This service model will aim to deliver a patient-centred, accessible, consistent and flexible service.  This plan includes the recruitment of a permanent workforce, which has already commenced, and a range of other service improvements which will be rolled out quickly.  Transition to the new model is under way and will continue through the autumn.  As part of this, a comprehensive assessment of community testing and swabbing locations is being undertaken.  Criteria considered include suitability and sustainability of the location as a long-term testing centre as well as travel times to test centres.<\/p> <p> As I said, we are constantly looking to improve further the responsiveness of the testing and tracing system and we will keep demand and capacity under review.  I appreciate that the two Deputies have raised the issue of a pop-up Covid-19 testing centre in Drogheda.  I will relay those concerns to the Minister as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200054#DDD00600","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600804500,"counter":432,"content":"<p>What is clear now is that the Slane centre is closing.  The decision has been made.  The Meath test centre is moving, I think, to Dunshaughlin or Ashbourne.  The Dundalk centre is moving to Ardee.  That is what is happening on the ground.  The Dundalk centre is moving to an area equidistant from the two big towns of Drogheda and Dundalk, but that means more people will have to travel farther.  I accept that the investment is there, that we must follow it through and that there are 37 full-time jobs there.  It does not make sense to have a full-time testing centre in east Meath, one in Drogheda, one in Ardee and one in Dundalk.  We have to wear the county jersey.  I accept that that means the centre will be in Ardee.  That is the decision that has been made.  I welcome what the Minister of State is saying.  He said that as demand increases, referral demand will be reviewed.  I believe we will have - we deserve and must have - a pop-up centre in Drogheda, particularly in view of the fact of the closure of the one in Slane.<\/p>  <p>  I congratulate all the HSE staff and officials on the fantastic work they are doing.  Together, all of us in the Houses of the Oireachtas, whether Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Labour, Sinn F&eacute;in or Independent, must work together to fight this disease.

That is splitting the difference.  For the sake of good planning we should be making sure that the response is where the service is needed, which in this case is Drogheda.  Looking at it on population terms or need terms, an objective case can and should be made to locate a centre of some permanence in Drogheda.  The HSE facilities are there and it would not take huge initiative to try to ensure that the resources are allocated to those facilities.  Being quick on local testing is critical to beating this condition and making sure that our economy remains open, that people stay in work and that businesses continue to thrive under difficult circumstances.  Far too many people are waiting for days for tests while their families remain at home, not at school, and partners and so on have to absent themselves from the workplace.<\/p>  <p>  Money has been no object in the fight against Covid-19.  We are borrowing eye-watering sums of money to tackle this condition and we will do the same next year.  It is better to plan in advance for a problem we know we will have rather than simply to react to it in a few months' time, when the Minister of State will acknowledge in the House that perhaps we should have established a Covid-19 testing centre in Drogheda.

They have made a very powerful case.  As I said, the HSE advises that we are meeting all testing demand nationally across the end-to-end testing and tracing process, with adequate swabbing and laboratory capacity.  I understand that these issues will be reviewed, and I will bring the Deputies' concerns to the Minister's attention.<\/p>  <p>  Unlike many other European countries, our testing demand does not currently exceed supply.  We are one of a few countries that automatically test close contacts as well as conducting serial testing.  We are among the highest ranked in Europe on testing per million of population, having done more testing than Germany, France, Norway, Italy, etc.  As I said, the HSE last week did 85,000 tests, our largest number yet: 52,000 in the community, 20,000 acutes and 13,000 serial.  Starting in May, the HSE had capacity for 100,000 tests per week, about 30% of which was offshore capacity at the time.  Over the summer months, however, it built capacity to 100,000 on-island tests per week.  In addition, the HSE has added surge capacity of 2,000 tests per day from our German laboratory partner, which we are very fortunate to have as there is a large and growing demand internationally for such capacity.  The HSE continues to forecast demand and is looking at additional kits, robots and methodologies that will increase onshore testing capacity across the winter months.  There are always improvements to be made, which we remain very focused on, to ensure consistency in the end-to-end testing process.  Referral demand in any area is subject to ongoing review by the HSE and evaluation against available capacity, whether that be in static or pop-up testing centres.<\/p>  <p>  Again, I will bring the Deputies' concerns to the Minister's attention.

On 20 August my colleague, an Teachta Gould, wrote to the Minister of State seeking information and an update on the status of drug and alcohol support group meetings.  I do not think anyone will dispute how important they are.  We know they are.  On 26 August an Teachta Gould received a reply.  In the intervening time he had to write to both the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach directly because no reply had been forthcoming from the Minister of State's office.  The Minister of State advised at that stage that it may not be the time to introduce exceptions to the public health advice.  On 3 September a Fianna F&aacute;il backbencher made a video announcing that the meetings would be restarted and put it up on social media, but on 4 September, curiously, National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, issued its advice.  That was a day later, so there is obviously some class of communication with the backbenches of Fianna F&aacute;il that is not going directly into the Minister of State's office.  I am sure he will wish to investigate that.  On 8 September we got the official announcement, and now we hear that these vital meetings have been stopped from 19 September.<\/p><p>The people who go to these meetings do so because they need support.  The meetings are the very definition of an essential service.  These people rely wholeheartedly on this service.  I will read to the Minister of State some quotes.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in, an Teachta Gould in particular, have received a lot of correspondence from people.  I will anonymise it, obviously:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI was in shock and very angry as we had only started the meetings back up in July and now they are shut down again.  In the meetings everyone wears masks, adheres to all the safety regulations.  Before I started AA I was suicidal, and the people and programme in AA saved my life. <\/blockquote>  <p>This is another quote:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe problem is most people only know an alcoholic in active addiction.  The alcoholic in recovery is a completely different person.  However, we are all tarred with the one brush.  This we can understand because at one time all of us in recovery were also in active addiction.  It is no exaggeration to say our continued recovery depends on meetings. <\/blockquote>  <p>Here is a final quote:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am a recovering alcoholic and I go to meetings to stay sober.  When the meetings stopped it was a huge struggle.  Unfortunately, some people drank and some will never make it back to meetings. <\/blockquote>  <p>This is very high-stakes, very important stuff and a really serious peer-to-peer support of the very best kind.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State can see from the testaments, this is the type of support that keeps people out of active addiction and in recovery.  It can keep them going and save their lives.  That is what they said.  These meetings have saved lives.  If that does not qualify as an essential service, I am at a loss to know what does.<\/p> <p> It is not lost on me or on anyone listening to this debate that bookmakers and off-licenses are open and yet these vital addiction and recovery support meetings have been forcibly closed.  I urge the Minister of State to rethink this and to engage with the groups which organise these meetings and to proactively find a way to ensure the meetings can take place safely.  They are a lifeline.  We know there will be rolling restrictions and that this is an issue that will be faced not only by Dublin but by other counties as we try to get ahead of this virus.  The Minister of State is compounding the issue these people have in terms of dealing with their recovery and their addiction and moving on with their lives.  I urge the Minister of State to rethink the suspension of these vital meetings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200055#EEE00600","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600805100,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her views.  We have found ourselves in a complex and difficult situation and I take this opportunity to update the House on the holding of drug and alcohol support group meetings in Dublin.  Last week, the Government published Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19.  The framework states that no organised indoor gatherings should take place when level 3 restrictions are in place and Dublin moved to level 3 from midnight on 19 September for a period of three weeks.  The level 3 restrictions apply to all indoor meetings.  However, organised outdoor gatherings of up to 15 people are still permitted.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the importance of drugs and alcohol meetings for people in recovery from addiction problems.  The Covid-19 pandemic has created uncertainty and anxiety for everyone, particularly those affected by drug and alcohol addiction.  My full intention, as Minister of State with responsibility for this area, is to do all I can to ensure we achieve the restoration of these essential addiction treatment services in Dublin as quickly as possible.  Having spoken to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, about this issue on several occasions this week, I state for the record of the House that it is his full intention to ensure that these services are returned.  However, we must ensure they can be held in a safe environment for the majority of the users of the services in a level 3 restriction area.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals affected by problem drug and alcohol use often have higher levels of physical comorbidity and alcohol may make an individual&lsquo;s immune system less effective.  As a result, this cohort of people are more vulnerable to the effects of respiratory disease and infection in general.  These risks to the health of participants in support group meetings cannot be ignored in the context of the serious danger of Covid-19, which is an enveloping respiratory disease.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy O'Reilly and other elected representatives who have contacted me concerning the importance of this issue since Friday.  The drugs policy unit in my Department is currently actively working on developing safe solutions to enable the restoration of all drug and alcohol treatment services nationwide.  I have asked the unit to make contact with the HSE, event organisers, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, AA, SMART Recovery, and other relevant stakeholders to develop a plan to achieve this outcome as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The situation regarding Covid-19 is evolving and is having a major impact in Ireland and across the world.  The measures in place and public health advice have been adapted to the changing circumstances and this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.  We are dealing with changing circumstances on a daily basis.  Real progress has been made on suppressing the virus due to the huge effort by our citizens.  By working together we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland.  We must all continue to do everything possible to avoid the virus spreading.  I assure anyone listening to this debate who is in recovery for addiction in Dublin that I and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, are working hard to ensure services can reopen in a safe manner as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200056#FFF00200","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1600805100,"counter":439,"content":"<p>The Minister of State said that individuals affected by problem drug or alcohol use often have higher levels of physical comorbidity and that alcohol may make an individual&lsquo;s immune system less affective.  That is offensive.  These people are in recovery.  Many of them have not had a drink for years.  The Minister is saying they will never be out of recovery because in his eyes they will always be in addiction.  That is what he is saying and that is grossly offensive.  I have brought it up with the Minister of State before.  That is not fair.  These people are doing their best.<\/p>  <p>  I have read out what we are hearing from these people.  The meetings are a lifeline.  We are here and we can have a meeting with more than 15 people.  We can manage it here and do it safely.  They want to do it safely and I welcome the fact that the Minister of State said he will engage but I am not sure if he gets the urgency of this or grasps how important these meetings are in order for people to keep their recovery going.  These are not only people with drug and alcohol addiction but people with gambling and other addictions.  They have no comorbidity.  What is the excuse for gamblers?  They are not at greater risk.  They are not under the influence of alcohol or damaged by alcohol misuse.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said he will look at this proactively and will instruct people in his Department to work on it, and I welcome that.  However, when he comes out with offensive language, it makes me wonder how sincere and committed he is.

They are, as described by the Minister for Health, essentially, a public health service.  They are an essential service and I urge the Minister of State to treat them as such and to look around.

This debate on the issue I am raising has been a long time coming.  I refer to people trying to report faults having an average waiting time of 57 minutes.  That is the average waiting time.  I am not raising this issue to complain, but as we face into the winter and the dark nights, na ho&iacute;cheanta fada geimhridh, I am worried about people's mental health and their safety and security.<\/p><p>The situation at the moment is an unmitigated shambles and a disaster.  I am not blaming the Minister.  I differ with him regarding many opinions, including on green issues, but I do not on this issue.  This has been a whole-of-government abandonment of the people, rural and urban.  I refer to people with pendant alarms and other types of alarm connected to the telephone, as well as those who do not use mobile phones, especially the elderly and the vulnerable.  They are all abandoned, because if the line goes off, they are out of contact.<\/p><p>I salute the founders of Eir, and its predecessors, Eircom and Telecom &Eacute;ireann.  I remember when the former Taoiseach, the late Albert Reynolds, waved a phone in the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis and stated that every phone would be fitted within a month, and it was.  Now it is impossible to get a phone disconnected.  It might take a year.  It is also impossible to get a phone repaired.  This is communications we are talking about.  People can be waiting up to 60 minutes and still not be able to get through.  I received a message from a man on Facebook this evening.  He wrote:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am a constituent of yours.  I have been trying to contact Eir every day since 20 July, and been on hold every day for up to 60 minutes, without ever actually getting through to anyone.  This company needs to be closed down. <\/blockquote>  <p>This is a shocking situation in 2020.  It was better back in the dark ages, when we had pigeons to deliver messages, than it is now.  This is an outrageous situation and this company must be taken to task and closed down.<\/p><p>I salute the workmen who were there when the lines were put up and the phones installed, and especially the care and attention that was provided to the customers.  I refer to the dignity of the work and the respect that those workmen had for that work.  Now, however, poles are falling out on the road, hitting buses and lorries and breaking mirrors.  A constituent contacted me today because he cannot cut his hedges.  He has got hedge cutters from the county council to cut his hedges, but it cannot be done because wires were lying on the ditch.  Wires are lying on roads and in the bogs.  It is a Third World service, and above all there are no communications.<\/p><p>Constituents contact my office because their efforts have been futile and they are weary of being on the phone with Eir for so long.  When those constituents have been unable to contact Eir themselves, they see us as the only last hope they have.  They contact many other offices, besides mine.  Eir often insists on those constituents getting an email address.  Those people do not have email, they do not do Google and they do not even have broadband.  It is shocking and disgraceful treatment, and it should be brought before the European Court of Human Rights.  People are entitled to get a service for which they pay.  Those people pay dearly for a connection and rent, yet they cannot use the telephones.<\/p><p>What about children going back to school and young people going back to college?  Classes and exams are often online now.  We talk about options for education, but those people cannot get broadband and do not have that service.  What about farmers trying to do applications for grants?  What about the CAO courses?  People in rural Ireland have been especially discriminated against, but people in urban Ireland have also been affected by the situation.<\/p><p>It is time the new Government sorted out this issue and stopped the blackguarding, the plundering and the rape of good communities by this company, Eir, which should be ashamed of itself.  It does not represent anything anymore.  A gentleman contacted me recently who was trying to get disconnected from Eir for six months.  Another man, Paul Lafford from Cahir, contacted me and he had an ordeal and a half in trying to deal with Eir.  The company accused him of not paying his bills.  When he then produced his bank statements, the company did not apologise, but it had to accept that he had paid.  The company did not apologise.  The Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, is toothless, useless and fruitless.  We have many such institutions and boards that similarly do nothing for the public.  They just have nice fancy names, fancy jobs and to hell with the people.  It is a sad indictment in 2020 that such behaviour is being allowed to continue.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices within the Government to deal with this shambolic and disgraceful company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200057#GGG00300","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1600805700,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McGrath for raising this important issue.  As he is aware, the provision of electronic communications services, including the repair and restoration of telephone services, occurs within a liberalised market, regulated by the independent regulator, ComReg.  As the Deputy referred to, it is responsible for the regulation of the electronic communications sector under European and national legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise, as the Deputy said, how vital telecommunications services are to citizens for so many aspects of their daily lives, especially during the current Covid-19 pandemic.  I and officials from my Department are focused on the need to ensure that telecommunications customers are sympathetically treated at this challenging time.  In this regard, officials from my Department have been engaging intensively with ComReg and with the telecommunications industry during this period.  Since Covid-19 began, ComReg has been monitoring consumer issues reported to it regarding outages and, in particular, those outages for vulnerable customers that may need to be escalated.  ComReg advises customers experiencing difficulties to contact their service provider in the first instance.  Following this, the customer is advised to contact ComReg and, depending on the particular circumstances, the issues may be escalated by ComReg.<\/p>  <p>  One of ComReg's functions is to determine the scope of the universal service obligations, USO, for the Irish market and to decide which undertaking should be designated as the universal service provider, USP.  The USO is designed to ensure that every person who makes a reasonable request for access for a connection and a phone service at a fixed location can have access to a basic set of telecommunications services, no matter where he or she lives.  On 29 July 2016, ComReg designated Eir as the USP until June 2021.  That designation as the USP of basic telecommunication services includes a requirement, among others, to clear line faults within timelines set in the USO.  As the designated USP, Eir is also required to publish information on its performance regarding the provision of the USO.  ComReg publishes this information quarterly. Legally binding annual quality of service performance targets for Eir are also set by ComReg, as the independent regulator for telecommunications operators, in respect of connections and service availability targets at a national level.<\/p>  <p>  Eir provides a customer guarantee scheme for repairs.  It provides two months' telephone exchange line rental credit where faults are not repaired within two working days from the date the fault was reported.  Any complaint that Eir is failing to provide such basic services, or failing to restore lines within a reasonable period, should be forwarded to ComReg for further examination.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that ensuring the performance of the requirements of this USO by Eir is a statutory function of ComReg.  As Minister, I have no role or function in this area.  ComReg is directly accountable \"for the performance of its functions to a Committee of one or both Houses of the Oireachtas\", as provided for in section 34(2) of the Communications Regulation Act 2002.  ComReg has a dedicated consumer helpline and I urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the regulator.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy has raised the issue here, I will ensure that his question and associated concerns will be raised directly with ComReg and ensure it is aware of the debate we have had tonight.  It is deeply annoying and frustrating to be in situations such as those described by the Deputy.  That is especially the case for people who have been left on a phone for 60 minutes waiting for a customer service operation to answer, particularly one in telecommunications.  It is maddening for customers that a telecommunications company cannot answer the phone after an hour.  I know that basic services that one would expect, such as quick response and contact, not being provided is a matter of real concern and I will ensure that the details of this debate are forwarded to ComReg.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200057#GGG00400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1600805700,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I have written to Carolan Lennon, the CEO of Eir.  We might as well be writing to Santa Claus.  The company has no respect for its customers.  I again pay tribute to its workers.  A good friend and neighbour of mine, P&aacute;draig O'Ceallaigh, who retired recently after 42 years, and his colleagues, have been travelling around the country in vans.  Those workers are travelling 100 miles and more to do repairs.  Eir does not have the staff on the ground and it does not have the interest.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister read out his reply and I know he is a decent man.  I thank him for agreeing to come to Tipperary where I will show him some of the conditions of the network.  It is the land of his forebears as well.  The reply that he read, however, is patronising, insulting and it is toilet paper.  It is disgraceful.  The Minister referred to waiting an hour on a call, but it is not possible for people to get through, sometimes for months.  They ring every day for months.  They do not get through to staff in Eir and they do not get a call back.  Customers find it impossible to get their lines disconnected, and it is equally impossible to get a phone put in.  People are flocking away from the company, and it is faltering and about to fail.  It will fail.<\/p>  <p>  Then there is the issue of Eir broadband.

Wonderful volunteers go in every Monday and ring elderly, vulnerable and lonely people.  Alone has also come on board and I salute that.  That service is no good if people do not have, and cannot get, phone lines.  Those people cannot make complaints.  Some of those people do not have computers and are not able to do that kind of stuff.  Our elderly people who looked after this country and built it up are being blackguarded, not to mention business people, farmers and young people.  It is a shame.<\/p> <p> To see the state of the network now would make one sad.  Wires and poles are hanging into fields from the road.  The poles are rotten and dangerous.  I was in a council yard yesterday morning and servicemen from a private contractor had to come in to look for signs before they attempted a road job to fix a pole that was hanging over the road and posing a danger to the public.  It is like \"Dad's Army\".  It is crazy stuff and if the Minister and the Government do not do something about this, more shame on them.  The Government is going to abandon its citizens during this time of Covid-19 when they are feeling lonely and isolated and the only contact they have is the guth&aacute;n in their hand to have a chat and caint with their friends.  It is a shame.  Those people are prisoners in their own houses and have no communication with the outside world.<\/p> <p> I am depending on the Minister.  This matter has been raised several times and has got worse.  The phone companies have no interest in serving the public because all they want is the money and to hell with the people.  ComReg should be disbanded because it is useless, toothless and fruitless.  It provides jobs for the boys, that is all.  ComReg states that its representatives have talked to the phone companies but it is a waste of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200057#GGG00500","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600806300,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I hope the new national broadband scheme that we are rolling out, and about which I will be answering questions later, will close the gap where there is a shortage of service and an inability for customers, particularly in rural areas, to get broadband.

I will happily respond to the Deputy once I have read and reviewed it.  I agree with the Deputy.  Roof after roof in the North has solar PV panels and it is not exactly the sunniest place on the planet.  We have failed to do that in the South.  During my previous term in this office, 12 years ago, we introduced a microgeneration support price scheme of 19 cent per kWh.  That was at the start of the solar revolution.  Unfortunately, the succeeding Government removed that scheme.  In fairness to my predecessor, he introduced such a proposal in the climate action plan that he developed and we will see it introduced early next year.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen it in action.  Yesterday, I was fortunate enough to visit the Fair Play caf&eacute; in Ringsend, one of the community energy projects that have just received support of &euro;29 million.  The caf&eacute; has installed 12 kW of solar panels.  Their experience has been fantastic because it works, integrates with their business and was easy to introduce.  They can see the level of power that they are using and to which customers can connect.  There is considerable potential in the development of solar power.<\/p>  <p>  EirGrid provided me with analysis a year or two ago when I was an Opposition spokesperson, as the Deputy is now.  I asked what level of solar power could be generated on roofs.<\/p> <p>I am going on memory, but I understand if we had 700,000 houses with solar panels on their roofs and 45,000 businesses that would provide 5% of our total power supply.  That may not sound significant, but one of the attractive things about solar power is that it would be very much complementary to other renewable power supplies, such as wind and so on.  It would provide a very stable local power supply source which, contrary to the original arguments against solar power, would strengthen and complement rather than undermine the grid. <\/p> <p> We will be using a lot of power at a distributed level as we move towards electrifying the transport and heating systems.  We will need every source of power and I am committed to the development of solar power not just on houses or smaller rooftops but for larger business applications where rooftop solar could be introduced and become an integral part of the overall switch to 100% renewables which is where we are going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200058#HHH01000","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600806900,"counter":458,"content":"<p>In the interest of time I will commend <i>noteworthy.ie<\/i>and <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>.

It would not work.  The key way to bring down electricity prices in the long run is to switch to renewables.  Our exposure to high fossil fuel prices is the greatest risk and the greatest cost.  There are many other reasons for prices increasing.  The benefit of renewables is that they would constitute our own power supply and keep money in the country.  Use of renewables also brings down the wholesale price.  While the renewable auction brings in an element of public service obligation payments, it was 20% cheaper than the previous renewable support scheme because the cost of wind and solar energy is coming down, slowly but surely.  The best way of reducing electricity prices in the long term is to continue this path of relying on renewable power, turn our comparative advantage in wind power particularly, and also now the ability to deliver solar power as a way of protecting consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200061#LLL00300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1600808100,"counter":493,"content":"<p>On the price of electricity, does the Minister believe, on the basis of his exchanges with them, that providers are still intent on increasing prices?

Ireland was actually one of the first countries in the world to get a national network.  To go back ten or 12 years, the ESB was one of the first companies in this area with real expertise.  Back in 2009, we signed an agreement with Renault-Nissan, I believe, and developed genuine expertise in the ESB in respect of charging networks and infrastructure, to the extent that when Transport for London sought a company to commission to roll out its network of fast chargers for the London electric taxi fleet, the ESB won the contract.  As a result, I have every confidence in the ESB that it will be able to deliver on this and more.  The restriction here will not concern funding; the restriction, as I stated, is more administrative in terms of getting planning permission and getting the local authorities and others involved.

It would be worthwhile determining what the barriers are.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of local authorities, I have spoken to Wicklow County Council about this matter.  Only 75% of the cost of installing the charging points is met by the Government so the council has to find the remaining 25%.  Councils are struggling because of Covid, the reduction in rates and the position regarding rent.  They are experiencing major financial difficulties and I do not believe they will have the resources to do what is desired.  We are not staying ahead of demand.

We will review it if no local authorities are willing to take up the 75% grant.  If they do not put priority on the development of that type of infrastructure and avail of that benefit for their communities, then we will come back to it, and look at it.

As I outlined in my reply to Deputy Murphy earlier, the national broadband plan network offers a high-speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500 Mbps from the outset.  This represents an increase from the 150 Mbps committed to under the contract.  The\u00a0deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first two years and more than 90% of premises in the State having access to high-speed broadband within the next four years.<\/p>  <p>  As of 15 September, design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 21 counties and steady progress is being made with more than 91,000 premises surveyed to date.  This\u00a0activity is increasing week on week and by year end, National Broadband Ireland expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys.  This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting the images, notes and measurements of\u00a0the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area.  This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network.  This detailed design is then used to initiate the \"make ready\" project with Eir for the area, where Eir ensures any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose.  It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area.  The laying\u00a0of\u00a0the fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year.<\/p>  <p>  The national broadband plan has delivered significant employment opportunities with National Broadband Ireland directly employing some 140 staff and more than 500 people are now working on the plan either directly or indirectly.<\/p>  <p>  Broadband connection points, BCPs, are a key element of the national broadband plan providing high-speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll-out of the fibre to the home network.  Some 144 BCP sites have been installed by National Broadband Ireland and the high-speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites, such as those owned by the Department of Education and Skills\u00a0for schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200063#NNN00500","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1600809300,"counter":518,"content":"<p>Am I correct in thinking that the way this is being rolled out by National Broadband Ireland is from the centre outwards?

It also recognises the special economic and social role of agriculture and the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane, as described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in terms of plans and strategies to achieve these targets.<\/p>  <p>  On Ireland's existing 2030 EU target to reduce greenhouse gases in the non-ETS sector by 30%, the climate action plan written by my predecessor sets out the policies and measures to achieve this, including setting an emissions reduction range for agriculture.  This is underpinned by actions aimed at: reducing emissions on our farms by vigorously adopting the abatement opportunities identified by Teagasc; promoting diversification of land use as part of a gradual transition; harnessing opportunities in the bioeconomy; realising the potential of sustainable bioenergy supply opportunities; better management of our peatlands and soils; and developing clusters of exemplar practice.<\/p> <p> The European Commission has just presented its plan to increase its ambition to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, from its existing target of 40% to at least 55% compared with 1990 levels.  This level of ambition for the next decade will put the EU on a balanced pathway to reaching climate neutrality by 2050.  It is intended that the 2030 target will be enshrined in EU climate law.  The European Parliament and Council have been invited to confirm this 55% 2030 target as the EU's new nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement and to submit it to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, by the end of this year.  Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target will be presented by June 2021, and additional effort will be asked of all member states, including Ireland, to meet that target.<\/p> <p> These developments at EU level, along with the\u00a0step change in\u00a0climate ambition set out\u00a0in the\u00a0programme for Government, will need to be reflected appropriately in the next iteration of the climate action plan, which we hope to develop next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020092200064#OOO02900","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1600810500,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

On 22 July, I raised with the Minister the prospect of the ESB seeking tenders for the demolition of those plants.  Unfortunately, that prospect has now come to fruition, with the ESB publishing those tender documents last week.

The European tendering process in that regard does not commit the ESB to any course of action regarding the future use of the site and does not prejudge the outcome of the feasibility study into the possible establishment of a green or renewable energy hub on either site.  Given the grid connections that exist on site and the expertise that exists in B&oacute;rd na Mona and IN the region in logistics and energy management it is obviously preferable that alternative uses be found rather than simply decommissioning the sites.  We should not prejudge what they may be or preclude things.  I have heard a variety of different suggestions not just in energy but also in waste management and other areas.  As such my instinct is that it is better for us to see what proposals arise out of that, to let the working group do its work and to not rule out any option.

If I am to take it at face value, the Minister is telling me that despite the publication and the seeking of tenders for its demolition publicised last week, ESB may well not act upon any such submissions it might receive and it would be folly on the part of any commercial operation to seek to tender, in the knowledge that the Minister has today informed the House that the prospect of a green energy hub remains alive.  This raises the prospect of a potential open competition from the wider public for the Minister or the ESB to ascertain the benefit to the community of offering alternatives that might well benefit the region.

How that very specific infrastructure can be repurposed or reconditioned for another use is not something I have a clear example of elsewhere.  However the sites have, as I said, other characteristics, including grid connection and if a use can be found, be it for the boiler or the other equipment on the site, which could be part of a new energy hub, then we should certainly look at that.  We should not restrict the options though, because applications other than the reintroduction of the exact same power plants are far more likely.
