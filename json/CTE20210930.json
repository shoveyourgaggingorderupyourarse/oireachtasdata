As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.

The core idea was for NAMA to acquire property-related loans from the commercial banks, to hold and manage the loans and related collateral and, ultimately, to dispose of those assets in a manner that protected the State&rsquo;s interests.  NAMA would then cease to exist.  At the outset, it was envisaged that NAMA would have a life of around ten years and would, therefore, be winding up in 2020.  However, a Department of Finance review published in July 2019 recommended that NAMA continue to work out its residual loans for a limited period beyond 2021.  It further recommended that, before the end of 2021, NAMA would submit to the Minister proposals and a plan for the dissolution of the agency.<\/p> <p>  The 2020 financial statements indicate that NAMA had operating income of &euro;274 million in the year.  This was down from &euro;363 million earned in 2019, reflecting in the main the continuing decline in the value of NAMA debtor loans, which stood at &euro;850 million at the year end, compared with &euro;1.23 billion at end 2019.  Administration expenses incurred by NAMA in 2020 amounted to &euro;63 million, down from &euro;67 million in 2019.  The profit for the year was &euro;192 million.  The last of NAMA&rsquo;s debt, amounting to &euro;1.1 billion, was repaid in March 2020 and the interest of private investors was redeemed at a cost of &euro;56 million.  Finally, a cash transfer of &euro;2 billion to the Exchequer in 2020 was funded from NAMA&rsquo;s accumulated retained earnings.  NAMA&rsquo;s retained earnings at 31 December 2020 amounted to &euro;2.6 billion.<\/p> <p>  Under section 226 of the NAMA Act 2009, I am required to carry out reviews every three years of the extent to which NAMA has made progress towards achieving its overall objectives.  Because NAMA has a specific purpose to be achieved over a finite life, it is more meaningful to look at its lifetime performance than at its performance in an individual year.  The report before the committee today is the third progress report, up to end 2018.  Where additional financial information is available in the audited 2020 financial statements, I will refer to the most up-to-date position in the following comments.<\/p> <p>  NAMA paid &euro;31.8 billion to the banks for the loans it acquired in 2010 and 2011.  At that time, the par value of the loans on the banks' books was &euro;74.4 billion, so the sale to NAMA resulted in very large losses for the banks.<\/p><p>NAMA funded the purchase by issuing debt.  <\/p><p> In the following years, NAMA implemented a significant programme of disposals of property assets and of loan portfolios, as well as additional lending to certain NAMA debtors where this was likely to generate best returns.  As I mentioned previously, NAMA held a much reduced portfolio of loan assets at end-2020 valued at &euro;850 million.<\/p><p> A key objective set by NAMA was to have redeemed all the debt it had issued by 2020.  NAMA was significantly ahead of the planned debt repayment profile from 2014 onwards and had repaid 95% of its borrowing by the end of October 2017.  All the remaining debt was repaid by March 2020.  NAMA covered all of its operating costs and additional lending to NAMA debtors without recourse to any additional borrowing.  At the end of 2020, NAMA was projecting it will generate a surplus of &euro;4.25 billion by the time it completes its work.  This includes the &euro;2 billion transferred to the Exchequer in 2020.<\/p><p> NAMA has a statutory objective to obtain \"the best achievable financial return for the State\" but how that return is to be measured is not defined in the NAMA Act.  The internal rate of return, IRR, is a standard performance measure for commercial property and other investments.  This measure takes account of the amount and timing of receipt of financial returns as compared to the initial investment and other outlays.  NAMA's results up to the end of 2018 and its projected future cash flows indicate that its expected overall internal rate of return over the full life of the agency would be around 6.6%.  NAMA has not set a target for the internal rate of return on its investment.  However, in fixing the prices it paid for the loans it bought, NAMA effectively anticipated an internal rate of return of around 5%.  By reference to that benchmark, NAMA is likely to achieve a modestly better return for the State.<\/p><p> In 2014, NAMA adopted a secondary objective relating to the delivery of office accommodation in Dublin.  At that stage, NAMA still had an interest in a substantial proportion of the undeveloped land in the Dublin Docklands strategic development zone, SDZ. The NAMA board approved a strategic business plan for the sites in September 2014 but this did not include formal targets in respect of the stated objectives.  While it was envisaged in the plan that construction on the docklands sites could potentially commence in 2016, no timescale was set for the completion of development.  By May 2020, construction was under way, and in some cases had already been completed, on sites accounting for 86% of the land in which NAMA had an interest.<\/p><p> Although NAMA acquired an interest in a substantial number of residential property developments at various stages of completion when it acquired its loans from the banks, the NAMA Act does not explicitly require the agency to engage in the development or delivery of residential units.  However, early on, the board adopted the facilitation of the delivery of housing, subject to commercial viability, as a secondary objective.  NAMA has sought to deliver residential units for both the social housing and commercial housing markets.<\/p><p> NAMA set a target of delivering 2,000 social housing units by the end of 2015 and this was achieved. By the end of 2018, NAMA had provided a total of 2,445 residential housing units to approved housing bodies or local authorities and an additional 36 units were at contract stage.  Of these, 1,352 social housing units had been acquired from NAMA debtors by a NAMA subsidiary, which was leasing the units to approved housing bodies.<\/p><p> In November 2015, NAMA set a target to deliver 20,000 commercial residential units on sites where NAMA had a direct involvement by 2020.  By the end of 2018, a total of 7,521 residential units had been delivered on such sites.  At that stage, NAMA was forecasting a further 5,750 units would be delivered through similar NAMA-supported commercial developments by 2021, that is, around 13,000 units in total.  This would represent delivery of around 65% of the target number of units albeit a year later than originally projected.  Between 2011 and 2018, NAMA debtors and receivers had sold sites with the potential to deliver an estimated 63,300 residential units.  NAMA reported at the end of 2018 that just 3,525 residential units had been built on those sites.  The annual report provides an update on this.  The report indicates that sites sold up to the end of March 2021 by NAMA debtors and receivers have the potential to accommodate around 81,000 residential units but that only 6,800 units, or around 8.4% of the estimated capacity, had been delivered to the market by March 2021.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021093000002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632990600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. McDonagh to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021093000002#B00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632990600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The committee invited us to discuss NAMA's 2020 financial statements and the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the progress of NAMA.  I am joined today by the NAMA chairman, Aidan Williams; chief financial officer, Noelle Condon; chief commercial officer, John Collison; and head of strategy and communications, Jamie Bourke.<\/p> <p>  NAMA last appeared before this committee in October 2020 and since then, despite the various challenges brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, we have continued to build on the progress outlined in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  I will briefly discuss some of this progress shortly but first I wish to update the committee on NAMA's cash transfers to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, we made our first surplus payment of &euro;2 billion in June 2020 and during the first half of 2021, we transferred a further &euro;500 million.  I am pleased to announce that just this morning, we made a payment of &euro;250 million to the Exchequer.  Another &euro;250 million will be paid in December.  Along with almost &euro;400 million paid in corporation tax, this brings our total cash contribution to the State to &euro;3.4 billion by end-2021 - an important financial support at this critical time.<\/p> <p>  As regards our financial results, 2020 was a difficult year in many respects.  While NAMA remained fully operational, planned asset disposals and debtor exits were necessarily delayed by the widespread economic disruption.  Additionally, the pandemic had a pronounced effect on our residential delivery programme, which experienced severe delays due to necessary and enduring site closures, impacts to supply chains and enhanced health and safety requirements on sites.  Nonetheless, the considerable asset enhancement and preparatory work undertaken by NAMA in previous years meant the agency was in a strong position to weather the storm; while some transactions were behind schedule, their values remained robust.  As a result, we reported a profit of &euro;192 million and cash generation of &euro;920 million for 2020.  <\/p> <p>  Our half-year accounts for 2021 will be submitted to the Minister shortly and show continued profitability from our operations bolstered by the very strong return achieved on the disposal of 80% equity in the Poolbeg West SDZ special purpose vehicles, SPVs.  Crucially, our strong cash position and profitability have enabled us to increase our lifetime surplus projection by &euro;250 million to &euro;4.25 billion.  This surplus, coupled with corporation tax paid of &euro;400 million, brings NAMA's total expected lifetime contribution to the State to &euro;4.65 billion.  The board will review this again in the first half of 2022 when our 2021 results are known.<\/p> <p>  I will turn briefly to the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report, which is the third progress report on NAMA prepared under section 226 of the NAMA Act.  The report deals with the period from establishment to end-2018 and it is clear that significant progress was made by NAMA during this period.  Our most notable achievement was the early full repayment of our &euro;30.2 billion Government-guaranteed senior debt.  As the senior debt was guaranteed by the Irish Government, it created a significant contingent liability for the State.  When market conditions began to improve in 2014, the NAMA board resolved to pursue a programme of accelerated deleveraging and early redemption of senior debt which, in turn, helped reduce the funding cost of Ireland's debt.  This recovery is of particular benefit now when one considers the significant costs to the State arising from Covid-19 and subsequently the increase in the requirement for State borrowing. <\/p> <p>  Much progress has also been made on other objectives mentioned in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Our work in the Dublin Docklands SDZ, which has had a major transformational impact on the area, is nearing conclusion with 86% of our original interests in the area now completed or sold.  In addition, we continue to identify opportunities to provide social housing from our portfolio.  Updated figures on both of these objectives are available in the briefing material provided to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Of course, housing delivery continues to be a major focus of our attention. Since 2014, we have been involved in the delivery of some 20,000 homes, almost 13,000 of which were directly funded and facilitated by the agency.  A further 7,600 homes were delivered on sites under the control of the agency at a point in time and benefited from NAMA funding to secure planning permission or for other asset management works.<\/p><p> There has been some uninformed commentary on the number of residential units that NAMA can deliver and has delivered.  It is important, in that context, to set out the factual situation regarding the restrictions under which NAMA operates.  Firstly, NAMA does not own the development sites in its portfolio; these are owned by our debtors.  We cannot force them to act in a manner which may hinder or reduce their repayment capacity.  Secondly, we must act in a market-conform way, meaning the agency cannot provide preferential funding terms to its debtors.  Thirdly, many of the sites in our portfolio are simply not suitable for residential development at present, owing to a lack of appropriate planning or zoning or essential infrastructure and services such as water, roads, sewerage or utilities.  Fourthly, the growth in property values has allowed a number of NAMA debtors to refinance their debt and exit NAMA with their considerable land banks.  These sites will be developed with funding from their new lenders.  Finally, the issue of commercial viability is key.  Under our legislation, this is the most important and relevant criterion for funding of residential development.  This basically means that NAMA can finance only developments that we expect will yield a profit.  This is an important demonstration that we are in compliance with EU state aid rules.<\/p><p> Commercial viability is becoming more challenging across the sector.  Even sites that have planning permission in place are currently not viable to build on, especially apartments.  Soaring construction costs coupled with pandemic-related delays and labour shortages are all putting upward pressure on the cost of delivering housing in Ireland.  The Government's recent Housing for All plan will seek to address some of these issues currently hindering supply and affordability; however, NAMA must continue to operate under the constraints I have just outlined.<\/p><p> Figure 1 in my written submission illustrates NAMA's delivery potential based on the viability and profile of the remaining sites with planning permission in our portfolio.  Delivery of the 2,400 units under the first two rows, (a) and (b), where it is indicated that funding is approved or under consideration, will be extremely challenging.  Our objective is to make the sites under (d) and (e) as shovel-ready as possible by achieving planning before disposal.  The sites under row (f) will likely become available only post 2025, but it is important to asset-manage them between now and then by trying to resolve infrastructure, zoning and, ultimately, planning.<\/p><p> There has also been some commentary to the effect that NAMA should not permit the sale of residential developments to funds and that, instead, any sales should be restricted to individual buyers.  The reality is that we have to operate to the clear and unequivocal mandate set for us by the Oireachtas.  Under the NAMA legislation, we are obliged to get the best price; we could not have limited the field of potential buyers or refused to sell to funds if the effect of doing so was to reduce the return.  Furthermore, the absence of such funds committing capital to purchase developments would simply mean that certain residential projects would not be viable and otherwise never built.  In any event, the vast majority of NAMA-funded newly built residential units are sold to individual purchasers, many of them first-time buyers.<\/p><p> From our perspective, the key takeaway from NAMA's residential delivery programme is that it has resulted in the supply of more than 20,000 new residential units in Ireland, whether owner-occupied, rented or used for social housing.  These are homes that exist primarily because of our contribution at various stages of the delivery process.  I assure the committee that NAMA will do its utmost to add effectively to this supply as much as possible before we conclude our work in 2025.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021093000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632990600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. McDonagh.

Obviously, since the lockdown in March 2020, there has not been very much demand for commercial office space.  That is the reality.  Any agent will tell you that.  From our perspective, we are fortunate enough that any of the stuff we have left in our portfolio is quite small in the context of the 4.2 million sq. ft.  In one particular building which we have pre-sold, there is about 70,000 sq. ft remaining at &euro;170,000.  In another building in which we are involved, a joint venture which is currently being built, there is about 70,000 sq. ft which is currently under construction and which probably will not complete until, say, quarter 1 of next year.  In that context, we are very fortunate that we have a very limited exposure.  We do not have 100% exposure because, effectively, there is the involvement of joint venture partners.<\/p> <p>  As for demand for office space, a lot will depend on how we all begin to handle Covid.  Do we begin to return to offices?  Will there be development of the hybrid working model?  As for the demand that is out there, what we are seeing on the ground is that everybody is sitting on their hands - and you cannot really blame them - until they know whether this Covid thing is under control and how many people will be coming back to the office.  The reality of Covid is that it probably brought forward the inevitable that remote working would become a reality by probably ten years.  It forced companies overnight to have people working from home.  The advent of technology, which has worked very well, meant that people could get on and do their jobs quite well, so there will inevitably be less demand for office space.  If I were sitting in NAMA's offices in 2014 and 2015 looking at the docklands, which were not yet developed, and if Covid had happened then, that would certainly be a big concern.  Thankfully, however, we are at the tail end of it, as far as we are concerned, and we have very little exposure left, which is a good thing for the taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021093000002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1632990600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>We understand NAMA's remit and the legislation, but there is the potential for 3,500 residential units at the Poolbeg West site.<\/p><p>That is clearly understood.

We have selected a preferred bidder.  We ran an open market process that started in July 2019 and concluded in July 2021.  We sold 80% of our interest in that to a consortium involving Oaktree, an affiliated entity to Oaktree called Lioncor, and the Ronan Group.  On the state of development, the site has planning permission for 3,500 units and 1 million sq. ft. of commercial office space.  The consortium that bought it is determined to develop this site as quickly as possible.  In accordance with planning permission, it will be done on a staged basis.  Certain other infrastructure has to go into the site before the full site can be developed and that will have to be worked out with Dublin City Council.  Within weeks of acquiring 80% of our interest in July, the consortium already submitted a planning application for the first 600 residential units in that portfolio.  It is actively working on a further planning application which it is hoped that it will submit in early 2022.<\/p> <p>  As part of the conditions set out in the planning applications by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the strategic development zone, 25% has to be set aside for social and affordable housing, including 10% social and 15% affordable.  This is from before the Affordable Housing Act.  The consortium, as part of the initial 600 applications, has made provision for 25% being social and affordable.  It is abiding by the obligation, which we are glad to see.  The 10% Part V social housing is an obligation for every site.

Obviously, the sale price in some areas is less than that in others, but the prices are all at market value.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021093000002#H01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1632990600,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Is that at today&rsquo;s price?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021093000002#H01200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632990600,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021093000002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1632990600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I want to ask a question on the consultancy costs, which seem to have increased exponentially.

As it happened at the time, France got an exemption because it set up a vehicle with majority private ownership but which was effectively state-controlled.  It got an assets vehicle it used for dealing with the banking crisis off-balance sheet.  We saw that and we worked with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and applied to EUROSTAT and the Department of Finance to see if we could set up a similar vehicle in Ireland with majority private ownership but over which NAMA or the Minister effectively had a veto and so effectively it was State-controlled, similar to the French one, and if we could then get it off-balance sheet.  They agreed we could, so when NAMA was set up originally it was capitalised with &euro;100 million.  Of that, &euro;49 million was provided the Minister for Finance and &euro;51 million was got from a number of pension fund managers here in Dublin, and effectively all they were entitled to was a dividend and their capital being returned to them once NAMA had paid off all its debts.<\/p> <p>  In 2020, as we had paid off all our debts, the Minister wanted a surplus out of NAMA.  For us to get the surplus out of NAMA, we had to pay off the private investors.  It was always intended we would pay them off.  They were capped in terms of their return.  For the &euro;51 million they put in, they got &euro;5 million in return for leaving their capital with us for as long as ten years and they got &euro;56 million back.  Once we paid back the &euro;56 million after paying off all our debts, we could pay the &euro;2 billion surplus or start paying our surplus, which was initially &euro;2 billion, over to the Minister in 2020.  It was purely a mechanism to keep NAMA off-balance sheet for EUROSTAT reporting purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021093000002#J01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1632990600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Just so I am clear, did that repurchasing of these private investors' shareholdings allow NAMA to make the transfer of the first tranche of the terminal surplus?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021093000002#J01900","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632990600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Yes, that is correct.

I have a few questions for Mr. McDonagh myself.<\/p> <p>  On the overall performance of NAMA, the &euro;74.4 billion was the par value of the loans at the point when the agency acquired them.  It got them at a 60% or 57% discount and &euro;31.8 billion was the cost in public money.  Mr. McDonagh outlined this morning that NAMA will achieve a surplus of &euro;4.2 billion plus about &euro;400 million in tax, and that is it.  The mandate obviously is to try to achieve commercially the best return for the taxpayer there.  The agency is hoping to achieve somewhere just the far side of &euro;36 billion over its lifetime, by 2025, in terms of the final figures.  This is less than half the par value of the loans at the point NAMA bought them.  If you look at it this way, there is a hit to the public purse there of about &euro;38 billion that obviously had to be made up.  That was the impaired loans, that was the bank bailout and that is what the taxpayer coughed up for.  Should NAMA be more ambitious in trying to bridge that gap?  I am aware it was probably under pressure from Government, and maybe Mr. McDonagh can clarify this for me, to sell a lot of those loans early.  Some of us would have felt that perhaps they were sold a bit too early.  I think it would be accepted that had NAMA been able to wait another one, two or three years, some of those loans and the properties they were on would have achieved a far better outcome.

As with anything, if a State body expresses an interest in acquiring a site we do our best to facilitate it, and it acquires it at whatever the independent market value is.

Today the committee will engage with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss pre-budget 2022 scrutiny.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and other attendees.  They should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for the full co-operation of members in this.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, Mr. Ronnie Downes, assistant secretary, and Mr. John Kinnane, principal officer.  I am aware the witnesses have probably heard the notice on privilege many times but I must go through it again.  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  If witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  They are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks by the Chair.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#A00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee today as part of its pre-budget 2022 scrutiny process.<\/p> <p>  Detailed work is ongoing in my Department to finalise the expenditure Estimates for budget 2022.  Similar to the approach adopted last year, the upcoming budget will be framed in the context of continued sustainable increases in core public expenditure, with a focus on significant increases in capital investment and the provision of exceptional additional funding for temporary supports to address the impact of Covid-19 and Brexit.  Since the onset of the pandemic, the Government has provided significant supports with direct expenditure measures to support incomes and employment and to fund key public services.  When the measures announced in the economic recovery plan are taken into account, it is expected that &euro;15 billion in direct expenditure supports will be provided in 2021, bringing to some &euro;31 billion the amount made available across 2020 and 2021.  This level of support, which has been essential in ensuring public services can respond to the challenges of the pandemic and in supporting people's incomes and businesses, has understandably had a major impact on the public finances.  Despite this, I believe it was the right approach from the Government.  However, we have been able to manage this shock due to the relatively strong position of the public finances before the pandemic and the co-ordinated approach at EU level in responding to the crisis.<\/p> <p>  As the public health situation improves and the economy reopens, we must start on the road to returning the public finances to a more sustainable position and the debt-income ratio must be put on a downward trajectory.  Withdrawing the temporary supports put in place, as they are no longer required, is essential to this.  However, we have been clear that this will be achieved in a carefully phased manner so as not to disrupt the ongoing recovery.<\/p> <p>  The summer economic statement, SES, set out the medium-term strategy inclusive of spending levels to 2025, and budget 2022 is being prepared in line with this strategy.  This will see core expenditure grow by an annual average of just over 5% over the period to 2025, a level of increase broadly in line with the economy's estimated trend growth rate.  The average annual growth rate in current expenditure is projected to be just under 4.75% over this period, with total capital spending growing by an annual average of more than 8.5%.  The increases in capital investment in the period to 2025 build on the increases in recent years.  Indeed, over the coming period, we will continue to support the recovery in the economy, including through record levels of investment in the capital programme.  This will see total capital spending as a percentage of national income, as measured by GNI*, increase to roughly 5% in 2025.  This level of investment reflects the Government's commitment to deliver on our key infrastructural priorities.  The revised national development plan, NDP, is currently being finalised and it will set out annual expenditure ceilings for the initial five years for each ministerial Vote group, in line with the parameters set out in the SES.<\/p> <p>  The planned increases in core spending over the period to 2025 will see overall core spending grow from just over &euro;70 billion in 2020 to almost &euro;93 billion in 2025.  This significant level of expenditure on services and investment in infrastructure requires that there is a continued focus on ensuring this spending delivers value for money and improved outcomes and that we ensure there is the capacity to deliver this significant level of investment.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the upcoming budget, this is being prepared in line with the expenditure parameters set out in the SES.  This will see total voted spending of up to &euro;88.2 billion in 2022.  Of this, &euro;80.1 billion will be for core expenditure, while up to &euro;8.1 billion will be available for non-core, temporary supports to address the specific challenges of Covid-19 and Brexit.  In line with the strategy adopted in budget 2021, this core and non-core spending will be dealt with separately, with allocations for temporary measures clearly outlined in the expenditure report.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant increase of &euro;4.2 billion in core spending for 2022, an increase of 5.5% over the 2021 core amount.  Some &euro;3.1 billion of this will fund increased current spending next year, bringing overall core current spending to &euro;69.2 billion.  Within this additional funding, &euro;2.1 billion is estimated to be required to fund existing level of services, ELS, costs, including for demographics, the public service pay deal and the carry-over of current year measures.  My Department is working through the detail to finalise the exact ELS requirement, taking into account the expenditure position at the end of September.  The remaining balance, currently estimated at &euro;1 billion, will be available to fund new spending priorities next year.<\/p> <p>  The review of the NDP was brought forward under the programme for Government and the phase 2 report on this is being finalised.  It is our intention to publish the review of the NDP on Monday of next week.  This will set out revised sectoral capital allocations as well as providing a renewed focus on delivery of efficient and cost-effective public infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  An increase of &euro;1.1 billion over the 2021 core capital allocation will see core capital spending rise by almost 12%, bringing capital investment, including spending on the national recovery and resilience plan, to more than &euro;11 billion next year.  This follows significant increases in capital spending in recent years.  By way of comparison, in 2018, the first year of the current NDP, Exchequer capital investment amounted to just under &euro;6 billion.  These sustained increases reflect the priority given to addressing key infrastructure requirements, including for climate action, housing, balanced regional development and healthcare.<\/p> <p>  On non-recurring temporary supports, this allocation is targeted at addressing the specific challenges of Covid-19, with up to &euro;7 billion available to fund relevant measures, including under the national recovery and resilience plan, with some of this amount to be held back in a contingency reserve to allow the Government to respond to the situation with the virus next year.<\/p><p>This funding will allow for the phased withdrawal of supports, additional expenditure on income supports as the labour market continues to recover, and spending on necessary public health measures required for the delivery of public services in a Covid environment.  Decisions on specific measures to be covered by this funding and allocations to Departments will be made as part of the Estimates process.  As in 2021, it is intended that all expenditure allocations related to Covid-19 will be separately identified in the expenditure report to ensure transparency.  In addition, &euro;1.1 billion of non-core funding relates to Ireland&rsquo;s funding allocation under the EU&rsquo;s Brexit adjustment reserve, BAR, for measures to address the negative impacts of Brexit.  This funding will be allocated across budget 2022 and budget 2023 to support employment, businesses and local communities negatively affected by Brexit, including those in the fishing industry.<\/p><p> Budget 2022 is being framed within a complex setting.  In light of this, I will seek to put together an expenditure settlement for next year that will support an effective response as we seek to deliver on our key social, economic, and environmental priorities, while also responding to the challenge of Covid-19 and the ongoing challenge of Brexit.  Accordingly, significant resources will be available next year to support our people and our key public services in recovering from the impacts of Covid-19.  In addition, we will also seek to ensure we continue to deliver meaningful improvements in key priorities in our core expenditure programmes.  Building on budget 2021, adopting this approach will enable us to continue to provide incremental improvements in the delivery of core public services across Government within a framework that supports medium-term fiscal sustainability.<\/p><p> I look forward to Members&rsquo; questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#A00300","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":219,"content":"<p>As a former member of this committee, the Minister knows its work very well.

It is good to be back before the committee and it is doing excellent work, as always.  On the recognition issue, the Government has on several occasions said we believe some recognition is appropriate and warranted in respect of the extraordinary efforts of so many people across society while we have been living with Covid-19 during the past 18 months.  At the very front line of all that are our healthcare workers.  The Government has acknowledged that aspect.  It is important we approach this in a considered and careful way.  Many people across society, in our health service certainly but also in other front-line public services, went above and beyond while doing their jobs during the past 18 months.  Many of those people took considerable personal risk to protect the rest of us.  The Irish people, and those on the front line specifically, have been nothing short of extraordinary during that time.<\/p> <p>  In addition, we all have a renewed sense of appreciation for the roles played by so many people in different parts of the private sector.  I refer to people who are cleaners and those who collect our refuse, for example, as well as those who work in our retail, tourism and hospitality sectors.  All those people took risks and went out on the front line in challenging and difficult circumstances.  I raised this issue yesterday in a pre-budget meeting with representatives from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  I asked for their views, and they agreed with my assessment that what we need on this issue is a collaborative approach.  Therefore, we will consult the social partners in depth to devise an agreed way forward that will allow us to deliver an appropriate form of recognition and that acknowledges and commemorates the fact that more than 5,000 died from Covid-19 in Ireland.  We must do that in a way that also expresses gratitude to all those on the front line.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious, as I said last week, that solidarity has been the hallmark of our approach to Covid-19.  As we exit the worst of the pandemic, we hope, it is important we maintain that social solidarity while at the same time finding a way to provide some special recognition of all those who have gone above and beyond in the course of their work.  There is an industrial relations context here, as the members will be aware.  Claims were lodged by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and other unions representing healthcare workers.  Those claims have made their way through the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court issued a recommendation last week.  Its essence was to request the Government to engage intensively and to bring forward a proposal in the coming weeks.  That process is under way and we will bring this issue to a conclusion in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#B00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I do not have anything else to ask on that matter.

That amount comes on top of &euro;15 billion to &euro;16 billion in expenditure last year as well.  In total, across last year and this year, expenditure in this regard has exceeded &euro;30 billion.  The expenditure of &euro;15 billion this year, however, will reduce significantly next year as the economy recovers and as all sections of our economy will now be allowed to reopen fully and to trade in as normal a way as possible.  Significant improvements are being seen in the number of people on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, for example.  Some 106,000 now receive the payment compared with a peak of 602,000 people.<\/p> <p>  The intention is that the &euro;15 billion being spent this year will transition to a figure of approximately half that figure next year.  There will then be around &euro;7 billion of direct, Covid-19-related, expenditure.  We have constructed that expenditure in a way that enables us to have a contingency fund.  As next year progresses, therefore, and as we continue to have to live with the virus and perhaps also to deal with other unpredictable events, contingency funds will be in place to enable us to respond as circumstances unfold.  Of that envisaged &euro;7 billion, some will be allocated directly to Votes and the budgets of Departments, particularly in healthcare.  Costs related to Covid-19 will continue to occur in healthcare, such as in test and trace, vaccination etc.  Similarly, Covid-19-related spending will also continue to be required in education to protect our staff, pupils and students and in other sections of Government and across the public services.<\/p> <p>  That is how we intend to structure spending.  We will allocate a certain amount, which could be up to &euro;2.5 billion, and there will also be a significant contingency reserve.  Built into that will be a buffer that will consider employment performance.  As members will be aware, the level of unemployment forecast across next year is just over 8%.  It could work out better than that, which we sincerely hope it will, or it could end up being worse.  Therefore, we must have sufficient headroom to be able to respond as circumstances unfold.  On budget day, we will be announcing more specific changes to vital schemes, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  It has been extended for another month, as the committee will be aware, at the current rates and with no changes.

It is fair to acknowledge that the recovery will not be even across all sectors.  It will be gradual in several sectors.  We are seeing an example of that in the aviation industry and with all the main airports.  Even international assessments conclude that the recovery of the aviation sector will be gradual.  There is, of course, an unknown factor as well in the form of changed work practices and the move to blended working.  We might wonder, for example, if we will see less international business travel in future.  Uncertainties exist, therefore.  Aviation is an example of a sector where there will be a recovery, but it will not reach 100% in the coming year.<\/p><p>Therefore, there are uncertainties there.  That is one sector where there will be a recovery but it will not be 100% in the coming year.  In addition, we anticipate that the recovery in the night-time sector, in arts and entertainment, will be gradual and we need to take account of that in the Covid-related supports we provide.<\/p><p> I can give assurance that the additional funding that was provided in some sectors last year will be considered in the context of this budget.  There will be a continuation of some, but not all, additional funding next year for Covid-related measures for sectors that we believe will need extra assistance to help them in their journey to recovery.  However, 106,000 people, who were in work in March 2020, are still out of work because of the pandemic.  It is a top priority for the Government to help them in their journey back to employment.<\/p><p> We need to be honest and acknowledge that it may not necessarily be back to the same job or to the same sector.  Some changes have been accelerated over the past 18 months of living with Covid-19.  However, the Pathways to Work programme, which is fully funded, involves thousands of additional training places, work experience placements and educational placements.  All those will be rolled out by the relevant bodies through the Intreo offices, SOLAS, and the further and higher education sector.  The Ministers, Deputies Harris and Humphreys, are implementing that Pathways to Work programme, which is designed to help people in their journey back to work.  Certain sectors have many job vacancies.  We need to match people's skills with vacancies and the new opportunities that are undoubtedly opening up across the economy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#B00700","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I thank an Aire for that.

It will come as no surprise to the Deputy that fishing communities and the fishery sector will be a significant beneficiary because they have been at the coalface of Brexit and have borne the brunt of it in many respects.  While some of the impacts of Brexit have not fully hit the agrifood sector yet because of postponement of the implementation of different aspects of the new regime, there is a Brexit impact and there will likely be a further Brexit impact, which will be taken into account.  In addition, certain sectors across the enterprise economy will also benefit.<\/p> <p>  We need to demonstrate a direct link between how we allocate the funding and the negative impact of Brexit.  That work is ongoing in my Department.  I do not anticipate we will be allocating in granular detail the full &euro;1.165 billion on budget day, but I anticipate that we will give a very clear statement as to where the funding will be going in overall terms.  I would be happy to provide any additional information we can.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#C00500","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>That is brilliant.

It took a lot of courage and commitment to do so.  The Government responded bravely and I compliment it on that.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask a couple of questions.  One of the things our friend, the late Professor John Kenneth Galbraith, used to warn about was inflation in the wake of inducements, incentives or assistance in any case.  This was necessary assistance but it could have the same impact.  We see signs of inflation.  Some of it may be associated with Covid but some of it may have a life of its own. Can the Minister indicate whether any particular specific remedies come to mind, other than a short sharp cut, which would have a negative effect on the economy.  Of the two options available, how is it proposed to protect the economy, encourage the recovery from Covid and at the same time try to ensure that we do not contribute to further inflation in the measures to be taken?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#D00600","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan for his question.  We are seeing an increase in inflation.  I believe the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, put it at 2.8% in the period to August of this year.  In a sense, it was an inevitability in the immediate rebound coming out of Covid and the burst of economic activity that we have experienced on foot of the pent-up demand, as many sectors and services were either impaired or fully shut down over the period of Covid.  We are now seeing the outcome of all of that play out.<\/p> <p>  There is also a range of international factors.  We are all witnessing the increases in electricity prices and in fuel costs generally.  We acknowledge as a Government that this places an obligation on us to take account of that and to respond in the context of the budget, and that is what we will do.<\/p> <p>  We also acknowledge the comments made by the European Central Bank and its monitoring of inflation across the eurozone.  In broad terms, it is fair to say that it believes the current trend is a temporary one.  The European Central Bank is monitoring very closely what it regards as the underlying inflation trend across the eurozone because, of course, we have benefited very significantly from the bond purchase programme.<\/p> <p>  The exceptional interventions of the European Central Bank in the markets have helped to keep borrowing costs low for Ireland over the past 18 months or so.  Undoubtedly, that is what has helped us to fund the additional spending on services and on income support for households, businesses, etc.  We equally acknowledge that this will not continue forever.  The European Central Bank will keep a very close eye on inflationary pressures across the eurozone and will stand ready over the course of next year to adjust its policies accordingly.<\/p> <p>  From our perspective, we see recovery taking hold in Ireland over the period ahead through a number of means.  We will have a really ambitious public capital investment programme and will be spending approximately &euro;11 billion next year on that capital programme, in health, in education, in housing, in transport and in climate action measures to name but a few.  We will spend up to &euro;50 billion of direct Exchequer capital over the next four years, from 2022 to 2025.<\/p> <p>  There is, of course, risk in the way in which we will taper off and gradually unwind the Covid supports.  There may well be businesses that are surviving by virtue of those supports.  The removal of those supports over time may well raise fundamental questions for some of those businesses but that day will have to be faced at some point in time because these supports cannot continue indefinitely.<\/p> <p>  Overall, we recognise that there is a strong rebound under way.  We anticipate that this will transition to a strong recovery.  The fiscal advisory council has, I understand, endorsed the latest economic forecasts that have been made by the Department of Finance and those will be published imminently.  There are strong grounds for optimism that both in terms of foreign direct investment and in the domestic economy, the recovery is sustainable.  We face challenges for sure, but the Government is determined to work its way through them and to help the recovery through its investment and through its supports and by not prematurely or abruptly ending the supports that are such a vital lifeline for so many businesses around the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#D00700","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

That is absolutely correct.  That is a key part of the strategy for the public finances that we brought forward in the summer economic statement.  As the Deputy will be aware, our intention is that, by 2023, we will only be borrowing for the public capital investment programme.  In fact, some of the public capital investment programme will be funded by revenues that the State is collecting.  We believe that by managing the public finances in this way and by having an investment-led approach to securing recovery, we can help the Irish economy in its different sectors to recover and reduce the deficit gradually over time.  For example, we anticipate that, by 2023, the deficit will be less than 2% of GDP.  For us, that is very significant progress.<\/p> <p>  We are looking at the overall trends in terms of foreign direct investment.  The pipeline is healthy.

That is a really good question.  In general terms, the real relevance of the measure of national debt is debt expressed as a percentage of national income.  For Ireland, we have two key measures of debt, the first being as a percentage of GDP and the second being as a percentage of GNI*.  Of course, the debt looks a lot more healthy as a percentage of GDP than it does as a percentage of GNI*.  However, we need to get it on a downward trajectory.  We believe that we will do that, primarily through growth in the Irish economy.  I refer to all of the international forecasts that we are working to, from the OECD and the European Commission, which are complemented by domestic forecasts.<\/p><p>They point to a level of confidence that Ireland as a small open trading economy, which is well positioned to benefit from a recovery in the international economy, will see continued growth over the coming years.  It makes it all the more important that in the coming years, we stop adding to the national debt.  It will hit &euro;250 billion next year.  By 2025 it will hit &euro;280 billion.  Coming into Covid it was approximately &euro;200 billion.  This will represent an &euro;80 billion increase in the national debt over the course of a five-year period.  This is a reality we cannot escape.  This is why our plan on the public finances is to close the budget deficit in order that we stop adding to the national debt and then that we grow the economy over the next number of years so the debt relative to the size of the economy shrinks.  These are the twin strategies we have to pursue to make sure our debt is sustainable in the medium and long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#D01300","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":246,"content":"<p>On the reward for essential and front-line workers and for people generally who sacrificed during Covid, I very much welcome this conversation.  It has become controversial.  It may be somewhat difficult for the Minister but it is very good that we are having a difficult and controversial conversation.  Many people went unacknowledged and unrecognised for a long time as to the importance of the work they did to keep our society going.  Generally, the right approach in terms of the immediate recompense is the engagement with the various groups that the Minister is now speaking about.  Obviously, there are different groups of workers, whether they be front-line health workers, most importantly, but also public transport workers, local authority workers, retail workers and carers.  They all had different experiences, played different roles and had different difficulties and challenges.  We need to talk to them.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example in which I was particularly involved which demonstrates something about how we need to listen to people on the ground.  This is the case of Dublin Bus workers.  After all they did for us during Covid, a proposal was put by the NTA and the company that would fundamentally attack their conditions of employment and lead them to work much longer hours.  Somebody dreamt up a plan for how to reconfigure Dublin Bus services which in the process would destroy the quality of life of the drivers.  They give a resounding \"No\" to that.  This is an example of how we have to listen to workers on the ground to see what their experiences are.<\/p> <p>  Beyond the immediate reward, what many people out there are looking for, whether they were on the front line or just sacrificed terribly because they could not work, is longer-term recognition of their importance, which has sometimes been undervalued.  The arts and music sector is an obvious area.  There are many others.  In many cases our supermarket workers are chronically low paid.  They suffer precarity and the issue of low pay more generally.  I would be interested to see whether these types of recognition are part of the longer-term lessons we learned, as well as the short term.<\/p> <p>  I would add to the Minister's consideration that some people who were under-recognised did a huge amount for us and sacrificed a lot for us and lost out in one shape or form during the pandemic.  Others did very well.  Some sectors of our economy saw profits go through the roof.  I wonder in the context of the budget should there not be serious consideration given, as some countries have done, to a Covid solidarity tax on those who did very well.  I ask the Minister to comment on this.<\/p> <p>  On the health service, perhaps the Minister could be a bit more specific about the lessons he has learned on the increased areas of expenditure he is considering.  We know our ICU levels were some of the worst as a proportion of population in Europe entering Covid.  Will we rectify this and get to the previously recommended levels?  At least we should get up to the EU average.  So we do not just respond in an emergency way and are desperately clambering, will we get our public health teams up to the levels they should be at so there are permanent increases in capacity?  All of these were recommended pre-Covid but in some cases we learned to our cost what the cost can be if we do not have the capacity when we hit an emergency.  Perhaps the Minister will say a little bit more about what the permanent areas of increased expenditure to deliver increased capacity in health will be.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister to clarify some matters on housing.  The figure of &euro;4 billion per annum over the course of Housing for All is being bandied around.  Is this direct Exchequer funding?  Can we have a little bit more detail on what this &euro;4 billion is and where it is coming from?  Is it &euro;4 billion additional or is it &euro;4 billion in total to the Department?  What I want to know is how much of it is directly going into the direct construction by local authorities and approved housing bodies of new public and affordable housing.  How much of it will continue in the rental accommodation scheme, the housing assistance payment, leasing or other expenditure that is not about directly delivering housing?  Perhaps the Minister will say a few words about that.<\/p> <p>  A lot of borrowing is being done.  It was justified to borrow to meet the challenges we faced.  There is a danger in borrowing because it has to be paid back.  We have always argued, as the Minister knows, that we should think more about taxing increased contributions in the area of profits, financial transactions and employers' PRSI in order that we increase our revenue but not at the expense of ordinary working people who suffered so much during this period.  Has the Minister drawn conclusions about needing to rebalance our tax system in this way, and making corporations, the very wealthy and financial services pay a bigger contribution in tax rather than having to rely on very high levels of borrowing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#E00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett.  There is much to cover there and I will be as brief as I can but as helpful as I possibly can.  The Deputy is right to point out that in coming to an appropriate answer on the question of recognition it is not about the Government having a conversation with itself.  We do not have all the wisdom on this issue.  Our country's approach to Covid was characterised by a collective effort and incredible solidarity by and large throughout the country.  This is a complex and difficult issue.  We recognise there is a need for special recognition to be given for the efforts of so many people.  No one could dispute that front-line healthcare workers are at the very top of that tree in terms of the exposure and work they did.  Others did an awful lot too and went above and beyond.  It is challenging and complex.  We need to come up with an answer and we will do this in a collaborative way.  We have a Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, process.  It is a very suitable forum for us to discuss the issue in an open and honest way with trade union representatives and employer bodies.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy touched on carers.  This is the point I made last week.  Many carers had to carry an enormous burden over the course of the pandemic when disability services stopped and were shut down overnight on public health grounds.  Carers had to provide 24-7 care.  Many of them will point out they do this in normal times anyway but a far greater number of them had to carry this.  How do we compensate and acknowledge their efforts?<\/p><p>It is impossible.  We cannot put a value on it, and that is the truth.  The long-term legacy is better public services generally, and that is certainly something I and my party strongly believe in.<\/p><p> On the issue of working conditions and the issue of having a genuine appreciation for the role of people in society on whom we really rely, I believe we understood that in a very clear way over the course of the 18 months.  The Deputy mentioned a number of those sectors.  That whole agenda is one the Government is committed to, and we will make progress in regard to low pay, working conditions generally and providing as much support and opportunity as possible for people.<\/p><p> In regard to health, the additional spending, both last year and into the future, is first and foremost to build up the permanent capacity of the public health service.  Last year, for example, the funding we provided was sufficient to increase the number of acute beds in our hospital system by more than 1,100 in a single year, which was a very significant step.  It will not be fully met in delivery but it will be largely met, and the outturn will go a long way towards that.  The funding that was provided for that last year will be considered as part of the Estimates process.  If they were not able to spend it this year, the intention would be to allow them to keep that funding so they can implement fully next year those reforms we would have discussed and agreed last year.<\/p><p> Beds is one issue and the Deputy mentioned critical care capacity.  That has to be a learning from Covid, if we are to be honest with ourselves.  We did withstand the Covid challenge and the Covid surge, but at a price.  No country can take the risk of its public health service being overwhelmed because of capacity issues.  The Government is committed to dealing with the capacity issue in acute bed care and critical care capacity over the period ahead.  I think we have made very good progress, even in the midst of a global pandemic.<\/p><p> In regard to housing, the specific allocation from the Exchequer to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will be confirmed on Monday when we publish the new national development plan out to 2030.  It is important to acknowledge that housing will be getting very significant increases, which will underpin the delivery of the Housing for All programme.  The figure the Deputy mentioned of &euro;4 billion does involve some non-direct Exchequer funding, for example, through the Land Development Agency, but it is public in the broad sense of the word, and it is going towards building homes - social homes, affordable homes and cost rental homes.  I think it is fair to put that figure in the total public investment by the State in meeting the challenge of Housing for All.  The direct Exchequer element of that public contribution will be set out when we publish the national development plan on Monday.  It will represent a very large increase in capital spending for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage over the next number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#E00300","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister sincerely for his excellent presentation.  One of the biggest and most topical financial issues for many workers these days is the issue the Minister touched on and which we will call the recognition of the work done by certain workers in certain sectors of society during the pandemic crisis.  I would be acutely aware of the fact we do not have a blank cheque for this.  It is not a matter where we can do whatever we like or give whatever people want.  I have heard people from the left standing up in the D&aacute;il and, to be blunt about it, saying things that sound great to the public and that sound marvellous.  At the end of the day, however, I live in the real world of economics where it is like a business.  It has to make money, it has to be able to pay its debts and we have to be able to look after sick and vulnerable people, which is absolutely right.  We want to recognise work but we have to do so in a prudent way that the State can afford.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister personally for the effort that he and the other Ministers made during the pandemic.  I know for a fact there are businesses open today that would not have been able to stay open only for the supports they received during the crisis.  Any politician who would not thank the Minister personally for that or recognise that work would not be doing his or her job properly, in my opinion.  Yes, I will be the first person to admit that an awful lot of businesses are struggling post pandemic and coming out of it, and I am sorry to say some will not survive.  All I am saying is, only for the efforts of the Minister and others, an awful lot more would have fallen by the wayside.  We have to try to evolve as an economy and try to get ourselves up and running slowly, safely and surely, and it will take great guidance and prudence to do so.<\/p> <p>  Dealing with the whole issue, it is like when a person sets out in a well-meaning way to do something good and it sort of backfires in his or her face.  That is the feeling I get with the Government and the issue of recognising the work.  No matter what the Government does now, it is going to be 100% wrong.  The Government is going to be wrong-sided on this because it is not going to do enough for enough people and, therefore, it is going to be wrong, no matter what it does.  What I want to see the Government do is this.  Obviously, people working in healthcare put themselves and their families at risk, and we all know 100% that has to be recognised.  All I would say to the Government is to try to take everything on board, be balanced and reasonable, and not keep people waiting forever.  It is so much in the public domain now that people are expecting the Government to make an announcement in the budget with regard to recognising that, and I would like to see that happen so we can move on from it.  Whatever it is going to be, it should be done in the fairest way it can be, but in such a way that we will not be waiting until Christmas for it.<\/p> <p>  Financially, we are at a juncture in our economic cycle and we really have to recognise work.  We have to recognise the contribution of employers.  We have to look at people who stand up and speak about employers as if they are an awful type of person.  We actually have people in the D&aacute;il who, when they mention the word &ldquo;employers&rdquo;, it is like people talking about developers or builders.  Over recent days, I met a builder, a very sound man, and I said this on the record of the D&aacute;il yesterday.  The reason I did this was because I believe an awful lot of politicians today, if they met a developer or a builder, would nearly be ashamed to say it because it is as though, \"Oh my God, I should not be meeting with this person.\"  It is the exact opposite.  I think every person in the D&aacute;il should be meeting with developers, builders and people who are in a position, in their minds and in their ability, to turn around and provide us with housing.<\/p> <p>  The reason I met this man is because he is a sound man who is a builder in Kerry for many years.  The one thing he was talking to me about, which is something I am very interested in, is the provision of one-bed accommodations.  He was talking about our main town in County Kerry and he said he has the ability to build many houses - accommodations, we will call them - and one-beds in particular, because I told him that is what we need.  I told him I am continually raising it with the Government.  What I would like to see him do is build them at an affordable rate and then the voluntary housing agencies, the local authority and all those types of groups would be able to purchase them at affordable money.  That man, and more luck to him, would make a profit and his company would make a profit, and he would then be able move on to the next job.<\/p> <p>  My goodness, is that not what we want?  I hear politicians standing up in the D&aacute;il to talk about these types of people profiteering from the housing sector and all of this type of rubbish.  That is why we have a housing crisis.  It is because we are not encouraging that type of work and we are not encouraging that type of person to carry on with their building companies.  We have lost many good builders over the years and they would not go near it now because they hear themselves and their industry being ridiculed continually in the D&aacute;il by people who never did a day's work in their lives themselves.  It is about time they were told that.  They are very lucky they are in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann because, if they were not in the D&aacute;il, they would not manage to make a living driving a digger, with a shovel or mixing cement, or trying to buy a field or borrow money from the bank, because they would not have the ability.<\/p><p>They would be put out of the bank if they were seen going in because they are not wanted there.  We need more of those types of people in Ireland to help resolve our housing crisis.  I would love to see a queue of Deputies coming into the House on a Tuesday morning saying they had met a developer in their area, a building contractor or a landowner who wants land to be zoned because he wants to sell it for a profit in order that houses can be built on it.<\/p><p> The State will not be able to do it itself.  I am not condemning the Government or its two predecessors.  History will tell us that governments are not able to provide all the housing that is needed.  The private sector is needed and we need those people who have the ability to borrow money, buy land, get it zoned, build houses and make them available at an affordable price.  As I said, there seems to be an awful mentality now as though builders have leprosy and people have to run away from them because they do not want to be seen with them; if people had their picture taken with a developer, they should nearly hang their in shame.  That type of nonsense has to stop.<\/p><p> I would love a Government to come out and say it wants to encourage these people to be involved and to say it wants the employers who create one or two jobs for themselves, their family or their neighbours, because they are the backbone of Ireland.  It is like the farmers who create work for themselves on their farm, and perhaps when they have jobs to be done, they hire their neighbours. There are Deputies who are lucky they are politicians because they would not want to try to do anything else.  It is as though they have a hatred for work.  I recall hearing one day that on one of the largest construction projects in Ireland, three people had been infected with Covid, and a politician stood up and said the 5,000 or 6,000 other people should all be sent home indefinitely and given &euro;350 a week to stay at home.  He wanted to shut down the job because three people had got the virus.  The reason he did was he thought they would be better off at home twiddling their thumbs than working.<\/p><p> We have to bring a strong worth ethic back to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and not listen to the fellas with their backsides coming out through their trousers who do not know the first thing in the world about work.  They could not create a job for themselves or anyone else.  We need to get down to brass tacks and start supporting that type of an economy.  I call on the Minister, the Minister for Finance and the wider Government to really encourage work-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#F00300","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I am afraid the Deputy is out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#G00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Perhaps it is as well that I am.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#G00300","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Would the Minister like to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#G00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I will, briefly.  It will be difficult to respond because that was a comprehensive <i>tour de force<\/i>by the Deputy, although I thank him for his comments.  I acknowledge what he said about the recognition issue.  We will seek to deal with that as quickly as possible but I do not envisage it will be a budget day issue.  We need proper engagement with trade unions and employer bodies to come up with a considered response to this issue.  Otherwise, we run the risk of significant divisions in society on the back of it.  I look at the email traffic coming into my consistency office, as I am sure the Deputy too does every day, and many people are expressing a view on this issue.  It is fair to say there is not a consensus but rather a wide set of views on the matter.  That is not a reason to address it, which we will do, but we need to give it careful consideration.<\/p><p>I worked in the private sector and I think I have a good understanding of how our economy and our society work.  When I listen to all the demands in the House every day for additional public spending, I know those demands can only be met, in part, if we generate the revenues in our economy to pay for them.  We are dependent on taxation revenues being generated by a strong, enterprise-based economy.  That is what gives us the funding to have good public services and a decent society underpinned by those services.  I understand that and it is why I have no hesitation in engaging directly with employers, for whom I have great respect.  The sacrifices many of them make are extraordinary.  They take very significant risks, in many instances putting their personal home on the line, as the Deputy well knows, in order to take on debt to invest in their business and not all the businesses work.  Many of them fail and people are left with major legacy issues as a result.  I have tried to help people in all sorts of circumstances where they gave it a go.  We should encourage people to give it a go.  We want an entrepreneurial culture in Ireland and I think we have one.  We just need to ensure the State does not get in the way but is there to help people and support them.  That is the perspective I bring to being in government.<\/p><p>My Department works closely with the construction industry.  We have a construction sector group, for example, which meets regularly and involves officials in my Department and also those representing the industry and the professions.  It is about listening to them and coming up with solutions.  I have never built a house, so I of course listen to people who have built houses and know what the issues are in getting that work done.  We in the D&aacute;il are not going to build any houses; we will build them by providing support to local authorities and approved housing bodies and by providing support to, and enabling infrastructure for, the private sector.  There is much talk about building houses but very little talk about putting in place the water, the wastewater infrastructure and the other services needed to build homes.  That is an important aspect.<\/p><p>The Deputy raised a fundamental question about getting more people with direct private sector experience into politics.  There are some but more are needed, as is more mobility into and out of politics.  We need people to come into politics with life experience and a full career behind them of getting things done in the private sector and who are willing to offer themselves in the interests of public service.  I want to see more of that rather than less, and that is a challenge for all of us.  Perhaps it is about the way we do politics and the challenges involved in being in public life now that some people simply would not tolerate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#G00500","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his time.  As a politician who worked in construction for more than 30 years, I have a good idea of how to build a house and how to work in construction.  To return to the point about investment in housing, many young people nowadays cannot afford to buy or build a house because the standards and conditions under which people now have to build them have gone beyond affordability.  We are investing large sums in housing, whether in the form of housing delivered socially or through the affordable housing schemes, and I recognise the idea is to try to have housing for all.  There are some fundamentals, however, that are not correct, and when we are spending all this money, little details get lost.  One such detail I come across all the time relates to county development plans or local area plans.  We zone lands for residential purposes without knowing whether it will ever become available in the lifetime of the plan because we do it as a desktop exercise.  We zone land-locked land for residential use.  We zone lands that can never be sold, for a plethora of reasons beyond anybody's control.  We do not compulsory purchase order, CPO, lands we zone, and I do not think we should.  More due diligence needs to be carried out in forward planning to ensure that whatever areas we zone are available.  Otherwise, we are just creating a scarce resource, that is, land ready for development.<\/p> <p>  This issue has not been tackled.  I have spoken to the Planning Regulator and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage about it.  It needs to be cracked on with.  If we are zoning land and saying houses should be built in a certain area, the first question should be whether they can be built there.<\/p><p>There is another issue around housing.  The national development plan is going to be published on Monday.  It is going to involve large figures, billions of euro of taxpayers' money and money we have borrowed, to try to provide housing and all the other infrastructure we require and want.  The big risk is that public works contracts are cumbersome to deliver.  We can spend seven, eight or nine years without getting a digger on site or getting a builder in.  The planning processes and approvals can take that length of time.  Money will be announced in the budget but I believe we should be cherry-picking projects that are shovel-ready.  That should be an immediate target for every local authority and public sector body, including the Office of Public Works.  Those bodies should pick out projects that are ready to go because what is happening is that we make announcements and do not see anything happening on the ground for five, six or seven years.  We have seen that is the case with flood relief schemes and all of those types of things.<\/p><p> Youth employment is a big issue.  How do we get the youth back into work?  How do we make work pay?  That is another area of expenditure where we must create a difference between not working and working through the benefits that accrue to working. <\/p><p> Deputy Michael Healy-Rae was talking about building contractors.  We have an amount of public sector works to which builders have signed up in the past five, six, seven or eight months.  The contracts were based and priced on a particular set of circumstances that have now completely changed.  People have entered into contracts and have found, before they go far into the project, that it is going to cost a hell of a lot more.  The contracts at the moment are fixed price, with no price variation for increases in the cost of labour or materials.  If we expect builders and contractors, as distinct from developers, to remain in business, we must tackle this issue head on.  The Office of Public Procurement must deal with this issue as a matter of urgency.  Many projects are at risk of closing down because people cannot afford to build them because of the increases and inflation that is there.  We need to deal with that urgently and I would like to hear the Minister's comments in that respect.<\/p><p> Moving to infrastructure, the Minister mentioned the servicing of sites, water and wastewater.  Irish Water is totally underfunded.  It has been constantly fire-fighting since it was brought into being.  It is dealing with risk and trying to solve the risk of pollution and whatever else.  There are many towns and villages across the country that do not have wastewater treatment.  Houses cannot be built in those places even though they may be growth centres for the main cities.  That infrastructure is just not there and there does not seem to be any plan for when the provision of that infrastructure might happen.  I know there is talk about funding becoming available under such a scheme.  If Irish Water is to do its job properly, it needs to be funded properly in order to carry out all the remedial works that are required, as well as other works that need to be progressed if we are to build houses.  I ask the Minister for his comments on what I have said and, if I have a minute or two at the end, I will come in again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#G00600","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments and questions.  His experience of working in construction comes through in the nature of his questions and the contributions he makes in the Oireachtas, and I acknowledge that.  Of course, when local authorities zone land for residential development, the whole purpose is for those sites to actually be developed.  There is little point in zoning new lands for development if there is little prospect of them actually coming to the market and being built upon.  I accept the Deputy's point on the need for proper due diligence because zoning additional land for the sake of it serves no purpose.  It may, in fact, serve to deny the possibility of zoning another site with some prospect of being delivered to the market.  There are constraints within the national planning framework.  The Planning Regulator will take account of the amount of zoned land in each area so there is little point in having land zoned that is not going to be brought to the market for construction or developed.  Councils have the power to dezone land.  That is one of the functions that remains with the elected members and it is one that I know some councils implement.  It is an important tool for them.  As the Deputy knows, there is provision within the Housing for All strategy for the taxation of zoned land that is not being used.  That is an issue on which the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage are currently working.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely acknowledge the pressures that are there at the moment for first-time buyers and others who are looking to buy their own homes.  I remember, as a young lad growing up, we lived in a local authority house and there was a great scheme at that time in the 1980s whereby if a family was in a position to relinquish the house back to the local authority, there was a &pound;5,000 grant.  My parents bought a small, old cottage in a rural area near to where we were living and moved there.  It was a fantastic home.  That is a great example of the type of innovation and the type of scheme that we need to support people as they seek to own their own homes or secure rental accommodation from a local authority or an approved housing body.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the planning system.  As he knows, there is a major body of work under way in the Office of the Attorney General, for which the Cabinet gave formal approval on Tuesday, which involves essentially rewriting the whole planning code.  That will, I believe, significantly reduce the legal risks that are currently resulting in many successful judicial reviews of essential infrastructure projects.  People have a right to object and to go to court and seek judicial review.  However, we should have confidence that where a project has come through a comprehensive planning system, it will be upheld and that the planning system is robust and sufficient rigour has been applied to the application.  I believe we will secure progress on that issue through the work that is under way in the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised issues around procurement and I am very much alive to them.  They are presenting during live tenders at the moment and we have certainly seen instances where the sponsoring body, the public body, has had to go to the second, third or fourth lowest bidder in order to successfully place a contract.  That is because of the inflation in costs that has arisen since the tender was submitted by the contractor.  That issue and the issue of the public works contracts and the price variation provisions there, whereby there can be no variation, as the Deputy knows, for the first 30 months, are presenting a challenge.  I have met with officials in the Office of Government Procurement and we have gone through the issue in detail.  Those officials are currently examining the matter and I have asked them to come back to me with some options as a matter of urgency.  I expect them to come back to me shortly with some proposals on those issues.  <\/p> <p>  I do, at the same time, acknowledge that we have a role in protecting the interests of taxpayers.  We must ensure that public money is well spent.  That will always be a top priority in my Department, as one would expect.  We must acknowledge that particular issues are presenting at tendering stage.  There are also issues relating to the performance of contracts.  Those issues are being examined by the Office of Government Procurement and the chief procurement officer.  I expect that I will be going to Cabinet on that matter in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the point the Deputy made about employment and that work should pay.  It should always be the case that work provides a better financial outcome for somebody than not working.<\/p><p>We are working through any specific issues in our social welfare code that create a disincentive to work.  We want to support people to work, even if it is part time, so that they do not end up worse off or lose secondary benefits, which tends to be a key issue in that regard.  <\/p><p> I acknowledge the point the Deputy made about Irish Water.  I have made progress in my time as Minister to date in significantly increasing Irish Water&rsquo;s capital funding.  I believe its budget this year is of the order of &euro;1.4 billion.  I provided additional funding in July last year and for quarter 4 of last year, which we announced on budget day.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, is determined, as part of the overall settlement we have agreed in the context of the national development plan, to ensure Irish Water is properly funded and has a secure and steady level of public investment in the coming years to allow it to plan the projects to which the Deputy referred.  These are not projects that can start within a month of the Government providing the funding.  Irish Water needs to know well in advance that funding will be provided for particular schemes, so that it can go through all of the different stages and get them to the point of construction. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#H00200","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I want to go back and forth with the Minister if that is okay with the Chair.

We will strive to be as fair as we can.  I also acknowledge that people look at the question of fairness through their own lens and perspective and we do not always get a consensus on what is fair.  It is the intention that this matter will be dealt with after the budget, so not on budget day, as I said.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and I met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions yesterday to discuss ICTU's pre-budget submission.  I took the opportunity to raise the issue with ICTU and it is fair to say that it broadly agrees with the approach that there needs to be collaboration and consultation.  I mentioned that we have the Labour Employer Economic Forum, which is a good forum in which the Government meets representatives of the employer bodies and trade unions.  That is a good forum for us to meet and discuss this issue further.  The LEEF will meet in October and the intention is to deal with this matter in the coming weeks.  We do not want it to drag on for months and months.<\/p> <p>  We also have the issue of a Labour Court recommendation in respect of a specific set of claims lodged by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and other healthcare workers.  I am sure the leaders of the relevant unions will demonstrate good faith and allow some time for us to work through the issue in its broader sense.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy touched on one point that highlights the complexity of all of this.  This is the issue of nursing homes where, unfortunately and tragically, many people passed away with Covid-19.   The vast majority of our nursing homes are private facilities and the people working in them are not public sector employees.  We have to ask what are the tools at the Government's disposal to provide appropriate recognition for people in that category.  They were on the front line and at the coalface of dealing with the worst of Covid-19.  That highlights the complexity and difficulty with this issue but we will deal with it.  We will not shirk from it.  There is a need for us to provide special recognition in as fair a manner as we can.  The best chance of achieving that outcome is by adopting a collaborative approach with wider society, including trade union representatives and the employer bodies.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#J00400","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Will the Minister give an indication of when he expects an outcome to that process?

To answer his question directly, we will not be using the stronger than expected tax receipts to boost the budget day package.  We do not believe that would be an appropriate or prudent thing to do.  We will, therefore, stick to the framework we set out in the summer economic statement.  As the Deputy noted, that involves an increase in core expenditure of &euro;4.2 billion, of which &euro;1.1 billion will go towards the increase in the public capital investment programme next year.  A further &euro;2.1 billion will go towards meeting the existing level of service commitments, demographics, public service pay costs and so on.  That leaves around &euro;1 billion for new budget day measures on the expenditure side.  That would be coupled with &euro;500 million, which will be available to the Minister for Finance for a tax package.<\/p> <p>  That is the structure of the budget.  We obviously welcome stronger than expected tax receipts.  If that leads to a lower than predicted deficit outturn, as set out in the summer economic statement, that is a good thing.  However, we certainly should not use this revenue to enhance what is already a strong budget package.<\/p> <p>  In overall terms, current expenditure growth for next year, as per the summer economic statement, stands at 4.6%, with overall expenditure growth for next year set to be around 5.5% because we are increasing capital spending by close to 12%.<\/p><p>Over the next five years, overall core expenditure growth will average around 5%.  We believe that is an appropriate level at which to set expenditure growth and it would be imprudent and unwise to use stronger than expected corporate tax receipts, for example, to boost that expenditure growth further.  We will not be doing that.<\/p><p> On the specific measures, they are the subject of live discussion.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and I, in particular, are working closely together on the social welfare Vote to ensure we respond in the best way we can to the increase in fuel costs and electricity prices that people are having to live with.  In the last two budgets, there were no increases in core weekly social welfare rates but there were packages that were targeted and impactful, in relation to the living alone allowance, the carer's support grant, improvements in the working family payment, qualified child dependent allowances and so on.

I will discuss three areas, namely, essential workers, capital projects and just transition and carbon tax.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has answered many of the questions on essential workers so I will be brief.  It is hugely important to acknowledge the massive effort essential workers put in during the pandemic.  It was so big that anything the Government does will only be a token but it is important the acknowledgement is there.  Easy options such as the public holiday will not suit everybody, such as supermarket staff who were on the tills without personal protective equipment, PPE, dealing with the public.  They will have to stock fresh food and keep shops running over the bank holiday.  I am glad the Government is taking an inclusive approach and consulting widely on it.  Bringing that to a timely conclusion with appropriate acknowledgement is important.<\/p> <p>  Spending on key capital projects, whether homes, schools, roads or public transport, is a massive deal.  It employs people locally and gives regions a chance to catch up.  On capital works like the N22 between Ballincollig and Macroom, trying to make that safer, or the N20 between Cork and Limerick, what is the outlook for such schemes in the short term?  It is essential such capital projects advance.  <\/p> <p>  The carbon tax and just transition are big issues for many people.  There is increased cost and we are likely to see it again in the budget.  The Government is aiming to change people's behaviour with increased costs, but that is easier to do in some sectors than others.  Somebody who farms and has to buy diesel has more difficulty transitioning than somebody who is in and out to work and has a public transport option available.<\/p> <p>  I understand the Government will ring-fence moneys for the just transition and doing works like insulating homes and so on.  Currently that is moving really slowly.  Look at the way the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, is delivering for homes around the country and the level of work it is doing on those homes with the insulation.  I am getting an increasing number of calls that people are disappointed with the length of time they are waiting and feel that the level of the works falls short of expectations.  What will ensure that, as carbon tax is increased and there is a bigger fund, it will deliver faster and more suitable works for people?  What oversight will be there on the likes of SEAI?  With the insulation of homes, SEAI pumps cavities but many bungalows built in the 1970s have a concrete strip across the top of the wall which will provide a cold bridge.  SEAI would want to pump the cavity and leave a cold bridge outside.  It is not delivering what people need and they are having to wait for the service.  As more money goes in, expectations will be higher.  What checks and balances will be there on SEAI to deliver on the just transition?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#K00200","speaker":"1455"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions and his comments on the recognition issue, which a number of his colleagues also raised.  The Deputy raised an important point on the need for remembrance and the fact we tragically lost so many people to Covid-19.  It is appropriate that we recognise and remember all those we lost, including those we lost in the last 18 months not due to Covid, who were denied the send-off they otherwise would have got.  It has been a difficult 18 months for the whole country.  It would be such a shame, having had so much solidarity across society in the last 18 months, if we were to end up with a divisive approach to this issue.  I am determined to avoid that and the best way to do that is to consult wider stakeholders, including trade union leaders, employer bodies and civic society.  We will do that as a Government and bring forward a proposal because recognition is warranted, justified and will take place.  The manner in which the Deputy and other colleagues presented it is the correct way to do it.  It is not an easy issue and it is not about a reward or anything like that really.

We have put balanced regional development at the heart of the new plan.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy touched on some specific issues, including road projects.  While I will not get into individual road projects that may or may not feature in the national development plan, suffice to say there will be road projects in the plan.  I acknowledge the great progress being made on the ground with the N22 project, the Macroom-Ballyvourney bypass, which the Deputy, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and many others have a keen interest in.  I am monitoring the progress of that and it is great to see it going so well.  The major Dunkettle interchange project is also under way in Cork and progressing well.  There will be road projects in the national development plan but the plan needs to be consistent with our climate action obligations.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will bring forward a climate action plan to the Government shortly.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, that involves carbon budgets that need to be implemented if we are to meet our targets of a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and carbon net neutrality by 2050.  That is a difficult challenge but it is one to which we must rise, so there will be an emphasis in the new national development plan on public transport, active travel and all forms of sustainable transport.  It will, of course, involve investment in road infrastructure, but I wish to set the overall context for the Deputy and colleagues.<\/p><p> As regards the immediate issues raised by increases in the carbon tax, we acknowledge that those increases, which must happen and have already been legislated for by the Oireachtas, pose a challenge for many people across society and for parts of the economy.  We will seek to respond to that in our budget presentation.  We are conscious of the need to insulate people insofar as we can from the impacts of carbon tax, but also rising electricity and fuel prices.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I will be bringing forward proposals on budget day in that regard.<\/p><p> The Deputy touched on the important issue of the implementation of the retrofitting programme, whether through the warmer homes scheme or the better home energy grants.  The current waiting times for those who apply to the warmer homes scheme are too long.  We need to do much better.  In the budget last year we provided a significant increase in funding for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and the implementation of schemes such as the warmer homes scheme.  I should be fair and acknowledge that Covid-19 had an impact on the ability of contractors to go into homes and get this work done.  In addition, there is a shortage of contractors in this space.  That is why we are investing more funding in upskilling, training and providing opportunities for people who want to move into the sector.  A significant amount of public money will go into this space in the next ten years and we need to make sure we have the capacity to deliver it.<\/p><p> This has been a difficult year.  The Department will have a significant underspend on capital, not just because of the impact of Covid on the ability to retrofit homes, but also due to its impact on the national broadband plan.  That is an issue on which I and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, are working.  We will do everything we can to accelerate the roll-out of the broadband plan.  It suffered a setback during Covid-19.  The funding is secure for its implementation and I am open to all and any options to accelerate the roll-out of the plan.  Covid has certainly underlined the need for connectivity in all parts of Ireland and, with more people now working from home or community hubs and so on, the need for high-speed broadband is imperative for the economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#K00300","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I will try to let members in for a second round.  We do not have much time left.  While members consider whether they wish to come in for two or three minutes for a second round of questions, I have a few questions, not so much about what is in budget 2022, but more the formation of it.  One of the more progressive measures in the budget last year related to areas such as mental health, where a differentiation was made between funding for continuation of services and funding for the development of new services.  Obviously, implementing Sharing the Vision is very important in that area.  Across the health sphere in particular and in the context of implementing plans such as Sl&aacute;intecare, it is incredibly useful that a differentiation is being made between keeping up core basic services as they are and the development of new services.  Will we see more of that in budget 2022?  Is it something the Department wishes to move towards more?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#L00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for her question.  The answer is \"Yes\".  In bringing forward a budget, it is important that we do not just set out the steady state and the overall amounts of money but, rather, actually lay out where the increases are going and what the new initiatives and measures in various areas are that will benefit from that funding, as well as, crucially, how that translates to services that people access and how it translates to where it really matters.  As the Chairman acknowledged, the budget last year in the area of mental health was more than &euro;1 billion, with more than &euro;30 million for specific new measures identified by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and her team.  I am in discussions with the Minister of State on that issue and also with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, regarding the disability sector.  We had a good budget last year for that sector and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has made great progress in reducing the waiting lists for assessments of need, for example.  I know she is anxious to translate that progress into the provision of therapy services, an issue on which the Chairman has spoken on many occasions.  \"Yes\" is the answer to her question.  I want to be able to set out specifically what the country is getting for the extra money that is being provided in various areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#L00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.   That is really useful to know because it makes a significant difference to people working in those services and to non-governmental organisations, NGOs, to be able to see exactly where money will be going.  In a similar vein, many people and NGOs often raise with me the usefulness of multi-annual funding in the context of the surety it provides in respect of from where funding is coming, but large-scale projects such as Sl&aacute;intecare or the development of an ICT system in the health service, for example, require commitments over several years.  We have a particularly annualised system of budgeting but, as we move forward with considerable large-scale projects - and we can see the system definitely needs things like ICT upgrades and the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare - is that something on which the Minister's Department is working?  I know there was resistance in the past to multi-annual funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#L00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":272,"content":"<p>In the context of capital funding, from next Monday when the national development plan will be announced, every Department will have multi-annual funding out to 2025.  They will know exactly what they will have each year and that gives them every opportunity to plan the delivery of projects, including in ICT.  There is a wide definition of what qualifies as capital expenditure.  It includes investment in ICT, for example.  That is a key issue.<\/p> <p>  In addition, as the Chairman is aware, there is flexibility to carry forward underspends in the capital space.  For each Vote, a maximum of 10% of the current year capital budget can be carried forward into the following year.  More than &euro;700 million was carried forward into 2021 as a result of underspends last year and it is inevitable that there will be underspends this year that will be carried forward to next year.  That funding will not be lost back to the central Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  It is more complex in the context of current funding.  When people raise the issue of multi-annual funding commitments, what they really want is a commitment to multi-annual increases in funding.  We set out the overall framework in the summer economic statement.  Built into that is an increase in core current expenditure of close to 4.75%.  As such, there can be a legitimate expectation that there will be increases in expenditure generally, but it has to fall to the Government, budget to budget, to set its priorities and monitor progress on the implementation of the programme for Government.  A degree of flexibility is needed because some Departments and projects may be ahead of schedule, while others may get stuck in the system.  One needs an ability to make budget day decisions.  I am not completely averse to multi-annual and there are certain specific areas where it would be helpful.  Several Ministers have raised that directly with me and we are examining it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021093000002#L00500","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Excellent work has been done by various Departments in respect of well-being budgeting.

I cannot go into any more detail than that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the school secretaries, I welcome the progress we have made on the pay scale.  The trade union called off the industrial action for a short number of weeks to allow the detail of that to be fleshed out.  We all have great regard for the work done by school secretaries.  This is an issue I was very keen to make progress on when I came into office and if we can implement this, it will be very significant progress.  The school secretaries and, indeed, the caretakers will continue to have other issues on which they will seek progress, and we will continue engagement on those.

Mr. Tyndall is joined by Ms Jennifer Hanrahan, who is a principal in his office.  Mr. Tyndall will retire next month, and we wish him all the best of luck.  He has served as Ombudsman for 14 years, six in Wales and eight in Ireland.  Mr. Tyndall is the fourth Ombudsman in Ireland following Michael Mills from 1984 to 1994, Kevin Murphy from 1994 to 2003 and Emily O'Reilly from 2003 to 2013.  Mr. Tyndall has served from 2013 to 2021.<\/p><p>The Ombudsman has two main roles: to examine complaints from people who feel they have been unfairly treated by providers of public services, including complaints under the Disability Act 2005, and to act as the champion of good administrative practice.  The Ombudsman has a close relationship with the Committee on Public Petitions and Mr. Tyndall has appeared before the committee many times.  It would be a good idea to set up a memorandum of understanding between the committee and his office.<\/p><p>I have a few notes here because Mr. Tyndall has covered so many things over the years that it would not be fair if we were to let any of them go.  Mr. Tyndall was appointed Ombudsman and Information Commissioner by the President in December 2013.  Mr. Tyndall is also commissioner for environmental information and an <i>ex officio<\/i>member of the Standards in Public Office Commission, the Commission for Public Service Appointments, the Referendum Commission and the Constituency Commission.  Mr. Tyndall was reappointed in 2019 for a second term.<\/p><p>One of Mr. Tyndall's key investigations was the Opportunity Lost investigation in 2017, which found that women who had worked in the Magdalen laundries had been wrongly refused access to the Magdalen restorative justice scheme.  Mr. Tyndall was also involved in Wasted Lives: Time for a Better Future for Younger People in Nursing Homes and, in 2015, Learning to Get Better, an investigation into how public hospitals handle complaints.  A Good Death, published in 2014, described some of the issues raised in complaints about end-of-life care in hospitals.<\/p><p>Mr. Tyndall has called for the extension of the Ombudsman's remit to investigate complaints from all sectors in receipt of significant public funding.  During his term in this office, the following came under his jurisdiction: private nursing homes, direct provision accommodation services and more than 200 regulatory and other public bodies.  Mr. Tyndall has also been involved in internal developments and international contributions.  He has ensured complainants can easily avail of his office services and that the office can deliver effective and efficient services by overseeing the development of the latest ICT and case management systems and user-friendly, award-winning websites.  Mr. Tyndall is highly regarded among the international ombudsman community and was elected president of the International Ombudsman Institute, IOI, in 2016, having previously served as its European regional president.  His office also hosted the IOI world conference in 2021.  Mr. Tyndall is also a key member and former chair of the Ombudsman Association, sharing his knowledge and experience as both Irish and a former Welsh ombudsman.<\/p><p>I could spend another hour and a half speaking about Mr. Tyndall and praising him.  I do not know where he has got the time to go through all that.  We look forward to his opening statement.  Before we hear from the Ombudsman, I propose that we publish his opening statement on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>I suggest that Mr. Tyndall make his opening statement for about five or ten minutes and that we will then have questions and comments from the members.

It is always good to engage with the committee.  As you said, this is one of many occasions when I have had the opportunity to do so.<\/p><p>The relationship between the Ombudsman and the Parliament through committees is very important, as it ensures there is oversight of the public services within my jurisdiction and, particularly, that there is an opportunity to deal with any recommendations that may not be accepted.  However, I am delighted to say, as I come close to the end of my term of office and following the work of my distinguished predecessors, that for more than 30 years all recommendations made by my office have been accepted.  That is testament to the quality and effectiveness of the relationship with the committee.  I was asked in a radio interview during the week whether people were concerned about my office and if they were afraid of it.  I did not want to say that people are afraid of my office as, in general, we have very good working relationships, but I did say that where people were thinking about not implementing recommendations, telling them they might have to account for that to this committee usually has a salutary effect and persuades them to change their minds.  I think they are afraid of the committee rather than of me.<\/p><p> I wish to open my remarks by saying that, as the Ombudsman, you see the failures of public service.  Often, people come to the Ombudsman because they are unhappy, but I am very conscious of the quality of the public services in Ireland in general and of the quality of the people who deliver them.  I wish to start by paying tribute to all the staff and leaders of public services throughout the country for their dedication, expertise and commitment.  This has never been more evident than during the pandemic.  I also take the opportunity of my final appearance before the committee to pay tribute to my staff for their work.  The range of work across the office is very extensive and I have been very well served, so I am grateful to them for all their efforts.<\/p><p> We are here, largely, to examine the annual report from my office.  The agenda lists three, but I will concentrate on last year.  As the members know, 2020 was not a typical year.  We had to deal with the pandemic.  We had not long moved into our new offices on Earlsfort Terrace and had hardly arrived before we had to move out again, but we were able to get services up and running very quickly and almost seamlessly.  Our systems enabled us to work remotely, as others have done.  The annual report is titled \"Managing complaints in a pandemic\" because that was the context in which we worked during the year.<\/p><p> The number of complaints to my office was slightly down.  We had high numbers of inquiries.  The reduction in the number of complaints was from a high in 2019 but was mostly related to the fact we were not able to undertake our usual outreach.  That had an impact.  A particular impact, considering conversations I have had with the committee previously, was in direct provision.  As the committee knows, the majority of our complaints come from our visits to the centres.  I am pleased we are about to recommence visiting the centres now.  That is not to say we had no complaints, but that the levels were lower than we would have expected.<\/p><p> We did receive some new types of complaints arising from the pandemic, such as complaints about the new pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  Most of the complaints about the PUP were about arrears of payments to applicants, simply delays in getting money out to people.  When we looked at it and the scale of what had been undertaken by the Department of Social Protection, we did not find any systemic issues.  It was a remarkable achievement to put the system in place in the time in which it was done.  We found individual cases and I illustrated one of those in the annual report.  It involved an entertainer resident in Ireland but working overseas.  Her PUP payment was first granted and then stopped.  When we looked at it, we could see there was nothing in the scheme that prevented her from benefiting from it as she was resident and paying tax in Ireland.  That was typical of a small number of cases where we got decisions reversed.  Generally, the scheme was well managed and it was remarkable how quickly it was put in place.<\/p><p> This week, along with Ms Hanrahan, I have been engaged in outreach, this time virtually, in Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny.  That is part of a programme of outreach visits the office does.  A case that was especially relevant there was the very sad one of a woman who was given drugs for alcohol withdrawal when, in fact, she had not had a drink for ten years and was dying with liver cancer.  The impact of that was that the drugs caused her to be drowsy and her family were unable to engage properly with her in her final days.  We brought about major changes there, partly because it was impossible for the hospital to identify who had actually prescribed the drugs.  That revealed systemic problems in the way its systems were recording medical interventions.  That has been changed since.<\/p><p> I have spoken to the committee at some length about the Wasted Lives report.  The critical thing I wish to say at this point is that we are very heavily engaged with the HSE and the Department on the implementation of the report.  I was delighted when the Government committed to implement the recommendations.  The important thing now is to ensure it is done in an expeditious fashion.  I hope the committee will also keep those recommendations in review to ensure the momentum is not lost and the commitments are delivered.  People have waited a long time for action and I hope it will happen quickly.<\/p><p> An issue that concerns me greatly is access to transport for people living with a disability.  Ms Emily O'Reilly produced a report on this in which she indicated that the schemes in existence then did not comply with equality legislation.  There has still not been a replacement for those schemes.  Many members will know about the inadequacy of the current disabled drivers and passengers scheme.  I have raised this issue time and again.  What is really instructive is that so many Members of the Oireachtas, including members of the Government, have complained to my office about the way the scheme discriminates between people with a disability.  This scheme provides for a tax reduction in respect of acquiring a vehicle adapted for disability.  The consequence of all this is that, before I finish, I intend to issue a report setting out my concerns about the lack of access to transport for disabled people.  It is a serious matter.<\/p><p> There has been a suggestion they can catch a bus or get a train.  Anybody who follows Twitter will be very well aware that the lifts on the DART almost inevitably do not work.  However, if you are living in rural Ireland and you are waiting for a bus or a train to come to your isolated home, you will be waiting for a very long time indeed.  I hope that argument will not be advanced again.  It is very important we do something because people get very isolated if they do not have access to transport and a way to get out and about and engage with their communities.  It affects disabled people who want to work and cannot.<\/p><p> I wish to refer to some issues that were mentioned by you, Chairman, in your very generous introduction.  I was wondering how I found the time for all that myself.  I will pick up on the issues regarding jurisdiction.  There has been a commitment to provide jurisdiction in respect of clinical judgment, in respect of prisons and in respect of the administration of the asylum and immigration process.  All those commitments are welcome.  We have seen fair progress on the prison complaints, although it has taken an eternity and must be brought to a conclusion.<\/p><p>The other issues are moving but they are moving glacially.  We could do with more progress on both of those matters in the not too distant future.<\/p><p> The Acting Chairman mentioned the role I played as president of the International Ombudsman Institute.  One of the things that happened with that was the Venice Commission developed the Venice principles.  I was glad to have an opportunity to input into that process and that they were adopted as the global standards for ombudsman institutions worldwide in December 2020 by the United Nations General Assembly with co-sponsorship by Ireland, which I was pleased to see.  For my successor, there is an opportunity to review the legislation.  It was amended in 2012 but the fundamental legislation dates back to 1980.  The time is right to review it and replace it with something more modern and fit for purpose, which is consistent with the Venice principles.  The Venice Commission has agreed to review legislation where requested to do so.  That would be a useful first step in moving it forward and something my successor might well want to take on board.  I hope the committee would participate in and perhaps sponsor any such review.<\/p><p> Before coming to this meeting, I thought back to my first engagement with the predecessor of the committee when I was appointed in 2013.  I said at the time and I have always said since that trying to resolve issues in a non-adversarial way, being fair to everyone and looking to drive improvement and learning more broadly in the system would be my approach.  In general I sought to fix things, rather than complain about them.  The Acting Chairman mentioned some of the major reports that have been prepared.  I hope they had an impact on securing improvements in public services.<\/p><p> I thank the members of the committee for their support over the past eight years.  The role of the Ombudsman is an intrinsic component of the checks and balances within any well-functioning democracy.  That relationship with the committee has been important.  The committee will not be rid of me quite as early as may have been thought.  I have agreed to remain in my post until the end of the year because of delays in the recruitment process.  There should not be a long gap before my successor is appointed.  I thank members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021093000002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":305,"content":"<p>If there is a delay in recruitment I suspect Mr. Tyndall could be here again next year.

I agree with everything he said, including what he has said about disabilities.<\/p> <p>  We are working on the issue of disabilities in Limerick.  We see an awful lot of people who have disabilities and who have outgrown their equipment.  That equipment is not getting back into circulation so we are in the middle of trying to organise a facility where all disability equipment that has outgrown children or adults gets reassigned, serviced, maintained, even if it has to stay on a shelf for a year or two.  Many people with disabilities are waiting a long time for such equipment and the only access available is to new equipment, whereas reconditioned equipment can get back onto the field faster and help those people with their disabilities.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Tyndall for everything he has done and for the way he relates to the rest of us in the committee room.

I say that as a new Deputy, which I am until the next election.  Mr. Tyndall's engagement, insight and assistance to this committee have been valuable and worthwhile.  We are a relatively newly reformed committee, as he knows having assisted us with that process.  I want to put on record my appreciation and that of the committee to him and his staff.  He rightly highlighted the superb support that his staff have given to him, as well as highlighting their flexibility at the outset of the pandemic.  I share his pain in having moved office before the pandemic hit.  Many new Deputies had that same experience.<\/p> <p>  As the Acting Chairman read out Mr. Tyndall's list of achievements and detailed his experience, it was beginning to sound like an episode of \"This is Your Life\".  His achievements are remarkable and he can be rightly proud of them.  The Magdalen laundries were mentioned and I refer to the impact Mr. Tyndall had on those survivor's lives.  The end-of-life care in hospitals is so important to many families who go through that process.  Direct provision was another matter that Mr. Tyndall dealt with and that is to name just a few of his achievements.  It is a remarkable career and I am delighted to hear that it has been extended to Christmas at least.  Hopefully, he will be back before us again.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the 2020 annual report and I want to delve into a number of issues.  When we last met we had a full discussion on direct provision.  Mr Tyndall said that 168 complaints were received in 2019 compared with 61 in 2021.  I would have thought the reverse would be the case.  He might come back to me on that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Tyndall also mentioned the Wasted Lives report on those under 65.  Unfortunately I had dealings with a constituent the other day and it just so happened that the only care that individual could receive was in a nursing home.  It is not appropriate and I note Mr. Tyndall referred to that in his opening remarks.  We need to examine and get away from such inappropriate placements for people.  He said he was able to visit 28 people under 65 at the time who were living in nursing homes, yet some &euro;3 million was ultimately allocated by the HSE.  How is that progressing?  If Mr. Tyndall answers those two questions I might come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021093000002#C00400","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":308,"content":"<p>We have just heard the bells for the Seanad so I invite Senator Buttimer to ask his questions because I suspect there is a vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021093000002#C00500","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":309,"content":"<p>It is only a recall so I am happy to wait a while.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021093000002#C00600","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632956400,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I will respond to Deputy Devlin then.

There was a delay in advertising the post but it has now been advertised.<\/p><p>I was delighted that the Minister committed to a full public and transparent appointment process, which is being undertaken by the Public Appointments Service.  I mentioned the need to review the legislation.  That is not required by the legislation but it should be.  International best practice would have the recruitment process specified as being open and transparent.  We are getting it and I am very pleased about that but it is through the personal commitment of the Minister.  It should be in law.  There are various other aspects about the independence of the office and the powers and jurisdiction that could usefully be reviewed.  It was good to have that example.  The closing date has passed and a process is under way so I expect that a candidate will be coming before the Oireachtas in the not too distant future.  I know these things take time - often more time than one would expect - but it is happening and there will be a replacement.  That is the first thing.  <\/p><p> Regarding direct provision, the reality is that people are happier talking to us in person.  We made very considerable attempts to put in virtual outreach.  For example, we arranged for rooms to be provided where people could video-conference privately with us but the take up was poor, which is why we are back on the road this autumn with a view to picking that up.

I know that work is under way for the first tranche of people to be discharged and helped to find homes within the community.  The point I made when I spoke to the committee, which I will repeat, is that this is the tip of the iceberg.  A total of 1,300 people were in receipt of fair deal.  We suspect the actual numbers were higher because there are other people in nursing homes who are not in receipt of fair deal.  Work is beginning on identifying who those people are and what are their preference is.  That work is under way.  Various elements of the recommendations are being implemented.  The point I want to make concerns the pace at which that happens.  I told the committee previously that at least four of the individuals with whom we spoke sadly died during the pandemic.  These people do not have forever.  Their lives are beings wasted as we speak.  The Government has made clear that the initial tranche is to be used as a pilot programme.  That is fine.  I have no difficulty with that - that is appropriate - but a pilot programme must lead to a much larger delivery.  The scale of this needs to move forward.  Work is happening on the statutory funding scheme for home care.  We are working with HIQA, which is developing new regulations that will take this into account.  I know from speaking with HIQA inspection staff that they are more engaged in talking to people under 65 in nursing homes when they are there to see if they have access to appropriate activities because one of the other things we said was that while people are waiting to come out, they need to have more appropriate activities so there is movement on every front.  My concern is that it now needs to accelerate, which is why I am asking the committee to come back to this topic.  We know about the so-called decongregation programme for people with intellectual disabilities.  That stalled completely some years ago and those small numbers of people continue to come out.  There is still unfinished business there.  These are people who, by and large, do not have prominent voices in our communities.  They are tucked away, which is why it is really important that in its scrutiny role, this committee stays on top of this as the issue moves forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021093000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":314,"content":"<p>That is something we might work on for our work programme.

Such a complaint may relate to end-of-life care, a failure to look after a possession or access for relatives, as we have seen.  I can consider all of those issues.  However, the person may have become ill as a result of another person being discharged from hospital.  If that is the case, I cannot examine that issue.  Neither can I examine issues relating to decisions taken on the care of that person.  The family do not want half an answer; they want somebody to look comprehensively at the whole of it.<br\/><br\/>This became an even bigger issue in Ireland when a decision was properly made by the courts that professional standards bodies and regulators, including the Medical Council, could not consider issues unless they suggested there was a <i>prima facie <\/i>case for a gross breach of professional standards.  That is my paraphrasing of the decision.  As such, a tranche of complaints have no home.  Many of the issues my office considers do not suggest at all that a person was in gross breach of his or her professional standards, but there may well be issues relating to clinical care from which lessons could be learned.  On some occasions, I have considered cases and simply raised them with the HSE as, even though I could not investigate them, I could see there were problems.  There was an issue regarding equipment in use in emergency departments and it was obvious to me that lives were at risk.  I was able to raise that issue but I could not formally consider it.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that north of the Border, the complaints considered by the Northern Ireland Public Service Ombudsman fit into the broad range of public service complaints.  Here, no one can look at them.  To be fair to the HSE, it does its best, but having the HSE consider an issue is not the same as having access to independent redress.  That is why this is so important.  The Government has accepted on several occasions that this is an important issue and has agreed to move it forward, but that has not transpired in practice as yet.  I know the Department of Health is considering it again, but it is time to get it over the line.  It is an obvious gap in the landscape of access to independent redress and it needs to be filled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021093000002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I wish to return to the issue of access to transport for people living with disabilities.

He noted that, nine years later, that has still not been implemented.  However, he went on to state that it is his understanding that the Department of Finance is to develop a new and more equitable scheme and that he hopes it will be included in the finance Bill this year.

I call Senator Murphy.  He is otherwise engaged.  I will come back to him.<\/p> <p>  Members have touched on disability and Mr. Tyndall mentioned it in his opening statement.  It is a bugbear of mine because I feel they have always been treated as second-class citizens.  A lift or ramp on a bus or train or an adaptation of a bike for a beach has always been perceived as a luxury and not a necessity.  I had a dog licence exemption Bill in the last sitting of the D&aacute;il to remedy the current situation which differentiates between somebody blind with a guide dog and somebody with autism and an assistance dog.  The latter has to pay for a licence.  It was discriminatory.  We will certainly visit that.<\/p> <p>  One issue that worries me relates to the additional supports given to carers to allow those people to remain in the community.  It is pertinent because we are coming out of the world's worst pandemic.  Mental health issues are going off the scale and we have a mental health centre, the Owenacurra centre in Midleton, which in all its years has never had a suicide and has never had a Covid case.  It has 19 long-stay patients.  It provided short respite and mental health day care services.  Now, because of inefficiencies in a Department which did not maintain the buildings, it is being used as an excuse to close it.  These are the most vulnerable people in it.  How does Mr. Tyndall feel about carers keeping people in the community who were in the mental health system and are integrated into society?  The threat of moving them and putting them into isolated settings will be detrimental.  How would he feel and react if this was happening today?  It actually is happening today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021093000002#F00600","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632956400,"counter":338,"content":"<p>The default position over the years in dealing with people with requirements which are not met in the community has been to go to institutional care.  Thankfully, over the decades we have seen many institutions closed.  Institutions have been a theme of my time as Ombudsman.<\/p> <p>  The first instinct of any State should be to support people to continue to live at home and, if they cannot live at home, to find alternatives in the community to support them.  Our first instinct too often has been to support people in institutional settings.  Many older people in nursing homes could have been supported in their homes and would have been happier.  That is not a criticism of nursing homes, but people are in them because they cannot be supported to stay where they want to be, which is in their homes where supports and adaptations could be made.  We are moving in the right direction and need to continue to do so.<\/p> <p>  There are a particular set of issues affecting people with mental health problems.  Closing the old large mental hospitals was obviously desirable, but alternative means of access to support must be provided for people with mental illness who otherwise would not thrive in the community.  Facilities need to be provided to support them so they can live decent lives and so that clinical interventions are available to them in clinical settings when required.   Closing the institution is not the end of it.  I have tried persistently and consistently to say we have to provide proper support for people, not just to enable them to live a bare existence in the community but to be engaged in the community and to have work, social lives and relationships so they can live proper, fulfilled lives.<\/p> <p>  I do not know the facts and do not want to comment but I will say we cannot provide all services for people with mental illness purely in a community setting without some kind of inpatient services for people in crisis at times when they cannot manage.  That does not and should not mean permanently being absent from the community, but it should mean they can be supported when they need help in appropriate settings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2021093000002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I will go back to Senator Murphy if he is there.

It is a job where you feel you have the opportunity to make a difference.  I am pleased to have had that opportunity.  There are areas in the broader work of the office which have been particularly rewarding for me.  I was pleased to sit as a member of the referendum commission during some key referendums that have taken place during my time in office.  That was a great privilege.  I am pleased to see some change is happening there and the electoral commission is being established.  That will take some of the work that currently sits with the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.<\/p> <p>  My office provides support to SIPO, including in the context of the ethics legislation.  I have never known anything more unfit for purpose than our current ethics legislation.  Having to assemble four of the busiest people in the country, namely, the clerks of both Houses, the Comptroller and Auditor General and me, along with two independent members to hear cases about supposed cheating on travel expenses is ridiculous.  The moves to reform ethics legislation must not be left any longer.  SIPO had no possibility of doing anything in respect of sanction.  There were no sanctions.  It is legislation that is completely not fit for purpose and needs to be replaced as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to see the ongoing work on reform of freedom of information.  I hope it leads to all bodies in receipt of substantial public funding being properly brought into the ambit of the legislation and proper resourcing to enable public bodies to respond to the requirements of individuals for transparency and openness.<\/p><p>I have had an opportunity in the course of what I have been saying to highlight some of the outstanding issues.

As part of the review of the legislation, creating as other offices do the possibility of having a team of people who can take on those big hard-hitting and impactful investigations would be a very big step forward.  At the moment people have to be taken away from the day job in order to do them.  This limits the capacity to do that.<\/p><p> It has been a very fulfilling opportunity for me to work as Ombudsman.

I am the vice chair of the National Platform of Self Advocates.  We are Ireland&rsquo;s first independent disabled person organisation, DPO, run for and by people with an intellectual disability.  We have more than 350 members all over Ireland advocating for their rights in forums such as this.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about participation in public and political life we do not just mean voting and being elected.  We mean all activities and decision making that affect the public.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, is very clear that states have to guarantee the rights of disabled people as voters, candidates and officeholders at all levels of government.  Participation means more than coming along one day to a meeting and telling our stories.  Participation for us means we should be involved in running events, chairing consultations, writing up reports and deciding what the solutions are.<\/p> <p>  People with an intellectual disability are not involved at every level of government.  We are not employed as experts in the Civil Service.  We are not elected to public office.  We are not even represented on all the departmental consultative committees.  The State does not seem to understand that many of us are not readers, do not write or do not have access to technology.  We are excluded from participation when we are not given the time or the supports we need to communicate.  We feel we are only allowed to participate in story-telling and not in decision-making.<\/p> <p>  The UNCRPD says that states have to encourage the participation of disabled people through their own DPOs.  This includes funding.  When we are fully funded we can bring the voices of people with an intellectual disability into different forums.  We have taken part in personalised budgets and Make Work Pay.  We deliver training on the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.  We are empowered advocates but without funding we still have very little power.  When funding stops, all our time goes towards finding money and our advocacy work stops.<\/p> <p>  If we want to be heard we cannot join bigger disability groups.  We need to keep our own independent voice.  We have lots of evidence that when we merge with other groups our voices are silenced.  Other disabled people do not always understand the extra barriers we face and they do not always advocate for accessibility or include us in how decisions are made.  We want the State to give funding for a wide range of DPOs so that unique groups can have their voices heard.  If there is competition for funding for advocacy activities, prioritise DPOs.  This may mean taking money away from service organisations and giving it to DPOs instead.<\/p><p>The State needs to communicate with people with intellectual disabilities in accessible ways or we cannot participate.  This means providing information in accessible formats such as easy-to-read English and videos, and giving us time to respond to information.  Calls for submissions should be published long in advance of deadlines.  Many of us rely on supporters to give us information and to assist us in telling our stories.  This takes much more time than is usual.<\/p><p> The best way to engage with the National Platform is to invite its members to a meeting of only people with intellectual disabilities.  This gives us space to talk about issues that affect us.  We find that when we are mixed with other groups, people do not give us a chance to speak.<\/p><p> We want the State to include us in policymaking from setting the agenda to implementation and evaluation; make sure the public process is accessible in how it is organised, scheduled and run, and include people with intellectual disabilities in the design and chairing of events; guarantee that our unique voice will be heard and heeded; and require that all official information is provided in accessible formats from every Department, not just information about disability issues.  People with intellectual disabilities have the right to be included in every part of life.  We want the State to train public servants on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, and the public sector duty; and employ people with intellectual disabilities in the public service as advisers and access champions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021093000002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe McGrath","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGrath for his contribution.

I thank the members for inviting us here today.  I am here with my colleagues Ms Lianne Quigley, chairperson of the board of management, and Mr. John Sherwin, who is the chief executive officer.  I am the advocacy manager in the Irish Deaf Society, IDS.  The Irish Deaf Society is a national deaf-led organisation, a cultural and linguistic minority.  Our aims are to serve the best interests of deaf people and their welfare.  The IDS is a recognised disabled people's organisation, DPO, under the UN CRPD.<\/p> <p>  We have the Irish Sign Language Act 2017 which states that deaf people have a right to access public services in their first language, which is Irish Sign Language, but it does not always happen.  I wish to talk about Articles 29 and 30, which specifically address the deaf community.  In Article 29, there are seven points I wish to explain.  There are no deaf Members in the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  Recently three deaf people put themselves forward for public representation but were unsuccessful.  I hope the three deaf people who did that will be role models to deaf people who may in future consider doing the same.  Their experience was very challenging, with many barriers when putting themselves forward as public representatives, particularly with the additional burden of seeking interpreters and translation in different Government meetings, and accessing funding.  There was a negative bias towards deaf people putting themselves forward as deaf representatives.<\/p> <p>  In regard to education, language, training and resources, the IDS encourages and empowers deaf people to make representation to Government organisations at national, regional and local levels.<\/p> <p>  In regard to voting, deaf people understand voting and elections but do not have Irish Sign Language access to watch political debates which happen during election time.  Leaflets, information, posters and so forth are not accessible as they are all in English.  When candidates go door to door canvassing, there is also the communication barrier at the front door.  Many deaf people have a basic education due to the provision of education they received, so literacy levels can be low, which impedes access to information.  In regard to the news and what is happening at election time, information about candidates or political parties, their manifestos, what policies they are promoting and so forth, there is much lengthy discussion on such matters.  However, deaf people get only limited conversation and dialogue in the social arena on these.  For example, they get limited information on the RT&Eacute; News, they get just five minutes of information about what is happening rather than the longer dialogue other people receive.  Deaf people therefore feel left out and excluded.  They are language deprived from the information.  They do not have a full knowledge of candidates and who would be best for them to vote for.<\/p> <p>  Local deaf clubs have invited Deputies to come to the clubs or to where deaf people gather.  They would like to hear their political manifestos and their campaign but they do not always get access to that.<\/p> <p>  A recent survey for the DPO Coalition, of which IDS is one of the founding members, found that 24% of people with disability have difficulty in accessing their right to vote and that 55% have difficulty in contacting their local representative.  The survey proves that the best way to improve the lives of deaf people is in one of two ways.  Government should provide core funding to DPOs, for example, to do research to show the experience of deaf people, and fund the IDS to enable deaf people become more involved in political life.  This survey will be published in the near future.<\/p> <p>  The IDS, as a DPO, has representation for the deaf community.  However, it does not receive enough funding to link in with local government or on a local or national level.  The Government has asked DPOs to consult different organisations, but we do not have the funding or the resources to enable us to do this.  IDS recommends that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth should take an active role in facilitating this consultation process with DPOs to get the information across to Government. <\/p> <p>  The IDS would like to see Government use and promote a social model of disability, as is recommended in the UNCRPD.<\/p><p>How do we make this social structure?  We need to ask people with disabilities, not the other way around.  It is not a disability issue; it is an equality issue.  It is not a charity model or welfare we are looking for.<\/p><p> As for other points under Article 30, the Citizens Information Board, CIB, and sign language interpreting services are running a pilot project at the moment in terms of access to interpreting services for cultural, sporting and other such events.  This is what was enacted in the ISL Act, so we expect to see the results of this and the deaf community's participation using this pilot project.  We very much want to see it become a permanent structure within sign language interpreting services in order that we will have this model of providing interpretation.  At the moment we are very much lacking in information on ISL and there not being enough interpreters.  That creates additional barriers for deaf people in their cultural lives, attending museums and suchlike.  Deaf people's choices in life are very limited.  They have to plan long in advance of an event if they want to go to it and they have to have a lot of patience.  They have to wait and then see what the choices they can access are.  They are significantly disenfranchised compared with other hearing people.  Grants are available to cultural organisations, but what we need to see in those grants is a stipulation that interpreter access must be provided because deaf people need to access services through ISL.<\/p><p> Oftentimes the media are not accessible to deaf people.  There is a bigger focus on subtitling than on ISL.  Subtitling is in English, and English is not the first language of the deaf community.  As I mentioned earlier, many deaf people have literacy skills.  Some are able to read subtitling really well and some are not, but the majority of deaf people would prefer ISL access.  Sometimes you think subtitling will be there and you turn on the TV and it is not there.  Subtitling is not reliable, and there is very sparse ISL programming provided.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, insists on targets for broadcasters to meet, and subtitling is included in the provision for deaf people, but very often the subtitled programmes are just repeated at unsociable hours, meaning that the target is met in a distorted way.  We know the quality of subtitling is unreliable and we may report this, yet it still goes ahead and the poor subtitled programmes are still included within the targets.  There was a TV programme that was on called \"Hands On\".  It was produced by Mind the Gap Films and RT&Eacute;.  It ran from 1985 right up until 2014.  It had 18 seasons and then it stopped.  IDS has pleaded with RT&Eacute; that we would really like to see this specific deaf programme back on the air.  Many of our people who are deaf were presenters who worked on that programme, on either the technical side or the presenting side.  They ended up going abroad to pursue their careers because the programme ended.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for having me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021093000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Grehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I thank the IDS for its presentation.

My name is Deirdre Fitzgerald-Graham.  I am a parent of three young children, one of whom has a disability, living in Galway.  I am a board member of LEAP.  I am a PhD scholar and lecturer in children's studies at NUIG.  The committee has already met my colleague, Ms Rachel Cassen, who is the co-founder and director of LEAP.  She is also a parent of two sons, one of whom has a disability, living in Westmeath.  Our opening statement relates to community participation.<\/p> <p>  LEAP is a family-based, non-profit organisation that assists families of children with disabilities to take action for an inclusive life.  We work with families, people with disabilities and their supporters and allies.  We focus our efforts on increasing expectations of what is possible in the lives of people with disabilities.  We work with families with children with intellectual disabilities.  We believe the ordinary life is the most precious of all and the term \"special\" does people very few favours.  We know an ordinary life, a typical life, produces better outcomes for people than segregated pathways.<\/p> <p>  We believe much of what is good in life is not in the currency of money, that we can lose years, decades even, in the struggle to obtain more services and more resources and that, ultimately, our children's lives are here and now.  Many families of children with disabilities and their representative groups are clear on what they are against and what is not working but less clear on what they are for and what is working.  We believe families who have a family member with a disability need support not only to survive but to thrive.  To achieve this, we explore the idea of what a good life looks like with families through visioning and planning.  We assist families to develop and articulate a strong and compelling vision of a good life.  We do this to counter the culturally held low expectations of people with disabilities.  We assist families to plan in order that the elements of a typical life are more likely to be present as a child grows to adulthood.  We encourage families to aim high and to focus on an ordinary life with valued roles.<\/p> <p>  This work involves ongoing conversations with families typically held around the kitchen table.  Since the start of the pandemic, however, these conversations have moved online and happen through our family leadership webinar series or our online visioning and planning sessions.  The seminars we deliver include topics such as developing a vision of an ordinary life for your family member; an introduction to inclusive education; celebrating families through sharing stories; supported decision-making for children and young people with disabilities; safeguarding the future; family advocacy; planning for life after school; creating community in the street where you live; and getting a life, not a service - how to utilise individualised funding.<\/p> <p>  As a family-based organisation, we assist families to figure out what we can do for ourselves, then what we can do with others and then when we need outside help.  We focus on belonging, relationships and valued social roles.  Many families have found that this approach has a better track record than relying on services to figure it all out.  This is important not only at crucial life stages such as starting a new school or leaving school but also when considering leisure and lifestyle options for our children, such as joining clubs and other groups.  We believe it is essential to connect with other families and to work with people who are positive, have high hopes and are creative and who have managed to create good lives for their own family members.<\/p> <p>  We encourage families only to dip their children's toes in special or segregated services and not to immerse them in those services.  We know the earlier a child deviates from the ordinary life path, the more difficult it will be for him or her to return to it.  For example, if you attend a special school, the opportunity to partake in typical milestones such as work experience or having a part-time job are often lost.  This makes it extremely difficult for a young person to rejoin the typical life path on leaving school.<\/p> <p>  Why does this matter?  As we can see from the OECD report from 2021, Disability, Work and Inclusion in Ireland, Government interventions in Ireland aimed at increasing the employment rates of disabled people are well intentioned but failing strategies.  Data up to 2018 show that only 34% of people with disability are employed, with much lower rates of people with intellectual disability and people with autism in employment.<\/p> <p>  One example of a successful employment project is RISE.  It is located in Washington, USA, where 70% of people with developmental disability are in open employment.  Research from RISE shows that the younger people with disability enter the labour market, the more likely they are to stay in open employment for the rest of their working lives.  RISE has also established that the optimal age for people with disability to commence paid employment is 13 years.<\/p><p>Embedding young people with disabilities in ordinary valued roles in the community, such as part-time work, is one of the most powerful ways to ensure that they do not live their lives on benefits, living in the shadows and experiencing loneliness and profound social exclusion, as is the case for many people with intellectual disability today.<\/p><p> Creating a positive and hopeful vision for the future, a vision that is supported by others, is vital to moving in the right direction.<\/p><p> In our work with families, much of what people say makes a good life, is not provided by services.  LEAP believes that children&rsquo;s and adults&rsquo; fundamental needs are for inclusion, participation, relationships, value and respect.  These needs are best met in the community when the person is embedded in a network of positive relationships.<\/p><p> We have a number of recommendations for the committee today. These recommendations contain many of the enablers of good lives, typical lives, valued lives.  Our recommendations centre on resourcing children and families to stay on the inclusive life path, personal budgets, promoting innovation and the creation of inclusive neighbourhoods.<\/p><p> When the majority of the voices in this space are service providers lobbying for more funding, what gets lost is the simple truth: that the majority of people with intellectual disabilities are supported throughout their lives by their families.<\/p><p> Thank you for listening to us today, we are happy to take any questions now from the members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021093000002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Fitzgerald-Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank all of our witnesses for their presentations and for the thoughtfulness of what is in front of us today.

What support do our witnesses feel that our committee should be lobbying for?<\/p> <p>  I also have a question for the Irish Deaf Society.  We note that the society is a founding member of the Disabled Peoples Organisation Coalition, DPO Coalition.  Can the society please elaborate on this coalition and its involvement with the State&rsquo;s Disability Participation and Consultation Network?  Are people with disabilities sufficiently reflected on the State&rsquo;s network?<\/p> <p>  My last question to the LEAP advocates is that they called for a normal and ordinary life for all children.  This is something that has been raised with me through my work on this committee but also in a personal capacity as a mother of a child with additional needs.  I know that some parents feel more secure by their children attending a special school as they may feel that their needs are definitely going to be met where others would have a different opinion in that their child would be best placed in a mainstream school and integrated, as referred to by Ms Fitzgerald-Graham, into an ordinary school.

We have various comments on the recommendations from the committee&rsquo;s report which was published in July and we watched with interest the committee&rsquo;s public meeting which the committee has uploaded live on the website.<br\/><br\/>I will directly address both the Deputy&rsquo;s question and recommendation No. 23.  Recommendation No. 23  in the committee&rsquo;s first report: Aligning Disability Funding with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tChildren with special educational needs have the same rights to appropriate education as children without special educational needs.  Accordingly, [you recommend] ... that the [EPSEN Act] Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 ... is [fully] commenced and ... implemented to ensure that children with special educational needs are educated, where possible, in an inclusive environment.  <\/blockquote> <p>LEAP has a proven track record in asserting the importance of inclusive education in line with Article 24 of the CRPD.  Inclusive education is the foundation for social inclusion and participation of all citizens in ordinary community life.  We know that the majority of children with disabilities attend their local neighbourhood school.  However, there are very few resources available to families to support the full inclusion of their child.  That is not just inclusion in the ordinary school building but inclusion in the whole curriculum and the full life of the school, such as the playground - to break it down - and inclusion on school trips.  <br\/><br\/>We understand that many children, as the Deputy has described, feel &ldquo;more comfortable&rdquo; placing their child in a special school setting.  Within that, we would include the autism spectrum disorder, ASD units, more commonly or typically known as classrooms.  I would like to make a comment on those in a moment, if I may.<\/p><p>In 2019, LEAP hosted a joint conference with the school of education in Trinity College Dublin called \"Belonging in School: The What, Why and How of Inclusive Education\".  This conference resulted in the formation of LEAP's families for inclusive education subcommittee, whose purpose is to provide a platform for families to share knowledge and experience of pursuing an inclusive education for their child.  During the pandemic, we had a meeting with Deputy Madigan at which we spoke about the issue of inclusion and the push at that time to return children with special educational needs to school ahead of their non-disabled peers.  We gave powerful testimony from families who are members of LEAP who did not want that.  They only wanted their children to return when all their children were returning.  They felt this proposal did not support their inclusion and that it othered them.  There was a lot of othering during the pandemic.  Imagine one child in a family going back while the others did not when, for years, the family had worked really hard to allow all of their children to go the same school, the local or neighbourhood school, so that they could be involved in the life of that school and community with their brothers and sisters.  Our families felt that this well-intentioned effort undid a lot of the careful work families had done with a view to full inclusion.<\/p><p> I will now comment on the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, increase in the number of special classes by more than 130%, from 548 in 2011 to 1,456 across the country now.  Some 1,192 of these classes are so-called autism spectrum disorder special classes.  Special units or classrooms are contrary to Article 24 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  LEAP is concerned about the normalisation of the segregation of children with autism in special classrooms.  We ask the committee to challenge the assumption that any child should be segregated and placed only with other children with the same or similar diagnostic labels.  Testimony from actual autistic adults is beginning to emerge.  These are adults who were segregated in these settings as children.  One will particularly hear this testimony in the UK and other countries.  It is not good.  We need to listen to these voices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021093000002#E01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Cassen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632956400,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Wynne for her question.

When it comes to access, I will have to try to select just one example.  When people are going to the cinema, they have plenty of different choices as to what to see.  However, a deaf person can only choose what has been subtitled.  Much of the time, that is just one film.  It very much depends on the cinema.  That is a general example of access.  When it comes to going to a restaurant or trying to order a sandwich, communication barriers can arise.  Even basic things such as devices being controlled by voice or having sounds but no visual representation when accessing physical buildings can cause issues.  Even with speakers, much of the time things are operated only through spoken language with no access through sign language.  I hope those examples are enough.  Ms Quigley will add to that response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021093000002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Grehan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632956400,"counter":383,"content":"<p>With regard to political life, Ms Grehan noted in her opening statement that three deaf candidates have stood for election at county council level.

We were constantly in search of interpreters who were willing to work voluntarily so that we could interact and discuss matters when canvassing in the community.  As the Deputy herself will know, going to local meetings of housing associations, public meetings and different local events and so on is a regular occurrence for those involved in political life.  Whether there is access through Irish Sign Language, ISL, very much varies.  That is a very negative aspect of being involved in political life.<\/p> <p>  In respect of cultural life, art and design, I have been involved with the deaf artists in our community and our deaf culture and deaf arts for many years.  It is very limited here in Ireland.  We very much depend on the funding that is available.  Opportunities to get involved and take part are very limited.  We have to apply for grants for monitoring programmes, development programmes and so on.  Even if we do receive those grants, they can be very limited and very small.  Of course, we always have to factor in the cost of interpreting.  A great responsibility is put on us rather than on the public arts institutions, theatres and the like, to provide interpretation and to make people aware that ISL access needs to be provided.

I am in my office and the bells for the Seanad are going off in the background.  I wish to thank the witnesses sincerely for their contributions and submissions, as well as the opening statements.  They are very impactful.  I wish to raise a few points.<\/p> <p>  I found Mr. McGrath's statement most striking.  What he described is not a one-day only event; it is not storytelling.  It is about the real lived experience and how we can ensure that everyone is included and that we are not making assumptions.  I read Mr. McGrath's opening statement and came away feeling that we should have invited him to attend the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage during the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Electoral Reform Bill 2020.  He would have been a very powerful witness there too.  I will follow up with a letter to that committee voicing my support for all that I have heard from Mr. McGrath today.  Perhaps, with his permission, I will include his opening statement.  We need to take on the challenge of accessibility of information and ensuring manifestos and other such documents are available.  I would welcome and appreciate any further comments Mr. McGrath may have on that.<\/p> <p>  To our friends representing the Irish Deaf Society, I would say that one of the very few positive things to come out of Covid was that every day, in the context of the delivery of information on Covid, we saw an ISL interpreter in front of us.  That normalised for the presence of ISL interpreters for everybody.  In fact, I miss them when they are not there now.  I think we should be building on that.  We have gotten used to it and have an expectation now.  We have an expectation of things being translated into Irish; we should have an expectation of always having an ISL interpreter there.  The representatives of the Irish Deaf Society have made very important points.  I am also a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  In that context, I would like to raise the point made by representatives of the Irish Deaf Society regarding co-ordination.  I suggest that, as a committee, we should write to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to emphasise the points that have been raised the Irish Deaf Society today.  I would like the witnesses to contribute to that letter by telling us what they would like us to include in it, highlighting the points they made to us in their opening statement.  Similarly, we should write to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht to emphasise the need to look at the BAI.  We should be using the voice of this committee.  We should be listening to the witnesses and ensuring we do their bidding.  They have given us an opening statement and a submission.  We should act on that and write, accordingly.  We should emphasise what the witnesses would like to say so that we are performing our duty of service to them.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the representatives of LEAP, I support the call for an \"ordinary life\" that was emphasised by Deputy Wynne.  Othering is something that was best understood in the conversations around, and the reaction to, the opening, or not, of classes in the context of Covid.  We saw it in recent weeks with NPHET information on self-isolation.  The advice came out and I was very glad to see that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, held meetings the next day from which clarifications arose and are continuing are to arise.  Another clarification was issued yesterday.  Therefore, we must keep front and centre at all times the idea that we are not othering.  I ask the witnesses to outline what they would like us to do to support that and to ensure we are doing that.<\/p> <p>  I noted that Ms Cassen initially referred to ASD units, then stated that the preferred terminology is now \"classes\".  That highlighted an issue for me.  I was hammered on social media when I used the term \"ASD units\" when I was beginning my advocacy work, particularly with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, on this issue.  There is a fear of using the wrong terminology in a way that results in othering.  How might we overcome that, provide a good service in listening to the witnesses and do what they tell us so that we are doing what we are supposed to be doing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021093000002#G00400","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632956400,"counter":389,"content":"<p>May we address four of the recommendations in the committee's first report, on aligning disability funding with the UNCRPD, or would the Chairman like us to do that at a later juncture?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021093000002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Cassen"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":390,"content":"<p>It is important that we hear it, but perhaps Ms Cassen can address the points raised by Senator Seery Kearney and respond to them directly first.

I would say that it is a difficult and nuanced point and position to make.  When we speak, we often speak from different roles in our lives and in different settings.  When my colleague, Ms Fitzgerald-Graham, speaks today, she will sometimes speak as a professional in her own field, but more often, she will speak as a mother.  The same applies to me.  However, when we speak as mothers, something funny happens and we risk becoming like a bad smell in the room.  I do not know how else to say it.  We are aware that we have to walk mindfully when we speak as mothers.  We want to draw the attention of committee again to our opening statement.  I hope it is apparent that from our inception nearly ten years ago, we have worked very heard to align all of our work with children and families with the UNCRPD.  Our work is about assisting families to stay on the typical, normative and valued life path.<\/p> <p>  I will get to my comments.  Frequently, government and services deal with individuals.  They deal with individuals just as individuals, as if they are not connected to families.  There is none of us living a good life that is not connected to other people.  Whatever government and services do, they must not seek to separate or alienate people from their family and friends, for it is they who constitute the enduring sources of love and support, however flawed at times, in people's lives.<\/p><p>If the goal of the UNCRPD is inclusion, I ask the committee how that is then achieved and why some people enjoy a rich and meaningful life when many others do not.  The disability advocate ally of LEAP, Jeremy Ward, stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe reality is that the full and positive lives of people with disabilities that we hear and read about do not happen by accident.  These inspirational stories can be told because someone had a vision and belief in what is possible, sometimes against considerable opposition, and planned to make it happen. <\/blockquote><p>That someone is frequently a family member and yet we ask the committee why family-based organisations such as LEAP struggle for funding and to be recognised under general comment No. 7 of the UNCRPD as a DPO?  We do not represent our children; we raise them.  We are not disability representative organisations but neither are we fully welcome or acknowledged in the DPO camp yet.  That is where the committee can help us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021093000002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Cassen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Very powerfully said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021093000002#H00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632956400,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her question and for her comment about seeing interpreters on the screen.  Sadly, there is no interpreter for the 9 p.m. news, the 1 p.m. news or the 6 p.m. news.  I know it is a positive start and hopefully it will lead to full access and better inclusion in society so that when one watches TV or the news there is access for the deaf community, similar to the Irish language news which is on at the moment.  Sometimes when there is an interpreter it is not put on the main RT&Eacute; news channel but it is on RT&Eacute; News Now.  We would like to see that on the mainstream channel, rather than being moved to a separate channel and almost hidden.<\/p> <p>  When children's schools were being closed due to the coronavirus, that was big news on the TV and it meant that so many children were home-schooled.  RT&Eacute;'s \"Home School Hub\" was set up and we had to ask RT&Eacute; to provide an ISL interpreter for that show, which it agreed to.  It was important that families educating at home could include all their children in watching the same programme, whether they were hearing or deaf.  That is another example of how we can encourage inclusion.

Following up from Mr. McGrath's point about the time needed for DPOs, the Department could hopefully champion time, budget and universal design in the planning of all government processes, activities and plans.  These matters need to be checked early.  Our work with the HSE during Covid, when we tried to update existing processes to include universal design after they were put in place, was difficult.  It is much more possible if it is included from the outset.<\/p> <p>  We would also love the Department to champion the efficient use of our limited resources.  For example, we engage with one organisation in respect of services on six different committees.  It is an unsustainable use of our resources.

So much has been brought up and I will focus on two or three aspects.  I was struck by the importance of time and space being allocated.  It is not just about the technical right to participate but it is about the time and space that make participation possible, enjoyable and meaningful.  I would like to hear more comment on that issue of time, especially in terms of public participation, meetings and discussions.  When I worked with the National Women's Council of Ireland, we found that women often went on to say what happened to them and then some man would explain what happened.  Mr. McGrath said that it is not just storytelling but it is about decision-making.  In this committee we always say we want to hear the experiences and analyses of people with disabilities because that is so important.  I ask the witnesses to talk more about the issue of time and participation and what could be done.<\/p> <p>  Points were made earlier about making sure that cultural venues, playgrounds and sports amenities are accessible.  I was happy to co-sponsor a Bill on playgrounds in the past.  I want to highlight something around that which also relates to the deaf community.  We will hear a lot about the national development plan in the next week or two and the committee made a detailed submission on it.  Something that was important to us in that submission was insisting that new State public spaces and buildings have universal design and accessibility because there will be a lot of capital expenditure on same in the NDP.  Could the witnesses comment on the importance of that?<\/p><p>We insisted specifically that the provisions of the Irish Sign Language recognition legislation, which I was proud to see passed by the last Seanad, be reflected in the design of buildings where there are to be public meetings or public performances.  Could the delegates comment on this?  Regarding the spatial aspect, it is not a matter of being <i>ad hoc<\/i>but of having the appropriate design from the beginning in any new public buildings or public spaces.<br\/><br\/>I would appreciate it if the delegates commented on the EU's Web accessibility directive.  There is now an obligation to have greater accessibility online in terms of participation.  In particular, there is an onus on public departments and bodies.  Could I have the delegates' sense of how this is going, how the measure is being implemented and what should be improved?  In the Oireachtas, for example, we should be able to do better at captioning debates.  While I am aware that we have the transcript and video, we should be able to follow up with subtitled debates.  People do not just want the summary; they want to engage and see where the political nuance is.  Where are the key gaps regarding participation and the implementation of the measures in the Irish sign language legislation?<br\/><br\/>Indirectly related to the new EU Web accessibility directive is the new legislation on online safety that is to be introduced in the Oireachtas in the autumn.  It is called the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill but it is transposing the audiovisual directive from Europe.  The directive is not just about protecting or avoiding harm; there is a duty to have inclusive cultural participation.  I am referring to <i>l'exception culturale<\/i>and the right to cultural participation, expression and diversity.  Could the delegates comment on that?  With the central focus on the protection aspects, which are important, proactively ensuring diversity in our media, including online media, and culture might get dropped.  Are there any comments on that?<br\/><br\/>My last point relates to special classes in schools and even to employment opportunities.  We have seen in Ireland a failure to avail of some of the opportunities that exist in terms of sheltered workspaces and so forth under EU law, but we have also seen, in other parts of Europe, the overuse of such spaces, whereby they become the only places where people access employment.  I am referring to ensuring access not only to employment, in respect of which Ireland is woefully behind the rest of Europe, but also to a fully diverse range of employment opportunities.<br\/><br\/>What are the steps to ensure education and employment, which are normally points of connectivity for people, do not become culs-de-sac for people with a disability, whereby the places or jobs found for them are not regarded as steppingstones?  What can we do to ensure we are building progression opportunities into employment and educational spaces?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021093000002#H00700","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632956400,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins.  She raised a lot of points.  On time and space, it is not just a question of the technical aspect; it is also about process.  It is a question of ensuring families with children with disabilities can undertake a process as a family, because families are not always on the same page on all these issues related to living a good and inclusive life.  In an attempt to get families on the same page, or even reading the same chapter of the same book, we bring families away each year to a live-in residential event, a weekend retreat.  We work with them on the question of what a good life looks like rather than on what constitutes a good service.  Asking the right questions is really important.  It is not really possible to work with families with children under the age of three, or children in arms.  There is too much going on in such families and they need to settle and get to a point where they can focus on major needs beyond the daily routine of an infant.  At that point, we introduce the notion of the good life, the ordinary life and the inclusive life, which links to all this good stuff and the thinking that if a child is not nursed and threaded into his or her local community from a very young age, it will be much harder for him or her to come back from a place of segregation and rejoin the normative life path.  That is why we work with children in the context of their families from the age of three years.<\/p> <p>  We give families a process, a piece of time in which they are all welcome.  There is a big welcome on the mat at all our events for them because many of them get used to being hidden in plain sight.  They are excluded from the point of the child's diagnosis.  The day they bring the child home from the hospital, they are excluded from many ordinary life events in their communities and become hidden in plain sight.  Therefore, time is critical.  Over years, we have conversations with families.  They are welcome and they are invited out of their isolation to our events.  We place great emphasis on hospitality, welcome, reciprocity and belonging.  The process that the Senator described, beyond just a technical process, is important.  The warm, human welcome is important.  <\/p> <p>  That brings me on to the issue of design.  Design is critical.  In this regard, the Senator mentioned playgrounds but it is often the case that what we do in the name of inclusive design, while well intentioned, fails.  For example, a swing surrounded by a fence for children with physical disabilities, which may be funded by the Lions club or another such charity, may be very well intentioned but it puts a physical barrier between the child using it and all the other children in the playground.  While it is not the intention, it others them.  Similarly, I see a rise in the installation of hubs on university campuses for neurodiverse students.  We believe in LEAP that those hubs, although very well intentioned, are othering.  I do not know whether it is positive to be seen to climb into one of those hubs.  Does it, in fact, other people?  We have to be very careful when we consider design for inclusion.  We must consider whether what we are doing is clumsy.  We need to kick the tyres of inclusion.  If we call something inclusive, it is very often not, based on our experience in LEAP.  It does not matter if we call autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classrooms units or classrooms; changing the label, or the plaque on the door of the building, does not really change what goes on inside.  Many try to claim that autism units and classrooms are inclusive.  By our definition, they are not.<\/p><p>By our definition, inclusion is what people your age are doing and what people from your culture are doing.  It is what is typical, optimal and normative.<\/p><p> I will move on to discuss work.  Sheltered work has no place in modern society.  It is not compatible with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  Work enclaves have no place in modern society either.  There were well-intentioned efforts at inclusion that put people with the same diagnostic label to work in a cafe.  That was a feel-good thing.  Such a person may get a wage and feel great.  It is, in many ways, a valued role better than what those people had before.  However, it is not good enough and we can do better.  I challenge this committee to think carefully about the issues with placing people in work enclaves.  It is a step forward from sheltered work but it is not yet good enough.  It is not yet full inclusion in open employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021093000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Cassen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I will go to our other guests because there were a number of questions about sign language.  I will come to Mr. McGrath, too.  I will note that spaces have been provided in universities.  If different needs are being accommodated within a shared space, I do not believe that needs to be othering.  The othering aspect of that comes more from a societal attitude to people using spaces in different ways and for different needs.  I think it is coming back to the design point.  Having design that includes, if necessary, spaces allowing for sensory reduction creates an inclusion whereby it is okay that it is visible that people in this space have different needs and that the spaces have been designed to accommodate them.  That is a slight query I have in that regard.

In doing that, we need to consult Article 4.3 of the UNCRPD, which states that we must ask deaf people what we can do to make a building more accessible.  It is a waste of time and expenditure if we do not do that in the first instance.<\/p> <p>  We must talk about universal design for deaf children and older people.  Special supports are made available to deaf children in schools.  Is that enough support or full support?  It is not.  Many deaf children within mainstream schools do not have enough support from the Government.  I would recommend that schools should have a curriculum from primary through to post-primary for sign language for everyone, not only for deaf people.  When sign language is taught in schools, deaf children are better able to socialise with their peers out in the playground when they go out to play.  When they go out to the playground at the moment, they do not have the same access.  Irish sign language, ISL, needs to be on the curriculum in primary and post-primary schools.<\/p> <p>  Likewise, opportunities should exist for older people.  We had a facility at St. Joseph's House for Adult Deaf and Deafblind in Stillorgan, which has now closed due to HIQA recommendations and older deaf people have gone out to live in the community.  They may feel isolated, even within nursing homes and nursing home care.  We need and must provide sign language access in order for them to feel included within the newer communities to which they have gone.

When we talk about websites being technologically accessible, Government websites, in general, provide very little ISL.  I would recommend straightforward planning.  The deaf community have ISL translation providers and through the Irish Deaf Society, IDS, we can consult and translate documentation on Government websites.  Not all deaf people within the deaf community are able to read English at a higher register.  Most deaf people would prefer the information in their first language of ISL on the page.  It is a straightforward issue and is not expensive to add onto a website.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about the ISL Act, it was fantastic that it was passed in 2017, as the Senator said.  That was a momentous occasion for us and I remember it well.  In 2020, a register of ISL interpreters was established.  That is a positive.  Last June, a pilot project was established for a social inclusion voucher scheme whereby funding has been made available to deaf people to allow them to access interpreters of their own choice in attending cultural, religious, social and other events.  It started in June but they have extended it by an extra month.  From the pilot project, we will be able to ascertain whether it should continue, and the IDS will be lobbying for its continuation.  Deaf people can book interpreters for themselves without having to worry about the money because the funding is there.  That could be to go to the theatre, to attend a one-to-one meeting with a solicitor to make a will and so on.  Deaf people do not have to rely on and seek grants and funding but can instead access a social inclusion voucher scheme to go to these events.

She mentioned the attitude of the general public to universal design and spaces.  That could translate to mean culture change within Government organisations.  One of the biggest culture changes needed is coming back to the idea of universal design and including that at the start of every single process.  To offer an example from my experience today, and this is in no way a criticism of the Oireachtas, but I was struck by the circular nature of this room.  When I started working with the Irish Deaf Society, I learned very quickly that theatre-style seating is no good because deaf people need to be able to see each other signing.  Looking at someone's back does not work.<\/p> <p>  We have also noticed here today that both Ms Grehan and Ms Quigley have to stand up in order to be seen while they are signing.  If universal design is included at the start of a design process for a room such as this one, the small physical barriers that do not affect me as a hearing person giving testimony would have been designed in a slightly different way.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the European Accessibility Act, we have some very good information from our partners the European Union of the Deaf.  We would love to have the opportunity to share with the committee its research work on how that can the Act can be implemented.  Perhaps that is something on which we can follow up afterwards.<\/p> <p>  There was also a question about barriers to the implementation of the ISL Act.  The IDS is producing its own shadow report on the UNCRPD and we are including some information about the implementation of the ISL Act in that report.  We would love to be able to send that on to the committee.  The need for deaf awareness training throughout Government is key because that awareness leads to action.  We would like to promote deaf awareness training throughout Government and the State provided by deaf people who give their first-hand experience and support to organisations that want to make their engagements more accessible.<\/p><p>Capacity is a huge barrier.  The number of interpreters employed in Ireland is limited and it creates huge problems in timing.  The number of people who are teaching ISL is also very limited.

It struck a chord with me when she spoke about people with disabilities facing cul-de-sacs in their lives.  It brings me back to the notion of where we come from in LEAP whereby the role of the families is poorly understood.  If we want the people we love to be connected to others and to be part of society as adults we have to think about the relationships they form when they are children.  Their classmates and the neighbours they grow up with will become their co-workers and friends later in life and they are less likely to meet this cul-de-sac the Senator described so eloquently.  It is about the role of families in supporting the full inclusion of their child with a disability.<\/p> <p>  We need to think about various roles now if we are serious about implementation of the UNCRPD.  We speak about roles such as inclusion facilitators and community animators.  Our vision is to move beyond the approach of employing only therapists, commissioning only separate or segregated services or having only one pathway for people with a disability towards segregated sheltered workshops.

There are the Intreo offices and services and employment to support people with disabilities.  Unfortunately, those who work in the service do not have the communication skills to communicate with the deaf community.  They are not interpreters.  In real life it is impossible to provide this type of support for interpreter provision all of the time.  Of course there are limitations.  When it comes to the deaf community the barriers lie in communication.<\/p> <p>  There is also an attitude that a deaf person is not able to work or to do certain roles.  There is a real barrier when it comes to attitude.  Deaf people are able to work and they definitely can.  Sometimes health and safety is used as an excuse to say a deaf person is not able to be involved and that it would break health and safety regulations.

Often people have to either phone a number or send a letter.

If they want to take all of the questions together I do not mind.  To follow from what the Irish Deaf Society representatives said in response to Senator Higgins, they highlighted the forthcoming DPO coalition report, which will highlight that 24% of disabled people have difficulty using their right to vote and 55% have difficulty contacting local representatives.  This is concerning.  Will the witnesses outline concrete actions we can take individually as public representatives and that we can push for as a committee?  The witnesses also mentioned the under-resourcing of ISL supports.  I have been seeking updates from public bodies on their compliance with the ISL Act.  Will the witnesses elaborate on areas where ISL needs are not being met?<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. McGrath of the National Platform of Self Advocates for his opening statement and for taking a stand on participation in all forms of decision-making.  He highlighted the need for all public processes to be accessible in how they are organised.  Like others, I was taken by his point that people are only allowed to participate in storytelling and not in decision-making.  Will Mr. McGrath discuss further how we can meaningfully include people with intellectual disabilities?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for LEAP.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions and for working to highlight the vital role that families play.  Their points on increasing employment rates among people with intellectual disabilities is incredibly important.  The witnesses mentioned international examples.  There is Project RISE in the US.  Will the witnesses expand on what was involved in this project and the type of structures and programmes we can put in place here?  As one of their recommendations they mentioned the importance of creating inclusive neighbourhoods.  Will they outline the significance of this and how we can foster these types of supportive communities?  The witnesses also spoke about the optimal age for employment being 13.  Will they elaborate on the reason for this as I am curious?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021093000002#L01000","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I am anxious to get everybody in so I invite Deputy Higgins to ask her questions after which we will go back to the witnesses to respond to the points made.<\/p><p>I thank the Chair.  I was panicking because I could see the clock ticking and I very much wanted to contribute to this discussion.  I was in the committee room earlier to hear the witnesses.  It was great to be able to be there to see how ISL worked in a practical way.  We have heard contributions on exactly that.  If rooms were set up with that in mind, that would all happen a little more naturally and would be a little easier for everybody involved.<\/p><p> I enjoyed today's discussion.  I particularly commend Mr. McGrath, Ms Fitzgerald-Graham and Ms Grehan on the points they made.  I was struck by what Mr. McGrath spoke about regarding the focus on full participation.  It is not just about consultation but full participation when it comes to decision-making on how things are run and how they are done.  I heard loud and clear his point about the funding that will be necessary to make that happen.<\/p><p> There has been a lot of discussion, especially in the second half of this meeting, on work experience and the need for meaningful professional positions to be made available to people of all abilities.  I was involved in such a scheme in my previous role when I worked for PayPal, which collaborated with the Trinity Centre for People with Intellectual Disabilities.  As Mr. McGrath said, it was a work experience programme that turned into meaningful jobs at the end.  We need to see more of that.  <\/p><p> I was quite struck by what Ms Fitzgerald-Graham spoke about in respect of the Washington experience, RISE and what had happened there.  That is something we should strive to achieve.  In my constituency, Stewarts, where I was over the summer, do a fantastic job in supporting people when it comes to inclusion.  It was great to hear so many stories about their clients who are in the working world and who are making meaningful contributions in the professional world, as well as in every other walk of life.  We need more of that.  Ms Fitzgerald-Graham's contribution was particularly positive.  She talked about everything from a possibility, as opposed to a barrier, perspective.  We need more of that kind of language because that is what we want to do.  We want to enable people to thrive and to fulfil their full potential.<\/p><p> Ms Grehan spoke about an issue relating to the deaf community in particular.  I was struck by one thing that would never have occurred to me, which were the expenses and additional expenditure involved for a member of the deaf community to run for election.  What can we do to support them?  The situation does not seem fair or right.  I was also struck by the figure of 55%.  Ms Grehan spoke about 55% of people from the deaf community having difficulty contacting local representatives.  I would love to learn a little more about that.  She spoke about literacy sometimes being an issue within the community.  Is that why people are not able to email local representatives?  What are the barriers and how can we break them down?  It is important that we do so.<\/p><p> I was also struck by what Ms Grehan said about the television show, which was such a success for so many years.  I intend to write to RT&Eacute; to ask why it is not being aired any more and what plans there are to bring in a replacement that would engage with people from the Irish deaf community. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021093000002#L01100","speaker":"1456","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":419,"content":"<p>In the few minutes we have left, I ask each group to respond, as briefly as possible, to the points made by Deputies Cairns and Higgins, in addition to the outstanding point made by Deputy Canney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021093000002#M00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632956400,"counter":420,"content":"<p>It is very important that people with disabilities are trained at an early stage to work in the community.

The project is going very well but one UK precedent I would like the committee to focus on is the access to work scheme.  In the UK, interpreters are provided for working people for their entire working life.  There is a net return to the Exchequer for that expense.

RISE is an organisation that has a great history.  Its members have presented to the National Disability Authority.  What they and other supported employment organisations such as Inclusion Alberta in Alberta, Canada, have found is that supported employment is the way to go.  The type of employment support projects or initiatives we have traditionally had for people with intellectual disabilities and autism, more commonly known as developmental disabilities in North America, do not necessarily provide the right types of support on the job.  Supported employment can assist an employer, for example, to look at a job that is not already being done in an organisation and to create a new job that does not exist.  Employers might go into a plant, factory or warehouse and see there is a particular task that is not being done.  They would then carve out a new role for a person to go in and take on, for full payment and with full terms and conditions provided.<\/p> <p>  We also want to mention Inclusion Alberta, to which LEAP has taken families.  We have undertaken study tours around the world and we have taken families to countries and organisations that are doing extraordinary work towards the full inclusion of people with disabilities.  Many of them are family-based organisations.  The committee might want to look at Inclusion Alberta.  It has a Rotary employment partnership whereby it works with Rotarians, businesspeople and the like in communities.  It does not use job coaches but places people with intellectual disabilities in open employment using the Rotary Club as its main partner.  There is no job coach but support is provided by an inclusion facilitator.  It is extraordinarily successful.  It leverages the support of the community and business partners in that community to place people in jobs.  The workers, as we know, are extremely loyal and extremely good at timekeeping.<\/p><p>We know this because LEAP has spent time there.  We have been to Alberta on three occasions.  We have spent time with these projects to learn what is best in employment practice for people with intellectual disabilities.  We use 13 as the base age because that is the typical and normative age at which all of us in this meeting probably got our first part-time job.  I know I had mine when I was 11.  Back in England all those years ago, I had a paper round.  Many of us started work at 11, 12, 13 or 14.  If we are parents, hopefully our own children started work around that time.  It has got a little later with the pandemic.  It has probably not happened at all.  If it has, it has probably not happened in the same way.  As always with everything in LEAP, we recommend that young people and children with disabilities do what their peers are doing at the same age and stage.  When we say \"peers\", we do not mean other people with the same diagnosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021093000002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Cassen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632956400,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, we must bring the session to a close.
