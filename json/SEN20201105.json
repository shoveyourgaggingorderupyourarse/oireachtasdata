It is such an important issue and we still have major problems with water in rural Ireland.  That is why I and my colleague, Senator Byrne, are raising this matter today.  The lack of infrastructure is paralysing the renewal of villages and towns and that is something on which we both fought during the programme for Government negotiations.  If we do not sort out our water network, we will not have housing or people living in our villages and towns again.  People will not move back into derelict buildings and they will not be able to build houses in the serviced sites around our villages and towns.  I will give one example but I could cite many between Malin Head to Mizen Head.  Broadford is a lovely village on the other side of the county in east Clare, very near Limerick city.  It is a perfect place for people who cannot afford the city prices or who do not want to deal with city traffic or large schools and businesses.  Such people could move to Broadford but it has no water infrastructure.  It has an amazing school and is a lovely village but without water infrastructure nothing is going to happen there.  There are so many beautiful old buildings that could be lived in, renewed and revived but they need water treatment plants, as do many other towns.<\/p><p>A total of 36 areas in ten counties are still releasing untreated wastewater into our environment.  In 57 areas across 21 counties, raw sewage discharges are the only significant pollutant for bodies of water.  We often try to blame farmers for everything but I am claiming this one back as a problem of raw sewage.  Some 66% of environmental water pollution incidents are due to a lack of sufficient treatment capacity.<\/p><p>Of course we have one-off issues with water as well but one very important issue has come to light.  It is becoming so serious now that families are ringing me whose children are experiencing kidney failure as a result of swimming in water with E. coli.  This is happening again and again.  County Clare had to close its beaches numerous times over the short summer during which businesses could make some money.  That is why I am going to keep highlighting this as often as I can until we get the funding sorted.  It was great to see this issue included in the budget but today we want clarity around when the Government is going to act.  We set up Irish Water to solve the significant problems that existed such as half our treated water leaking but we need to take this seriously if we are serious about regional rebalance.  Now that people can work from home more, this is the most important time to do this.  If we do it right, it could be a real turning point and villages and towns that have been waning for years to finally becoming bright, shiny places to live in again.  That is what we need for people's mental, physical and social health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#B00500","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I echo the remarks of the Senator.  Much as this is an issue in Clare, it is also an issue in counties Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow.  This is not just an environmental concern.  Dealing with this issue could revitalise our rural communities and villages.  We have a planning issue whereby many people are being told they cannot have one-off housing, but we should at least allow them to live in their local villages.  Doing so will also support the local shops, post offices and schools.  Our problem at the moment is that many villages lack the three Ws - water, Wi-Fi, and wastewater.  If we can address those matters, we can revolutionise how we support rural living.  This is about small towns and villages all over the country such as Ferns, Camolin, Our Lady's Island, Ramsgrange and Campile in County Wexford.  There are many others and I am sure the Minister of State could name some in Kilkenny as well.  Imagine if we as a Government were able to provide the infrastructure to those villages.  It would support our remote working strategy and would be far more sustainable environmentally, but most important, the quality of life for people living in those communities would be transformed.  That is why both I and Senator Garvey wanted to raise this but I am sure it is a concern of Senators in all parties and Members of both Houses.  We ask that the Government prioritises a programme to provide the necessary water and wastewater infrastructure for our rural towns and villages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#C00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Garvey and Byrne for raising this important issue and doing it so well and speaking so eloquently on behalf of the communities they represent.

If we are serious about balanced regional development and our smaller towns and villages, water and wastewater infrastructure, along with broadband and Wi-Fi, are critical infrastructure.

It is timely and important.  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has had statutory responsibility for all aspects of public water service planning, delivery and operation at the national, regional and local levels.  As the Senators will be aware, prior to that the 31 local authorities were responsible and would have had the capability to fulfil that responsibility, were it not for persistent underfunding.  As part of budget 2021, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has secured funding of more than &euro;1.4 billion to support water services.  This includes &euro;1.3 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water.  This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and wastewater services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including in rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area.  The programme for Government commits to supporting the take-up of Irish Water's small towns and villages growth programme, which is intended to provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements which would not otherwise be provided for in its capital investment plan.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that Irish Water is subject to independent economic regulation by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, which determines the revenue required by Irish Water to meet its efficient operating and capital costs to ensure that it operates in an efficient manner in delivering its services to customers.  Therefore, Irish Water put forward to the CRU for consideration proposals for a small towns and villages growth programme as part of its capital investment plan for the period from 2020 to 2024.  The programme is intended to support of a number of the national policy objectives and national strategic outcomes under the national planning framework.  I understand from Irish Water that an allocation of &euro;97.5 million for this programme was approved by the CRU.  I also understand that the design of projects is now commencing and that investment under the programme will begin to deliver in the coming years.  Irish Water is working with local authorities across the country to ensure the investment supports the growth of identified settlements where these are prioritised in line with the local authority development plans, which again align and will come on stream in the coming months.<\/p><p>In addition to the major investment delivered by Irish Water, my Department also funds rural water investment under the multi-annual rural water programme.  This programme supports investment in community-based group schemes and the improvement of wells and septic tanks.  The current investment programme is based on recommendations from the working group established in April 2018 to conduct a review of rural water services.  <\/p><p>There is a two-strand approach to the considerations of the working group.  The first strand considered the composition and distribution of funding under the rural water programme while the second is considering the long-term future resourcing of the rural water sector more generally.  The issue of wastewater infrastructure in villages not serviced by Irish Water is a matter which the working group will consider as part of its work.  The Department expects a further report from the group in 2021.<\/p><p>I again acknowledge the Senators for raising this important matter.  It is vitally important that we continue to keep it on the agenda.  They can be absolutely assured of the Government's commitment to delivering water and wastewater infrastructure for rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#C00300","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

This issue of how we are going to cope with the devastation of the flooding is very important for west Cork and its residents and for Cork County Council.  On 19 and 20 August 2020, there was a very severe storm with exceptional winds and rain, and within seven days, on 25 August, there was another period of 12 hours of torrential rain, which caused exceptional damage, particularly to the roads of west Cork.  We have all seen the flooding in places like Rosscarbery, Bantry, Skibbereen and Bandon, where there were frightening scenes that really affected businesses and households throughout the entire province itself.<\/p> <p>The issues pertain to the towns such as Bandon, Bantry, Skibbereen, Dunmanway, Rosscarbery, Clonakilty, Leap and Ballydehob, which all suffered serious damage.  However the secondary roads were destroyed, and that has been the core issue.  The road network in county Cork is an amazing 12,000 km in length; it is the longest road network in Ireland.  The amount of damage done to that network, and mainly to secondary roads, is estimated at &euro;4.6 million.  Cork County Council is going through a budget process at the moment, which is very hard on the local authority.  It is using reserves to keep the council afloat, and it has seen major budget cuts in areas such as road maintenance, village renewal, beach cleaning and toilet cleaning.  This deficit in the budget of almost &euro;4.6 million is having a major impact on how it can provide services going forward.<\/p> <p>I seek clarity from the Minister of State on what can be done in respect of the damage done to the majority of the secondary roads in west Cork.  The issue is that only &euro;1 million has been spent to date, as another &euro;3.4 million is to be spent as soon as the council receives the funding to fix the road network itself.  Without that, the secondary roads in west Cork in particular will be in a very poor state.  I refer here to places such as Bantry, Schull and Skibbereen.  These are very important parishes and parts of the county because an infrastructure is required for the tourism on which we all depend and which is not there at the moment.  If we do not have the infrastructure, we will not have the throughput of tourists on which this part of the world really depends.<\/p> <p>Therefore, I seek clarity and a pathway to ensure that Cork gets this funding because with it, the network can be rebuilt, that is, the roads that are badly required in west Cork and building can take place going forward, once the Covid-19 crisis is over. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#E00300","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.

I want to offer our sympathies to all of the families and businesses that were affected by the flooding in county Cork.  It is something that I experienced in Kilkenny, when it used to flood before the flood scheme was implemented there.  Certainly, I know from standing in homes and business when the floodwater is there, that it is a really devastating, disheartening, difficult and challenging time for people when there is persistent flooding, as seems to be happening in this case.<\/p> <p>My Department undertakes the lead Department role, as set out in the strategic emergency management, SEM, framework of 2017, in relation to co-ordination of national level response to flooding emergencies, where warranted.

My Department seeks to support local authorities by requesting additional funding for exceptional costs incurred in the immediate response to severe weather events such as those experienced in County Cork in recent months.  Such eligible costs relate to the response, clean-up and necessary immediate works associated with the event only, including the hire of plant and contractors necessary for immediate works, the purchase of materials required for response and clean-up and any staff overtime payments relating to an immediate clean-up.  Capital costs associated with infrastructural damage, flood defence works or cost planned works are not eligible.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the OPW has responsibility for leading and co-ordinating the implementation of a national flood risk policy approved in 2004.  This policy involves the development of a planned programme of prioritised feasible works, with a greater emphasis on non-structural measures.  We cannot discount the fact that the impact of climate change is now manifesting in these extreme weather events, such as extreme flooding, and rainfall patterns.  The overarching objective of the Government is to try to tackle that and it should be recognised.  The OPW is delivering a multi-annual programme of capital investment in flood relief measures, including major and minor works schemes now planned for future measures in areas of significant flood risk.

These are specific items relating to the roads programme and an additional emergency fund because of the persistent occurrence of these severe flooding events.  I am more than happy to take the Senator's concerns back within the Department and to relay the points he has raised.  These events will occur in the future.  In that context, it is important that the Government is able to respond to the needs of communities and local authorities when road infrastructure, particularly that in rural areas, is severely damaged as a result of such events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#F00300","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Urban Development","time":1604572200,"counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#G00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, to the House and I wish him the very best in his role.  On 9 July, I spoke on the Order of Business on the eve of a decision being made by Waterford City and County Council regarding planning permission for a transformative 125,000 sq. m mixed-use development on the north quays in Waterford city.  The Minister of State is well aware of this project because I have spoken to him about it and explained it on several occasions.  It is, however, worthwhile outlining the significance of this development for Waterford and the south-east region.<\/p> <p>I firmly believe this project will act as a catalyst for a decade of accelerated growth, in line with the projections outlined in Project Ireland 2040.  That is why I have promoted this project and worked hard to ensure its delivery since I was Mayor of Waterford in 2016, when the site was first designated as a strategic development zone, SDZ.  Some people dispute that a rising tide lifts all boats, but I could not disagree more in this instance.  This is not just about this particular development, but about the wider follow-on development in housing and many other areas, which is already at an advanced stage of discussion.  The project aims to deliver significant retail, hotel and conference facilities, prime city centre offices and 300 apartments and it will be a game changer for Waterford and the entire region.  The previous Fine Gael Government recognised the potential of the project, including its potential to create significant number of jobs in the area, and that is why this project was prioritised in Project Ireland 2040.  It was listed in the national development plan and funding of &euro;20 million has been allocated to it by the National Transport Authority, NTA, and urban regeneration and development fund, URDF.<\/p> <p>Despite these developments, significant uncertainty has remained about this project.  The uncertainty exists because Waterford City and County Council requires funding of &euro;110 million over four years to facilitate the construction of enabling infrastructure for this prime brownfield site.  This involves a public transportation bridge over the River Suir to link the north quays SDZ with the city centre, the relocation of Plunkett Station to the centre of the site to create a modern public transportation interchange and the upgrading of road infrastructure in and around the site.  These works are of critical importance for this exciting project.<\/p> <p>Such investment will unlock &euro;400 million in private sector investment and create more than 2,900 jobs in an area with a stubbornly high unemployment rate.  I believe this project is the litmus test for the national planning framework and the commitments contained in the programme for Government for balanced regional development.  Significant Government investment in Waterford and the south-east region is overdue.  I stress that time is of the essence for this project.  A decision is urgently needed to enable Waterford City and County Council to progress the tender for the bridge, roads and transportation hub and to enable the finalisation of contracts with the developer.<\/p> <p>Many have doubted the Government's commitment to this project in recent years.  I am proud to say I am not one of them.  However, the time has passed for talking and uttering positive reassuring words about this project.  It is now time for tangible action and that requires that a memorandum go to the Cabinet seeking approval for the funding I outlined.  I hope the Minister of State will have a positive update for me.  I would also like him to give me an indication of when further funding is due to be announced under the URDF.  Councils across the country are eagerly awaiting that news, including my local authority in Waterford which has a significant project proposal for the wider Viking triangle and cultural quarter areas.  I am sure that comprehensive proposal has scored well in the Department.  I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House and I look forward to his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#G00200","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and for the opportunity to discuss the North Quays project in Waterford, and particularly Waterford City and County Council's bid for the North Quays under the urban regeneration project.  As the Senator outlined in detail, this is a significant project for the region.  The urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, funding is designed to unlock the potential of our five cities and large towns.  This project is key to doing that for Waterford and the region.<\/p> <p>The Senator correctly pointed to the cumulative work carried out over the past six years by the previous Government.  Indeed, the former Minister of State, Paudie Coffey, designated the area as a strategic development zone in an order made by the Government under SI 30 of 2016.  That showed the commitment the then Government had to realising its potential under the URDF.  Indeed, it made it a core central plank of the national planning framework in terms of our objective to have compact development.  I understand the Senator was the mayor at the time an event was held in Waterford to try to progress this project.  Since my appointment to the Department, the Senator has been quick to contact me about it and put forward the genuine case for it.<\/p> <p>It is important that the Government backs this project.  As regards the history, &euro;6 million of URDF funding was allocated in November 2018 and a further &euro;30 million of URDF funding was allocated in June 2019 to assist this project through the stages.  I know from talking to the Senator and the former Minister of State, Paudie Coffey, how important this is for the region and the value that the city, the business community and the residents put on it.  One must remember that this site has been derelict for decades and it has been a hindrance to unlocking the potential in the city.  I believe this project will achieve this.  It is important for our five cities and large towns, and, indeed, villages that they get regeneration funding to assist them.<\/p> <p>On 26 November 2018, the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government announced URDF funding of &euro;100 million for a total of 88 projects across the country.  I referred to the two allocations that were made from the URDF for the North Quays project.  In mentioning this project, I am mindful of places such as the Docklands in Dublin, which had a special designation and, in the context of an all-Ireland approach, what the Belfast quarters did for regeneration in that area of Northern Ireland.  This can be key for Waterford city.  I appreciate the Senator's concern to try to progress this project.  He has my office inundated with queries about it.  I also note that a media notice has been circulated for next Tuesday afternoon regarding a visit to Waterford.  I hope that proves successful for the Senator and his hard work in the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#H00100","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response, for recognising the importance of this project to Waterford and the south east and for acknowledging the work of our former colleague, Paudie Coffey, designating the site as a strategic development zone.

I wish to record my thanks to each and every one of them for not giving in or saying that the project was going to fail, as many people have suggested.  I again stress the importance and urgency of funding to Waterford City and County Council for the enabling infrastructure for the site.

I noted the Minister's remarks on it at the recent meeting of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.

It is a bit like the passport, in that it is a symbolic representation of being a European citizen and being entitled to access EU rights.<\/p> <p>Like many people, I was very heartened and encouraged to hear remarks from the Government in April last year indicating that it would be prepared to cover the cost of retaining the EHIC for all citizens in the North.  That is a very important step and I support it.

There is an awful lot of work going on in regard to that so I will just outline how it will work.<\/p> <p>As Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile noted, in April 2019 the Government sought to make arrangements so that the people of Northern Ireland would continue to have access to EHIC rights in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  At that time, we were preparing for a situation where there might not be a withdrawal agreement.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Now, of course, we are dealing with a different context.  The withdrawal agreement, of which the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is an integral part, is now in place between the EU and the UK and has the protection of international law.<\/p><p>The Government recognises the importance placed by residents of Northern Ireland on maintaining the EHIC equivalent rights.  This matter is being addressed in discussions between the EU and the UK on the future relationship, which we continue to monitor.<\/p><p>We are also aware that in line with obligations under the withdrawal agreement, the UK Government will provide eligible EU nationals and their family members who are resident in the UK before the end of the transition period and, therefore, covered under the withdrawal agreement, with a UK-issued EHIC.  Further clarity from the UK on this will be required in order to assess if there are any implications for Northern Ireland, including in relation to eligibility.  In the event that these issues are not adequately resolved, preparations are under way for a scheme to ensure continued access to EHIC equivalent arrangements for eligible residents in Northern Ireland.  The scheme under development would allow residents in Northern Ireland to seek reimbursement for the cost of necessary healthcare while on a temporary stay in another EU or EEA member state or in Switzerland, should it be required, from 1 January 2021.<\/p><p>The Department of Health is working to progress arrangements that are compatible with domestic and EU law and to ensure that the HSE has the necessary operational arrangements in place to administer this in the relevant scenario.  Detail on this can be found in the Brexit readiness action plan, published on 9 September, and Part 3 of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020, published on the Oireachtas website on 29 October, which will be discussed with Members in the coming weeks.  We will be in this House to discuss those issues probably towards the end of this month.  I was planning to be here on 23 November.<\/p><p>More broadly, the EU rights of Irish and, therefore, EU citizens from Northern Ireland are specifically addressed in the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The protocol confirms that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy, exercise and have access to rights, opportunities and benefits that come with EU membership.  It is important to underline that under any scenario Irish citizens, no matter where they live, will continue to have EU citizenship.  They will continue to enjoy the right to live and work throughout the EU and the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality.<\/p><p>While it remains our hope that access for Irish citizens in the North to certain EU programmes and benefits can be adequately addressed in the context of the future relationship, we are proactively working to ensure that the people or Northern Ireland can continue to enjoy access to EU rights, opportunities and benefits into the future, as they do today, including the benefits linked to holding a European health insurance card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#J00400","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response, which was fairly comprehensive in one sense.

I appreciate also that there are current restrictions on travel but hopefully we will get through to the other end of that.<\/p> <p>People need to hear and understand how this is measure will work.

We will have an opportunity to tease through the details of that legislation when it comes through the House.<\/p> <p>One of those elements is in this space.  The Department of Health and the HSE are putting in place a scheme to ensure continued access to EHIC-equivalent arrangements for Northern Ireland citizens.  Of course, that needs to be compatible with domestic and EU legislation.  As I have said in the past, if necessary the Irish Government will pay for this showing a commitment to people in Northern Ireland to try to ensure that as they move through or go on their holidays in the European Union and if they run into difficulty and need to access health services and so on, there will be a reimbursement equivalent to EHIC which would obviously be as streamlined as we can make it for citizens to reimburse their healthcare costs through the HSE.<\/p> <p>We will put in place a system that is as simple to administer and as streamlined as we can make it.  We need to do it within our own legislative parameters and it also needs to be consistent with EU legislation.  Of course, we do not control legislation in Northern Ireland.  However, I think the Senator will recognise there is a serious commitment to this by the Government.  He will see that in the legislation.

Anyone from north County Louth will be familiar with Centre Travel, KT Travel, McGuill Travel and O'Callaghan Travel.  These businesses combined have been in operation for 180 years, employ 30 staff and have an annual turnover of more than &euro;16 million, so they are by no means small fry.  These are small enterprises that give excellent personalised customer service.  They were thriving viable businesses but they now see no light.  They still give an excellent service with negative return.  To give an example, one of these travel agents has had only five bookings since September.  This week, it will issue 75 cheques in refunds to its customers.  As we know, there are costs associated with refunds and staff are needed to do this work.  Other outgoings include cumulative bank charges, office charges, rent and heat.  One travel agent has estimated that it takes up to nine hours for each refund to be organised with all the administrative hurdles, telephone calls, emails, etc.  All money is going out.  Travel agents are not normal retail outlets. <\/p><p>Let us remember that travel agents only make money when customers board a flight and the plane takes off.  As we know, some flights are taking off but the Government advice is that people should not travel so people are not travelling.  In such instances, under EU law, travel agents are obliged to refund the cost of flights whereas airlines are not obliged to do so.  Five travel agencies have gone into liquidation.  Under EU law, customers are refunded.  Must the Government or the Commission for Aviation Regulation now provide refunds?<\/p><p>Travel agents are seeking clarity on whether they are eligible for the Covid restrictions support scheme.  Is the scheme based on turnover or profits?<\/p><p>The refund credit note is of no practical assistance to travel agencies as it only protects customers if a travel agent goes into liquidation.  A refund credit note does not help travel agents to keep their business running and only protects customers.  It is important that customers are protected but these businesses still need a refund.  <\/p><p>I stress that the travel agents that I have spoken to respect and understand the restrictions but they need help to ensure their businesses still exist when the restrictions are lifted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#L00400","speaker":"1671","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McGreehan for raising this very important issue.  She raised it as a national issue but recognised the importance of the sector to the north east and listed travel agents in County Louth.<\/p> <p>I am very familiar with the important service that travel agents provide nationally to the industry.  They support the corporate sector and service the domestic market and people here who travel abroad.  I recognise that travel agents put a lot of work in at the start of the pandemic and worked with us.  I have certainly seen that in the case of Martin Skelly in Navan Travel and Eimer Hannon in Hannon Travel.  Travel agents have worked with the State to bring people who were stuck abroad home.  They have also engaged with customers in the past couple of months and tried to provide that service.  At the start of Covid, the sector stepped up and helped to get people home who were in trouble and solved a lot of issues.  The travel sector is very relevant in local communities.<\/p> <p>I recognise that many businesses and thousands of people working in the travel agent industry have been severely impacted by the collapse in national and international travel and tourism as a result of Covid-19 restrictions.  The needs of these businesses and their employees have formed part of our consideration of the range of grants and funding assistance that we have introduced in budget 2021 and in the July stimulus plan.  We are developing our recovery plan, which will be launched in November or December. <\/p> <p>I agree with the Senator that the travel agent sector recognises the importance of restrictions.

Compared with other retailers, they are a very different business model.  <\/p><p>The Irish travel sector is a strong, dynamic industry which employs over 3,500 people across Ireland.  Last year, the Commission for Aviation Regulation reported a &euro;1.2 billion turnover for Irish travel agents in 2018, as part of its annual report for that year.  Travel agents are engaged in all aspects of overseas travel, including leisure, corporate and visits to family abroad.  We are all very familiar with this service.  From a departmental corporate travel point of view they are very important.  <\/p><p>There is interdependency between outgoing and incoming air and sea travel volumes.  The travel industry is a nationwide SME sector, largely comprised of family-run businesses employing over 3,500 people in towns and cities across the country, including in rural Ireland and the north east as mentioned by Senator McGreehan.  The ITAA has informed the Government that the majority of Irish travel agents are at risk of long-term unemployment unless immediate action is taken, which backs up the Senator's statement that it is important that this sector benefits from supports that are provided.<\/p><p>The Irish travel industry has remained active since March to service customers with cancellations, refunds and rebooking holidays.  This work is ongoing.  These companies could not close even though they were effectively blocked from trading and they have had to continue to carry a proportion of salary and overhead costs.  We recognise that.  The companies make an argument which is unique in terms of the arguments being made by other businesses.  Travel agents provide an essential service to customers.  The ITAA has told us that if they close this responsibility will fall to the Commission for Aviation Regulation in respect of which there will be associated costs.  It is important that we ensure the supports being made available are reaching the sector.  <\/p><p>In recognition of the importance of the sector and of businesses in many other sectors, the budget provides for a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors.  We are trying to help businesses to operate as best they possibly can over the next couple of months, when allowed, in order that they can thrive again in the years ahead, which this sector believes it can do.  The sector believes that if it can get through the next six to eight months it will be in a strong position to recommence services, create jobs and operate in the Irish market in the years ahead.  <\/p><p>Through the measures announced in the July stimulus package, including the employment wage subsidy scheme, the restart grant+ and the other variations of it and the low-cost loans and commercial rate waivers, we are providing supports to suit the different businesses.  As many businesses have had to close under the level 5 Covid restrictions we have made changes to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  The new payment structure for the PUP includes an increase in the top rate to &euro;350 for those who were earning in excess of &euro;400 per week.  This change to payment rates will apply in respect of all existing and new applicants.  The travel industry would have benefited from the initial wage subsidy scheme and probably took the view that the new scheme did not suit its needs.  The increased rates should be of assistance to it.  The EWSS is also being amended to align with the amendment to PUP, with the top payment increasing to &euro;350 for those earning over &euro;400.  As part of budget 2021, the new Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, is now operational through Revenue and offers a targeted, timely and temporary sector-specific support of up to &euro;5,000 per week to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels due to Covid.  This is based on turnover.  I am aware that Members of the Houses have received representations on travel agents' eligibility for the scheme and the full details will be confirmed as part of the Finance Bill, Second Stage of which is currently before the D&aacute;il and will probably come before this House next week.  We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and the new &euro;2 billion credit guarantee scheme.<\/p><p>The level of help now being provided to businesses across all sectors is unprecedented and ahead of that available in many other jurisdictions.  We will continue to keep the mix of support for specific sectors under review to ensure businesses can reopen as international travel recovers.  It is important that the travel sector can benefit from these supports as well.  I look forward to the completion of the debate on the Finance Bill over the next week or two to bring clarification to this issue.<\/p><p>The Senator mentioned the refund credit note.  People might say it did not help the sector but the purpose of it was to give confidence in the early stages to those customers who did not need a refund.  I am conscious that people in difficult times financially might have no choice but to seek a refund of money they had on deposit with a travel agent but there are people who might have been in the position of not having to seek a refund and were able to leave the money with the travel agent to help support the sector.  As I said the purpose of the refund credit note was to provide confidence to a customer who had been loyal to a travel agent for many years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If the customer was willing to leave his or her money on deposit, the State was saying the money would be paid out at a later stage.

It was an attempt to stop the withdrawal of cash from travel agents and to stop people seeking their deposits back.  That was the intention.  The scheme had some impact but maybe not enough and it was certainly not enough on its own to help the sector.  That is why we have announced a range of other supports.

My Commencement matter is on Clonturk Community College, a new secondary school in Dublin 11.  The school has enjoyed phenomenal success since it was established a short number of years ago, where demand far exceeds supply and there has been a large expansion in the number of places offered by the school year on year.  There is a real concern, however, with the accommodation at the school.  It has already needed temporary accommodation for this school year and it is seeking temporary accommodation for next year.  The key issue is that the school cannot continue to ask the Department for temporary accommodation.  We need a clear commitment to have a permanent building for this school provided for the start of 2021.<\/p> <p>The crucial matter is that it is extremely costly for the Department of Education to provide temporary accommodation and it is places stress on those involved in the school to be continually worrying about school accommodation.  We cannot allow a situation where the school building effectively defines, limits or constrains learning outcomes.  I know the school staff are extremely committed to making the existing arrangements work but the school is under significant pressure.  We need a clear commitment for a new school building sooner rather than later.  I am appealing to the Minister of State to relay to the Department the need to have the school building project completed in a timely and straightforward fashion.  I am extremely frustrated with the school buildings section of the Department.<\/p> <p>I am dealing with two other schools.  Pelletstown Educate Together national school is a new school in a similar situation.  It has no certainty about securing a permanent school building and we are told there are delays.  I am also dealing with a school in Dublin 1, Gaelscoil Chol&aacute;iste Mhuire.

I am here on behalf of the Minister, Deputy  Foley, who could not make this morning's discussion.  She apologises for that as there was a clash in her diary with other meetings.  I am very happy on her behalf to respond on the matter raised by the Senator relating to Clonturk Community College.  I am conscious she raised matters relating to two other schools but I do not have details on those because I did not know they would be raised.  I will relay them to the Minister, Deputy Foley.  In fairness to the Minister, although the Senator said there was a delay of two weeks in responding to the matter, we recognise the pressure on the Department and how the Minister is on the front line trying to deal with how schools cope with Covid-19.  It is a priority but I have no doubt she will respond to the Senator as quickly as possible.  I will certainly liaise with the Senator and we will contact the school as well.<\/p> <p>We must recognise how busy the Department is.  One of the good news stories of the Covid-19 pandemic is how well the education system is responding and how schools are reopening.  I compliment everybody involved, including the teaching community, the support staff and parents, as well as the Department and its agencies.  They have successfully managed to keep schools open over the past couple of months and will do it in future.<\/p> <p>Clonturk Community College is a multi-denominational school under the joint patronage of City of Dublin Education and Training Board and Educate Together.  It was established in September 2016 as a \"start-up\" second level school to meet the needs of a growing population in the area and the demand for a multi-denominational second level school.  The school opened with an enrolment of 48 pupils in 2016.  In September 2019, the school had an enrolment of 343 pupils.  It is envisaged that Clonturk Community College will accommodate 1,000 pupils when at full capacity.<\/p> <p>In January 2019, the Department approved a devolved grant for Clonturk Community College for the purchase of a modular building that is now in place.  This has provided an additional eight general classrooms, four pastoral offices, three guidance rooms, two special educational needs classes, two computer rooms, one art room, one science laboratory, one general purpose room, one principal's office, one staff room, one staff workroom and all the necessary toilet facilities, changing rooms, circulation, lifts and staircases required.  This, together with existing accommodation, provides the school with mainstream classroom capacity to cater for 750 pupils.<\/p> <p>While awaiting the delivery of the modular building, interim temporary accommodation consisting of nine rented prefabs was installed and remain on the site.  The school authorities have expressed the need to retain these to cater for the current cohort of pupils.  Officials from the Department provided the necessary forms to the City of Dublin Education and Training Board in order to assess the need for the retention of these prefabs and any other deficits of specialist accommodation.  This documentation was recently received by the Department and it is being assessed.<\/p> <p>In addition, the school authority is seeking an increase in specialist accommodation to be on the site for the 2021-22 school year.  This application is currently under consideration with a view to catering for the school's long-term needs.<\/p> <p>In quantifying the specific requirements for September 2021 and future years, the Department is in the final throes of concluding its nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level across the 314 school planning areas through a geographical information system.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including child benefit data from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department's own school enrolment databases, as well as local information provided by the school community, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.<\/p> <p>The process has been strengthened this year through three specific initiatives.  These include enhanced engagement with local authorities on the information on residential development incorporated in the analysis process and additional engagement with patron bodies and their local knowledge on school place requirements.  Education and training boards, diocesan offices and national patron bodies such as Educate Together, An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta and others can be an important source of local knowledge.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The process has been strengthen this year through three specific initiatives: enhanced engagement with local authorities in respect of the information on residential development incorporated in the analysis process; additional engagement with patron bodies in respect of their local knowledge on school place requirements, education and training boards, diocesan offices and national patron bodies, such as Educate Together, An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta, etc., can be an important source of local knowledge - this will add to information also provided to the Department by local authorities or individual schools; and, in order to aid the planning system, the Department will also be utilising the information gleaned from schools under the national inventory of school capacity completed by individual schools last year as part of the primary online database, POD, and post-primary online database, P-POD, return processes.<\/p><p>As Senator Sherlock will be aware, capital planning and budgeting is undertaken on a multi-annual basis.  Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive approximately &euro;12 billion over the period 2018 to 2027.  This includes &euro;8.8 billion for the school sector and &euro;2.2 billion for higher education infrastructure.  A significant amount of money has been provided by this and the previous Government for education and rightly so.  The specific allocations in each area are closely monitored and may be adjusted from year to year to take account of project progress and other factors.<\/p><p>Since 2018, in excess of &euro;1.2 billion has been invested in capital infrastructure under the school building programme.  A further &euro;725 million is allocated for investment in 2020.  The roll-out of Project Ireland 2040 in the school sector has involved overall construction activity during 2018 and 2019 on 139 projects ranging in value from &euro;1 million to in excess of &euro;20 million.  There were also 401 projects with a value of less than &euro;1 million in construction during this period.  The completion of these 540 projects is expected to deliver more than 40,000 permanent additional and replacement school places and to replace approximately 600 prefabs.<\/p><p>The Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme.  The main elements of this pipeline currently involve 372 large-scale projects and approximately 800 projects for delivery under the Department's additional school accommodation scheme.  While good progress continues to be made with the roll-out of projects, the enhanced funding levels envisaged under the national development plan, NDP, will be key to ensuring the successful delivery of the remaining elements of the pipeline of projects during the period of the plan, namely, up to 2027.<\/p><p>Again, I thank Senator Sherlock for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to outline the position on behalf of the Minister.  I assure her that the application for capital funding for Clonturk Community College for specialist accommodation is being assessed and the school authorities will be notified of a decision as quickly as possible.  The planning system and the method for providing additional accommodation for schools throughout the country has greatly improved in recent  years and the Department is very responsive in terms of providing places at both primary and secondary level as quickly as possible when they are needed.  We can all see the benefits of that.  Sometimes schools begin in temporary accommodation but that is replaced with permanent accommodation very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#P00200","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.

Based on its current numbers and the excess of demand over supply of places, it is very clear that this school will meet the 1,000 student capacity mark in a very short period.  I ask the Minister of State to ask the Department to provide a date or precise timeline for the completion of the nationwide demographic exercise.  The information contained in the response is very useful in terms of how that data is compiled but I would reiterate that the school's view that there is a proven demand for a permanent school building.  I take on board what the Minister of State has said about the Department being very responsive in recent years and would point out that in this particular instance, space is not an issue.

It is the right way to plan and deliver schools, based on evidence and research.  The Senator says the school to which she has referred needs approval for a capacity of 1,000 students.  The Department has recognised that and when the school was planned in 2016 it was announced that it would eventually be a 1,000-pupil school when at full capacity.  It is nowhere near that at this moment in time.  It has just over 343 pupils, with accommodation for 750.  I am sure the Department will ensure things are developed in time but it is recognised that it will be a 1,000-pupil school.  There is no dispute about that because that is what the Department planned for when it announced the school in the first place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#Q00300","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for taking those Commencement matters and I thank the Senators for putting forward their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#R00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1604572200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.51 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Resignation of Member","time":1604572200,"counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#T00050"},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I have received notice in writing from Senator Elisha McCallion of her resignation as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

It is a project to co-ordinate the development of the northern area of Longford town, utilising key assets and connecting the functional area in a strategic way that maximises ongoing and future investment.  The plan incorporates an area of more than 55 acres, encompassing the 18 acre Sean Connolly Barracks site, with a new focus on the River Camlin.<\/p> <p>Longford has a high ratio of jobs to resident population, which indicates a need to provide suitable and attractive residential development in proximity to those jobs, as well as to develop more sustainable travel patterns and ensure the town derives economic benefit from the jobs it supports.  If that is done, the town will be able to provide an enhanced range of services and facilities to the surrounding rural community and associated economises.  Substantial investment from F&aacute;ilte Ireland under Government initiatives and directly by the local authority have worked towards achieving these aims.  The project will represent a consolidation of that investment.  The project involves an area in the northern portion of the town covered by the Camlin quarter masterplan.  It will be a major investment in the areas of Connolly Barracks, Little Water Street, the mall complex, Abbeycarton and the Providers innovation hub.<\/p> <p>The project was a significant priority of mine while I was a member of Longford County Council.  Since being elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I have worked to ensure the continued support of the Government for the project.  In December 2018, the then Taoiseach, now T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, visited the area and met members of Longford County Council and local business people who described in detail how the lower part of Longford town had been ravaged in recent years by the closure of a substantial number of businesses.  The project is designed to improve the sustainable mobility and physical connection between the major functional areas in the northern section of the town core.  It aims to enhance environmental quality and liveability and to provide an environment that attracts and encourages inward investment and increased footfall in this part of Longford town.  The proposed works will require detailed design, environmental assessment, planning and, potentially, compulsory purchase orders in some instances.

From that litany of failures, two examples include the suffering of women as a result of inadequacies in the provision of healthcare, such as the continuing CervicalCheck controversy, and the failure of this State to prevent the abuse of women in mother and baby homes.<\/p> <p>On the issue of maternity care, I would like to know from the Minister of Health what concrete progress has been made under the national maternity strategy for the period from 2016 to 2026 to ensure that Ireland has the best and safest maternity services and best supports for women and babies in the world.  In particular, I would like the Minister to tell the House whether all women in need of specialised maternity care are currently receiving that necessary care.<\/p> <p>I will highlight another matter regarding maternity care which was raised in the other House.  This concerns the effective seizure management drug, sodium valproate, also known as Epilim.  It is suitable for use by many people with epilepsy but if it is taken by pregnant women, the result can be babies having significant developmental issues, namely, a 10% chance of a physical deformity or a 40% chance of a neurological disorder.  Some 1,600 women in Ireland between the ages of 16 and 45 years are taking this drug for epilepsy.  Alarmingly, awareness of this real risk is still too low.  Studies show that nearly 33% of these women are unaware that when taken in pregnancy the drug can cause learning and developmental problems, with 17% unaware that the drug can result in serious birth defects.  The HSE estimates that 1,250 children were impacted by this drug in this way between 1975 and 2015.  That is 1,250 children too many.  To protect women, the drug must now only be issued by a specialist and its use must be accompanied by a pregnancy prevention programme and the signing of an annual risk acknowledgement form to drive ongoing awareness.  A study by Epilepsy Ireland showed that not even 30% of women taking this drug had heard of this mandatory pregnancy prevention programme and only 22% had been asked by their healthcare professional to sign the annual risk acknowledgement form to maintain awareness.<\/p> <p>It is important, therefore, that we ask the Minister what is being done to address this urgent and serious risk being posed to these women and babies.  Regrettably, the systemic failures of this State in addressing issues facing women continues to this day.  As long as those failures continue, it is important for us women to continue to talk about them inside and outside this House.  I will continue to do so tirelessly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#V00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I want to take a moment today to reflect on some of the global issues pertaining to human rights.

I refer to the rolling back of protections regarding access to abortion.  It is now well-nigh impossible to access an abortion in Poland.  The streets in cities there have been teeming in recent days with protesters and there has been global solidarity.  I certainly stand in solidarity with those protesting in Poland for the basic and fundamental right to bodily autonomy and to have access to much-needed healthcare and compassion.  Polls in Poland seem to show that people power works.  I hope that is the case and I express my solidarity.<\/p> <p>I also want to reflect on the LGBT-free zones in Poland.

There has been much talk in Ireland and across Europe about condemning the LGBT-free zones, but I wish to put this egregious infringement of human rights on the record of the House.  I encourage every Member to stand against such things.<\/p><p>With regard to the US, once lauded as the bastion of democracy, I doubt that anybody could not comment on the extraordinary voter suppression and some of the alarming tactics that have been used across the US.  We see the potential fallout from that with protests outside count centres.  However, it would be remiss of me to cast my eyes across the world and not turn my gaze here.  Last week, we had an impassioned discussion about rights and the victims of institutional abuse in Ireland.  Our past lingers clearly in the shadows.  Ireland has led on gender recognition rights.  It introduced the Gender Recognition Act in 2015 with little problem, and people have lived their lives perfectly normally.  We achieved both marriage equality and abortion rights by popular vote.<\/p><p>However, we cannot be complacent.  There are bad actors in every community.  There are some outside the House who are intent on undoing some areas of democracy.  There could even be some in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is no coincidence that the out Members of our Parliament, myself included, receive untold abuse online both from bad actors and from people who wish to silence and suppress us, either because we are living our truth out loud or because, hopefully, we are inspiring other people to live their truth.  I encourage other Members of the House to be aware of the hard-won democracy we have and to stand against that in our communities and not allow these bad actors to infiltrate and take over what has been a great deal of hard work in Ireland to achieve the level of democracy and rights we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#V00300","speaker":"1663","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I commend the last speaker and agree with everything she said.  It is important that we have a debate on foreign affairs.

I also agree with what the Senator said about the United States.  Let us hope that there is a change of President at the end of today or, please God, in the next couple of days.  At the same time, we must acknowledge that it was not a good day for the Democratic Party in America and perhaps reflect on the limits of liberalism as a political philosophy.  Unless politicians tackle wealth inequality, which is not a liberal but a socialist philosophy, we see what can happen and where politics can slide, unfortunately.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of Debenhams, and I hope I will not be the only Member raising it today.  There was a very constructive cross-party meeting yesterday with shop stewards which was organised by Deputy Mick Barry.  The workers in Debenhams are on their 210th day of strike action during a pandemic.  They are standing in the wind and the freezing conditions facing us this week.  They have been left out there without the intervention that is desperately required from the Government.  I must be honest that I got boiling mad yesterday at a meeting of the enterprise and employment committee, of which I am a member.  We heard about the Duffy Cahill report which is now four and a half years old.  It has been sitting gathering dust for four and a half years.  It would have prevented what has happened to the Debenhams workers.<\/p> <p>There has been all sorts of emergency legislation, much of it necessary.  Why have we not had emergency legislation for working people?  Why have we not had emergency legislation to deal with strategic insolvencies?  That is what we are talking about here.  We should not have to remember what happened to the Clerys workers and realise that it is four and a half years later.  This is political because both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have failed in this respect.  They had the opportunity in the last Government to do something about it and they chose not to.  We cannot leave these workers in the lurch.  KPMG has said it is prepared to walk away at the end of December.  The assets that the workers are trying to defend with a 24-hour picket, day after day, are rapidly reducing in value.<\/p> <p>There must be an effective Government intervention.  It has to happen, and I call on all Members of the Seanad to play their role.  In fact, I believe we should have a special debate on the Debenhams workers.  Every Member, regardless of political party, should call on the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste to intervene directly with the company.  It is clear that the back channels have not worked.  We cannot allow these workers to be left in the lurch again, standing in the cold until Christmas.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is what they are facing at the moment.

It is right that the Government should do what it can.  I ask the Leader to take that message back.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan spoke about inequality in the United States.

We all have to take account of that.<\/p> <p>I wish to briefly raise a very difficult, divisive and emotive debate that took place in the House in recent weeks on mother and baby homes.  Unfortunately, it ended up becoming a political issue, which it should not have.

It is good that the commission is sitting for another four months to fully consult survivors about having their identity revealed.

I commend all those working in public transport companies who have kept services operating throughout the pandemic, although there have been issues with some services in Galway city that negatively impacted on communities.<\/p> <p>It appears that the BusConnects plans for Dublin have been significantly changed following the rounds of public consultation that have taken place.  I understand another round of public consultation is set to begin shortly on the revised plans.  The substantial consultation with public representatives and communities is to be welcomed and acknowledged.  It is a productive approach to take.  I also understand the National Transport Authority, NTA, intends to lodge a planning application in March and to start the project on a phased basis in 2022, with a completion date in 2027.  While the timeframe seems excessive, the plan is a significant one that involves land acquisition, route changes and new vehicles.  During the summer the NTA issued a tender for the supply of 200 electric buses for public transport.<\/p> <p>I suggest that the focus on Dublin has been to the detriment of other cities such as Galway.  Early last month, a public consultation opened on a cross-city link in Galway city, which aims to introduce a public transport corridor from University Road in the west of the city to the old Dublin Road in the east.  Everybody in Galway would agree that this route is badly needed.  However, except for this project there has been little progress on other more comprehensive and strategic BusConnects plans for Galway and other cities.  That must change, notwithstanding the constraints on the resources and capacity of the NTA.<\/p> <p>In February 2018, the Fine Gael-led Government allocated &euro;200 million for transport investment in Galway, including public transport and cycling and walking infrastructure under the national development plan.  The launch this week of the review of the plan by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, highlights an opportunity to make more progress on public transport development, including on the BusConnects plan.  I ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Transport come to the Seanad to debate and discuss the provision and expansion of public transport outside of Dublin in other cities and rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#X00300","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I welcome this initiative.  It is positive that we are using our time in the Seanad to at least highlight matters.  I thank the Leader and the Cathaoirleach for arranging it.<\/p> <p>I want to raise the issue of local government finance.  We are aware that our city and county councils are struggling financially.  I especially wish to mention local property tax, LPT.  Will the Leader extend an invitation and arrange for the Minister for Finance to come to the Seanad to discuss the LPT?  One only needs to look at the website of Fine Gael, the Leader's party, the Government website,and the Minister's website to see the endless commitments and promises to reform the LPT.  I am opposed to this tax in principle.  I am not opposed to bringing in income to local authorities but the system used is very unfair.  A neighbour of mine is a very elderly pensioner on a very low income.  She is paying the tax.  I spoke to two professionals recently who live in Foxrock and who have an income in excess of &euro;200,000.  They do not pay the LPT.  This is historical because, since 2013, all new properties are exempt from the tax.  It is an absolute shame.  It is a disgrace.  The system requires urgent reform.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, there are more than 4,000 houses, I will not speculate about what they cost but they are valuable properties and perhaps cost in excess of &euro;500,000.  The people involved have never paid the LPT.  That is wrong.  I do not think we need to convince anyone that it is wrong.  In that context, we need to hear from the Minister.  We cannot keep putting it off.  There have been some suggestions about general elections, certain demographics and why we are not doing anything about it, but that is all speculation.  We need to address how we are going to bring in some sort of emergency legislation to at least bring that group into the net.  I will leave it at that.

It is also important to remind people that no matter where they come from, as long as they are living in Ireland and they are over 18 years of age by 15 February 2021, they are entitled to be part of that process.

We are witnessing in the United States the extraordinary scenario whereby officials who are responsible for administering voter registration or the counting of ballots are also on news channels giving partisan political commentary.  This is extraordinary to Irish ears.  We are incredibly lucky that we have a system that is independent in that regard.  However, it is not a system that does not require reform.  The fact that there is one draft register that is completed on 15 February every year is a cumbersome and unnecessary aspect of our voter registration system.  By the same token, there is huge duplication within the system.  Individual entries are not given individual identifier numbers such as PPS numbers or dates of birth, which allows for duplication.  This means, for example, that statistics on turnout are inevitably inaccurate.  <\/p> <p>I am calling for a debate on reform of that system to ensure it is not only transparent but also accurate and facilitates those who are more mobile than others.  Young people in particular do not live for all time at one address.  If they are students, they rent properties which quite often are far away from where they grew up.  In those circumstances, we need to put in place a system that facilitates their registration and voting in the areas in which they are resident at any given time.

There are 33 houses in the county that we know of that have been declared to have issues with pyrite.  As the Cathaoirleach will be aware, pyrite is a harmful mineral found in quarries.  Sadly, there are particular periods when houses were built from stone that contained this mineral.  Over the past decade or so, in particular, many houses in County Clare had insulation installed and beads pumped into the walls.  Unfortunately, when this mineral mixes with moisture, which happens particularly when people put insulation in their houses, it leads to expansion and cracking.  In some cases, the houses are deemed unsuitable for habitation and have to be demolished.<\/p> <p>There is an active pyrite support group in County Clare that has done a lot of work in this area.  It wants the county to be included in the concrete block grant scheme that is available in counties Donegal and Mayo, particularly in parts of Ballina, County Mayo.

It is not appropriate or suitable in County Clare because most, if not all, of the 33 houses that have been declared to have pyrite will have to be demolished and rebuilt.

The heartbreaking bit was when she asked him what in the name of God she has to live for and look forward to if they do not come home.  Hope is probably the biggest thing we can instil in all our constituents and citizens in this country because people are doing their absolute level best.  The vast majority of people are living by every single rule and doing everything that has been asked of them since March.

The purpose of this relatively short Bill is to complete the transposition of Directive EU 2017\/1371 on the fight against fraud to the Union's financial interests by means of criminal law, commonly referred to as the \"PIF directive\".  This directive further harmonises the approach across the EU to the criminalisation of fraud affecting the Union's financial interests.  I am hopeful the Bill will receive broad support in the House.<\/p> <p>As Senators know, membership of the EU means that member states must contribute to the EU budget.  Equally, member states receive funding from the EU budget through a variety of sources.  Responsibility for protecting the Union's financial interests and fighting fraud is a shared responsibility between the EU bodies and the authorities within its member states.  Member state authorities manage approximately 74% of EU expenditure and collect the EU's traditional own resources.  As such, it is incumbent on all member states to take the necessary and appropriate measures to tackle criminal behaviour in relation to both EU revenue and expenditure. <\/p> <p>The Directive replaces the 1995 EU convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests and the related protocols, which was the first measure to create a common approach to the criminal prosecution of offences against the EU's financial interests.  This directive establishes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions with regard combating fraud and other illegal activities, including corruption and money laundering, which affect the European Union's financial interests.  These financial interests refer to all revenues, expenditure and assets covered by, acquired through, or due to, the Union budget, the budgets of the EU institutions, or budgets directly or indirectly managed and monitored by them.<\/p> <p>Fraud offences are, of course, not new to our legal system, or indeed to those of other member states.  There are very few situations where the existing general offences on the Statute Book cannot be used to prosecute the relevant criminal behaviour in the State.  Many aspects of the directive have not required legislation as the appropriate offences are already in place.  However, this directive harmonises measures across member states and seeks to ensure that they are practical deterrents, that they fit together with other EU measures, and that they are effective against, in particular, cross-border crime.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Browne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The key offence of fraud affecting the Union's financial interests is already in place.  Ireland first gave effect to this offence in section 42 of Part 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  The directive requires that the offence be updated to provide for a new offence of misappropriation and to apply the freezing and confiscation measures which are contained in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 to the proceeds of criminal offences under this Bill.  This is achieved through an amendment to Schedule 1A to the Criminal Justice Act 1994 to enable the freezing and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds from the criminal offences in the Bill.<\/p><p>Other provisions in the directive are already provided for in existing legislation and therefore do not need to be separately provided for in this Bill.  Notably, the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 and the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended, apply in their respective areas and satisfy the requirements of the directive.  Another provision of the directive is that committing a serious offence within its scope as part of the activities of a criminal organisation is considered an aggravating factor in sentencing.  This provision already exists on a general basis through section 74A of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, as amended.<\/p><p>In a European context, the directive is of particular significance in that it defines the scope of offences falling under the European Public Prosecutor's Office, EPPO.  Although Ireland is not participating in the EPPO, those offences will be prosecuted by the EPPO in other member states, potentially in co-operation with Irish authorities, so I would like to address developments in respect of that office.  As Senators will be aware, the establishment of an EU-level body with investigative and prosecution powers was under consideration for many years.  The legal basis for it was ultimately included in Article 86 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as introduced by the Lisbon treaty.  The regulation for its establishment entered into force in 2017 through a special legislative process and 22 member states are participating in it.  Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary and Poland are not taking part.  A European chief prosecutor and 22 nationally appointed European prosecutors are now in place and the EPPO is expected to be operational by the end of 2020.<\/p><p>In respect of Ireland's participation in the EPPO, the development of a supranational investigative and prosecution authority, even one with a relatively limited scope, clearly presents fundamental questions of policy which are outside the scope of the Bill.  However, I note that a critical difficulty would have arisen whereby Irish courts would not be entitled to exclude evidence the collection of which contravened rights under the Constitution.  Under the EPPO regulation, evidence would potentially be admissible based on other member state legal regimes and the regulation itself.  In more general terms, challenges arose in how the EPPO structures would have interacted with our common law regime, given that the EPPO built primarily from a civil base.  Although Ireland could not take part, we recognise that the establishment of the EPPO is an important and innovative EU measure and we have been working closely with participating member states and the EPPO, in particular to look at how cooperation with non-participating member states will work.<\/p><p>Although details of the arrangements are currently being worked on, the expectation is that under Article 105(3) of the EPPO regulation, participating member states will designate the EPPO as a competent authority within each for the purposes of making mutual legal assistance and European arrest warrant requests to non-participating states.  These issues are currently under detailed consideration.  It is important that we avoid conflicts of jurisdiction and ensure legal certainty in respect of requests.  We will be consulting and taking into account the advice of the Attorney General on these matters.  It is important to emphasise that the fact that Ireland is not participating in the EPPO does not prevent us from prosecuting such crimes in Ireland.  Such offences will be dealt with by the relevant agencies within the criminal justice system, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Public Prosecutions.<\/p><p>I will now turn to the content and provisions of the Bill before the House.  As I noted, it is a relatively short and primarily technical Bill comprising 11 sections and a Schedule.  Section 1 is a standard provision defining the principal Act as the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.<\/p><p>Section 2 amends section 40, which is the interpretation section for Part 6 of the 2001 Act, and substitutes the definitions which will now apply to Part 6.  In particular, it provides that the offences in the Bill have the same meaning as they do in the directive.  This means that the offence of fraud affecting the financial interests of the European Union has the same meaning as in Article 3(2).

Section 2 provides that it has the same meaning as in Article 4(3) of the directive, which means the action of a public official who is directly or indirectly entrusted with the management of funds or assets to commit or disburse funds or appropriate or use assets contrary to the purpose for which they were in any way which damages the Union's financial interests.  A person guilty of an offence is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both. <\/p><p>Section 5 inserts a new section 42B into the 2001 Act providing for liability for offences by a body corporate in respect of an offence under section 42 or section 42A and provides for penalties on conviction on indictment of imprisonment and-or a fine. <\/p><p>Section 6 amends section 45 of the 2001 Act and provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction.

Article 10 of the directive requires measures to be put in place, in accordance with Directive 2014\/42\/EU, to enable the freezing and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds from the criminal offences in the directive.  The principal offence of money laundering and active and passive corruption are already subject to these measures. <\/p><p>Section 10 provides for the repeal of sections 41, 46(4) and 47 and Schedules 2 to 9 to the principal Act.  These Schedules are the 1995 Convention and related protocols on which Part 6 of Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 is currently based, and as they are being replaced by the directive they will, therefore, no longer be relevant.<\/p><p>Section 11 is a standard provision, providing for the Short Title, collective citation and commencement provisions.  The changes this Bill will make to our existing legislation enables us give full effect to the EU directive.

Like my colleague, Senator Gallagher, I welcome the Bill.  Fine Gael is supporting this legislation which is very important to implement the existing directive relating to these matters.  This legislative measure comes at the end of a long path of legislation in this area.  Obviously, theft, fraud and dishonesty offences are as old as time.  In 2001, Ireland passed an Act which gave effect to other international conventions at that time and replaced the Larceny Act 1916 and many of the outdated provisions in that Act.  The 2001 Act was the standard bearer in respect of dishonesty offences and has been for almost 20 years, but this is the tenth iteration of amendments to that legislation so it has had to be updated as the nature of crime in this area has changed and become particularly advanced.  I refer, in particular, to the cybercrime and corruption offences that are targeted by this amendment to Part 6 of the 2001 Act.<\/p> <p>We have often been critical in recent months of the fact that legislation gets pushed through the House.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is both initiating this Bill in the Seanad and giving us an opportunity to deal with it and also allowing us to deal with it in an appropriate fashion, by starting with Second Stage and canvassing the views of Members.  I also note what he said about bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage and we look forward to that.  I congratulate him on taking a reasoned approach to this.<\/p> <p>I noted what Senator Gallagher said about the difficulties other states have had in transposing the directive into their national law.  I am not sure that Ireland is in a position to cast stones in that regard, because we have been quite slow in doing so with other legislation.  I also note that the Commission is due to bring a report before the European Parliament on 6 July 2021.  In light of what the Minister of State said, I certainly hope we will have it passed and in law by then and that the Commission will be in a position to report on the provisions we have put in place to implement the directive, which is an important one.<\/p> <p>There was also an opportunity in this legislation to examine, perhaps, gaps that have arisen in the last 20 years in the ordinary course and beyond what this Bill specifically does in terms of transposing the directive, for example, the provision of greater penalties in respect of making a gain or causing a loss by deception, which is provided for in section 6 of the 2001 Act.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Oireachtas has taken time since the 2001 Act and in recent years to make a very clear policy statement in respect of the unacceptability of certain offences by marking specifically harsh or strong penalties in respect of certain types of offence, or offences that take place at a certain level.  I have in mind specifically section 15A of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, as amended.  The section provides a presumptive minimum mandatory sentence of ten years in respect of the possession of drugs for sale and supply of greater than &euro;13,000.  I recognise that the operation of the measure in practical terms has a different effect than was perhaps intended by the Oireachtas but nonetheless the Oireachtas took an important step in making a clear statement that the State would not tolerate drugs activities at that level.<\/p><p>When we look at section 6 of the 2001 Act, we can also say that it is possibly appropriate for the State to make a similar statement in respect of fraud and deception, also at a very high level.  In recent years we have seen prosecutions in this jurisdiction for extraordinarily high levels of fraud alleged against individuals.  It would potentially have been appropriate in this legislation to bring forward, perhaps a section 6A, to provide for a minimum mandatory sentence in respect of fraud above a certain level.  I do not prescribe what that is, but there was an opportunity there to look at that.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding that, I think it is very important to have regard to what is in the Act.  By my reckoning, it really does three specific things in extending the definition of fraud within the context of the European Union's financial interests; defining the offence of misappropriation and the extraterritorial applications provided for in section 6.  I wish to make a point specifically in respect to the definition of \"misappropriation\".  I heard what the Minister said about the definition section that is provided for in section 2.  Misappropriation is said to have the same meaning as it has in Article 4(3) of the directive, which is included as a Schedule to the Bill.  From the point of view of making legislation more accessible to the public, as much as it is to practitioners, I wonder if a definition of misappropriation could be put in to the definition section rather than forcing anybody who wants to see what it is to go to Article 4(3) of the directive, which I think is on page 17 of the Bill, and to read the definition that is provided there.  I think it would make it easier.<\/p><p>This is the tenth iteration of amendments to the theft and fraud offences legislation in Ireland.  It includes corruption offences, which the Minister mentioned.  I think she also mentioned money laundering and terrorist financing, which were dealt with in the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 but, equally, it covers everything from social welfare and burglary of dwellings to miscellaneous provisions and mutual assistance.  There is quite a lot of legislation here.<\/p><p>I have regard in particular to the great work the Law Reform Commission does in providing access to consolidated legislation, which makes it a great deal easier for anybody who wants to parse what is in the legislation to look at a consolidated Act.  Again, there is possibly an opportunity for these Houses to consider consolidating the theft and fraud offences legislation into a single Act in order that we have easy access to all the relevant considerations.<\/p><p>Finally, I will address the extraterritorial application of the offences, as provided for in section 6.  I welcome this, as I believe it is very important.  Again, the nature of these offences is changing.  The international nature of them is clear now and we need legislation like this to ensure that the State is equipped to deal with those matters.  I do not have any difficulty with the provisions in section 6 relating to the fact that an offence committed in another State, which is an offence there, can be an offence here.  That already exists in other Irish legislation.  Is it possible to clarify that the principles of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict would equally apply, so that one does not have a double jeopardy situation where somebody was facing charges in both states?  I think provision is already made for that generally in law but it might be worth confirming that this is the case.<\/p><p>I welcome the legislation.  I think it is timely.  I think Ireland is clearly acting in an expedient manner in terms of putting an important directive into Irish law so that it is there and we comply with our obligations under European law.  As the Minister said, the Bill is quite short and it uses the Schedules to the Act to slim down the text of the Bill itself but there is a solid legislative basis for us to proceed.  I welcome the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#QQ00200","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy McEntee, to the House and congratulate her on her appointment.

We have, however, seen some Bills purporting to be technical in nature rather rushed through this House that have created a great deal of controversy in recent weeks.  So, I have heard those words with a somewhat dread feeling, which I am sure was shared by others also.  This Bill, however, is genuinely a technical one and I am happy to support it on behalf of the Labour Party Senators.<br\/><br\/>Previous speakers have also referred to the fact that the Minister will bring the Bill forward only to Second Stage today and that we will have some time, which will be short no doubt, before Committee and Remaining Stages.  That should not need to be said.  It is exceptional that we would see Bills being rushed through this House on all Stages.  Unfortunately, that exception has proven to be the norm in recent weeks over this term.  I am glad that we are only dealing with Second Stage today, but it is partly because we have the Seanad Chamber today and therefore could not be dealing with Committee and Remaining Stages in any case.  I note that the Minister will have amendments on the extraterritorial issue in section 6 coming forward on Committee Stage.<br\/><br\/>I disagree with the Senator who spoke about minimum mandatory sentences.  They are not commonplace in Ireland's sentencing system and I do not believe they are a good idea.  They do not have any evidence basis for their effectiveness and it is welcome that we have not moved towards minimum mandatory sentencing in general in our criminal justice system.<br\/><br\/>This is a somewhat technical Bill.  I will not speak for very long on it.  I am aware that it is before us with the purpose of transposing remaining provisions of the 2017 directive known as the PIF directive.  I am grateful to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for its usual excellent work in informing us about the background to the Bill, and for informing us that the name &quot;PIF&quot;, which I had wondered about, is an acronym of the French for protection of financial interests.<br\/><br\/>The directive is about protecting the EU financial interests and therefore the provisions in this Bill are primarily amending the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, but doing so in order to create offences around fraud affecting the financial interest of the EU.  Some aspects of the PIF directive have already been transposed into our law via the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018, which replaced some provisions in Part 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.<br\/><br\/>My primary question for the Minister is why the 2018 Act did not transpose all of the relevant provisions of the directive.  In other words, why is this Bill actually necessary?  I am particularly interested to know the answer to that given that the transposition deadline for the PIF directive, a largely technical directive as we have heard, was 6 July 2019.  This is not timely, it is actually overdue.  We have already had legislation before the Houses that passed in 2018, which already has inserted some of the relevant provisions from the directive into the 2001 Act.  I have a question about why we are only seeing this legislation now, especially given its relatively technical nature.<br\/><br\/>I have two more points to make.  I note that the Bill amends the 2001 Act.  The 2001 Act was itself a major piece of codifying and reforming legislation bringing together, as it did at the time 19 years ago, all of the pre-existing law on theft and updating it.  I am certainly old enough to remember teaching my students about the Larceny Act 1916, and indeed defending before the courts on prosecutions under that Act.  The 2001 Act was a very welcome piece of codifying legislation.  Senator Ward referred to the need for consolidating legislation more generally, and made the point that this is the tenth version of amending legislation to the 2001 Act that has been before the Houses.  We have excellent consolidating work going on with the Law Reform Commission and others, but we in the Oireachtas have a duty to ensure we are not engaging in piecemeal amendment over different pieces of<i>ad hoc<\/i>legislation.  Again, my question is why we could not have had just one piece of legislation amending the Part 6 of the 2001 Act to transpose the directive.  Why is there a need for two?  Now we should really be looking at a more wholesale codification of the 2001 Act and its subsequent amendments to ensure we have a criminal theft code.  Theft and fraud offences are not the only area, indeed they are not by any means the most problematic area, where we see this sort of piecemeal and <i>ad hoc<\/i>reform and amendment.  Sex offences law is a real area crying out for codification.  Many of us have spoken on this many times.  We need to see a proper codifying Act that brings together the vast array of these different offences, and especially sex offences against children, on which I did some work a few years ago.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As a result, inconsistencies have arisen over the years and have been litigated before the courts in the context of the provisions of sentencing, etc., on those very serious offences.  We could take a lead from companies law where we have very good consolidation in statute.  That is a general call.<br\/><br\/>I note the Minister of State's comments about the European Public Prosecutor's Office, EPPO.  Ireland is one of five members states which has not taken part in the EPPO system.  We opted out of that under Protocol 21 along with four other states on the basis of concerns over our constitutional due process guarantee over our rules regarding admissibility of evidence and more generally because our common law system is different and has evolved differently from the civil law system pertaining in other member states.  I absolutely support that.  In previous justice committees I have supported us taking a different perspective on criminal law matters.  Obviously, Ireland is not the only member state to do so.<br\/><br\/>However, there are aspects of the civil law system that we can learn from and can borrow from for our own criminal justice system.  One of the is the idea of codifying criminal laws so that they are easily accessible and understandable.  Consistency across different provisions is a very strong feature of European criminal justice systems.  There is also the issue of the protection of victims' interests.  While we have very strong due process laws which I strongly support, we can learn from other European systems in strengthening the role of the victim and enabling the victim to have a voice within the criminal justice system through the <i>partie civile<\/i>method and other mechanisms.  We are changing and improving our system to take account of those good practice measures elsewhere.  When we are debating legislation that is European criminal justice legislation, we should bear those points in mind.<br\/><br\/>I support the Bill and thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#RR00200","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.

I am sure it will not be lost on people that today the Government is bringing through legislation that aims to protect the EU's financial interest while we still have the ongoing saga of Apple's tax affairs.  The Government's attitude towards the Commission was to fight it in the courts instead of doing the right thing in that regard.  I know this Bill is not related to the Apple tax issue, but it should not be lost on anybody here that the EU directive which we are beginning to transpose into law here comes from the belief that the EU's finances must be protected in the same way that we must protect our own financial interests.  The tax loopholes here have contributed to the EU's frustration with tax avoidance.  It is embarrassing that the State is involved in legal disputes that allow Apple to run away with &euro;13 billion that should have been taxed, ach mar a duairt m&eacute;, sin sc&eacute;al eile.  That said, Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Bill.<\/p> <p>It is welcome that the Bill tackles further aspects of white-collar crime, corruption, fraud and tax evasion even though it is more specific to offences against the EU's financial interests.  The Bill aims to tackle fraud that affects the EU's financial interests.  We know the complex VAT fraud and what are known as carousel fraud operations have used shell companies and Irish banks.  Of course, they have been unwittingly involved, but criminal enterprises have used Irish banks to commit serious offences.  Therefore, it is right that Ireland plays its part as a member state and implements the legislation to give effect to this EU directive.  We know that these types of crimes cost EU taxpayers billions of euro each year.<\/p> <p>Criminal liability for corporate bodies is very welcome, particularly the failure-to-prevent model, notwithstanding the difficulties highlighted in the court cases with proving intent.  I hope it will provide another aspect of liability should a corporate body be negligent in preventing the offence.  However, I note that the specific type of corporate criminal liability only applies to offences that affect the EU's financial interests.  The clear aim of Article 10.2 of the 2013 directive and section 9(1) and (2) of the 2017 Act is to drive corporate bodies to ensure that they have mechanisms in place to ensure that their managements prevent employees and subsidiaries from committing offences under the Act and the failure-to-prevent model is considered appropriate.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Law Reform Commission has suggested that this approach could give rise to difficulties and could potentially be unfair.  The commission also stated that other legislation has \"overcome this particular potential difficulty by requiring that the contingent offence be committed for the benefit of the corporate body as an express proof of the corporate liability mechanism.\"  It further indicated that it is considered one of the toughest approaches to corporate crime.  Can the Minister of State tell me why, in this instance, we did not take the tougher approach to corporate offences?<\/p><p>I want to mention a couple of concerns that I am sure the Minister of State will engage with me on as the debate on legislation proceeds.  I agree with other colleagues who have welcomed the fact that we are getting a regular, proper approach in terms of this legislation's journey through the parliamentary process.<\/p><p>The EU directive failed to create a harmonisation of penalties for these offences across member states.  I know that the Council has its reasons for that.  However, this type of criminality is generally carried out across borders where a problem arises.  I mean if the penalties differ across member states it could give rise to issues of legal uncertainty for defendants and concerns about the fundamental rights of defence and entitlement to a fair trial.  Does the Minister of State have any thoughts on mitigating the issues that might arise in terms of those fundamental rights?  While these crimes are serious, we must still ensure that defendants are treated with their right to justice in mind.  I hope that the Minister of State or the Taoiseach have engaged at EU level to ensure that this is not going to be a major issue of concern for us as we move forward.<\/p><p>Other parts of the directive improve harmonisation across member states by actually recognising that fraud and tax evasion affect EU finances under criminal law, which is welcome.  What concerns me deeply is that part of this island, with Brexit, is being dragged out of the EU and, therefore, these measures will only have effect on one part of Ireland.  I would like to hear from the Minister of State, if he is in a position to provide the information at this stage, on what he thinks the implications will be for the people of the North and, indeed, of the whole of the island in terms of preventing cross-Border fraud, as well what will be the consequences for fundamental rights, in the context of the EU, as a result of Brexit.  How will Ministers engage with their colleagues north of the Border?<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill at this point.  I am sure that, like others, we will seek to amend it at on Committee Stage.  At the moment, however, we are content.

I support this Bill.  It is technical legislation that transposes a directive and replaces a range of existing EU directives and regulations.  The directive and this Bill are aimed at stamping out crimes against the EU budget and specifically mentions fraud that affects the financial interests of the European Union.  To be clear, we are talking not just about, for example, the misappropriation of funds that might be obtained under the EU budget but also fraud or wrongdoing concerning money from national budgets that could contribute to EU resources.  I mean the EU budget being made up of the EU's own resources, as they are called, namely, its share of customs duties collected by member states, a portion of the VAT collected by member states and a fixed percentage of the gross national income.<\/p> <p>Is this legislation about crimes against member states which would affect those areas of national income-gathering that would indirectly impact on the portion of their national incomes contributed to the EU?  Is that what we are talking about?  So it is not just the misappropriation of funds obtained from the EU, for whatever purpose, but clearly applies to broader areas of activity such as VAT, fraud or whatever, which affects member states.  Is it our understanding that that is also fraud as it affects the financial interests of the European Union because it affects the moneys available to member states from which a portion is given to the European Union?  In that context, I am conscious of the role of the EPPO which will only begin its operations this month.  That is probably why the Bill is before the House now.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The EPPO investigates and prosecutes crimes against the EU's financial interests, including fraud concerning EU funds of over &euro;10,000 and cross-border VAT fraud cases involving damages above &euro;10 million.  It is targeted at particularly high-end fraud, with small issues being handled domestically.  Up to now, only national authorities could investigate and prosecute these crimes and they cannot act beyond their borders.  The EPPO will have a European delegated prosecutor in each member state.  Ireland has opted-out of participating in the EPPO, as did the UK originally.  Obviously, the UK will not be opting-out of anything any longer.  Ireland opted-out on the grounds that the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, is independent of Government and of the police and it being part of an EPPO might undermine its independence.  We are a common law jurisdiction.  Is it the ongoing position of the Government that we will be opting out of the EPPO?  Is there any intention to opt-in in the future?  How is it envisaged the DPP will handle cases covered by this legislation in the absence of having an official delegated prosecutor within its ranks?  <\/p><p>In 2016, the EU's fight against fraud annual report found 1,410 instances of fraud involving some &euro;391 million.  I recently read the regulatory impact analysis on this Bill, published by the Department of Justice, arising out of which I have a question.  It states that the EU Commission estimates that implementing the directive would result in a saving of &euro;477 million across the EU.  The Department's analysis is that it is not possible to quantify what portion of that &euro;477 million would result from Ireland's transposition of the instrument.  I ask the Minister of State to address that point.  On what basis did the Commission reach the figure of &euro;477 million and why can a country-by-country breakdown not be given, even in very general terms?  The Commission's fight against fraud report gives a national breakdown.  If it has a means of estimating an overall figure, surely it would be able to estimate a breakdown by country.  It would be of benefit to know what kind of money could be saved by the passage of this Bill into law.  I am wondering why there is no country-by-country breakdown by the Commission or Ireland.  Is it about protecting the reputations of certain countries?  Is it the case that the further east one goes the further into the wild west one goes and so on?  I would be grateful if the Minister of State could address that issue as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#UU00200","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":124,"content":"<p>As no other Senators are offering, I call the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to respond to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#VV00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for the support expressed for the Bill, which while technical is important.  I thank them for their contributions and the points raised, some of which were very interesting and relevant as I expected.  I am glad the Bill was commenced in the Seanad and that adequate time is provided in that regard.  It was suggested by my Department that the Seanad be used in this manner as much as possible.  There are a number of pieces of legislation in the Department of Justice that have fallen behind schedule.  There is no reason in the world they cannot be brought before the Seanad first, with adequate time provided for scrutiny.<\/p> <p>While the Bill is a relatively short and technical Bill, the importance of this area should not be understated.  These crimes are not victimless.  We all pay for them.  Updating the legislation to reflect fully the new requirements arising out of the directive is important to keep pace with new behaviours and is an important step in showing our commitment to dealing with this type of illegal behaviour.  I do not propose to deal with all of the issues raised but I will touch on some of the points raised by a number of Senators.<\/p> <p>The main point raised by Senator Gallagher was that a number of states have not signed up to the EPPO.  Most states have transposed it.  Ireland is late in transposing it.  It is my responsibility to get through as quickly as possible the EU legislative matters that have been held up, but with due consideration and assessment, which is what I am trying to do in terms of the various Bills I am bringing forward.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Browne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Brexit will cause serious difficulties.  There is no question about that.  I know Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised this issue as well.  We still hope there will be an agreement between the EU and the UK that can address all of these concerns.  If there is no such agreement, the fallback will be to try to agree a bilateral arrangement with the UK, although I hope that will not be needed.  If that cannot happen, we will go back to international conventions, which would cause serious difficulties, whether that is in family law, crime or any other area.  I hope we do not end up in that position because it would be serious and difficult for us to deal with.<\/p><p>Senator Ward raised a number of important issues, such as minimum mandatory sentences.  Some of the decisions of the Supreme Court in recent times seem to be against minimum mandatory sentencing.  I am not a particular fan of minimum mandatory sentences.  While they give out a clear message, in many cases they catch not the serious players but the people the serious players are taking advantage of.  Even the mandatory sentences in place now are often more honoured in the breach than the observance by the courts these days.  I will seriously consider the matter, however.  We need to send out a clear and strong message that this is a serious offence.  Deception and fraud are not taken as seriously as they should be by some people, including criminals.  This is certainly not a victimless crime.  Outside the scope of this legislation, we have recently seen that some young people are using their bank accounts to effectively carry out fraud, perhaps without even realising what they are doing.  They are seriously damaging their futures as a result.<\/p><p>This is the tenth iteration of amendments to this Bill.  It is an issue on which I have always been strong, even as a practising barrister.  People often spend a great deal of time finding out exactly what the law is.  This can cause problems with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well.  Not only do we need to see greater accessibility to and consolidation of legislation, I also want to see a greater emphasis placed on plain English.  An awful lot could be done on that in this country in various departments and in terms of law in particular.  Other jurisdictions have done some good work around this and it is something that is absolutely needed here.  As we know, ignorance of the law is no defence but one should be able to find out what the law is.  For this reason, I want to see greater work done on that.<\/p><p>Some of my comments have touched on certain of the matters correctly raised by Senator Bacik.  I do not know why this issue was not dealt with in the 2018 Act and I acknowledge that we are late in transposing this directive.  In my role as Minister of State at the Department of Justice with responsibility for law reform, I have a focus on transposing EU legislation and doing so on time.  I intend to use the Seanad for a considered debate on these technical Bills.  The Seanad is an appropriate place for doing that.<\/p><p>Codification is needed in various areas, including sex offences.  There are a number of lacunas in this area.  I am familiar with one from when I practised criminal law, namely, that nearly all cases of rape are dealt with in the High Court but rape with a digit is dealt with in the Circuit Court.  That is an anomaly but those kinds of anomalies are increasing as a result of the piecemeal approach we have taken to these offences.  I agree that codification is very important.<\/p><p>We are strong on the issue of due process but, again, the voices of victims have not been heard in the way they should have been heard.  In fairness to the Minister, Deputy McEntee, she has made some strong statements around that and she intends to introduce reform to give victims a greater say and role in criminal processes.<\/p><p>I addressed Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's main concern about what will happen if an agreement is not reached with Brexit.  It is a serious situation and the Senator raised an important point.  The guillotine is coming down on the negotiations so I hope that an agreement can be reached.  Otherwise, we will find ourselves in a very serious situation.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen raised some important points.  I do not have answers to his questions on the European Commission, the &euro;477 million of savings or the breakdown but I will endeavour to get that information for him.  The main reason we have not opted into the EPPO is that there are issues with exclusion of evidence.  The courts here would be required to accept evidence that would probably otherwise be excluded under the Constitution.  Our view is that the Constitution and the due processes provided therein must be protected.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Browne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Obviously, it is always possible to opt in but it would be very difficult to see that happening.<\/p><p>Detailed consideration will be given to the Bill on Committee Stage.

<\/blockquote>acknowledges that: <blockquote> \t- nature and biodiversity, meaning the diversity of living things within ecosystems, are deteriorating globally at rates unprecedented in human history, thus steadily destroying the essential basis for our health, sustenance, prosperity and quality of life;<br \/><br \/>- scientists have warned that a sixth mass extinction event, labelled the 'Anthropocene Extinction', may currently be under way;<br \/><br \/>- nature and biodiversity provide essential life supports to humans in a variety of ways, including through pollination of crops, regulation of water, air and soil quality, regulation of climate, provision of resources such as medicines and building materials, mitigation of natural disasters such as flooding, maintenance of options for the future, and opportunities for learning, inspiration, aesthetic appreciation, spiritual development and the improvement of mental and physical health;<br \/><br \/>- nature is essential for human existence and happiness, that natures&rsquo; contributions are difficult or impossible to replace, and that the future of humanity is inseparable from the future of nature;<br \/><br \/>- the decline of nature and biodiversity is primarily due to human drivers, including changes in land use such as agricultural expansion and urban growth, the direct exploitation of organisms via unsustainable harvesting, logging, hunting and fishing, the impact of climate change on species distribution and ecosystem structures, and its exacerbating effects upon the other drivers, pollution of the air, water and soil, and invasions of alien plant and animal species;<br \/><br \/>- the maintenance and improvement of current habitat conditions and natural heritage is as important as the generation of new ones; <\/blockquote>notes with concern that: <blockquote> \t- globally, around one million animal and plant species are already threatened with extinction, many within decades;<br \/><br \/>- the average abundance of native species in most major land-based habitats has fallen by at least 20<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>per cent, while at least 680 vertebrate species have been driven to extinction by humanity, with more than 40 per cent of amphibian species, almost 33 per cent of reef-forming corals, more than one-third of marine mammals, and approximately 10 per cent of insects threatened with extinction;<br \/><br \/>- biodiversity loss is not only an environmental issue, but a developmental, economic, security, social and moral issue as well, with current negative trends in biodiversity undermining progress towards the United Nation&rsquo;s Sustainable Development Goals in the areas of poverty, hunger, health, water, cities, climate, oceans and land;<br \/><br \/>- a lack of diversity, especially genetic diversity, poses a serious risk to global food security by undermining the resilience of agriculture to threats such as pests, pathogens and climate change;<br \/><br \/>- land degradation has reduced the productivity of nearly 23 per cent of the global land surface, while pollinator loss increases the chances of crop failure;<br \/><br \/>- up to 400 million tons of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge and other industrial waste enter the world&rsquo;s rivers and oceans annually, while fertilisers entering coastal ecosystems have created over 400 dead zones covering a combined area of almost one quarter of a million square kilometres;<br \/><br \/>- the destruction of natural environments, in conjunction with poaching and wildlife trafficking practices, increases the likelihood of animal-to-human transmission of zoonotic pathogens such as Ebola, Rabies, Swine Flu, Avian Flu, SARS, and possibly SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus); <\/blockquote>recognises that: <blockquote> \t- most Irish habitats listed on the European Union Habitats Directive are in unfavourable status and almost half are demonstrating ongoing declines, while none of Ireland&rsquo;s grassland, heathland, bog, mire or fen habitats are in favourable status;<br \/><br \/>- almost 40 per cent of our active raised bogs in Ireland&rsquo;s Special Areas of Conservation network have been lost in the past twenty years;<br \/><br \/>- of 202 regularly occurring species of bird on this island, 37 have been placed on the red conservation list, including the curlew, corncrake, lapwing, barn owl and golden eagle, while a further 91 are on the amber list, including the robin, starling, swallow, swift, cormorant, gannet and puffin;<br \/><br \/>- 30 per cent of our bee species and 18 per cent of our butterfly species are threatened with extinction;<br \/><br \/>- according to the Irish Wildlife Trust, 48 of our marine species face extinction and require greater legal protection, including the basking shark, angel shark, Atlantic salmon, sunfish, turbot, halibut, purple sea urchin and kaleidoscope jellyfish;<br \/><br \/>- seismic testing, occurring at acoustic levels 100,000 times more intense than a jet engine, has regularly occurred over the past decade during the exploration process for oil and gas reserves in Irish waters, causing untold damage to whales, dolphins and porpoises by damaging their food sources, such as plankton, and causing displacement of species in some cases;<br \/><br \/>- invasive animal species such as the zebra mussel and the grey squirrel, and invasive plant species such as giant hogweed and Japanese knotweed, pose a growing threat to our native flora and fauna;<br \/><br \/>- biodiversity provides vital ecosystem services, free of cost, to one of our most important economic sectors, agriculture, with the value of nutrient cycling by soil organisms alone estimated to be worth &euro;1 billion a year;<br \/><br \/>- the direct annual value of insects via pollination of human food crops has been estimated as at least &euro;53 million in Ireland, while the indirect value provided through pollination of forage crops such as clover and the maintenance of a functioning ecosystem, is likely substantially higher;<br \/><br \/>- alongside the intrinsic value of an intact marine environment, it has been estimated that recreational services provided by Irish marine ecosystems are worth &euro;1.6 billion in value to the economy, that fisheries and aquaculture are worth &euro;664 million, carbon absorption services &euro;819 million, waste assimilation services &euro;317 million, scientific and educational services &euro;11.5 million, coastal defence services of &euro;11.5 million, and seaweed harvesting &euro;4 million;<br \/><br \/>- in many parts of Ireland, whether on their own or supported by the State, farmers have led the way on projects to protect biodiversity, habitats and species, including farmers involved in the Burren Programme in Clare, the Hen Harrier Project in six special protection areas, the Pearl Mussel Project in  eight different river catchments, and the Biodiversity Regeneration in a Dairying Environment (BRIDE) project in the Bride Valley, Co. Cork;<br \/><br \/>- in a 2015 survey, Ireland&rsquo;s natural, unspoilt environment was cited by 86 per cent of visiting tourist respondents as a reason to visit Ireland, and that in 2018, out-of-State tourism generated &euro;5.6 billion for the Irish economy; <\/blockquote>calls on the Government to act upon the Programme for Government&rsquo;s commitments regarding biodiversity as soon as possible, and to: <blockquote> \t- review the protection, including legislative protection processes, of our natural heritage and significant land use changes;<br \/><br \/>- ensure that the State can protect nature and enforce existing statutory protections of designated features of conservation interest by providing sufficient support to the National Parks and Wildlife Service and reviewing the Service&rsquo;s remit and structure;<br \/><br \/>- establish a Citizens&rsquo; Assembly to examine and propose solutions to the biodiversity emergency, thus bringing the creativity and ingenuity of our citizenry to bear upon this crisis;<br \/><br \/>- ensure that environmental policy is strategy-led and biodiversity-focused by developing a new National Pollinator Plan, supporting the collection of biodiversity data, developing a National Soils Strategy, completing a national hedgerow survey, and carrying out a baseline biodiversity survey on Irish farms;<br \/><br \/>- ensure that farmers are recognised as the custodians of our land, and are financially supported in playing a vital role in maintaining and restoring habitats and utilising ecologically sound practices;<br \/><br \/>- seek to ensure the Common Agricultural Policy rewards farmers for sequestering carbon, creating habitats and restoring biodiversity, improving water and air quality, producing clean energy, and developing schemes that support results-based outcomes;<br \/><br \/>- secure improvements in soil health and water quality by delivering an ambitious reduction in the use of inorganic nitrogen fertiliser over the next decade;<br \/><br \/>- advocate for a fair system of eligibility conditionality, under the reform of Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition rules, recognising that farmers should not be unfairly penalised for maintaining land that contributes to biodiversity principles, and thus allowing farmers to accrue benefits from managing land as wetlands or native habitats;<br \/><br \/>- implement the EU&rsquo;s Farm to Fork and Biodiversity strategies in order to increase environmental and biodiversity benefits to our economy and society, including the ambitious reductions in respect of pesticides and fertilisers;<br \/><br \/>- conserve and expand a diverse range of natural habitats by developing a National Land Use Plan, incentivising the rewetting of carbon-rich soils, supporting the planting or rewilding of native woodland on every farm, and adopting a close-to-nature, continuous cover approach to forestry so as to ultimately create permanent biodiverse forests containing trees of all ages;<br \/><br \/>- develop comprehensive legislation for the identification, designation and management of Marine Protected Areas in Irish territorial waters, aiming to ensure these areas cover 30 per cent of our waters by 2030.&quot;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is great that I have lived to see the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for biodiversity.  It gladdens my heart because I thought we would never see it.

This is a momentous occasion for me because I have been talking about biodiversity for approximately 30 years.  It gives me hope.<\/p><p>Biodiversity means life and difference, and it concerns the different life forms and the importance of having variety.

During this debate, I hope to go through some of the reasons it is so important we do not go to 60 R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garveys or one type of tree or animal left on the planet.  It is what we face in this emergency we are discussing today.<\/p> <p>I will start from the ground up, or even beneath the ground.  I will mention the soil beneath our feet because sometimes we forget the importance of healthy soil.  Even building a house we start with a good foundation.  There are major issues with soil quality in the country.  One teaspoon of healthy soil contains more microorganisms than there are people on the planet.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Of course, that is in healthy soil.  Together, these microorganisms break down all the rotting debris and turn it into good humus.  They give us the nutrients and bacteria we need for our own food and for animals.  To survive under the ground, the microorganisms need to be sheltered which is why they need something to keep them safe, no more than humans do.  The microorganisms below ground need food and shelter just like us.  Keeping the soil covered at all times is a good start because without healthy soil one gets poor drainage and increased run-off, of which we have seen much.  People were talking about it in Cork this morning and it is happening all over the country.  We have major issues with flooding and run-off and biodiversity is the solution to sort out this crisis.<\/p><p>I had the good fortune of studying organic horticulture in the Organic College in Dromcollogher with Jim McNamara many moons ago.  He said that one feeds the soil, not the plant.  Only with healthy soil do we get healthy plants, which includes all our food.  Nobody can argue the difference between a healthy carrot or tomato grown from healthy soil and one grown in poor soil pumped with chemicals.  If there was biodiversity in the soil, people would not need those chemicals and could grow their food naturally.  What we need right now is a variety of grasses because to get healthy soil we have to have a mixture of grasses.  Most grass swards are dominated by perennial ryegrass and some clover if one is lucky.  With just two plant species in a mix, the modern grass sward has a lower number of insect species and other invertebrates than grass swards in the past.  These modern swards also require higher levels of nutrients to achieve higher farm productivity.  This leads to the less aggressive species of plants being outcompeted, with a subsequent loss in biodiversity.  As always in this Chamber, we must focus on actions and solutions.  We must focus on what can be done and what is being done.<\/p><p>I must mention an amazing man called Donal Sheehan.  Just a few years ago he put out 40 chairs in his local hall to start a project called Farming with Nature.  Some 140 people turned up to that meeting so they had to sit on each other's laps and were standing all around the place.  One would not get away with that now.  All the farmers in the area wanted to take part in this and be involved but the project had to turn them down as only 42 could take part.  They then discovered there was only funding for 27 farmers.  However, all 42 farmers agreed that they would split the money between them even though there was only money for 27 because they were so eager to get involved and do the right thing.  What they do, simply, is grow a variety of grasses, which sorts out loads of problems.  Farmers of every kind are involved, including small farmers with 15 ha and those with 400 ha.  They might have ten cattle, 40 cattle, dry stock, weanlings or they might be dairy farmers.  All types of farmers were involved.  It is a good example of what can be done on all kinds of farms.  It was named the Biodiversity Regeneration In a Dairying Environment, BRIDE, project after the lovely River Bride, which is a tributary of the beautiful River Blackwater.<\/p><p>The BRIDE project uses a multispecies grassland mix, which contains several grass species, including Timothy and Cocksfoot, and several wildflower species such as plantain, red and white clover and yarrow to benefit pollinators and a wide range of insects.  The benefits of this scheme, though it sounds so simple, are huge.  The inclusion of a mix of high clover will result in less use of nitrogen fertiliser.  Many farmers have to spend lots of money on fertiliser but clover is a natural nitrogen fixer.  Root systems of different species are important as well.  This is interesting because soil loss occurs when there are heavy rains, but if there are lots of different types of grasses, they will have different roots with different depths and they hold onto that soil.  They also help hold onto the nutrients when they are spread and they go into the soil and feed it.<\/p><p>This same principle will mean a higher tolerance of different climate conditions.  Now we often get a month's worth of rain in two days and farmers are losing some of their topsoil as a result.  More biodiversity underground improves soil health.  It is a symbiotic relationship between the environment above and below ground.  A healthier mix of grasses also enriches the variety of flowers, which then attract insects, including butterflies and predatory insects.  Predatory insects sound scary but they are brilliant.  In Dromcollogher, we saw that if one has flowers that attract predatory insects, those insects will take care of the aphids, greenflies and all the other insects farmers often have to spray to keep away.  If they have the right flowers and biodiversity around their farms, they will not have to deal with that problem.<\/p><p>That brings me to pollinators.  With healthy varieties of flowers and grasses, we get a healthy variety of pollinators.  We all know their job is so important that no food would be grown in this country if we did not take care of them.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is it.  We will not be able to grow food if we do not get this right.  I will draw attention to another great solution, that of the Irish Seed Savers Association.  The main objective of this organisation is to conserve Ireland's very special and threatened plant genetic resource.  I have been fortunate enough to visit the organisation and to get seeds from it.  I do not have a green finger but if one takes any of this group's seeds and put them in good soil, one will get food.  It is not a big challenge if one has the right seeds in the right place.  This group's work focuses on the preservation of heirloom and heritage food crops that are suitable for Ireland's unique growing conditions, which makes it easier to grow its seeds.  The Irish Seed Savers Association maintains the country's public seed bank, which includes more than 600 varieties of seeds which are not commercially available.  <\/p><p>We all know about the big multinationals that are producing seeds which will never reseed, meaning farmers cannot save their own seed and have to buy it.  I remember being involved in Genetic Concern many years ago.  A doctor from University Hospital Limerick joined the campaign because the people in her village had never had to save seed until a certain big company, which I will not mention today, came along and gave free seed to the farmers without telling them that, when it came time to save the seed, there would be no seed to save.  This is why I wanted to mention the Irish Seed Savers Association.  What it does is so important.  We must not give power away to the multinationals as regards how we grow our food.<\/p><p>I will give the Minister some examples, although I do not have up-to-date ones.  In 2017, Ireland, the land of the spud, imported 72,000 tonnes of potatoes, 44,000 tonnes of which came from Britain.  We imported 47,000 tonnes of onions, 29,000 tonnes of tomatoes, 23,000 tonnes of cabbage and 15,000 tonnes of lettuce.  These are probably the five easiest things to grow in this country.  The total value of these imports was &euro;175 million.  This is money we sent out of this country.  I raise this issue because, the better our biodiversity, the easier it is to grow this food here in Ireland.  It is madness.  We have to make it easier to grow food and without biodiversity that becomes more of a challenge.  <\/p><p>I will now move from our fields to our hedges.  Ireland was once entirely forested.  I remember my father telling me when I was a child that Brian Bor&uacute; could go from one end of Ireland to the other without putting a foot on the ground.  Sadly, that is not true today.  A great lecturer from Macroom, Ted Cook, told me that, when the trees were cut, not only did the humans have to take shelter but the animals, insects and birds had to flee.  To where did they flee?  They fled to our hedgerows.  We have the best hedgerow system in all of Europe but if we do not manage it properly that will no longer be the case.  Living in a small area in which the roads are narrow, I believe there is a need for proper hedge management and hedge trimming, but I do not agree with hedge butchery.  It is really important that the Government come together to introduce supports for proper hedge management.  Ted Cook says it very well when he says that a hedgerow is like a high-rise block of flats with different species and types of animals living on every level.  That really struck home with me.  He says that if one wipes out the top layers or butchers 2 m in, one wipes out the habitat of all of those animals and plants.  This is something with which we need to deal.  It is controversial but it must still be done.  I do not ask that they be let grow wild everywhere, but we have to find a balance.  Nature is all about balance.<\/p><p>If I am to move on from hedges, I have to go to the bogs.  Some 21% of our land is peatland.  That represents approximately 1.5 million ha, 80% of which is degraded.  These bogs emit more than 10% of all our country's greenhouse gases.  It would cost &euro;1.5 billion to restore them.  The Republic of Ireland has 8% of the entire world's blanket bogs.  We are standing on a world-class ecosystem, or at least what could be one.  Peatlands store four times more carbon than tropical rainforests.  Let us take that seriously and prioritise our bogs.  <\/p><p>I did not really get the whole bog thing as a child.  I was reared cutting turf and making gr&oacute;ige&aacute;ns.  It was back-breaking work.  We were given out to and were not allowed mess because we had to get the turf in.  I only got it when visiting new projects such as Scohaboy bog in Cloughjordan, which has developed into an amazing place and amenity for local people.  The farmers flocked together with Gear&oacute;id &Oacute; Foighil and the community to create this amazing space.  I now value bogs in a whole new way.<\/p><p>I will move onto forests and talk about a friend of mine who recycled 500,000 cans 30 years ago.  We were talking about biodiversity 30 years ago.  He used the money from these cans to buy native woodlands and planted trees with children from different schools.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He planted the trees with the children in the schools, and I visited the schools with him.

I welcome the attendance and participation in this debate of my party colleague, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.  I thank Senator Garvey for moving the motion.<\/p> <p>In 1972, a young research assistant made a list of natural and semi-natural habitats in County Kildare with the objective of selecting habitats for preservation.  That research assistant, Roger Goodwillie, who then worked for An Foras Forbartha, which is now the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, made a number of interesting observations.  Back in 1972, referring to my constituency, Mr. Goodwillie stated that bird life in the area was rich and it supported a high population of grouse.  He observed oak wood with a rich flora and abundant bird life, including species such as the nightjar, rich wild fowl feeding and a breeding area for many water birds.  He also noted that the area supported a huge number of snipe.  Almost 50 years later, bird species, such as the curlew, that were once common in my constituency have all but disappeared.  I care about the whole island of Ireland and beyond but I have particular knowledge of my constituency, which is why I have made reference to it.  I hope the rest of Ireland does not feel left out because the issue is a national and global problem.<\/p> <p>In Ireland, the curlew, for example, has suffered a massive decline of 96% since the 1980s, with fewer than a handful of native curlews remaining in County Kildare.  Species of water birds such as lapwing and snipe are already in danger of meeting the same fate.  They live a treacherous existence as they are forced to the very edge of once ecologically rich habitats.  However, we have begun to take steps to address the issue.  The curlew task force, which was established in 2017, and the subsequent action plans under the NPWS, have made tentative progress.  As we know, the NPWS does excellent work but it is chronically under-resourced.  Voluntary organisations, such as Birdwatch Kildare, have made valiant efforts over the years to over the years to safeguard our tiny breeding curlew population in the county.  They have also taken practical steps to provide nesting spaces for swifts, which is another threatened species.  Volunteers across the county, from Johnstownbridge to Athy, have been implementing swift conservation measures.<\/p> <p>Butterfly Conservation Ireland, proudly based in County Kildare, does tremendous work, managing the habitat of rare species of butterfly, such as the dark green fritillary and marsh fritillary.  In Kildare, of the 22 sites originally referenced in the 1972 work, eight are designated as special areas of conservation today under the EU habitats directive.  These include the beautiful, unique Pollardstown Fen, which is fed by an alkaline spring and the Curragh aquifer, and Ballynafagh Lake near Prosperous in north Kildare.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Vincent P. Martin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=VincentPMartin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What is missing is habitats of scale with rich biodiversity potential that could support wildlife and bring back species lost to Ireland.  If we do not take action now and designate further sites throughout the country, not just in the west and north west, our children will never hear the call of the breeding curlew.  Ireland is a winter refuge for many migrating water birds, but these too have suffered declines in recent years.  Researchers at the Kildare branch of BirdWatch Ireland estimate that wading birds such as lapwing and golden plover have declined by 19% in the past ten years.   It is not just water birds.  Countryside birds such as yellowhammer suffered massive declines and the corn bunting is extinct.<\/p><p>A recently published CSO report entitled Environmental Indicators 2020 states that in 2018, Ireland had the third lowest proportion of total land area in the EU 28 designated as terrestrial special protected areas, SPAs, under the EU birds directive, at 6.1%, and the eighth lowest proportion of total land area designated as terrestrial special areas of conservation, SAC, under the EU habitats directive, at 13.1%.  That is a cause of great concern and must be corrected.  One way of approaching it is to increase the designated area to at least match the EU average.  It should include both terrestrial and marine habitats.  Another proposal would be to ensure that management plans are put in place for our designated protection areas to ensure no further loss of biodiversity and to reverse the declines we have seen.<\/p><p>John Hume is often rightly referred to as having been pivotal to the peace process.  He used and invoked the EU when he stated that we all live in a country called Europe and that we should deal with our strengths and commonalities.  I am confident that we will call on the EU again for protection and strength going forward.  The laws are in place but they must be complied with.  I refer to the habitats directive, the birds directive and the water framework directive.  Article 12 of the habitats directive requires the creation of a system of strict protection for certain species.  Member states are obliged to take requisite measures to establish a system of strict protection for the animal species listed in that annexe, including bats and many other animals.  There is an obligation on member states.  The article prohibits the deliberate disturbance of these species, particularly during breeding, rearing, hibernation and migration.  It also prohibits the deterioration or destruction of breeding sites or resting places.<\/p><p>The European Court of Justice has issued many judgments that oblige the State to take action in respect of this matter.  A member state fails to fulfil its obligations under Article 12(1)(b) and (d) of the directive if it does not take all requisite specific measures to prevent the deliberate disturbance of the animal species concerned during their breeding period or allows the deterioration or destruction of their breeding sites.  There is a significant volume of EU law on this matter.  The courts are listening.  One will get a good hearing in court in respect of these matters.  Responsibility begins in an individual capacity but we must have compliance with national and EU law.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled an amendment to the motion.  I welcome its concern for, and love of, bees, although obviously not the B-Specials.  Of course, we should protect the native Irish honey bee.  I have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Hackett, about that.  The specific remit of the Native Irish Honey Bee Society is to protect, preserve and promote the native Irish honey bee.  It is a rare strain of bee.  The dark European strain adapts best to our climate.  The two national associations, namely, the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations and the Irish Beekeepers Association are 100% on board.  In Kildare North and Kildare South, they are among 20 organisations that have signed a voluntary pact to preserve and protect the native Irish honey bee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#LLL00200","speaker":"1667","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and I thank Senators O'Reilly, Garvey and Martin for proposing this motion.  I would not have expected anything less from those Senators.  They have a great slogan and I have a lot of time for green politics, and for the Green Party for that matter.  The slogan is \"Vote Green, get Green\".  I think that is an important maxim, not one of which we should lose sight.  I try to apply it to everything I do here.<\/p> <p>The Green Party is in government and that is important.  The people elected representatives from the Green Party, gave them a strong mandate and expected them to go into government.  I think that going into government was the right thing to do.  However, the Green Party is in government to do something and that is to drive this green agenda, as they have done with other things.  I refer to sustainability and sustainable development goals, SDGs.  I met the leader of the Green Party on Tuesday, and I was particularly taken aback when he gave me this little gift of an SDGs lapel badge, because I have never had one before.  When I left that meeting, I was encouraged to go back and check out SDGs.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge that part of the agreement to be in government was that there would be a strong focus on the SDGs and that we would be mindful of that aspect in all our Oireachtas joint committees.  We are very conscious of that, and we have discussed the SDGs at the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine.  That strong focus has, therefore, taken effect and people need to be constantly reminded of that.  I thank the Green Party and its representatives for that.<\/p> <p>I am not surprised by this motion.  I am more interested in the final part, which calls on the Government to act on its programme for Government.  With all due respect to the Minister of State and her colleagues here, in local government and in Europe - because we have Green Party representatives in Europe and that is also great - I have to say that it is incumbent on all of us to pursue the green agenda.  The leader of the Green Party, the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, referred to not losing sight of that at the meeting I had with him.  It is possible to be distracted when in government by many things.<\/p> <p>In many parts of Ireland, whether on their own or supported by the State, farmers have led the way in projects to protect biodiversity and species.  I want to ensure, as I know the Minister of State does, that farmers are recognised as the custodians of our land and are financially supported in playing their vital role in maintaining and restoring habitats and utilising practices that are ecologically sound.  The Minister of State really understands that aspect more than anybody else because she is a farmer and works on the land.  I want our Government to ensure that the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, rewards farmers for sequestrating carbon, creating habitats and restoring biodiversity, improving water and air quality, producing clean energy and developing schemes that support results-based outcomes.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State and colleagues will also know that we are now planning for CAP policy post 2020.  There is a great emphasis on environmental outcomes in that context, and that is very positive.  It has taken a long journey of more than 20 or 30 years to get to that point, but the importance of those outcomes has now been recognised.  Farmers, however, should not be unfairly penalised for maintaining the land that contributes to diversity principles.  I refer to allowing farmers to accrue some form of benefits, financial or otherwise, if they are proactive in protecting and developing wetlands and native habitats.  That is important.<\/p> <p>What does the Green New Deal say about farmers?  European farmers and fishermen are key to managing this transition, but they want a just transition.  I acknowledge the just transition group within the Green Party, whose members I have found exceptionally helpful and engaging regarding environmental issues I have had to pursue.  It is a really practical advocacy group, as well as being involved and immersed in politics.  The members of the group need to be saluted and recognised.  They are not antagonistic, but they are concerned and they should be encouraged and supported in civic society and politics.<\/p> <p>The farm to fork strategy will of course strengthen efforts to tackle climate change, and that has been repeatedly acknowledged by the Minister of State.  It will also help to protect the environment and preserve our biodiversity.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, the European green deal sets out the farm-to-fork targets.  They include reducing fertiliser by 20%, reducing antibiotics in animals and reducing pesticide use.  There are knock-on effects because when one reduces some of these items, one reduces yields.  That is not a bad thing.  We are over-producing in some areas, but we must acknowledge there will be a knock-on effect in a reduction in yields.  I would prefer to have reduced yields of higher quality, but there are financial implications.  One thing that has emerged from the research by the European Commission on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, is that the income of farmers across Europe is approximately 40% of the income received by people in the commercial and industrial sectors.  There is a drop in incomes and we must acknowledge that.<\/p><p>In terms of biodiversity, we want higher diversity in our natural landscapes and organic production.  I do not doubt any of this from the Green Party as it is very important.  I also wish to speak in support of the amendment from Sinn F&eacute;in, and I presume Senator Boylan will speak on that.  I commit myself to supporting it.  To refer to a few more issues, there is some important legislation coming down the track - we shall be known by our deeds and not our words.  There is the sustainable water environmental abstraction Bill, which has enormous implications for agriculture and the building and construction sector, particularly regarding concrete.  People have wells and others are in local community co-operative water schemes.  In many cases, the cumulative effect of two or three sources of drawing or abstracting water will be a challenge.  We will have to face up to that and we must support farmers in that regard.  There is also a marine Bill coming down the track, which is important.  There have been, and continue to be challenges, in the forestry sector.  The Minister of State has made a start with her Bill, but there are other issues.<\/p><p>What is this motion about?  From my reading of it, we want more funding for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and for farmers to enable them to implement green practices, to create biodiversity habitats on their land and to pay them not to develop wetlands or native habitats.  I support the call for the establishment of a citizens' assembly, a national pollinator plan, a national soil strategy and a national land use plan to conserve and expand native woodlands.  We want to cut down on nitrogen fertiliser and pesticide use, and we want to have a national hedgerow survey and a baseline diversity survey.  All of this is admirable and I support it.  The Green Party is in government.  People voted Green to get green.  It is early days for the party and I hope it will continue the momentum that is required because it will be distracted in many ways down the line.  I sincerely wish the party well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#NNN00100","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Senator Malcolm Byrne.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes this opportunity to discuss solutions to the ongoing biodiversity crisis and will support the motion proposed by the Green Party.  I compliment my colleagues on it.  The rate of global change in nature during the past 50 years is unprecedented in human history.  Nature across most of the globe has now been significantly altered by human activity, with the great majority of ecosystems and biodiversity showing rapid decline.  Globally, 75% of the land surface is significantly altered.  Some 66% of the ocean area is experiencing increasing impacts and over 85% of the wetlands have been lost.<\/p> <p>These global changes have many reverberations in Ireland, where most Irish habitats have unfavourable status.  Bee and butterfly species are in decline and many marine species are now reportedly at risk of extinction.  It is welcome that the Government has moved in several areas to provide additional supports to protect an enhanced biodiversity.  These include moves to establish a new wildlife crime unit in the NPWS, progressing the final report of an independent advisory group on marine protected areas and providing funding in both the July stimulus and budget 2021.  As the motion outlines, the programme for Government also sets out a number of additional actions which are required over the Government's term in office to address the crisis further.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Timmy Dooley:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is vital that the commitments contained in the programme for Government are completed as soon as possible.  In May 2019, Ireland became only the second country in the world to declare a biodiversity emergency, on foot of a Fianna F&aacute;il amendment that I had the pleasure to propose in my time in the D&aacute;il.  In moving this amendment, we recognised that the national biodiversity action plan did not go far enough and that further action was needed at the time.<\/p><p>We also called for the establishment of a Citizens' Assembly on biodiversity loss.  I was very pleased to see such a commitment in the programme for Government that was agreed by the three parties because it will not be by an act of this House that biodiversity will be protected but through the sustained effort of all citizens across the State.  It will not be done by academics sitting in isolation, identifying the problem and directing the custodians of the land to deliver; it will be done in harmony with them.  The farmers are the first people who need to be consulted and their concerns and views taken on board.<\/p><p>I come from a farming family from a small farm in a part of the country where the land is not considered to be especially good.  There is a very significant mix of species there, from rushes to heather, wet land to dry land, trees, shrubs and hedgerows.  Until such time as we come to appreciate that kind of land and remove the burden of production that has become a feature of modern farming, we must provide the appropriate resources to the custodians of this type of land rather than continuing to reward those who focus only on the production of grass, grain and corn through unnatural, forced means to meet our food requirements.  It will have to be done in a holistic way.  We must look at the way we consume and waste food.  This will not be done in isolation.  I hope we can have such a discussion in a Citizens' Assembly where we bring all sides together rather than look at the issue in isolation.  This is a significant problem, which is part of our culture of overproduction based on an insatiable demand for more and more products and greater production that, sadly, ends up dumped in landfill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#OOO00200","speaker":"1655","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Like my colleagues and others in the House, I strongly support this motion.

The programme for Government sets out a certain level of ambition that does not fall only on the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, even though I am certain she is more than capable of leading the charge, but on the entire Government and all Departments.  It falls on all of us and, as my colleague, Senator Dooley, said, on society at large.  We must all play our part in ensuring that in the future we continue to have the diversity of species we currently have.<\/p> <p>Senator Martin spoke very eloquently about the birds.  I will also speak about the bees.  We must recognise the considerable amount of good work that has been done on the all-Ireland pollinator plan by local authorities and Tidy Towns committees, which operate on a voluntary basis right around the country.  The Minister of State might elaborate on the new all-Ireland pollinator plan.  I hope the targets in it are much more ambitious and build on the success of voluntary groups, local authorities and everyone else in order that we can all buy in to the important job of saving the bees.<\/p> <p>One of the positive aspects of the motion is that, as Senator Boyhan stated, it recognises the very important role farmers and the agricultural community have to play in contributing towards the protection of the environment and habitats.

One of the issues we really need to address, and especially in respect of carbon sinks, is allowing farmers and landowners to own carbon credits to allow them to gain a form of income through acting in an environmentally responsible manner.  Farmers are some of the strongest guardians of the environment but they want the transition to be just and they want what they do to be sustainable.  I firmly believe that if we give a system whereby farmers are able to own and trade carbon credits, it will help the sustainability of our environment and the sustainability of farm families, and it will help in the offset of emissions.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan referred to fertiliser as an issue that needs to be addressed.  One of the best things the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, can do, and I believe that many farmers would agree with her, is to attack the current oligopolistic nature of the fertiliser market.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We are speaking today about how we can deal with the biodiversity challenge.  It is a worldwide challenge.  A motion was passed in the last Oireachtas and I believe it is an issue we all support.  Society definitely supports it too.<\/p> <p>The biggest issue in trying to progress this is how to get everybody on board.  This will be a major challenge.  Other speakers have referred to the farming community.  Statistically we are under pressure when it comes to our agricultural and farming community.  When there are more farmers over the age of 80 than under the age of 35 it will be a real issue to have the farming community coming on board.  We are looking at the scenario where 50% of our farmers are over the age of 55 and one third of our farmers over the age of 66.  Those kinds of statistics in any industry will be one of the biggest issues when trying to get major changes in practice and major changes in society.<\/p> <p>Our younger generation of farmers are very well educated having gone through college programmes over four years and then on to agricultural college.  They are the most capable agricultural students in the world.  When one talks of biodiversity, they understand the need for change and they understand that what happened in the 1980s and the 1990s cannot continue.  For a start, they know that the market will not take it.  They know they have to be part of a society and an economy that understands change is required to find solutions for this biodiversity problem.  There have been solutions over the past few years.  On the nitrates issue, for example, there was a targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, grant that brought forward the ability for slurry to be injected into the ground.  The majority of slurry spreading in my part of the world is all now done by a trailing shoe injector.  If I was to say this five years ago, I would have said there was no hope of that happening but it has been a major success and a major change.  We have seen the economic and the environmental impact of major change like that.<\/p> <p>The main challenge facing Ireland as a society is how we get everybody on board in order that we can make this major change in society, which is needed.  That will be the problem.  Our farming generation is the ultimate issue at the moment.  How can we, to borrow the phrase, teach an old dog new tricks?  That is the problem we have at present.  We need to get them on board.  That will be the ultimate problem for the Government.  I believe that the majority of farmers really welcome the Government's plan for the farm retirement scheme.  They want to have an outlet whereby they can move their farm on.  We really have to find a solution to that issue.

I listened to the informative and entertaining speech from Senator Garvey on the issue.  As a pure inner-city woman who grew up in a concrete jungle, I always find it useful to listen to contributors with a knowledge of peat, soil and hedgerows.<\/p><p>It is generally accepted that we are in the middle of a climate and biodiversity crisis with dramatic knock-on effects.  As the motion notes, around 1 million animal species are threatened with extinction within decades.  Last year the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services stated that we are losing plants and animals hundreds of times faster than in the past.  The twin challenges of climate change and a biodiversity crisis arrived at our door very suddenly.  We can choose to rise to the challenge, enhance our food security and rise to the challenge of the effects of climate change or we can decide to ignore it.<\/p><p>The effect of the climate and biodiversity crisis on the world we live in, is immense.  Today each of us came into this Chamber with a face mask.  We are required to socially distance from each other.  We have limited contact with friends.  We will not have the same Christmas this year because we are in the middle of a pandemic, which scientists warn will become a more frequent occurrence in the coming years.  This is because of the climate and biodiversity crisis we have.<\/p><p>Over the weekend, in a supplement to the <i>Financial Times<\/i>, the scientist who co-discovered Ebola said that we are living in the age of pandemics because of how we treat our planet.  He specifically pointed out issues such as deforestation and the loss of biodiversity as the key drivers of our exposure to more zoological viruses, as some animals need to expand their range, move into new areas and their natural home is destroyed. <\/p><p>The Labour Party supports of the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment which references the shocking report last week from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, which pointed out that our forestry industry is a net contributor to CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions and that we should be moving to a more sustainable and biodiverse model of forestry.  This needs to start with our commercial forestry arm, Coillte, which had prioritised non-native trees.  Some 92% of the forests in the Dublin Mountains are comprised of non-native species.<\/p><p>Ireland has a very low tree coverage at just 11%, in the area where I live in Dublin's inner city, we have extremely low tree coverage.  Somebody gave a load of seeds to Dublin Corporation in the 1950s and we have pear trees which are dangerous for older people and not suitable for an inner-city environment.  <\/p><p>In our previous work on both climate and forestry Bills, my Labour Party colleagues, Deputy Sherlock and Senator Hoey, pushed hard to promote alternative forest systems, like continuous cover and broadleaf forests, which we argued was better for climate change mitigation and provided co-benefits such as protecting our biodiversity. <\/p><p>During this debate we have heard many people who have a strong rural and farming background but I want to give an urban perspective.  The majority of the world's population live in cities and we have higher density.  In giving this perspective, it is vital to state the impact that our local authorities can have in supporting biodiversity in our urban centres.  Simple changes and interventions such as supporting more biodiverse non-interventions are really important in terms of maintenance.  Natural interventions are very simple and cheap, such as planting wildflowers, and developing pollinator plans and pathways.  However, much more can be done to take this beyond lip service.  It should not be limited to the climate or parks sections of local authorities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I shall give an example of something that happened in my area a few years ago, which has also happened in other countries.  This issue needs to move beyond specific Departments to other areas that local authorities are dealing with, in terms of our built environment.  Temporary allotments were established in an area that was being regenerated with housing and after the financial crash social housing was built.  When moving the allotments we found another space but many councillors questioned whether we should put allotments on top of buildings.  We were told no because of the depth of soil and heaviness required and, unfortunately, there was no greening of the building in terms of design.  <\/p><p>The programme for Government contains a commitment to build 50,000 publicly built houses over the next five years, which I am not sure I believe.  We need to prioritise greening but that does not have to be complicated or expensive. It just needs to be encouraged.  People need to be informed that sometimes not being green and pristine is a good way to approach the issue.  For example, Milan has a vertical green building comprised of trees called the Bosco Verticale that people travel from all over the world to see and we should incorporate that into our built environment.  The new architectural challenge is to create the garden cities of the 21st century.  We want density because we want people to move around and we want to support a non-car culture but we must do all that in our building environment.  We could very easily incorporate biodiverse environments into that.  Simple interventions that do not cost an awful lot of money need to be encouraged and mainstreamed into local authorities.  The OPW did a lot of work for diversity week but other agencies and the OPW need to mainstream their thinking when it comes to the lands and buildings they maintain. <\/p><p>We support this motion and the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  It is very promising that the Green Party has prioritised this issue by tabling a motion.  I look forward to working with other Members of the Seanad over the next couple of years in terms of mainstreaming that thinking and bringing an inner city voice to the challenges of biodiversity and climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#RRR00200","speaker":"1672","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":153,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Senator Lynn Boylan.

I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the biodiversity crisis that was declared by this House last year.<\/p> <p>As someone who has worked in a national park for years I have a deep connection to biodiversity and am aware of the absolute urgent need to take action to save what is left, and invest in restoring what we can.  I commend the Green Party Senators on what is a very comprehensive motion on tackling the biodiversity crisis.  I look forward to the time when the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Senator Hackett, brings forward the legislation that will fulfil the demands stated in the motion.<\/p> <p>I shall point out two things that I hope will be taken on board by the Government because, unfortunately, no amendments were tabled for them.  One is the inclusion of rhododendron on the list of invasive species.  As someone who has worked in Killarney National Park, I know that we need to take an evidence-based approach to the eradication of rhododendron.  Unfortunately, to date that approach has not been taken in Killarney National Park. <\/p> <p>The motion focuses a lot on the collection of data, and rightly so.  I ask that the Government considers stopping tendering out the running of the National Biodiversity Data Centre and instead bring it under central control but resource it adequately.  That would mean giving permanent contracts to the scientists and researchers employed thus valuing their contribution to society.<\/p> <p>I do not disagree with the intentions of the Bill.  I come from a school of thought that views nature as having value in its own right.  Nature should be protected regardless of the benefits that humans might happen to accrue from it.  Unfortunately, I wince when I hear the term \"ecosystem services\" because nature does not serve us.  In fact, it is rather a case that we in the global North have exploited nature for centuries.  The concept of offsets and ecosystem services are taken from the book of technocratic, green-minded decision-makers who believe that something will not be respected for its intrinsic value but rather only for its monetary value or for what we, as humans, can get out of it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It sets up an unhealthy master-servant relationship with nature and it perpetuates the narrative that nature must be subsumed within the economy rather than the other way around.  Commodifying nature is morally wrong, but it also comes with real risks.  If something can be bought and sold or if one puts a price on something, there will always be people with pockets deep enough to buy their way out of protecting it or to claim ownership of it.  Decommodification activists in the indigenous communities have been warning us for years that in many senses what we are trying to do now with nature is a form of neo-imperialism.  In many cases, it does not have the desired outcomes that people promise.  Payment for ecosystem services risks creating perverse incentives, for example, a forestry system that is set up to store carbon but which incentivises the planting of non-native species or the planting of trees on biodiversity-rich marginal land.  If this sounds familiar, it is because that is the state of forestry in Ireland.  <br\/><br\/>As I said, I wholeheartedly welcome this motion but, with no disrespect to those who drafted it, I wish we did not have to be in a space where we have to calculate the monetary value or cost of not protecting biodiversity and that we would legislate for it because it is the right thing to do.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support this motion but we hope that our amendments will also be supported because we believe they come from a good place and they seek to strengthen the motion which, as I said, is very comprehensive.  One of the Sinn F&eacute;in amendments relates to liquefied natural gas, LNG.  The rationale for it is that the motion outlines how human action is behind the biodiversity crisis and an important driver of that is the climate change crisis.  Changing climate means shifting habitats, seasons and ocean acidification, among other factors that all negatively impact on biodiversity.  In the programme for Government the Green Party secured a partial ban on one specific LNG terminal on the Shannon Estuary but we learned in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>that the leader of the Green Party is considering a plan which could allow the construction of three floating terminals and turn Ireland into a massive exporter of fossil gas.  The clear signal that this State could send to the fossil fuel industry is a ban on new fossil fuel infrastructure such as these terminals for liquefied natural gas.  <br\/><br\/>Sinn F&eacute;in has also tabled an amendment calling for the climate Bill that is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny to actively support the implementation of the national biodiversity action plan.  We have heard from eminent speakers at the Joint Committee on Climate Action why this is so important.  We need to take climate action to protect biodiversity but how we take that action can adversely impact on biodiversity.  It is essential that the actions that we take to address climate breakdown and biodiversity loss are fully complementary.  Again, I hope that this amendment will be accepted because it is critical it is included in the climate Bill.<br\/><br\/>Senator Martin stole my thunder in speaking on the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment with regard to bees.  Ireland has potentially the greatest reserve of <i>Apis mellifera<\/i>in the world.  We need urgent action to protect it.  I have engaged with beekeepers, particularly in Connemara, who are desperate for action in this area.  Voluntary does not cut it.  We need to have a strategy in place because these beekeepers are finding non-native bees in their hives today and every day and they are demanding that action be taken on the issue.<br\/><br\/>Sinn F&eacute;in wants to work with colleagues in this House.  Our amendments come from a good place.  We believe they are constructive and we hope that Senators will support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#SSS00500","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Like others, I welcome the motion and the opportunity to discuss the biodiversity crisis.  It is a crisis we discussed at some length in this House in various debates over the course of the previous Oireachtas, including on the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill and the Heritage Act, because it cuts across so much of our policy in Ireland.<!--\/p--> <p>It is always useful at the beginning of any discussion on biodiversity to reflect on how extraordinarily fortunate we are to be living on the only known planet with life.  It is a planet on which, if one considers the extraordinary diversity of life in any acre of peatland or rainforest, there is an extraordinary and impossible complexity of life.  It is an extraordinary mark of shame that over the past century, humans have been stripping the colour, texture, voice, diversity, sound and richness of that complexity out of the environments we occupy.  The evidence is there in the massive escalation in the loss of habitat and of species.  I will not go into all of the figures because they are comprehensively discussed in this amendment.  It mentions the fact that 500,000 species face extinction and that more than half of our native bird species are either on the red or amber list of endangerment.<\/p> <p>This motion could be stronger on how we respond to that crisis and perhaps the Minister of State will address these issues in her response.  I acknowledge a positive measure in the motion in that it recognises that biodiversity is not just important for the economy but that it is important for humanity in the wider sense as well as spiritually and morally.  That is recognised in the motion.  When we come to the actions in this motion, however, it does not say enough about what we can do.  If this is a crisis, and we recognised that it was in 2018 while some people recognised it long before that, then action needs to be taken.  While there are many proposals relating to measurement and future strategy in this motion, there is no commitment to action and to use every tool we have.<\/p> <p>I am concerned, for example, that when we look to the commitment to moving towards a better forestry strategy, the strategy is referenced in the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment but it is not directly referenced in the motion.  We are due to have a new forestry strategy in Ireland, starting next January.  Surely this is an opportunity to genuinely commit to placing biodiversity at the centre of that.  I will mention a concerning indictment of our strategy.  The recent \"Spruced Up\" article by Niall Sargent and Noteworthy informed us that there have only been three environmental impact assessments relating to the 17,000 afforestation licences that have issued since 2010.  The environmental impact assessment is a tool we already have.  It should be used robustly and at every opportunity and it should not be something we seek to avoid or be an unnecessary hurdle that we try to evade wherever we can.  The Government can immediately commit to using the environmental impact assessment tool more widely and robustly.  We have tools in the directives from Europe on birds, habitats and water.  Again, we need an active and robust engagement on using them.  It was mentioned that Europe would guide us but we can also guide Europe.  I hope we will have an indication today of an intention for Ireland to push back strongly on the proposals in the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, to diminish opportunities for countries to set a value on ecological care, biodiversity work and that custodianship, which is so important.  We need to have a robust challenge from Ireland to a CAP that goes against the vision of a green Europe.  We also need to hear that Ireland will not seek a derogation under the nitrates directive.  If we are concerned about nitrogen in our soil, one thing we can do is stop making a special exception to allow us to use even more of it.<\/p> <p>On hedgerows, we had a system under the heritage Bill, which was dismantled.  It is fine to conduct a hedgerow survey but we also need to amend the heritage Bill, which allows landowners to personally interpret the Roads Act 1993 without any reference to, or engagement with, local councils, meaning we do not know what is happening with our hedgerows.  We cannot stand over that.<\/p> <p>I welcome the reference to the national pollinator strategy in the motion and the proposal for a national soil strategy.<\/p> <p>Let us make them statutory; not simply an aspirational guide but something concrete that needs to be reflected in planning and in local authority strategies at both urban and rural levels.  <\/p> <p>There is another issue at play here, although I did not submit an amendment on it because I am hoping the Minister of State will clarify her intentions.  The motion refers to farmers as \"the custodians\".  I accept that farmers and people across rural Ireland are some of the most passionate advocates on behalf of the environment and our ecology but they are not \"the\" custodians alone.  Certainly they are custodians but we are all custodians.  People in rural and urban Ireland, public representatives, members of BirdWatch Ireland, the beekeepers of Ireland, members of Butterfly Conservation Ireland and so many others are also custodians.  I am concerned about the suggestion of a Citizens' Assembly to motivate people and to channel the individual ingenuity of citizenry because we cannot put this all on citizens and say the public needs to do more.  Part of citizenry is recourse to justice and it is really disappointing that in the recent forestry debate we had a framing of those citizens who seek to do the work the State has not always done in the area of environmental scrutiny as vexatious and problematic.  We need to celebrate citizens who step up but we cannot leave it to them alone.  The State needs to use all of its powers and tools.  <\/p> <p>I recognise that this is a positive marker but let us translate it into concrete policy actions at every level.  Let us also see in the context of our land use strategy that biodiversity is not simply a subsection of farming but something far wider.  It is not, as was very eloquently described, simply about services.  One line from the climate talks in Madrid last year still stays with me.  An investor spoke about the exciting potential in trees and said that \"trees are the best thing we have invented yet\".  There is a certain hubris in that.  Humans did not invent trees and they are not simply reducible to vehicles for storing carbon, sources of fuel or building materials.  It is a concern that so often we hear of the same tree supposedly performing all three functions.  The tree, all of the wide diversity in nature and all of the ecological beauty that is there are things we cannot create.  We can only nurture, protect, encourage and support nature through rewilding, rewetting and the restoration of habitats.  We can stop being part of the problem and start being part of the framing of a positive solution but if it is lost, it is lost forever.

In this case, human interference is positive with dedicated men and women doing back-breaking work to clear the rhododendron.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Shane Cassells:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, there is a long-running issue and tension between the NPWS and the volunteers on the ground in Killarney, who have been clearing the rhododendrons for four decades.  The volunteers on the ground know the ecology of the area very well.  I met several of them during the summer, including the O&rsquo;Donoghue family who operate the tour of the lakes in Killarney, and then in the evenings and weekends go out with other volunteers to do that back-breaking work to clear the rhododendrons because they value the area and are passionate about it.  However, they are also very aware of protecting the area because they make their living from the tourism industry, as do so many in County Kerry, and they want to make sure they have a vibrant industry.  There is a problem between the collaboration of the volunteer groups and the NPWS on this work.<br\/><br\/>The impact of the relentless erosion of woodlands by this invasive species is unbelievable.  It is causing devastation to the ecological balance and to the habitat of many different species in the first national park established in this country.  The destruction of the national park by this invasive species had been brought under control many years ago but the problem exploded again and in recent years volunteer groups have cleared hundreds of hectares of rhododendron from half a dozen of Killarney's most valuable woods.  Volunteers have stressed the need for them to be able to go back in and conduct surveys and sweeps of the cleared areas to make sure the rhododendrons are not returning from dormant seeds.  This request was not facilitated.  That is the issue in that part of the motion and the power struggle with officialdom.<br\/><br\/>A couple of years ago <i>The Irish Times<\/i>carried a special major feature by Paddy Woodworth on the threat to our national park.  It featured a quote from Therese Higgins who stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe issue is not who does the work ... but ... whether the cleared areas stay clear.  I can see no way forward as long as NPWS conservation work is not directed by science. <\/blockquote><p>The motion calls for the strengthening of the NPWS, but I do not want a strengthening of officialdom and the system if it is not working collaboratively with those who are trying to protect the ecology of the area who know it best.  I accept that it is not just motivated by ecological reasons but commercial tourism reasons as well.  If the jewel in the crown of Ireland's national parks is allowed to be destroyed because of a power struggle, tourists will never return to Kerry, pandemic or no pandemic.<br\/><br\/>I urge the Minister of State to address the issue in her closing remarks.  I support the motion, which is very nuanced and very well thought out and researched.  We can empower a lot of people to do work and find that the net result does not give us what we set out to do in the first place.  I urge these Houses to listen to the people on the ground on many different topics.  They are helping communities at the coalface.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#VVV00200","speaker":"1641","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.  We know each other from Offaly and also from Galway.  Like the Minister of State, who is a farmer, I also come from a farming background.  I grew up on a farm, worked on a farm and got the green certificate.  The amount of research that has been done in the past ten to 20 years that shows us the loss of wildlife and habitats is shocking.<\/p> <p>It is crucially important to maintain wildlife and increase what we have.  I believe local authorities have a crucial role to play in doing that.  I mentioned my background and how I came to be involved in public representation in an earlier discussion.  It was related to the environmental impact of the development of a waste transfer station in the Ballinasloe area.  The impact was on the waterways in low-lying floodplains.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aisling Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We came together as a community group to challenge the local authority and ensure that the habitats directive was upheld.  I appreciate that, as mentioned in the motion, the status of protected natural habitats is under threat.  I call on the Minister of State to consider providing, through future legislation, extra resources for the underfunded and under-resourced environmental section in each local authority.  Individuals and groups, including community groups, are working together to protect the environment in which they live.  We must ensure that they are supported in doing so but also that it is not the case that individuals must come together to fight against local authorities or groups that have planning unfavourable to protecting the environment.<\/p><p>Protecting wildlife is important.  The River Suck has a special protection area, SPA.  The birds directive covers a number of birds there, including the Whooper swan.  As Senator Martin mentioned, the marsh fritillary butterfly is the only protected butterfly in the EU.  It is found in Ballinasloe exactly where the low-lying floodplains are.  The devil's-bit scabious is a food plant for it.  How do we protect the devil's-bit scabious in our unique boglands?<\/p><p>I pay tribute to the groups that are doing great work.  The Living Bog is protecting many of our raised bogs, for example, in Mountbellew.  There are also a number of raised bogs in Roscommon.  Such groups are doing their best to protect what is there and ensure that people can enjoy the resources and amenities on our doorsteps.<\/p><p>As well as making sure that we have regulations and biodiversity plans, we must bring our community groups with us.  We must ensure that people can see the amenities, resources and wildlife habitats if we are to be able to maintain them in the long term, for example, walkways, cycleways and greenways that pass through the areas in a way that protects the land and the species, and if people are to know the value in keeping what we have.<\/p><p>Speaking as someone from a farming background, I take on board Senator Lombard's point about the importance of the generational aspect for farmers and bringing them with us.  I come from an area where there are suckler farmers and many small farms, and off-farm income is crucial.  Much of that income comes from ecotourism.  I was pleased to see from a recent Teagasc presentation on using less technology and having lower emissions, including from slurry, that so much work was being done and that farmers were leading in terms of technology to ensure that we would be able to meet our European requirements.  I call on the Minister of State to take into account the work that farmers are doing in leading the charge and to consider funding our local authorities to ensure that areas that are currently protected remain so and that, crucially, the number of wildlife habitats on publicly owned lands is increased.  Our community group is going through all of that right now, which just shows that individuals and community groups have to fight hard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#WWW00200","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Like other Senators, I welcome this motion on biodiversity.  I am delighted to see the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.  Between the Mayo and Offaly connection and her love of land, she is the best person we could have as Minister of State with responsibility for this issue.  I will work with her.<\/p> <p>I could reiterate much of what has been said.  Regardless of what side we come from, there is a recognition that we have to deal with this issue, but we must do so in a fair manner.  That is evident from today's discussion.  Many of us grew up in rural Ireland.  I often make the point that those of us who were reared on small or medium-sized farms grew up with such positive environmental lives.  We grew up where our parents would not touch a bird's nest.  If we had some poultry in our gardens and during the summer our hens came along with a clutch of chickens, it was a fantastic thing for children to witness.  The idea of working with schools is found throughout this motion and Government policy.  If we listened more to our younger generation, we would see that younger people were coming up with many good ideas.  As adults, we have to buy into that.  One could not walk into any school today, be it urban or rural, without seeing biodiversity initiatives in action.  That is fantastic.  Combined with everything the pupils are doing with their teachers in this regard, it gives me great hope for the future.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Eugene Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In certain respects, some people have the belief that many farmers are basically anti-environment.  They are not.  The key to success is working with the farming communities.  All farming organisations have environmental committees and specific members dealing with environmental issues.  I spoke before the budget to members of Macra na Feirme.  Their interest in biodiversity was extraordinarily positive.<\/p><p>I recall the environmentally friendly ways that our parents and grandparents had of dealing with issues.  There was no dumping of waste food - the crumbs were thrown out to the birds.  Children were told about every type of bird - that is a robin, that is a blue tit, that is a bullfinch.  This all happened on the farms of Ireland.  From my perspective, it was a most amazing experience as a young person.  We need to find some way of returning to that.  We must encourage people to grow vegetables and fruit trees in their gardens again.  Those used to be part of every farm in my area of County Roscommon.  I am sure that many of the Senators around me who come from a rural background, regardless of whether they now live in Dublin city, Cork city, Galway city or some other large urban area, can identify with this experience.  It is an important aspect to remember in the debate.<\/p><p>Turning to the programme for Government, it is important that we see commitments to the promotion of biodiversity in our schools.  The more we link up with schools, the more we will learn.  It is important to review the protection of our natural heritage, including hedgerows.  When discussing carbon, we must take into account the importance of our hedgerows in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Dolan and others spoke about having stronger links with local authorities, be they in urban or rural areas, in terms of additional programmes and providing them the funding to do more.<\/p><p>People talk about pesticides on farms.  I come from an horticultural background.  It is what I studied in college.  I do not like pesticides, but some use of pesticides is needed in some farm situations.  Many of those farmers would like there to be a safer and environmentally friendlier way.  Surely that is something that we can work through.<\/p><p>I like the great idea in the programme for Government about having an annual biodiversity award scheme.<\/p><p>If one dictates to or speaks down to people, one creates a barrier and a division.  Regardless of our parties or whether we are Independents, we as politicians must always work to bring groups together.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Eugene Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If some farming group expresses anger or concern about an environmental issue then I believe going and speaking to those people, listening to their point of view and pointing out some change that can be made will be better for everybody.  That often works.  There should not be an \"us and them\" in this debate.  It is important for all of us to keep that in mind as we further debate these issues and bring in legislation on them.<\/p><p>There were many aspects of farming in the past and it was tough for people to have enough income to survive.  Remember, however, it is tough to have a liveable income out of many farming methods today.  Any of us who are politicians will know that if farmers do not have what is called \"the cheque in the post\" and other things to help them along the route, they would not have financial survival mechanisms.  That is the reality.  Anything we can suggest or propose as politicians, in conjunction with the farming organisations or horticultural or agricultural organisations or whatever they are, might say to somebody if he or she made a slight change on his or her farm of 40 acres and started producing something else then it might pay.  I am, however, a great believer in pilot schemes and adequately financing people to work on that for a few years to see whether it will work out financially.<\/p><p>All in all, this is a good motion.  Obviously, there will be further debate on aspects of it but in terms of forestry we need to have a real and big discussion on it.  I know that will come up in terms of what we will bring forward, hopefully, in 2021.  There is much positivity coming out of forestry if it is handled the right way.<\/p><p>I have referred before to Sliabh Bawn in my neck of the woods and I believe I spoke to the Minister about it.  Coillte owns a vast area of land where it has grown mainly trees and spruces, in particular, that we can have issues with.   It is, however, an important part of creating jobs and money.  In terms of where we put in a wind farm, however, which people did not like, Coillte along with Roscommon County Council has opened up a fascinating walkway and runway and it shows up the history of the area.  It is a beautiful place I would encourage people to walk for their well-being.  It is a fantastic place to have on one's doorstep right now.  There are, therefore, ways we can make huge improvements and ways we can bring the vast majority of people with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#XXX00200","speaker":"1674","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  Many times we spoke about climate action and a climate crisis.  This is our opportunity today as Greens to put biodiversity on the table for its own sake and not to mix up messages.  Absolutely, we need to look at how both can exacerbate each other's problems but today it is about biodiversity.<\/p> <p>As a Government, we have two Ministers with responsibility for biodiversity, one of whom is a Minister in Cabinet.  We have the Ministers, Senator Hackett and Deputy Noonan, and that is a valuable position to be in.  I agree, however, with many of the comments that this is an all-of-government issue and must go across every Department.  In fact, as a spokesperson on education I believe it must permeate every bit of children's lives as well.<\/p> <p>Today, what I will say is a kind of love note to suburbia because it often gets forgotten.  Senator Moynihan spoke passionately about inner cities and architecture.  We also hear from farming communities.  I have had much experience coming from a farming background too but really I grew up, raised my family and will more than likely end my days in suburbia in a much-loved three-up, two-down.<\/p> <p>When I was growing up we had insects hitting our windows.  We were stung by bees frequently.  We sat on our doorsteps and identified birds, as has been outlined by Senator Murphy as well on his farm.  We did the same, however, in suburbia and it was an important part of our upbringing.  What we did not have was the understanding of what we were about to lose.  For that reason, steps were not put in place to save the things we were about to lose.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Much of this is related to the interests of corporations and monoculture but also a lack of understanding.  We must bring people with us as we move forward.  Suburban parks in those days were barren, scorched places and planting was frequently spruce.  We must reverse that and bring people with us as we do so.<\/p><p>In the past few months, I have witnessed the unfolding of nature around me.  On my street, mowing has stopped and I see wild flowers surging, children out playing and experiencing nature and older neighbours hand-picking weeds.  My campaign manager, Claire Hillery, started a campaign in Galway called \"Say No to the Mow\".  People became aware of all the colours they could see because of the surge in the number of wild flowers.  When we looked outside, we no longer saw only green but pinks, blues and yellows, perhaps as a result of that.<\/p><p>I was also honoured to chair the climate action and environment strategic policy committee of Galway City Council at the time we put forward and adopted the all-Ireland pollinator plan.  We had dedicated volunteers on the committee who did much work for years.  Parks around the city have been transformed.  What we must do is explain the message because the council has been criticised for not collecting grass or waste materials, for instance, and not doing as much mowing.  We need to take that criticism on board, start a conversation on it and explain that we are doing this because we are giving back to nature.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, will bring forward the fourth national biodiversity action plan next year setting out our policies under the European Green Deal and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.  I welcome that.  As Senator Dolan correctly stated, that needs to be implemented at local authority level.  In my final year as a councillor on Galway City Council, we managed to have a biodiversity officer and a tree officer appointed.  That has not happened in all local authorities but it is an area on which we can make progress.<\/p><p>When I was growing up in the 1970s and 1980s, bogs were cherished as sources of fuel and because people had fun on them on days out with their families.  The Department has funded a significant biodiversity restoration initiative, the Atlantic bog project, in recognition of the strength of the role bogs play in biodiversity and as carbon sinks.  This was done outside the programme for Government.  The project will be on 2,100 ha of bogs on the Atlantic coast and I am delighted that Derryclare bog in Galway will be one of them.<\/p><p>We need to remove commercial forests from bogland.  I take exception to comments that we should not look at the economy.  We must understand and recognise that farmers make a living from these lands.  We must recognise that they have been let down by the Common Agricultural Policy.  The EU habitats directive, the importance of which my colleague has spoken about, also gets a mixed reaction from farmers, particularly in the west which I know well.  People need to make an income from their land, as they are used to doing.  We need to look at biodiversity in economic terms as well.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I fundamentally believe this, which is why I welcome the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, being in the Department with responsibility for agriculture.  She takes that approach and looks at farmers' interests as well as nature's interests.  Both have to go hand in hand because human beings are part of the ecosystem.<\/p><p>When we were younger we looked at plastic and we now understand that we should not put all of the bottles into the same bin and we do not put paper and cardboard in the same bin as food waste.  In the short time we have had, we have taken a huge step forward in our understanding of plastic waste, partly because people can look at images on David Attenborough's television programmes and elsewhere and see what it actually does to our marine life.  This is the first step in some ways for us in the Government to look at biodiversity in the fullest sense and really show it to people in a really concrete way.  When people stand at the front doors of their suburban homes they no longer get stung by bees or see insects or other wildlife.  We must think back to how it used to be for previous generations and think forward to what we can do now and what the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Fine Gael Party have the opportunity to do in government in partnership with the Opposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":171,"content":"<p>We have to call the Minister of State at 4.59 p.m. and we have four speakers remaining.

I welcome the Minister of State.  This is a very important area.  I am a former REPS planner and I know the important role farmers have played in environmental programmes over the years.  The Minister of State will be developing a new REPS scheme.  As the original REPS programme transitioned into the agri-environment options scheme and GLAS, it switched from a whole farm approach to more targeted measures.  We saw that farmers recognise the value of stone walls and hedgerows and they became landscape features to be protected under basic farm payments.  The riparian zones were a supplementary measure under the original REPS.  There is great potential in nutrient interception, shading rivers and reducing temperatures in regard to the value of habitats as they are and as shelters.<\/p> <p>The potential in this area is huge.  I am particularly concerned that in the past many farmers viewed scrub as waste ground, as did the State which provided grants to reclaim it.  That has changed and, as Senator Lombard said, newer generations understand the importance of habitats and ecosystems.  The EU possibly does not as people still get money for forage areas.  In order to avail of maximum payments farmers have to keep controlling those areas that are becoming scrubby.  They are penalised with regard to areas that are not grassland or forage areas.  I ask the Minister of State to see whether this can be changed in the next CAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#BBBB00700","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Kyne for sharing his time.

I will shorten my speech considerably because of the time.  Between 35% and 40% of the food produced worldwide is wasted.  Europe should play an important role in food packaging.  New types of food packaging will allow food to be transported further and further afield.  Fresh flowers can be packaged and sent by sea rather than by air.  All of the flowers from Africa come by air and are transported through Europe.  They could be transported by sea using a modified air packaging system.  This approach has to be pushed by the European Union and various European governments.  Farmers should be compensated or paid if they play an active role in this.<\/p> <p>On biodiversity, there was a major issue with a species of snail when the Naas dual carriageway was being developed.  I have asked several Ministers from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine what has happened.  Have surveys been carried out on any destruction caused or whether the Naas dual carriageway had a devastating effect on the snail at the time?  Did the snail come back?  Is it in the area at present?  In my area, it was argued that wind farms would have a big effect on grouse numbers but grouse are now nesting under the pylons.  I would like surveys to be carried out in this regard.  We have an area of diluvian woodland and an issue with regard to displacement of the freshwater pearl mussel by infrastructure.  Does development have a detrimental effect on freshwater pearl mussels or do they just move on to another place?  I understand that no trials have been done in this area.

Since the introduction of the tomato box, there has been very little change in the way stoned fruit and vegetables are packaged.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paddy Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This type of modified air packaging gives considerable additional time to fresh flowers and would revolutionise the industry by using sea transport rather than air transport, which is used at the moment.

Many projects have been held up over the years by the intended displacement of certain species.  Has that been as detrimental as proposed?

It follows an amendment that my party tabled in the D&aacute;il last year that made Ireland only the second country in the world to declare a biodiversity emergency.  Without doubt there is an emergency.  We all learn from the people around us and we have all learned a great deal from David Attenborough and Greta Thunberg, most recently, over the past few years.  I learned from a man that I would like to pay tribute to the late Joe Lynch from Valentia and Rathangan.  He was incredibly passionate about the biodiversity and heritage both of his native Kerry and Kildare.  Not a week went by that without me receiving an email or a newspaper cutting of an article from him on biodiversity.  I miss receiving those missives from Joe and we miss him in so many ways.  His message always was, \"This is getting too late and we have a crisis.\"  He was correct because the statistics show that the change in nature globally over the past 50 years is unprecedented when we consider how nature across the world has been significantly altered by human activity.  We must do different things to make this right.  We must respect the diversity of life and our habitats.  We must strike a sustainable balance between man, animals, wildlife, what we grow and the earth.<\/p> <p>Regarding Ireland's biodiversity heritage, I am very lucky that Pollardstown Fen is within 5 km of where I live in County Kildare.  The fen is a most beautiful place and I recommend everyone to visit it to see its biodiversity that exists with support.  I also live very close to the Bog of Allen and, again, there are specific actions that need to be taken there and at Ummerus Bog.   <\/p> <p>The Curragh is an important place for heritage and biodiversity.  I look forward to support in this House to help declare the Curragh a unique conservation area.  It needs to be designated a heritage park.  I thank Gaye Brabazon and Karen Tyrell for all of the education that they afforded myself and many others on walks across the Curragh in helping us to learn and understand its flora and fauna.   We learn much from those who went before us regarding how they preserved and respected the land.

I agree with what Senator Pauline O'Reilly said, that is, the fact that the Minister of State comes from a farming background is very important in terms of understanding biodiversity.

It was reported towards the end of last month or last week that our managed forestry estate has become a net emitter of carbon, according to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  That would be a staggering finding as it contradicts the Government's position that Irish forests are a significant carbon sink and carbon store. I have just seen a statement provided by the Minister of State that refutes the claim so I would appreciate if she expanded on the issue.  If the claim is true then it would make us one of two EU states where forests are emitters rather than carbon sinks.<\/p> <p>Following freedom of information requests, we know that not a single environmental impact assessment was conducted on large scale plants in terms of peat soils.  The forestry model has been touched on a lot here today.  A new forestry strategy is due but it must deliver for biodiversity and our climate.  It must also deliver for workers and communities who depend on forestry.  The strategy must ensure that we grow the right trees in the right place yet not sacrifice biodiversity in the west, for example, by planting Sitka spruce or enable biodiversity destruction on intensive dairy farms in the east. <\/p> <p>The last issue that I shall speak to is the honey bee.  It is mentioned in the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment because we must protect the Irish native honey bee as it is at risk of extinction.  A recent study showed that, potentially, we have the greatest reserve of the northern dark bee in the world.  However, our magnificent bees are under threat from non-native bees that is leading to the hybridisation of our local native bees.  I call on the Government to give particular consideration to the Irish native honey bee and act as quickly as possible as every passing day erodes the genetics of local bee colonies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#EEEE00200","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I have argued before that farmers would appreciate Natura and protected areas if they are compensated as they were under the rural environment protection scheme, REPS.  As the Minister of State will know, there are excellent schemes that are targeted at geographical areas such as Burren Life, Aran Life and the hen harrier project.  These schemes provide financial support and compensation for targeted works and measures.<\/p> <p>REPS has taught farmers the value of stone walls and hedgerows.  Thankfully, we have many thousands of kilometres of hedgerows but they were not taken into account for the carbon storage value because more research was needed on what value to place on them.  Therefore, it is important that we get a value.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The impact of large-scale farming and tillage farming has seen the loss of some hedgerows and stone walls.  As well as being habitats and ecosystems, they have practical benefits for farmers, whether in terms of controlling grazing or for shelter, and we must also acknowledge their historical values as townland or barony boundaries.<br\/><br\/>Planting of new hedgerows and the maintenance and protection of stone walls have been the cornerstone of previous REP schemes.  Stone walls are features of the Aran Islands, for example, and many parts of the west coast.  They are a unique part of the landscape.  It has always seemed strange to me that many of the larger farmers in some parts of the country that have lower levels of habitat, whether it be hedgerows, scrubland or whatever else, would end up with higher payments than those who had many habitats and ecosystems under the single farm payment system.  That could be looked at as well.<br\/><br\/>More could also be done in regard to trees.  Each farm should have at least one grove of trees in conjunction, where possible, with neighbours, both as shelter for nesting birds and as corridors for mammals.  That would all be beneficial.  I am in favour of having planting events on farms where generations of the family come together, such as grandparents, parents and grandchildren.  It would be a positive experience for a young child of between five and eight to remember planting a tree with their grandfather or planting a grove of trees with their parents, and when they are in their 70s and 80s, they would be able to do the same, or at least to remember it.<br\/><br\/>I mentioned the riparian zones and the importance of encouraging the planting of individual trees in hedgerows as part of schemes.  Flooding, as we know, is natural.  Climate change may make it more common or more sudden and result in greater volumes.  Drainage schemes in the past were part of the solution to provide more farmland and there were and still are impacts downstream.  Only with the agreement and compensation of farmers can some floodplains be recreated upstream from major cities or towns where there is a flood problem.<br\/><br\/>Reference was made to the re-wetting of bogs.  We saw events in Clifden in September, and while we cannot say what the exact cause was, we must examine what solutions can be found.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, is looking at solutions.  Are there solutions upstream in terms of water storage on the bog areas?  We have seen changes to the practice of clear-felling of trees, which is welcome.  That is an issue that was highlighted in the early to mid-2000s in Galway when concerns were raised about eutrophication on Lough Corrib caused by sewerage works, septic tanks, coniferous plantation run-off and farming.  It is debatable which order those causes would be put in but there has been much progress as well and improvements to all of those areas.  As other speakers have said, knowledge and education in farming as well as investment has been most beneficial.  In the 1980s there were many cases of silage effluent run-off causing pollution and fish kills and, thankfully, we no longer see that nowadays.<br\/><br\/>The first time I spoke in the Lower House in 2011 it was about invasive species, which is an area I like to speak about.  <i>Lagarosiphon major<\/i>, African pondweed, is being maintained and controlled on Lough Corrib now but it was a problem.  Rhododendron has been mentioned by other speakers.  Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam are also invasive species that add to the challenges we face.<br\/><br\/>There is an onus and requirement on us to protect bogs, yet we must recognise the need for some to cut turf.  Rather than taking a confrontational approach, which occurred in the past, the best approach is the reduce the need for the cutting of turf by means of the schemes we have for the insulation and retrofitting of homes.  I took the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill on behalf of the then Minister, Deputy Madigan, in this House.  It focused on looking at State-owned lands in regard to raised bogs.  Many farmers were aggrieved because they felt that the small guy was being stopped and yet the big guys such as Bord na M&oacute;na and the State were being left untouched.  There is recognition of that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020110500002#EEEE00300","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604572200,"counter":188,"content":"<p>We extended the time provided for the debate to facilitate Members who were in the Chamber at the time but I will not allow any other speakers in.

The extension of time by half an hour demonstrates the passion in the House for this issue, which I welcome.<\/p> <p>All Senators spoke passionately on the motion.  I think of Senator O'Loughlin's account of the habitats and areas close to her own home.  I thank Senator Boyhan for his well wishes for my party in this Government.  I concur with Senator Murphy's comment to the effect that no matter what side one is on, everyone realises that we have to do something about the crisis we are in.  On behalf of the Government, I am delighted to support the proposed motion on the biodiversity emergency put forward by my colleagues, Senators O'Reilly, Garvey and Martin.<\/p> <p>Biodiversity is a keystone to our way of life and must be respected and restored, and it is essential that it remains high on the political agenda.  We are in the middle of a biodiversity crisis.  As the motion indicates, on a European and national level, we are seeing notable declines in our overall net biodiversity figures for both species and habitats and general biodiversity quality.  The primary drivers of these declines have been attributed mainly to human-related activities being carried out in an unsustainable manner, which have damaged and, indeed, removed many natural habitats that are essential for support.  Senator Paddy Burke made an interesting point on the effects of current infrastructure.  I accept he was coming from the other aspect of it, but it resonated with me in a different way.<\/p> <p>Climate change also has a direct influence on biodiversity, both land-based and marine-based.  If anyone needs reminding of the devastation that is happening in our natural world, a review of any of the recent documentaries from Sir David Attenborough, now in his 95th year, would soon illustrate in beautiful filmography what we have done.  A number of speakers referred to him.  The \"Blue Planet\" and \"Our Planet\" series are excellent, and his most recent documentary film \"A Life on Our Planet\", which is his self-declared witness statement on his life, and our future, is particularly sobering.  It is well worth watching.  The Covid crisis we are now in, as highlighted by Senator Moynihan, may well have its roots in ecological disruption and breakdown.<\/p> <p>Biodiversity underpins every facet of our lives, be it the environmental, social, and economic foundations.  I support the stated aim in the motion that action is needed by this Government to help reverse the marked decline in our biodiversity.  I take on board the comments of Senator Cassells.  A couple of Senators mentioned rhododendrons in addition to the many other invasive species of flora and fauna.  As I helped on one occasion to clear rhododendron in Abbeyleix Bog, I fully acknowledge the slow, arduous, back-breaking process involved, largely undertaken by volunteers.<\/p> <p>My party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, who has special responsibility for heritage in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, has within that remit, a significant role to play in biodiversity and natural heritage support, and with responsibility for the NPWS, there is a the vast expanse of lands within Natura 2000 designations.  Senator Dolan raised the issue of local authority engagement.  I assure her that the Minister of State will actively engage with local authorities in that regard.  His Department will lead in the development of the 4th national biodiversity action plan, which should be in line with policies under the EU Green New Deal, and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity Post-2020 Biodiversity Framework.<\/p> <p>In his contribution, Senator Dooley also highlighted some of the positive developments from the Minister of State's Department.  My Department along with Deputy Noonan's Department, and other Departments and State agencies, will actively work with a biodiversity focus on establishing a database for our natural capital, to establish an inventory of the ecosystem services we have, and their symbiotic relationship and value to the wider economy, society,and our shared environment.  This involves developing new pollinator plans, supporting the collection of biodiversity data, developing a soils strategy, completing a national hedgerow survey, and carrying out a baseline biodiversity survey on Irish farms.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pippa Hackett:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=0000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Many of these initiatives will be supported through budget 2021 funding, as well as the provision of biodiversity training for farmers, the very people we will probably rely on the to deliver in practice and on the ground for biodiversity.  Senator Lombard highlighted that we have to get farmers on board in this regard.  Doing so is a vital cog in achieving our ambitions.<\/p><p>Senators Boylan and Higgins regarded putting a monetary value on our ecosystems as unsavoury.  I understand where they are coming from but I invite both of them to chat to farmers in designated areas and learn what the designation means to them and how their land has been devalued because of it.  My colleague, Senator Pauline O'Reilly, put it much more eloquently in suggesting that if we want the farmers to manage the land in the way we want, we have to put a value on that management.<\/p><p>Positive measures being taken to address the biodiversity challenges of our country include numerous farm-based, locally-led schemes that work well.  These projects are examining how we can incorporate biodiversity and the awareness of its importance into agriculture. There are 23 projects under way as part of European innovation partnerships, EIPs, many of which are steering efforts with a focus on improving our biodiversity and climate action.  Many of the EIP goals, supported by my Department, target the restoration, preservation and enhancement of biodiversity in farmland habitats towards more sustainable agricultural management practices that will have positive implications for biodiversity.  Support and engagement with citizens and farmers, as the custodians of much of our landscape, but perhaps not all of it, is critical in achieving this goal.  Indeed, increasing the area under organic farming and in horticulture should also benefit biodiversity.<\/p><p>I did not realise Senator Kyne is a former REPS planner.  I would appreciate having time to sit down with him sometime to discuss how we can position ourselves and make our vision for biodiversity fit with what farmers can and will want to achieve.<\/p><p>On food production, the value of direct pollination of human food crops has been estimated to be more than &euro;50 million per year in Ireland alone, which shows how important a healthy biodiversity network is for the very food we eat.  For example, adopting diverse hedgerows and allowing them to bloom and fruit, and introducing wildflower margins with diverse species mixes, can support and hopefully increase our dwindling pollinator populations.  This requires active engagement with farmers on improving biodiversity-friendly practices, and every step on this road is a step in the right direction.<\/p><p>The all-Ireland pollinator plan aims to give much-needed assistance in this area for our pollinators.  Senator Byrne alluded to the necessity of having a more ambitious plan.  I would welcome that.  I acknowledge the comments of my colleague, Senator Martin.  He is an avid keeper of bees and is fully aware of the value that these workhorses of nature provide.<\/p><p>I was glad Senator Garvey spoke so eloquently about our soils.  As she said, healthy soils contain an abundance of biodiversity.  The value of nutrient cycling by soil organisms alone is estimated to be worth in the region of &euro;1 billion a year. <\/p><p>Peat soils comprise approximately 21% of our land area.  These areas are essential for carbon sequestration in our efforts to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  Under the climate action plan, we aim to re-wet 40,000 ha of drained organic grassland soils that will reduce emissions by 440,000 tonnes.  That is difficult to sell to farmers.  Again, we need engagement to do that correctly. <\/p><p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly also made reference to the Wild Western Peatlands project.  This is an important project, again supported by my Department.  It will see Coillte Nature restore and rehabilitate approximately 2,100 ha of Atlantic blanket bog, restoring rare habitats of international importance.  This involves re-wetting and restoring bogs as much as possible and establishing native woodlands on fringe areas, but only on suitable ground that could and should have trees planted on it.  <\/p><p>Comments were made on forestry.  I assure Senator Warfield that the next forestry strategy will factor in all the essential environmental and community concerns that have been absent in the past.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pippa Hackett:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=0000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Biodiversity at sea is often forgotten about.
