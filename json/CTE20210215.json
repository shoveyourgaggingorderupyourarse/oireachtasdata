There may at times be some technical difficulties, so I ask people to bear with us.<\/p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Senators Martin, McDowell and Black.  I welcome everyone to today's meeting.  We have no correspondence to note.  Are the draft minutes of our public meeting on 9 February, during which we engaged with officials from IBEC, agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. David McArdle, treasurer, and Mr. John Nolan, secretary, of the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA.  As we all aware Brexit has had serious implications for Ireland and the economy.  The agenda today involves a discussion on the impact of Brexit on trade connectivity and trade flows.  These are the men and women at the coalface who are keeping our supply chains open and our shelves stocked.  Seven weeks into the new Brexit trading environment, it will be great to hear from those who have to operate under these new changes.<\/p> <p>  We will hear also from Mr. Eamonn O'Reilly, chief executive of Dublin Port Company, Mr. Glenn Carr, general manager of Rosslare Europort, and Mr. Barry Kenny, corporate communications manager at Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>  In the first session of today's meeting, we will engage with the IRHA.  I welcome Mr. McArdle and Mr. Nolan.  I thank them on behalf of the committee for making themselves available.  It is important engagement for our committee's work.  We would like to know the implications of Brexit on their industry.<\/p> <p>  Before the witnesses make their opening statement, I remind them about parliamentary privilege.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts does and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given.  They should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name, or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the person or entity's good name.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not commit or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House campus.  In this regard, I ask all members, prior to making their initial contribution to the meeting, to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  That is an important warning for everybody.<\/p> <p>  Participants in the committee meeting from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protection afforded to those participating within the parliamentary precincts does not extend to them.  Therefore, if they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, they must respect that direction.<\/p> <p>  I ask members that if they are not contributing to please mute their devices.

Most exports have moved to direct route ferries due to the uncertainty of delivery times and travel through the UK.  The level of goods in Dublin Port is down to 30% of pre-Christmas volumes.  This is due to a mixture of stockpiling and the cumbersome nature of importing goods into Ireland.<\/p> <p>  There has been a loss of connectivity from the UK to Ireland through Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort due to the move by hauliers and customers to direct ferries.  Some ferry operators have removed services at weekends because of the direct ferries.  This week, one ferry company removed its full week's service from Rosslare to Pembroke or Fishguard.  Dublin Port is suffering a lack of space due to the agencies taking up a sizeable amount of land for their terminals.  The agencies being Revenue, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the HSE.  The port is lacking room for bulk cargo, car transporters and drop trailers.  The container depots have not opened for longer periods, as requested, to help alleviate traffic, nor have the main ferries moved their times to help facilitate the issues associated with customs.<\/p> <p>  The new systems for the pre-boarding notification, PBN, new requirements for safety and security declarations and import and export declarations are not working effectively.  It is clear that neither the Irish authorities nor industry took an opportunity to trial the new systems before they came into effect.  Consequently, the new systems have been overloaded and goods are being blocked and delayed.  Licensed hauliers, as carriers of the goods, have borne the brunt of these disruptions.<\/p> <p>  The IT systems being employed by the Irish authorities are not working and require substantial revision to ensure they can be effective at clearing the backlog of goods stuck in the system and preventing such problems occurring again.  The system is being challenged at a time when import and export levels are lower than normal due to pre-December stockpiling.  The systems will collapse entirely once trade volumes are restored.  It is deeply frustrating that despite the long lead into Brexit, the systems and approaches being operated by the Irish authorities to manage post-Brexit trade are not fit for purpose and are frustrating rather than facilitating trade.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of specific measures that could be introduced to address the current crisis.  These include: co-ordination between the different systems being operated by the Irish authorities.  There are alarming indications that the systems, ICT and otherwise, being operated by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are not working in tandem; new protocols and procedures should be applied at the Irish ports to work with and support those involved in the transport of goods.  At present there is very limited communication or information being provided and a distinct lack of engagement at all levels; review processes to address the imposition of unnecessary and repetitive checks on goods being imported to Ireland.  A risk-based approach to inspections is needed to prevent unnecessary blockages to the trade in goods.  There is a distinct lack of oversight of the operations of the different Irish authorities in the ports with no central entity or office assessing how each of the Irish agencies are responding to Brexit.  Consequently, the current problems being experienced are not being diagnosed and addressed.  Given the lack of preparedness of the Irish authorities for Brexit, some form of adjustment period will be required to allow them to get their systems and processes working effectively.<\/p> <p>  Licensed hauliers have to meet a plethora of new protocols and requirements to keep goods moving, including securing some or all of the following: a master reference number, MRN; a pre-boarding notification, PBN; an entry summary declaration number, ENS, for safety and security; a transit accompanying document, TAD; an export safety and security declaration, EXS; customs checks, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine checks; and HSE checks.<\/p><p>That concludes my opening statement.

I will address a number of those reasons with him very briefly.<\/p> <p>  From other meetings I have attended, we have been led to believe that the Revenue documentation situation was going to improve and would soon be all right.  I say that because Mr. McArdle's evidence would not support that.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the lack of space issue, leaving cargo, parking material and bringing material into the port.  Space is being taken up by agencies such as Revenue and the HSE.  Can Mr. McArdle suggest a solution to this?  Do they have too much space?  Is there more space available?<\/p> <p>  Is there is any basis for me being told in another forum that the Revenue Commissioners were getting on top of things and that the delays would even out shortly?  Similarly, are the delays with the HSE likely to be sorted out?  Mr. McArdle mentioned various bureaucracies involved and documentation one must have.  Does it seem logical to him that some documents required could be done without while still fulfilling minimum terms?

Each department has an IT system but the systems are not talking to each other.  As such, agents or hauliers have to put the relevant information onto different systems.  That is a significant frustration.

In light of current technology, this needs to be looked at.  There should be a change to the requirement for this valuable paperwork to be carried around in an envelope and transferred from trailer to driver and back to the trailer.  The way the business operates out of the UK into Ireland for goods is on the basis of a 24-hour service and 80% of this runs on an unaccompanied basis.  As such, the trailer is brought by truck to be loaded onto the ship.  The truck stays in the UK, while the trailer is shipped to Ireland and then collected by another truck.  This system is used as a result of time and cost factors.  However, trailers containing agricultural goods now have to be sealed but there is nowhere to put the papers except inside the trailer.  If one goes for a seal check, the inspector will want the paperwork and one has to break the seal in order to get it.  That is a problem.  The original certificates for agricultural produce is another issue.  In this age of technology, the certificates should be separately emailed, such as to a driver's phone, so that those working in the sector do not have to go around carrying certified sheets of paper.  If one of the certificates is lost, the truck will be delayed for weeks at the port.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021021500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McArdle"},{"type":"speech","time":1613347200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their comprehensive replies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021021500002#E00400","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1613347200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McArdle and Mr. Nolan for their statement and for taking the time to inform the committee of where matters stand from their perspective.

However, based on what Mr. McArdle and Mr. Nolan have told the committee, there seem to be many problems at our end too, such as IT systems not working properly, which is very disappointing at this stage, and cumbersome paperwork having to be filled in.

UK customers are not up to speed on getting their paperwork to Ireland for importing into the country after Brexit.  We are going to have a lot of issues, come 1 July, with exporting to the UK.  It is going well at the moment, considering the amount of goods that are moving, although that amount is still well down.  The UK system has yet to come online, as such, so it is not doing a whole lot about imports at the moment.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked about our meetings with Revenue.

That is why customs in the UK is not an issue at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I had an experience last week of a problem in the UK.  Goods have been sitting in warehouses in the UK since January because people there are not up to speed on how to fill out the paperwork for UK export declarations and, thereafter, Irish import declarations.  Last week, I encountered a customer who has had electrical goods in a warehouse since January.  He was told that the goods were coming but someone else told him, on the side, that the goods were stuck in a warehouse because the people in the company at the UK end did not know how to fill out UK export declarations.  We took the goods and got them in.  This is why the volume of traffic from the UK is about 50% of what it should be.  We are seeing it get better every week but it is a slow process because people are being educated slowly on how to get the paperwork ready.

Have there been any meetings with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  They also mentioned the HSE.  Is there any benefit in meeting those organisations to reduce the volume of paperwork?  Is there any advantage in doing that?

It goes back to the old customs code as it relates to sanitary and phytosanitary checks on goods.  The rules are the rules and it does not seem that they will be changed or made more flexible.  We have asked if they could be made easier for what we call regular goods.  We were told this would be looked at but I am not sure if anything will come out of it.  A regular load of a given product will have to go through the process each time because the rules are the rules, so it is going to be difficult.  With regard to any goods requiring sanitary or phytosanitary checks, there will be a minimum delay of four hours.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McArdle made the point earlier that one has to give 24 hours' notice.  The problem with this is that within 15 hours, the load is physically in Rosslare or Dublin because of the distance between the UK and Ireland.  We will engage to try to get flexibility on that point, but the officials seem to be sticking to the requirement for 24 hours' notice.  If they could work with less than 24 hours' notice, it would be easier for us in some respects because of the original veterinary certificates which have to travel with the load.  It is a small thing but it is important for us.<\/p> <p>  Revenue has rules.  We are asking that they be modified for the benefit of everyone else.  The rules have not changed yet, if the Senator understands me.  That is all I can say.  The weekly failures of the automated import system, AIS, since Brexit have not helped.  There are always outages during the week with the effect that declarations cannot be completed, which means that imports and exports cannot happen.  The system is failing us from an Ireland Inc. perspective.  The system has been modified.  There was a big modification yesterday.

There is no daily updated record.  It is a controversial issue for the agents because when the money goes out, they do not know where it is going.

The committee will have a conversation on that.  Part of our work is to give a platform to sectors that are impacted by Brexit, and obviously the road haulage sector is one of those most impacted.  When we make our final report we also want to be able to put into the report some key recommendations to send to the relevant Minister and up the line to Government.  All of the committee members have contributed at this point.  I have a question from Senator Black that I have been asked to put to Mr. McArdle and Mr. Nolan as the Senator was unable to attend the meeting today.  She says that while there is a simplified transit procedure in place that will limit the checks needed if exporting through the land bridge to the UK and the EU, we heard last week that adjusting to the regime has deterred people from using it.  Although transit time has not increased there is still a lower volume of trade done through the land bridge.  The Senator would like to know why that is  She points out that the land bridge still remains a strategically important route for agrifood, seafood and other sectors trading in time-sensitive produce.<\/p> <p>  I also have a couple of questions on the land bridge as we come to the conclusion of our session.  We are aware that there are certain products with a short shelf life and the time of transit is very important.  How has fresh produce in particular been impacted by the new regime under which hauliers now have to operate?  Have the import and export times increased dramatically?  Is this having an impact on the shelf life of goods coming into Ireland?<\/p> <p>  In the next session the committee will engage with Rosslare Europort and the Dublin Port Company.  We have listened carefully to the issues raised by Mr. McArdle and Mr. Nolan, especially around the space at Dublin Port and the fact that the agencies are spread across a number of different buildings.  What are the hauliers' specific asks of the two port companies with regard to making life a little bit easier?  We are all conscious that we are only seven weeks into this entirely new trading environment and that there was always going to be a bedding-in period or some teething problems.  Are there things that the haulage sector can see now that need to be addressed and which are not simply just teething problems?<\/p> <p>  Are there specific requests that Mr. Nolan and Mr. McArdle want the committee to include in its report, which we will send up to Government, on what we need to do to assist the sector in coping with these changes?  Senator Garvey, for example, has made a recommendation that we hear from Revenue, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the HSE on how they might streamline their process.  I am hearing loud and clear the issues raised by Mr. McArdle and Mr. Nolan on the level of paperwork required.  It seems absolutely ridiculous that a haulier would have to break the seal on his or her truck to get paperwork from it.  It seems that this type of system is not really fit for purpose.

There was some interruption during that contribution.  On the importance of the land bridge, only for DFDS coming in with three ships on 1 January there would have been a lot of issues for hauliers going to Europe.  Contrary to an Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, report that said there was 40% capacity, there was no capacity on the direct routes.  DFDS provided three ships, which gave us six extra sailings a week.  Stena Line put in another ship and a daily service out of Rosslare.  Irish Ferries, which did the least of all, transferred one ship for one sailing per week off the Holyhead route and onto the Cherbourg route at weekends.<\/p> <p>  On the lack of transport going on the UK land bridge, the issue still comes back to paperwork and the need for the paperwork to create the transit document.<\/p><p>Customers are probably doing much more in trying to keep their UK business going rather than having to worry about their European business, so they have concentrated on sorting out their UK business.<\/p><p> The direct ferry is good competition for the land bridge.  It is more expensive but it is keeping to the same timelines as it.  Paperwork is probably the biggest issue for the land bridge due to what is happening and changing in the UK.  There are still delays in Dover and Calais.  It is not plain sailing, much as people might like to say it is.  The queues are always there and have not gone away.  The Eurotunnel has reduced its volume of trains per hour.  It used to run six trains per hour and that is now down to four.  I also understand that P&amp;O Ferries in Dover has reduced its ships by one, so there are fewer sailings from Dover as well.

It is the second busiest roll-on, roll-off, RoRo, passenger port in the country and the foremost RoRo port in the country for direct services to Europe.  It has been a truly transformative number of weeks as, together with our shipping operators, we have brought new and expanded direct services between Rosslare Europort and the Continent of Europe.  Direct sailings to Europe have increased from three to 16 each way per week, offering 32 services between Rosslare and Europe.  These services have played a vital role, ensuring continuity of the country&rsquo;s supply chain, which has been facing the twin challenges of Brexit and Covid-19.  Our current shipping operators are Irish Ferries, which provides a twice daily service from Rosslare to Pembroke; Stena Line, which provides a twice daily service - temporarily reduced - from Rosslare to Fishguard and six sailings per week to Cherbourg, France - up from three at the start of the year; Brittany Ferries, which provides a twice weekly service from Rosslare to Bilbao, Spain, with a third service to Cherbourg and, most recently, the introduction of a new weekly service to St Malo-Roscoff; DFDS, a new, six-times per week direct service from Rosslare Europort to Dunkirk, France, which commenced on 2 January 2021; and Neptune Lines, which provides a trade car carrier service from Zeebrugge to Rosslare, on average every four to six weeks.<\/p> <p>  Increasing connectivity and frequency of shipping services, along with developing Rosslare Europort as the offshore wind hub for Ireland are the key objectives in growing the port and maximising its potential for the benefit of the region and the country.  Our figures for January 2021 clearly show the demand that these new services have attracted, with the key highlights of January 2021 versus January 2020 as follows: Rosslare Europort, now Ireland&rsquo;s number one port for direct RoRo services to Europe, with ship visits up 37%; combined freight traffic, UK and Europe, up 43%; and continental freight up 47% and UK freight down 49%.  The expansion of these services to mainland Europe has been essential to protect the supply lines of our exporters and importers to avoid the disruptions that the UK land bridge has brought post Brexit and to support the new supply chains created directly with Europe.  We are confident that these direct services will be maintained and we are in ongoing discussions and reviews to accommodate potential additional frequency and capacity to Europe such is the ongoing demand for these services.  <\/p> <p>  Despite the very positive increase in direct services and freight volumes to Europe from Rosslare, trade with the UK and our passenger business continues to be severely affected by both Covid and Brexit and will have a very negative impact on our balance sheet.  Our UK freight traffic is down 49% and passenger traffic is restricted to essential purposes only.  It will be important that both of these issues are resolved to a level to ensure sustainability in the longer term of services to both the UK and Europe. <\/p> <p>  While pre-Brexit planning at Rosslare by all stakeholders was put in place to ensure the smooth transition on our services with the UK, the reality of the reduction of trade volumes to the UK is clear and it will take a number of months to fully understand what levels are likely to return directly from the UK and the use of the land bridge as a route to and from Europe.  It should be noted that further significant disruption is expected from July, when the UK intends to implement their customs procedures and checks.  <\/p> <p>  Extensive planning and works have gone into the port and there was significant investment in infrastructure and resources by all of the Government agencies and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann as the port authority, so that Rosslare was well prepared for Brexit.  I thank the Ministers, Secretaries General and their teams in the Departments of Transport, Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Health, the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of Public Works for their enormous support and guidance in our preparation. <\/p> <p>  The temporary border inspection post, BIP, is fully completed and operational and all State agencies are amalgamated on one site.  Rosslare Europort is in a unique position in that the BIP is located approximately 1 km from the berths and ensures that freight and passenger traffic moves freely to and from the ships and onto their onward journey.

I will begin by looking at Dublin Port and what happened post Brexit.  Dublin Port is, as committee members will be aware, the biggest port in the country.  The particular types of trade that are of concern because of Brexit are roll-on, roll-off and lift-on, lift-off or trailer and container trade.  About 1.5 million units of trade move through Dublin port in a year, which is about 84% of all units moving through all Irish ports annually.  In the context of Brexit, we saw an enormous amount of stockpiling in the last months of 2020.  Coming into January we saw volumes through the port as a whole decline by about 24%, which was an enormous fall in one month.  If one includes the increase that we saw in December however, which was around 22%, then the overall decline in volumes over the two months was approximately 4%.<br\/><br\/>To pick up on some of the remarks made by Mr. Carr about the impact of Brexit on GB trade, the story in Dublin was very much the same as that in Rosslare <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the ports in south Wales.  Mr. Carr mentioned that trade was down by approximately 49% in Rosslare and it was down by about 45% in Dublin.  On the other hand, the volume of trade between Dublin Port and ports in continental Europe, including Bruges, Rotterdam and Cherbourg, was up by 14% in the month.  On the operational side, we did not know what to expect from Brexit but were very surprised by the scale of the decline in volumes.  We thought there would be a decline at some level but we were not expecting it to be so large.  At the same time, we had not expected to see such a large increase in volumes in December.<br\/><br\/>As we look ahead, the concerns that we have are identical to the concerns at Rosslare.  What we have seen in Dublin Port is the impact of EU border controls being introduced and we are very conscious that UK import controls will be introduced in British ports in stages, on 1 April and subsequently on 1 July.  That will potentially have an impact on Irish exports, depending on the level of preparedness and the stringency of the checks that the British authorities carry out.  Overall, we are looking at a period of enormous dynamism.  It is a transient period and it is going to take four to six months to reach some sort of steady state, by which time we will have an understanding of the impact of Brexit on the flow of goods through Dublin Port.<br\/><br\/>As I speak, goods are moving through the port.  Obviously, there are individual instances where there have been difficulties with State agencies, including Revenue and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in respect of particular consignments but from where I am sitting, I see that all of the preparations that were made and all of the facilities that were put in place are operating efficiently and effectively to allow the reduced volume of trade to pass through Dublin Port.<br\/><br\/>I note that the European Commission in its winter economic outlook talked about Brexit having five times more impact on the UK economy than the European economy.  However, I suspect that the impact of Brexit on the European economy is going to be largely felt in Ireland.  There are definite worries there for the future because we cannot meaningfully predict the impact at this stage.  All I can do is reassure the committee that a huge amount of preparatory work has been done at Dublin Port in the context of Brexit.  All of the infrastructure needed for the border controls is in place and is operating effectively.  We have seen significant dynamism in terms of shipping lines changing ships from one route to another in response to market requirements.  I cannot be either optimistic or pessimistic about the future because it is so unknowable at the moment.<br\/><br\/>I will leave it at that.  I hope my opening comments have been of some benefit and I would be delighted to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021021500002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1613347200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Reilly and call Senator Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021021500002#Q00100","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1613347200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carr, Mr. Kenny and Mr. O'Reilly for their presentations.

He might go on to talk about rail links to Rosslare Europort and whether there are new opportunities in freight.  I am talking about Dublin, Rosslare and the old Rosslare-Waterford route.

As he will know, it has been my view for a long time that the port was under-utilised, and in a very short period, it has become demand driven.  Mr. Carr has certainly helped in the transformation of the port but we want it to continue to grow.  What are his asks of us, in preparing our report, for the port's overall development?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Carr spoke about the potential development of Rosslare Europort as an offshore hub for renewable energies, something I would strongly support and like to happen.  In the context of a review of the national development plan, what would he like us to suggest in that regard?<\/p> <p>  Most of our focus, as a result of what has happened with Brexit, has naturally been on freight, but with the introduction of quite a number of more direct routes to continental Europe, there is the potential for increased tourism.  Mr. O'Reilly and Mr. Carr might each like to talk about the potential for tourism, when we get over this Covid period, arising from the increased number of links to continental Europe.

The DART+ programme is being developed and an element of that will examine how can we increase the capacity and service levels on the Dublin-Rosslare line.  In the NDP too, which was referenced, there are critical aspects on coastal protection, which we are advancing as well with the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Carr might like to add detail on the following, in his role as general manager of the port.  Currently, Rosslare Europort is a ro-ro port, and the master plan for development is built around the role of business and requirements there.  We are in the process of reviewing our overall national rail freight strategy.  We have been liaising on that with stakeholders and the Department of Transport and we anticipate formalising it in the short term.  As well as that, the Minister for Transport has indicated an all-island rail strategy is to be developed and it will look at freight and other aspects outside the Rosslare area, such as Shannon Foynes and other aspects around the network.  There will also be a cross-Border element.  As these programmes are rolled out and the review of our rail freight strategy are conducted during the year, there will be greater clarity about the types of opportunities.  As members will be aware, there are ambitions in the local authority to develop a greenway on the old Waterford-Rosslare line, but as it stands, the committed developments relate to passenger service and the master plan for Rosslare Europort, about which Mr. Carr can speak in greater detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021021500002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Kenny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613347200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>My apologies for the earlier technical sound problem.  I have a dual role - one is general manager of Rosslare Europort and the other is in respect of rail freight.  As Mr. Kenny said, we are putting together a national rail freight strategy.  We strongly believe there is a very positive role for rail freight to play.  There is work to be done to ensure that we identify the commercial opportunities where rail freight would be viable.  The current service going into Dublin Port from Ballina is a good example of that.  However, it is about how one can replicate opportunities like that around the network and around the country, wherever they would be best served.  We should not forget Waterford Port in the south east, which is a rail connected port.  In order to make rail freight really work, it is important it is connected into ports.  I know the initial master plan for Rosslare Europort is very focused on the development of roll-on roll-off because that is where the greatest opportunity for the port lies.  That has been demonstrated over the last number of weeks.<\/p> <p>  There is a real opportunity with offshore wind.  At the moment, no port in the country has the right amount of infrastructure for exactly what this industry requires.  We conducted extensive research on this over the last 12 to 18 months, which recognised the opportunity.  We strongly believe that Rosslare Europort is best positioned to service that industry, particularly since the development of offshore wind banks will extend from County Louth right around to County Cork.  Rosslare Europort has potential, obviously with the right investment.  The port can be deepened, land can be reclaimed quite easily and a multi-purpose hub can be provided for offshore wind which can connect with the available land beside the port.  This land can also be developed for associated industry and educational development in respect of the offshore wind sector.<\/p> <p>  This would not only be a significant change for Rosslare Europort but a significant change for the south east given the jobs and opportunities that it would bring.  We should not forget that if we do not capture the construction and installation stages of offshore wind, a big opportunity will be lost in terms of the economics that go along with those projects.  We have put forward a very good proposition.  It requires investment to the tune of &euro;200 million.  However, we believe that &euro;200 million is much better served in a location like Rosslare Europort than possibly anywhere else in the country.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about other things that are needed.  We certainly need the motorway and the link road to be completed.  They are absolutely essential.  I would not underestimate the difference that 20 minutes off a journey can make.  The committee heard from the IRHA earlier and I am sure it told members that time and money are critical factors in that industry and in keeping our supply chains going.  The growth we have seen in Rosslare Europort has highlighted the importance of the part that it can play for the country.  We have taken a little business away from Mr. O'Reilly but that can be well-catered for as regards alleviating some of the pressures on Dublin Port.  It is very important that Rosslare Europort is developed as it can alleviate some of the pressure points that occur, particularly in a capital city and on a motorway and in helping to keep Dublin Port operating.  A 10% shift out of Dublin Port might not hit Mr. O'Reilly's balance sheet too heavily but it does absolute wonders for the balance sheet in Rosslare Europort because of its scale.  We are seeing an additional 70,000 to 80,000 units come to us.  That is all good for the country in keeping the supply chain going.<\/p> <p>  We should not forget the pre-Covid congestion on the M50 and the impact that was having on our supply chain and on industry.  That congestion will come back.  As regards the NDP, we certainly need a motorway and the connectivity to the ports completed.  We need offshore wind for other reasons because that facility and investment brings other opportunities for Rosslare Europort.  It would be hard to justify other areas of activity for the port unless the infrastructure is in place.<\/p><p>What one needs is a big project to justify the investment in that infrastructure.  Offshore brings that potential, particularly because of the length of the projects and the activity.  These projects go on for 20 years or more.  Therefore, the investment and infrastructure involved is over a much longer scale whereas if one concentrates on roll-on roll-off, for instance, one's guarantee of supply of that business is subject to the shipping lines and the market.  However, we know offshore is coming, action in respect of climate is urgently needed and that this will be dealt with.  It is important we build the infrastructure at a port to support that industry.<br\/><br\/>I agree fully there are great opportunities for tourism once Covid-19 is over.  For the first time in a long time, the shipping industry is in a unique position to offer a different experience for the traveller.  We are all used to going on airplanes so maybe people will have second thoughts about that.  It was great to see the <i>Stena Estrid<\/i>, the latest ship by Stena Line, in Rosslare.  It is at the top end in terms of the customer's on board experience.  That type of product - in fairness, Irish Ferries has the <i>W.B. Yeats -<\/i>can offer a really good experience for the customers when they come on board.  The shipping industry will actively seek to work with tourism bodies, ports, etc., to encourage people to use them.<br\/><br\/>We have seen some interesting things with the new service to Dunkirk.  Recently, we had contact from the European motor home society which has nearly 1 million members across Europe.  It was delighted with these new services and connections but more so with the frequency of those services, which has been critical in the success on the freight.  Having six services a week out of Dunkirk will also give real choice to tourists.  We will work closely with the tourism industry in Wexford, the relevant chambers and the wider tourism sector in Ireland and the corresponding bodies in France and elsewhere in Europe to develop these links because this is a good opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021021500002#R00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Glenn Carr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613347200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I welcome and thank the witnesses for taking time out to make their presentations.

We were very active in the lead up to Brexit in trying to make sure there was enough infrastructure in place.  We liaised with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We ran seminars a long time ago for hauliers, IBEC and so forth.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the difficulties hauliers have had, there was a significant amount unpreparedness among cargo owners, those who owned the goods and had to get them moved by hauliers on ships through ports.  I have seen it in the spaces on shelves in one or two of the larger UK retailers in Ireland, food and otherwise.  There was a significant lack of preparedness.  I saw a manifest for a trailer from an internationally known work vehicle company.  It was an enormously complex manifest of items which had been presented to a customs agent with three hours notice.<\/p><p> It was anticipated all of this would be cleared for the sum of &euro;25 with three hours before the trailer was supposed to board the ship.  This practical example showed a very sophisticated operation, which is very large financially and is internationally known, was entirely unprepared for the realities of the non-tariff barriers that Brexit reintroduced and for tariff barriers that have arisen because of the origin of trade rules.<\/p><p> In terms of what we can do to facilitate the flow of goods through the port and prevent delays for hauliers, much of what is left to do, which is within our power, has been done already.   This has been done through the provision of infrastructure and upgrading of the port road network.  It depends now on industry, in particular the cargo owners.  When operating border controls which we have had many years' notice of, it falls to them to make sure all of the provisions of European law on sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, customs and so forth, are complied with through the Revenue and through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021021500002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613347200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Carr or Mr. Kenny like to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021021500002#T00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613347200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I can sympathise with the hauliers because one of my businesses is a company called Navigator.  We bring in car parts from the UK and it is very challenging for us at the moment.  What Mr. O'Reilly said is correct.  There was a complete lack of preparation by household names in the UK for the reality of what the new post-Brexit world would look like.  However, this is it now.<\/p> <p>  One of the benefits Rosslare has seen is the shift in the supply chain going directly to Europe.  I believe much of that will remain and be maintained but we should not underestimate the amount of trade we had, and I have no doubt will get back, with the UK.  It is going to take time for companies to adjust.  There are no quick technical solutions to this.  In implementing this, we are using the sophistication level of nearly 30 years ago in trying to clear declarations.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of what can be done now, we said we have worked well with State agencies around design and how traffic can flow through the port.  I do not think that is an issue at the moment because stuff is moving through the ports quickly, but volume is right down.  If something is not ready then it is not leaving the UK port.  If it arrives in Ireland it goes through the current process and often one small error in the whole declaration can hold it up.  Before Christmas, everyone was talking about the congestion at ports.  We have not seen that, particularly with UK traffic.  We have had a bit of congestion ourselves but that involved direct services going out and the unprecedented demand for those services.  I think some of the supply chains will shift completely out of the UK.  Ireland has always been associated with central distribution out of the UK.  We have almost been part of the UK in that regard but now we are part of Europe.  That is where the difficulties are because we are trading so much with a third country which is badly prepared for what is involved.<\/p> <p>  We should not underestimate what will come in July because we will go through all of this again on the UK side.  This is provided it does not seek an extension to that.  It is going to be difficult and it will take a while to train people in customs clearance.  We did not have many people ready to step into that industry.  There is a skill there that needs to be built up.  An invoice I received a few weeks ago had 1,800 different commodity codes for one trailer.  It took nearly ten hours to clear and that involved using people who were experienced in that area.  This was a world that used to have a just-in-time system, where someone in a garage in Dublin could wait until 3 o'clock to order a piece of equipment and it would be delivered from the UK before 10 o'clock the next morning.<\/p><p>It is not physically possible to do any of that at the moment.  Therefore, there are elements of the supply chain, of that next day just-in-time, that will be altered so it may become a 24 or 48 hour service or stock may need to be held in Ireland.  The good new is that from the European side, the issue has always been frequency and availability of services.  As I said, we now have 32 services going to Europe every week and we hope that will grow.  I know Mr. O'Reilly has seen increases in Dublin's services as well.  Over the next few months a balance will need to be achieved and I have no doubt that it will be.  We work with the hauliers as best we can but there are some fundamental things that are part of the new world, which people will have to get used to and work through.  Hopefully, in time, technology will lend a hand as we understand the full requirements before we install systems that may not meet the requirements and, therefore, cause more difficulty at some point in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021021500002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Glenn Carr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613347200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carr, Mr. Kenny and Mr. O'Reilly for their presentations today.

We are developing Dublin Port in accordance with a master plan extending out to 2040.  It is very important to understand that with this master plan we are moving Dublin Port to its ultimate and final capacity in just 20 years from now, and that is at best.  If things go against us then it is possible the port could reach ultimate capacity within only ten years.  This is a really important point to emphasise.<\/p> <p>  The scale of Dublin Port is such that the investment we have had to make, and will continue to make, is enormous.  For example, in the 25 years since the Dublin Port Company was created as an entity, from 1996 to 2020, the company invested &euro;722 million in infrastructure in Dublin Port.  Over the next five years, we plan to invest &euro;400 million, with about &euro;80 million of that in this year alone.  In the five years between 2026 to 2030, &euro;470 million will be invested.  All of the investments we are making over the next five, ten and 15 years are very large amounts.  We self-finance and raise money ourselves.  The money does not come from the Exchequer.  All of these investments in Dublin Port are to bring it to its ultimate and final capacity.<\/p> <p>  A corollary to this, and it is an important point, is that import does not compete with Rosslare Port.  I cannot go to the market and encourage shipping lines to come to Dublin that want to go to Rosslare.  Likewise, Mr. Carr is not in a position to compete for trade from Dublin.  The demand for port infrastructure is a derived demand from what shipping lines want.  That, in turn, is a derived amount based on what the customers of ferry lines want and what the hauliers want.  For example, the same shipping lines are going through Rosslare Europort as are going through Dublin Port, servicing the GB ports.  The ports do not compete with each other.  They are part of the national transport system and in that respect it is very much in Dublin Port's interest to see significant investment and development in Rosslare Europort and to see the investment in roads, which Mr. Carr spoke about, being made.<\/p><p>The more demand there is for ships to call at Rosslare, the less pressure there is on Dublin Port and the later it is that we will ultimately reach our maximum capacity.

For instance, they have not yet put their border inspection posts in place.  There is the question of whether there is a need to put two of them into two ports or should they be concentrated in one port.

There are four out of Rosslare but just two out of Fishguard and two out of Pembroke.  They are not ideally aligned timewise either.  I would much rather see a port being developed over there with the right infrastructure and the right road network infrastructure upgrade and with a regular schedule of every six hours or so.  This would give the haulier a good choice.  If one does not have that choice one will simply go up to Holyhead, Liverpool etc.; such hauliers will not come across.<\/p> <p>  Again, pre-Christmas and pre-Covid, we had a lot of congestion issues at Holyhead.  There are, therefore, some fundamental choices that those ports and the relevant government agencies over there must make.  We will certainly work with them but the complexities that will come in in July will be seen more on the UK side than in a port over here.  We have our systems in place now.  As we have our border inspection posts in place now, it will not be seen here.  Again, what we probably will see is an effect on volume coming through.  That is not good in the long term, particularly for the sustainability of the shipping services.  If they do not have a sustainable level of freight all year round, the shipping line must divert that vessel somewhere else.  I am conscious that while we have great success on our European routes, we must equally try to balance and keep our UK connectivity because a reduction there is not the way we want to go.  We need to improve and increase frequency in order to attract a market on that and there must be a sustainable volume.  We must not forgot that there must be passengers as well, when that comes back post Covid.  We are working with them but in terms of customs and stuff like that, that is going to be an issue for the UK to implement post Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021021500002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Glenn Carr"},{"type":"speech","time":1613347200,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Reilly and Mr. Carr.  I have few questions myself.  My first is to Mr. O'Reilly.  I have visited Dublin Port a couple of times with him and some colleagues.  I found the entire set-up very impressive.  The view from the port company's building is something to behold and I am sure it is a nice place to be working in.  I saw at first hand the level of investment the company has been making over the years, and that it intends to make.  I am aware of the company's long-term plan and it is good to have that forewarning about reaching the ultimate capacity in the next ten to 20 years, depending on how things move.<\/p> <p>  One of the concerns raised at our first session today with the representatives of the haulage industry was specifically on the location of agriculture, Revenue and HSE facilities at the port.  They are in different terminals and this seems to be proving tricky for some of the hauliers in that they may sent to different terminals in order to get paperwork completed.  Is there anything that can be done from our side to assist with that?  Is that a problem to which we can find a solution?  I fully appreciate that the company is constrained and it cannot just build wherever it wants.  What can we do to try to streamline that?<\/p><p>For the representatives of both ports, one of the issues raised by the haulage industry was the fact that in the context of original certificates, physical paperwork is required for some of the checks.  The representatives of the haulage industry called for that paperwork to be digitised.  They stated that a physical piece of paper should not be required in this day and age.  Is that a reasonable suggestion?  How do we make that happen?  How realistic is it that we would get that issue resolved in the near future?  Basically, what would it take to digitise all of the paperwork that is currently required in actual paper format?<br\/><br\/>The representatives of the haulage industry also referred to 1 July.  They mentioned that some additional checks will come into play in April but the full range of customs requirements will come into effect on 1 July in the UK.  Mr. Carr has painted an element of the picture.  He stated that we will not see much of it here but it will impact on volumes.  From the perspective of both ports, what can we expect here when that full range of customs requirements hits home, particularly in light of the fact that there has been some stockpiling and the level of imports is down on what one would expect at this time of year?  Do Mr. Carr and Mr. O'Reilly anticipate stockpiling in advance of that date, while customs checks are not as stringent as they will be?  Will that ease the pressure such that we can adjust to those new arrangements over a longer period post 1 July?<br\/><br\/>On the idea of certainty of delivery, it is obvious that with direct access to Europe one has greater certainty in terms of getting one's goods fruch as fresh seafood, for example.  I am talking about the impact of the land bridge and the fact that certainty of delivery is probably more guaranteed with direct access to Euom location A to location B and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Is the land bridge viewed as a bit too uncertain in terms of delivery time?  One of the things we discussed in the run-up to Brexit was the fact that it took almost twice as long for goods transported via direct access to mainland Europe to get there and that the land bridge was much quicker.  This is particularly important for perishable goods srope but we were always told the land bridge is extremely important for perishable goods.  Where are we at in that regard?  Where is that trade-off?  Do the witnesses still consider that the land bridge will always be required?  How is it coping?  Are they having much engagement with their counterparts in the UK?  In the run-up to Brexit, the feeling was that those in the UK were not as prepared as we were.  I think that has been shown to be true.  Are the witnesses having much engagement with their UK counterparts in terms of any blockages there right now and, in particular, in advance of 1 July?  How are they getting ready for that date to ensure we do not see major impacts on our supply chains? <br\/><br\/>Those questions are for either Mr. Carr or Mr. O'Reilly.I will go to Mr. O'Reilly first and then to Mr. Carr.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021021500002#V00400","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1613347200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I will work through the questions in reverse order.  On the issue of the land bridge, we are starting to see signs of hauliers again promoting usage of the land bridge for reasons of cost, speed and shortness of transit time.  If the land bridge re-establishes itself, it will again become the preferred means for hauliers to move between Ireland and continental Europe.  That is down to cost, time and the frequency of sailings out of Ireland.  There are signs that it might be starting to re-establish itself but, as with so many issues relating to Brexit, we just do not know whether it is going to prove reliable.  It will take several months for that to prove itself.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the introduction of border checks in Britain in July and the effect they will have, I do not anticipate that the checks will have any impact on the operations of Dublin Port.  That is not to say that they will not be very significant checks for exporters.  Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort are going to be able to handle all of the exports that are coming out of Ireland but, unfortunately, from the point of view of Ireland Inc., those lines of trades are going to flow and that is entirely outside of our control.  It is down to the British authorities and the nature and extent of the checks they choose to introduce.  Britain is in a unique position having left the EU.  It is entirely autonomous.  It can make its mind up in whatever way it wishes in terms of what border controls it decides to put in place for exports from Ireland or elsewhere in the EU into Britain.<\/p><p>We simply do not know today what those checks are going to be.<\/p><p> I absolutely agree with the hauliers' comments at the committee's earlier session about the checks happening at different locations around Dublin Port.  It is completely suboptimal to have all of these different types of checks in different locations but, unfortunately, any is all that was possible given how tight the land area is in Dublin Port.<\/p><p> The direct question was asked on whether there was anything the committee could do to help.  The Dublin Port Company would aspire to opening a dialogue about entirely moving, within the next five to ten years, all of the boarding and reception facilities out of Dublin Port to a remote location at the other end of the Dublin Port Tunnel.  This would be in a similar fashion to what has happened in Rosslare where a haulier leaves the port and goes 1 km out.  Mr. Carr referred to those facilities as temporary facilities.  If that could be achieved, it would free up about 14 ha in Dublin Port.  This 14 ha would be about one third the size of Rosslare Port and may give the committee a sense of the scale of land lost due to Brexit.<\/p><p> On the digitisation and physical paperwork, there absolutely is a need for the introduction of overarching systems architecture, which embraces everything that the shipping lines, the hauliers and customs are doing.  One would see this in the major ports in Europe, and especially the big container ports with enormous ships coming from the Far East where many people have an interest in the cargo on board.  This includes the cargo handlers, the hauliers, the revenue agencies, and others.  There is a need now, following the British departure from the European Union, for those sorts of systems to start to be developed.  We are starting work on that ourselves.  This will take a number of years.  It is not a quick solution.  It might be that customs will be in a position to provide significant digital functionality, which I believe may be there already, which hauliers and cargo companies can access.  On top of that there is a need for very sophisticated systems to be in place to help manage efficiently the flow of goods and information through the ports.<\/p><p> I believe I have picked up on all of the Chairman's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021021500002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613347200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Yes, I thank Mr. O'Reilly.

Again, working back from a customers' perspective in designing these processes, it is really important.  The person goes into one area in Rosslare and the agencies come to the person as against the person having to go to multiple sites as happens in Dublin, which the haulage industry tells us can give rise to possible consequences apart from the annoyance of moving from one location to another, such as issues emerging with tachographs or a point in time.<\/p> <p>  Our border inspection post is outside of the port but is under a derogation and it will come inside the port.  We have provided for this in our master plan for a future design of the port.  I understand that it is an EU requirement that the post would be inside a port security boundary for security reasons.  The temporary post works very well and we believe the permanent post will work equally well, if not better, now that we have had a bit of time to address any issues that have been identified in the first design.<\/p> <p>  With regard to digitisation, I absolutely agree.  The port is embarking on a digitisation programme with automation where possible.  Equally, that needs to apply in the customs area.  We are going from 1.6 million declarations to 20 million declarations a year and we must have the facilities and digital solutions for this to make life easier for everybody.  There are a lot of players in this, from the driver in the cab to the central distribution depot or the manufacturer and others in the supply chain.  It requires integration with all the elements of the supply chain to make sure the information is following in real live time to the end destination.<\/p> <p>  On the land bridge question, it is very difficult to know.  I believe there will be a need to look at the land bridge and its true time and cost.<\/p><p>For example, if I am going to go through the UK, it is the amount of back-office time, the actual time it takes for checks, the time it take to conduct physical checks at the different ports, the permits that are required and integration with all of the different systems.  One can easily search Google and be told it will take 14 hours but that is not the reality, which is what we need to recognise.  It takes 18 hours to sail from Rosslare to Cherbourg, one will be in Dunkirk within 23.5 hours and now we are seeing greater activity benefits, particularly with hauliers going to Dunkirk because one is 16 km from the Belgium border and one's driver has a completely free tachograph.  We are starting to also see that some of the Irish hauliers are forging links, relationships and partnerships in Europe.  This is not uncommon with a lot of the traffic that went through originally, particularly unaccompanied traffic where a trailer is dropped to the port, we put it on the ship, the ship brings it to the corresponding port and a partner haulier company picks up the trailer at the other end to drive it to its final destination.  We are seeing that a lot of the traffic at the moment is accompanied, which is a real indicator that a lot of it is the land bridge traffic.  Some of that is already moving to unaccompanied.  Again, it will be interesting over the next while to really look at the true land bridge time and costs versus direct sailings.  There is a premium at the moment on direct services but I am not quite sure it is as much in Europe, so one must do the full analysis on that.<\/p><p> From conversations that I have had, it seems that some of the decisions now have been taken away from the hauliers and that is very important.  Ireland's industry, at the coalface, has really got involved in the supply chain because it is their product being moved.  I know, at first hand, of major organisations in Ireland that have now moved their supply chain directly into Europe.  That means such traffic is going to be maintained and staying.  A simple example that I have seen is Amazon traffic coming in.  Very interestingly, we are now seeing more inbound traffic from Europe than outbound.  Again, that would have been an issue previously for a lot of haulage companies because, typically, they would have to go through the land bridge to pick something up for their back-fill coming back.  However, we now have more laden trucks coming in from Europe than leaving Ireland.  That tells us that parts of the supply chain have obviously moved to directly dealing with Europe.  There is a lot that will play out.  There is always going to be the land bridge.  The land bridge is probably going to be quicker but these checks were not in place before Christmas, and we all saw what happened at the ports of Dover, Calais and so forth.  The more frequent the service and the more connectivity is offered directly into Europe, then the more companies will use it, and the more sustainable it will be.<\/p><p> Finally, in regards to stockpiling there has been a trend.  Every time a Brexit issue has been approached there has been a bit of stockpiling.  It is hard to say whether that will happen again in July.  There is a possibility that it might happen if what the UK decides to implement is going to be more problematic than what is already there.  Having said that, there are issues at the moment and we have seen a direct switch to Europe and Rosslare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021021500002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Glenn Carr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1613347200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>As we are only permitted to be in this committee room for two hours we only have two minutes remaining.
