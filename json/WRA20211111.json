If upon review, a household is found to exceed the limits on income eligibility grounds, for example, they would be removed from the list.\u00a0Furthermore, authorities are also required, when directed by the Minister, to undertake a statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA) to count the number of households on the waiting list for social housing supports whose need has not yet been met. The SSHA process requires all local authorities to review those households who are on their housing list but who are not currently in receipt of housing support. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.\u00a0The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.\u00a0However, with the exception of the specific payments listed in the Household Means Policy as being disregarded, all income from social insurance and social assistance payments, allowances and benefits is assessable. <\/p>  <p>  The determination of whether an applicant household meets the income criteria is based on a calculation of their preceding 12 months&rsquo; net average income prior to the date of receipt of application. This ensures that the most comprehensive picture of a household&rsquo;s current and previous income is available at the point of carrying out the assessment.<\/p>  <p>  The documentation required with regard to proof of income is set out in the social housing application form. A degree of discretion is permitted to the local authorities as to the extent of documentation the authority deems necessary to ascertain a household&rsquo;s average income over the preceding 12 months in order to satisfy themselves of the household&rsquo;s true income pattern.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.

A rent increase limit of 4% per annum initially applied in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) . The introduction of the rent increase restriction in RPZs had regard to the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords and takes account of local rental market factors, providing certainty to tenants and landlords with regard to medium-term rent levels.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Section 24A of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004, as amended, provides that the Housing Agency, in consultation with housing authorities, may make a proposal to the Minister that an area should be considered as a Rent Pressure Zone. \u00a0Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the\u00a0area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ). <\/p>  <p>  The criteria to be satisfied by an area under section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act for designation as an RPZ are as follows: <\/p>  <p>  - the information relating to the area, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each RTB Rent Index quarterly report, shows that the annual rate of increase in the average amount of rent for that area is more than 7% in each of at least 4 of the 6 quarters preceding the period immediately prior to the date of the Housing Agency's proposal, and\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - the average rent for the area in the last quarter, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each RTB Rent Index quarterly report, is &ndash;\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - \u00a0in the case of counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow or an LEA in any one of those counties, above the average rent in the State, excluding rents in the 4 Dublin Local Authority areas, or\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - \u00a0in the case of any LEA outside of the Greater Dublin Area (i.e. Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow), above the average rent in the State, excluding rents in the Greater Dublin Area. <\/p>  <p>  Each RTB quarterly Rent Index Report includes a summary in Table 9 of the data used to establish whether each Local Electoral Area fulfils the criteria for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone. This ensures transparency in relation to the position of individual areas in terms of average rent levels and increases. <\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords, a blanket extension of the RPZ rent predictability measure to rental properties across the entire country or a ban on rent increases\u00a0is considered legally questionable and highly vulnerable to legal challenge.\u00a0The Housing Agency and the RTB will continue to monitor national rents and if any LEA\u00a0meets the designation criteria it will be designated as a RPZ. <\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to better protect tenants with affordability challenges by extending the operation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) until the end of 2024 and prohibiting any necessary rent increase in a RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).<\/p>  <p>  When introducing these measures,\u00a0I was very clear on the need to carefully monitor inflation. At that time, HICP inflation averaged 0.73% p.a. over the previous 3 years but had risen to 1.6% p.a. in the year ending June 2021. I needed to revise the RPZ rent control relatively quickly in July, on a basis that could be independently verified.<\/p>  <p>  To address the rent affordability challenges building on foot of the unexpectedly fast rising inflation rate, as recorded by HICP (CSO preliminary data for October 2021 shows HICP inflation of 5.1% p.a.), I have secured Government approval on 4 November to introduce a cap on rent increases in RPZs of no more than 2% per annum pro rata. In effect, this will mean that rents may only increase by HICP inflation or 2%, whichever is the lower.\u00a0The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2021 will be published shortly and is intended for priority enactment as soon as possible in December.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 July 2019, the RTB is empowered under Part 7A &ndash; Complaints, Investigations and Sanctions &ndash; of the Residential Tenancies Acts to investigate improper conduct by landlords and to impose sanctions, where appropriate.\u00a0The breaches of rental law that the Investigations &amp;amp; Sanctions (I&amp;S) unit of the RTB can investigate include a contravention of the rent increase restriction and related procedures in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs).

Under this legislation, there are 31 fire authorities which provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Local authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide. 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters, with approximately 2,065 retained firefighters around the country. It is important to note that the numbers of fire service front-line staff have been maintained at a constant high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of\u00a0years, even\u00a0when\u00a0staffing numbers, by necessity, were reduced in\u00a0other areas of the local authority sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department published 'Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland'. The adoption of KCS as national policy saw national norms\/ standards being established for fire services in Ireland for the first time, against which local authority fire services could benchmark themselves.\u00a0\u00a0 The report of the Fire Service Validation Group, ' Fire Services in Ireland, Local Delivery - National Consistency', published in 2016, noted the staffing arrangements in place in fire services across Ireland to achieve these standards and that fire services manage staffing levels in fire stations to achieve the national standards of fire service response.<\/p>  <p>  The prioritisation of work and effective management of\u00a0all resources is, in the first instance, a matter for management in each of the\u00a0fire services, based on their assessment of local risk, needs and resources.\u00a0In relation to the staffing requirements in each local authority, under the Local Government Act, 2001 it is the responsibility of each Chief Executive to employ such staff and to make such staffing, funding, recruitment and organisational arrangements as may be deemed necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of their local authority.The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three-year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population and positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to issues regarding recruitment and retention within the retained fire service; the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management has approved a proposal for undertaking a review of the model of local authority &lsquo;retained&rsquo; fire services delivery, with particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of staff. The objective is to explore and understand the issues which are impacting on service delivery, to undertake research and analysis and to propose options which will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100071#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regeneration Projects","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100071#WRD01200"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[54746\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100071#WRD01300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the progress that has been made in ensuring that the homes in an estate (details supplied) are removed from their current red zone demolition category; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1509","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":212,"content":"<p>The Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan (LRFIP) provides a roadmap for the regeneration of Limerick across the four main areas identified in the plan.

A further &euro;75 million was allocated for the delivery of Cost Rental homes in Budget 2022.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A total of 390 Cost Rental homes were approved under this first tranche of CREL funding in early 2021. Twenty five of these homes, being the first Cost Rental homes to be designated in Ireland, were acquired by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan. The first tenants moved in to Taylor Hill from 28 August 2021. The cost-covering rents for these homes is approximately 40% below comparable open-market prices in the area, ranging from &euro;935 per month for a two-bed terraced house to &euro;1,150 for a four-bed detached house. Cl&uacute;id has also commenced their tenant selection for a further 56 Cost Rental homes at Barnhall in Leixlip, Co.

Construction of these purpose-built Cost Rental homes is due to be completed before the end of the year and the tenant selection process is underway.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Delivery of CREL homes is subject to construction schedules, which, together with housing projects more generally, were impacted by COVID delays at the beginning of this year. The initial timeframes submitted by AHBs were based on all efforts being made to deliver the homes as soon as possible.

During Quarter 2 2021, 137 new construction schemes, (1,883 homes) were added to the pipeline.<\/p><p>Early delivery of affordable housing will principally arise from previously approved Serviced Sites funding of local authority schemes where construction is commenced and, in early 2022, via the First Homes scheme. There are three Serviced Sites Fund projects on-site which will cumulatively assist in the delivery of 205 affordable homes. &euro;55m has been allocated to the Affordable Housing Fund (formerly the Serviced sites Fund) which will support the delivery of 500 affordable purchase homes in 2022, to be delivered through local authorities.<\/p><p>In addition, the Affordable Housing Act, 2021 provides the statutory basis for a new tenure in Ireland: Cost Rental. Budget 2021 allocated &euro;35 million to the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme which enabled the first Cost Rental homes to be delivered this year by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan. The tenanting processes for further Cost Rental homes at Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and Barnhall, Leixlip, County Kildare, are currently underway. In total, 390 Cost Rental units will be delivered through this funding, with the initial focus being in the Greater Dublin Area and Cork.

In this regard, Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, Damien English TD, recently announced changes to the employment permits system for workers from outside the European Economic Area (EEA), in order to increase the number of skilled construction workers.<\/p><p>In support of the development of Housing for All, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) undertook an analysis of the labour required to deliver on the Plan&rsquo;s annual targets, including at occupational level. This analysis has informed the labour demand forecast of 67,500 i.e. an additional 27,500 workers, for the construction of new builds by 2025, in order to keep pace with an expected graduated increase in annual supply to 33,000 homes in that year. Efforts to expand the workforce will operate to this timeline.<\/p><p>These efforts are being informed by a range of forecasts, undertaken by the EGFSN, across all construction activities. Forecasts in the EGFSN&rsquo;s 2020 report Building Future Skills: The Demand for Skills within Ireland&rsquo;s Built Environment Sector to 2030 are being updated in line with the labour demand estimates for housing, as well as estimates from an EGFSN study on the Climate Action Plan&rsquo;s retrofit targets and the construction of renewable energy projects.<\/p><p>Education and training output will also be aligned and expanded with these requirements, in order to accommodate the different demands on the construction sector, for example through implementation of the Action Plan on Apprenticeship 2021-2025, which aims to increase apprenticeship registrations to 10,000 per annum.<\/p><p>As of Q2 2021, CSO data indicates that there were 127,100 employed in the construction sector.

Tourism has been devastated by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the necessary public health restrictions introduced to control it. Now, as our economy and society begins to open up, we have an opportunity to reconfigure our tourism sector and to more meaningfully address sustainable development and management within the tourism ecosystem.<\/p>  <p>  I recently brought a report to Government, developed by the Sustainable Tourism Working Group, which identifies a suite of actions that will promote sustainable tourism practices which can be implemented prior to the development of a new national tourism policy. The actions identified in this interim action plan will help to form a clear narrative for communicating about the sustainability agenda, build a better understanding and awareness among tourism stakeholders and allow for visitors to practice responsible tourism. The successful implementation of the interim action plan, along with the guiding principles that were developed in 2019, will underpin the advancement of a new tourism policy which will mainstream sustainability. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in Budget 2022, I secured a record level of funding for tourism. This funding will support measures to help address short-term survival-related concerns and also enable recovery across industry as we reopen to international tourism and begin to transition to a more sustainable future. This funding will also allow the tourism agencies to deliver on their commitments in the interim action plan. For example, next year F&aacute;ilte Ireland will develop and roll out a suite of supports and workshops to help tourism businesses to implement sustainability best practice and leverage the benefits for their business. Tourism Ireland will create new sales and marketing opportunities for those sustainable tourism businesses that want to grow their international business. <\/p>  <p>  Measures such as these will shine a light on areas and destinations at home that are striving to be best in class in terms of sustainability and provide better access to information and tools for the tourism industry and visitors to practice responsible tourism. As we rebuild our tourism sector we will seek to realise Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to be amongst the world-leaders in sustainable tourism practices and set out a path for a green transition of the tourism industry and our destinations to become leading sustainable tourism destinations. Many parts of Ireland are very well positioned to advance down this path, including the Deputy's own West Cork which, with its strong food and cultural focus and spectacular scenery and natural heritage, has built a very strong international awareness of all that it has to offer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100072#WRE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":282,"content":"<p>Question No. 117 answered with Question No. 115.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":283,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100073#WRF00300"},{"type":"question","counter":284,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[55053\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100073#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she has assessed the number of enterprises supported by her Department that are reporting financial distress;

While our domestic tourism market has helped sustain the industry, it now needs international visitors to return in significant numbers in order to facilitate a meaningful recovery. Since the easing of restrictions on the 19th of July overseas visitors have started to return to our shores but at a much lower level than prior to the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, a Tourism Recovery Taskforce was put in place to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan with recommendations on how best the Irish Tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the crisis.\u00a0 One of its recommendations was an increase in the overseas Tourism Marketing Fund to help protect Ireland's existing brand position and kick-start the recovery in inbound tourism. <\/p>  <p>  In the recently announced Budget 2022, I was happy to secure additional resources to support tourism next year, including a substantial &euro;35 million increase in our overseas marketing fund and a provision of &euro;50 million for further business continuity supports for tourism businesses.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The competition globally to attract tourism will be more challenging than ever and I am more than confident that Tourism Ireland is equally equipped for and up for the challenge. To this end Tourism Ireland has started to &lsquo;roll out the green carpet&rsquo; and welcome back our international visitors as they work to encourage as many overseas holidaymakers as possible to book Ireland for their next holiday destination. The concept revolves around creating a commitment to travel, by &lsquo;pressing the Green Button&rsquo;; green being the universal colour of &lsquo;go&rsquo; and instinctively connected with the island of Ireland.

This includes the allocation of funding to sporting organisations across a variety of funding schemes.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Sport Ireland is in the process of developing a Diversity and Inclusion policy to further broaden the scope of its remit in this area. Sport Ireland recently concluded a wide ranging research and consultation process with the sport sector, representative organisations and the general public, specifically encouraging the LGBTI+ community, people with a disability and those from minority ethnic communities, including the Travelling community, to share their views. <\/p>  <p>  The aim of the research and consultation process was to identify the barriers and challenges to participation in sport and physical activity faced by certain communities, and to identify opportunities to remove or reduce those barriers. The insights gained will inform the identification and development of supports and initiatives to promote participation in sport and physical activity across under represented communities, including the LGBTI+ community. <\/p>  <p>  The Local Sports Partnership Network (LSP) which is comprised of 29 LSPs around the country, plays a vital role in increasing participation levels in sport and physical activity, especially among those sectors of society that are currently underrepresented in sport. Working with trusted professionals and valued volunteers, the Network engages communities to deliver opportunities for participation in sport and physically activities that are progressive, innovative and fully inclusive at a local level.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020, 340,000 people from communities across Ireland including LGBTI+ persons took part in sport and physical activity opportunities organised by Local Sports Partnerships. In recent years, the LSP Network has utilised funding from the Dormant Account Fund to support inclusive initiatives and programmes that focus on groups with lower levels of participation which includes members of the LGBTI+ community. <\/p>  <p>  In June 2021, the Local Sports Partnerships and National Governing Bodies of Sport supported the inaugural #LetsGetVisible campaign, which was developed by Sporting Pride in association with Sport Ireland. The aim of the campaign was to recognise and promote the importance of visibility and representation amongst the LGBTI+ community. <\/p>  <p>  The Sport Ireland participation unit is currently working with Sporting Pride to explore opportunities to grow and develop this campaign in 2022 utilising the forthcoming Sport Ireland Diversity and Inclusion Policy which will contain specific actions on promoting participation and inclusion of people from the LGBTI+ community, as recommended in Action 43 of the Sport Ireland Participation plan.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy might also be interested to note that I will soon be launching a Sports Action Plan covering the period to end 2023, which will include a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board.

Funding has been made available under the National Development Plan for a culture and creativity investment programme. This investment programme is closely aligned with the Creative Ireland Programme and includes a range of investments in regional arts and culture facilities which include a number of artists&rsquo; workspace projects among other initiatives. Based on this investment we can expect to see the delivery of significant redevelopments our National Cultural Institutions including the Abbey Theatre and the National Concert Hall as well as investments in regional arts and culture facilities.<\/p><p>Local authorities have important functions with respect to the provision of \u00a0artists'\u00a0 work spaces. My Department has allocated up to &euro;3 million to Dublin City Council for capital development of studio workspaces towards funding provided under the urban regeneration development fund on sites owned by the city council. This level of investment will be of significant benefit to artists in the area and address the deficit in artist workspaces in Dublin city.<\/p><p>Recent decades have seen the development of a nationwide infrastructure of venues and arts centres, many of which were initiated and funded by local authorities. These centres are also supported through capital schemes largely operated by my Department. Projects supported included the provision of new integrated art centres, theatres and studio space and the refurbishment of existing performance spaces. \u00a0Support provided to these arts centres by local authorities and the Arts Council is critical to ensuring that a stable and vibrant network can be maintained. Capital funding schemes operated by my Department continue to be focused on enhancing this existing stock of arts and culture centres throughout the country. Recent capital schemes are being informed by the strategic Review of Arts Centres and Venues commissioned by the Arts Council and CCMA, as well as the Arts Council's published Arts Centre Policy and Strategy 2019, which sets out its funding criteria for arts centres from 2020 onwards.<\/p><p>The Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 is a &euro;4.7m capital investment scheme for arts and culture centres which is being administered by my Department.\u00a0 The scheme will run until 2022 and focuses on enhancing the existing stock of arts and culture centres throughout the country. Projects that provide additional capacity for artists and artistic production particularly in arts centres are favoured. The Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 is constructed of a number of funding streams one of which is Stream C which is aimed at upgrading visual artists' workspaces and is run by Visual Artists Ireland (VAI) on behalf of my Department. Funding of approximately &euro;79k was announced in October 2020 by VAI for Stream C to 10 applicants.<\/p><p>In response to Covid-19,\u00a0 capital funding towards the pilot Outdoor Public Space Scheme 2021\u00a0 by my Department is intended to fund local authorities to adapt, equip or otherwise improve public spaces for cultural and events activities, taking account of public health guidelines and of the needs of the local arts community.

Total electricity demand over the next ten years is forecast to grow by between 19% and 50%, largely driven by large new energy users, which include transport electricity demand (estimated at circa 23% per annum) as a result of accelerated uptake of EV charging. It is evident therefore that additional electricity generation and enhanced demand management is needed to support the decarbonisation of our economy and society, including the transport sector, and to achieve our emission reduction targets.<\/p>  <p>  While the supply and provision of electricity to the country is a policy matter for the Department of Energy, Climate and Communications (DECC), and detailed queries on this matter should be directed to that Department rather than the Department of Transport , I can inform the Deputy that under the Climate Action Plan the electricity sector commits to expanding electricity output and refining the grid to meet this additional demand, including the extra demand from electric vehicles. The Plan commits to increasing the share of electricity supply from renewable sources to up to 80%, delivering three new transmission grid connections\/interconnectors to Northern Ireland, Great Britain, and the EU, as well as exploring further interconnections to other countries. A range of supporting measures will also be needed to enable this transformation of the electricity generation sector. These will include providing the conventional capacity that will be essential to ensure the security of the system, grid investments, interconnectors, and storage facilities. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Climate Action Plan outlines a number of measures to deliver on increased electricity demand management including:<\/p>  <p>  - The Commission for the\u00a0Regulation of Utilities (CRU) will deliver a new Demand Side Strategy \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 which will aim to have industrial, commercial and residential demand fully\u00a0participating in supporting system needs with high levels of renewable generation, and seek to facilitate active participation by\u00a0consumers and communities in the energy market.<\/p>  <p>  - The Sustainable Energy\u00a0Authority of Ireland (SEAI), the CRU and the system operators, will work \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 with large energy users and enterprise development agencies, to develop\u00a0approaches to enhance reporting and usage of lower carbon energy sources,\u00a0including increased transparency of electricity emissions data to enable\u00a0large energy users to address their electricity emissions across time\u00a0(hourly) and geographic locations.<\/p>  <p>  - EirGrid and ESB Networks\u00a0will undertake an in-depth analysis of local, regional and system level flexibility requirements, and modify their own approaches and procedures\u00a0to facilitate demand flexibility, to drive down costs to the consumer and\u00a0provide the necessary flexibility to meet the needs of the energy\u00a0transition to 2030.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (the CRU) has statutory responsibility, under S.I. 60 of 2005, to monitor and take measures necessary to ensure the security of electricity supply in Ireland.\u00a0 The CRU is assisted in its statutory role by EirGrid, the electricity transmission system operator. The CRU is an independent statutory body and solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions.<\/p>  <p>  EirGrid&rsquo;s Generation Capacity Statement which was published on Wednesday 29 September and covers the period 2021 to 2030 sets out a medium term need to develop 1,850 MW of generation capacity by 2025. On the same day, the CRU published an information note, setting out the programme of actions being progressed to deliver the required generation capacity. The actions include: increasing the availability of existing generators; developing of new generation capacity &ndash; including temporary generation capacity in advance of winter 2022; extending the operational life of some existing generators; new rules for the grid connection of data centres; and actions to enhance demand-side response, including large consumers reducing demand when the system margin is low.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has statutory responsibility to monitor and take measures necessary to ensure the security of electricity supply in Ireland.\u00a0 In this regard, the CRU recently published a programme of actions to deliver 1,850 MW of generation capacity by 2025. Such actions will help power our future electric fleet. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100078#WRL02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":564,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100078#WRL02200"},{"type":"question","counter":565,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[55258\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100078#WRL02300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of persons awaiting a driver test in each test centre area, by age, in tabular form.","asker":"1514","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":566,"content":"<p>The\u00a0driving test\u00a0is the\u00a0statutory responsibility\u00a0of the Road Safety Authority.<\/p><p>The information requested is held by the Authority and this question is being referred to it for direct reply.\u00a0<\/p><p>I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100078#WRL02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"question","counter":568,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[55259\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100078#WRL02600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of persons awaiting a driver test appointment in each centre, by age;

Based on the modelling done by the National Transport Authority, the abatement potential from the bundle of measures that would achieve these targets is 1.4 MtCO2 emissions. The increased number of daily journeys will be achieved by providing more attractive active travel and public transport options to promote a radical modal shift away car usage.

This position is reinforced by the EU legislative framework for insurance (the <i>Solvency II<\/i>Directive). <\/p><p>Having said that, the Government is acutely aware of the concerns felt by many sectors, including the ones highlighted by the Deputy, regarding the cost and availability of insurance. It has therefore prioritised the implementation of the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform<\/i>. As the Deputy may be aware, the first Action Plan Implementation Report, which was published in July, shows that significant progress has been made, with 34 of the 66 actions contained therein now completed. <\/p><p>One of the key achievements in the first half of this year was the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines some six months ahead of schedule. Early data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) shows that since the commencement of the new Guidelines award levels have reduced by an average of 40%. This is an encouraging development; it is my hope that this trend will continue and result in lower costs for businesses.  As the insurance reform agenda progresses, we will continue to hold the industry to account on its commitments to pass on savings from the Guidelines, and other elements of the reforms, to customers. Minister of State Fleming, in his ongoing engagement with the sector, has emphasised the need for insurance providers to reduce premiums and increase their risk appetite to provide cover in new areas. A further element of the Action Plan with particular relevance to these types of activities involves reviewing the Duty of Care. The Minister for Justice, who is leading on this action, has noted to Government the intention to bring forward legislative proposals to reform the law in this area. My officials understand from their Department of Justice colleagues that these proposals are at an advanced stage. <\/p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.

Therefore, meeting the target of an average of 33,000 homes per year will clearly require a significant increase in delivery. This increase in delivery will also require an increase in investment to support the building of new homes - in particular in the form of development finance. <\/p>  <p>  This development finance will be needed by all those involved in developing homes across all regions of our country, from small and medium sized builders and developers, to larger operators, and this finance must come from a range of sources.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing for All plan has clearly set out that public monies alone will not account for all of the funding for housing development in the State. External sources of finance will be needed to bridge the gap between the overall funding requirement to build an average of 33,000 homes each year, and that provided via direct Exchequer funding, State borrowing, Home Building Finance Ireland and the domestic banking sector. <\/p>  <p>  Housing for All committed to the establishment of three dedicated work streams to drive the delivery of key aspects of the plan. This includes an investment work stream, which is chaired by the Department of Finance and includes membership from the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and the NTMA.  <\/p>  <p>  Through the Housing for All investment work stream, there will be ongoing stakeholder engagement with a wide range of public and private bodies with a role in financing housing development. This will include engagement with public bodies involved in home delivery such as Home Building Finance Ireland, the Land Development Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank, amongst others. It will also include engagement with domestic banks and private entities including institutional investors who also play an important role in funding the supply of additional property in Ireland, as is the case in most other property markets. The forward investment provided by investors provides capital to construct additional properties and many of these homes would not be available without the investment provided. <\/p>  <p>  This engagement with stakeholders across the broad spectrum of funding for residential development is an important means of understanding the funding landscape and supporting the availability of the right type of finance for the wide variety of home developers and development schemes nationwide. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, consideration is being given to the nature and type of this engagement.<\/p>  <p>  Any engagement with institutional investors is not undertaken with a view to encouraging the bulk buying of residential houses. Rather, it is one part of a broader targeted engagement with all public and private bodies with a role in financing housing development, to ensure an adequate supply of appropriate finance to support the development of additional homes across the State. <\/p>  <p>  Ensuring that people have access to home ownership in this country is a priority for this Government. Building up supply, after a period during which construction was forced to close for a significant period of time, is key to delivering on the ambitious targets set in Housing for All and making sure that those who wish to develop homes have access to a range of appropriate funding sources, both public and private, is central to the delivery of additional homes across the country. Engagement with key stakeholders is an important and legitimate means of gathering information on the funding landscape for residential housing development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100080#WRN03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":642,"content":"<p>Question No. 241 answered with Question No. 240.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":644,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100081#WRO00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","counter":643,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100081#WRO00300"},{"type":"question","counter":644,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[55325\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100081#WRO00400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the reason retired prison officers who are in receipt of a State pension did not receive the 2% rise in payments that other sectors of the public service received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":645,"content":"<p>I\u00a0assume the Deputy is referring to pensions payable to retired prison officers under the civil service (occupational) pension scheme rather than the State Pension payable by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  Under the current pension increase policy for the pre-existing public service pension schemes, qualifying pensions fall to be increased in line with a general round increase in annualised basic salary of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater, granted to serving public servants on 1 October 2021. <\/p>  <p>My Department issued a circular on 1 October authorising pension administrators to pay the increase to qualifying pensions.

A Tourism Recovery Taskforce was appointed in 2020 to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan with recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the crisis.\u00a0The Taskforce undertook a public consultation process that garnered over 800 responses, including submissions from 60 organisations. This input helped guide and influence the key pillars of the report and informed the recommendations in terms of the survival and recovery phases for the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Taskforce presented the Tourism Recovery Plan 2020 &ndash; 2023 to me in September 2020. The Plan makes a number of recommendations to help tourism businesses to survive, stabilise and recover from the COVID pandemic.\u00a0In December 2020, I appointed a Recovery Oversight Group, who report to me on a regular basis with updates on the implementation of the recommendations set out in the Recovery Plan and on the recovery of the sector.<\/p>  <p>  I regularly meet with and remain open to engaging with, a wide variety of tourism stakeholders and representative bodies. The Hospitality and Tourism Forum, which the T&aacute;naiste and I established, continues to provide a platform for structured engagement between the Hospitality and Tourism sectors, the tourism agencies and relevant Government Departments. The purpose of the Forum is to allow key issues to be discussed, with a view to identifying practical actions which could be taken by Government or by industry itself, to support the sectors.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I secured a record level of funding for tourism that will address short-term survival-related concerns and also enable recovery across industry as we reopen to international tourism and begin to transition to a more sustainable future. This includes a &euro;35 million increase in the Tourism Marketing Fund in 2022, to accelerate the return of international tourism to Ireland.\u00a0 Budget 2022 also included a provision of &euro;50 million for further business continuity support for strategic tourism businesses that can help drive the sustainable recovery of our tourism sector; and an additional provision for skills development and staff retention.<\/p>  <p>  There is increasing recognition that tourism growth must be sustainable, as well as being consistent with our sectoral climate change targets and commitments. In that regard, I know that Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are working towards the longer term goal of ensuring that we are successfully marketed as a sustainable tourism destination.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the Recovery Oversight Group, in addition to my on-going engagement with industry stakeholders and representatives, will inform future policy considerations as I continue to work, alongside my Government colleagues, to support the tourism sector over the coming year and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100082#WRP01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":684,"content":"<p>Question No. 255 answered with Question No. 254.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":685,"content":"<p>Question No. 256 answered with Question No. 254.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":686,"content":"<p>Question No. 257 answered with Question No. 254.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":687,"content":"<p>Question No. 258 answered with Question No. 254.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Culture Policy","counter":688,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100082#WRP01900"},{"type":"question","counter":689,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[55443\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100082#WRP02000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the initiatives she has taken or proposes to take to encourage cultural activities throughout the country with particular reference to ongoing challenges such as Covid-19 or other threats in the short and medium-term; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":690,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[55445\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100082#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the degree to which her Department has assisted with community-based arts and cultural activities, by county, in the past 12 months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":691,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[55446\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100082#WRP02200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which her Department continues to liaise with cultural and arts groups, including the performing arts; if she is satisfied with the progress in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":692,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[55447\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100082#WRP02300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which her Department, directly or through the Arts Council and Kildare County Council, has assisted with productions at a club (details supplied); her proposals for do so in 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":693,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 and 261 to 263, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The all-of Government Creative Ireland Programme 2017-2022, led by my Department, seeks to enable each citizen to realise their full creative potential.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. <\/p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.

As set out in Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland, the efficiency of the banding model and its application to local authorities will be considered. Equivalisation as between singles and families will also be considered. The review will also have regard to new initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and Cost Rental housing.

This resulted in a pause in overall Foreign Birth Registration processing.<b><\/b>Staff continued to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Over 5,000 of such emergency Foreign Birth Registration applications have been processed to date in 2021. For other applications, the Department operates a transparent general policy of processing Foreign Birth Registration applications in order of receipt.<\/p><p>At present, there are just over 31,500 applications for which documentation has been received and are awaiting processing.

The HSE reports that emergency department attendances have now reached 2019 levels, exceeding them at some sites, and the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys for hospital admission have been increasing steadily over the past several months. This winter is expected to be particularly challenging with the continued need to manage Covid-19 in our hospitals while facing the high winter demand for ED services, particularly by older persons.<\/p>  <p>  The Winter Plan 2021\/22 is in active development by the HSE and a revised plan has just been submitted on foot of a request by the Department of Health. The revised Plan will reflect the funding available and set out the measures to be implemented and the expected impacts. My Department is continuing to engage intensively with the HSE on the issue, and a finalised Winter Plan will be published in due course.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Winter Plan 2021\/22, the HSE are preparing for the volume of both unscheduled and scheduled activity to return to previous levels. In order to accommodate this demand the HSE will implement new ways of working, open additional capacity, and continue to enhance infection prevention and control measures in our healthcare facilities.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the Sl&aacute;intecare 'right care, right time, right place' approach, the Winter Plan will be targeted at optimising and creating capacity at three critical stages in the patient pathway: avoidance of hospital admittance unless absolutely essential, patient flow through our hospitals, and safe and timely egress of patients from hospital. As in previous years, Winter Plan initiatives will aim to reduce demand on emergency care by providing additional acute bed capacity, alternative care pathways in the primary care and community care sectors, and additional discharge supports in the community.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is continuing to invest in the development of primary and community services through the Enhanced Community Care programme. Some &euro;195m was allocated in Budget 2022 to build on the progress made this year and to ensure the continued rollout of 96 Community Healthcare Networks across the country as well as the establishment of specialist community teams for older persons and those with chronic conditions.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The development of these networks and teams, alongside other initiatives such as improved GP access to diagnostics, expanded Community Intervention Teams and the development of Primary Care Centres, will enhance capacity in community services and ease pressure on hospital EDs.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100090#WRX01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":934,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100090#WRX02000"},{"type":"question","counter":935,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[55240\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100090#WRX02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the lack of stroke facilities in hospitals; if a strategy is being put in place to alleviate this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":936,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s proposed National Stroke Strategy 2021-2026 has been clinically approved by the HSE Chief Clinical Officer Clinical Forum at its meeting in July 2021 and the HSE inform me that it will be reviewed by the HSE Executive Management Team at its meeting of 23rd November, 2021.

The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE also has a system in place for the efficient provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e. in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent ongoing medical care or are receiving end of life care.\u00a0 In these cases, a medical card is issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and completed medical report by a healthcare professional.\u00a0 Additionally, patients with a terminal illness and who have been certified by their treating Consultant as having\u00a0 a prognosis of 24 months or less to live are also now eligible for a medical card without a means assessment.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer, for a period of five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100094#WRBB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages","counter":1061,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100094#WRBB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1062,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[55377\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100094#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the provision of a statutory home care scheme; the way in which perceived age discrimination in the provision of home care services will be tackled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1063,"content":"<p>Enabling people with care-needs to continue to live independently at home for as long as possible is a priority for the Government. To advance this, the Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services for people aged 18 years and above based on their assessed care-needs. Work is on-going within the Department to progress the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery for home support services.<\/p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined.\u00a0The Department recently commenced a targeted stakeholder consultation on these draft minimum requirements. In addition, HIQA recently ran a public scoping consultation to inform the development of their National Standards for Home Support Services.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the development of a statutory scheme for the financing of home support, the Department is undertaking work on the potential demand for and cost of the introduction of a such a scheme.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In parallel to this, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for home support. Within this context, funding was provided in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The testing of the reformed model of service delivery for home support commenced this month in the first of the four pilot sites: CHO 8.\u00a0It is envisaged that the three other sites, CHOs 2, 4 and 7 will be fully\u00a0 operational by January 2022.\u00a0 A National Home Support Office will be established before the end of the year and recruitment of the 130 posts funded for the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs is scheduled to commence in this quarter. A comprehensive and robust operational model for the roll-out of the interRAI has been developed which will facilitate effective, efficient, fair and transparent care needs assessment and planning and appropriate service delivery. The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home support scheme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021&ndash;2023 commits to the advancement of the development of the new home-support scheme in 2021 and to the commencement of its implementation in 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100094#WRBB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Charges","counter":1064,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100094#WRBB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1065,"qnumday":388,"qnumall":"[55387\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021111100094#WRBB01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 439 of 7 October 2021, the status of his Department&rsquo;s examination on this issue; if there is a timeline available for when these charges will be reformed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1066,"content":"<p>As outlined to the Deputy previously, the Programme for Government makes a commitment to introduce a cap on the maximum daily charge for patients and visitors at all public hospitals, where possible, and to introduce flexible passes in all public hospitals for patients and their families.

To that end, Government and my Department introduced a number of supports to assist sectors in dealing with the impact of COVID-19 and social restrictions necessary in the interests of public health.<\/p>  <p>  On Thursday, 11th November 2021, I was pleased to launch the new Community Activities Fund. This &euro;9m fund is being provided by the Government to support community and voluntary groups impacted by Covid-19.\u00a0 This once-off funding will be allocated under the Department&rsquo;s Community Enhancement Programme and in order to ensure there is sufficient flexibility to allow funding to be targeted to where it is needed in each Local Authority area, it will be administered locally by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs).<\/p>  <p>  The Community Activities Fund will support groups, particularly in disadvantaged areas, with their running costs such as utility (Electricity, Heating charges) or insurance bills, as well as with improvements to their facilities. Groups will also be able to use the funding to carry out necessary repairs and to purchase equipment such as tables and chairs, tools and signage, laptops and printers, lawnmowers, canopies and training equipment.<\/p>  <p>  My Department currently supports over 420 community organisations under the Community Services Programme (CSP) to provide local services through a social enterprise model.
