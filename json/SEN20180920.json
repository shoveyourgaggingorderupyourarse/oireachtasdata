Nonetheless, I will air my concerns because they are important and ask that the Minister of State relays them in full to the Minister for Health.<\/p> <p>I met Craig Bolger in my constituency office in Carlow last week.  He asked that I use his name because he wants me to be his voice.  He is a family man, devoted to his ten year old son Brandon, who was diagnosed with cancer on 27 March this year.  Brandon's cancer was detected through a stubborn verruca and later operated on.  He was lucky that his mother and father kept asking questions and kept fighting for treatment because it took a lot of back and forth to get a diagnosis.  I am raising this today because Craig and his wife Sandra have had to fight for their son every step of the way since they first noticed that stubborn verruca.  Brandon's cancer, which affects bone or soft tissue, is rare.  It is called Ewing sarcoma.  In one day, Brandon had a line inserted into his neck, had two teeth pulled and underwent a lumbar puncture.  He is a resilient little boy who never complains.  His smile is infectious and he would brighten up any room.  He should not have to be fighting anything but cancer now.  However, Brandon is supposed to have chemotherapy every 14 days at Our Lady's Children's hospital in Crumlin but because of a lack of beds, his chemotherapy has been repeatedly delayed over the last few months.  This has happened on several occasions, not just to Brandon but to other children too.  This week, Craig raised his frustration with me, with local and national media and on social media.  His son's chemotherapy, which has to be administered on time was delayed by five days this week.  This little boy is seriously ill.  Why did this happen?  During this delay, Craig shouted loudly and eventually on Tuesday he got a bed for his son but this is just not good enough.  Brandon should get a bed when he needs one.  We now have a system in which members of the public have to make a huge noise in order to effect change.  If there is an ability to help people, why does our healthcare system make them beg?  The Bolgers have asked why they have to beg for a service that should be in place for their seriously ill son.  Why can people only get help when they shout about it?  Why can they not get the help they need straight away?  Why do they have to go to newspapers or radio and television stations?  Brandon has a hell of a fight on his hands already.  Why does he have to fight for this?  <\/p> <p>Brandon is going to Barretstown on 5 October.  There are great people there and there are great people in Our Lady's hospital in Crumlin and in the health service generally.  There are also great parents who should not have to fight these kinds of battles for their children.  They are at the end of the tether as it is and are crying out for help.  We cannot have a system that does not treat children because of a lack of capacity, funding or resources.  Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable.  We have children on waiting lists for diagnosis, for surgery and for treatment.  They are waiting for care, for treatment and to be seen and to be heard.  I ask the Minister of State to explain why this has happened, not once but several times to Brandon and to many other children.  Why have children in Crumlin been left waiting for chemotherapy?  Why are their parents fighting for a bed?  I ask the Minister of State to put a stop to this.  I ask her to relay this message to the Minister for Health.  He must give a commitment to Craig Bolger and his son Brandon that they will not be waiting for chemotherapy services.  No child in this country should be left waiting for chemotherapy or for a bed.  A child can wait for Christmas but cannot wait for treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#A00500","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Murnane O'Connor for raising this matter and apologise on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who cannot be here this morning as he is attending a meeting in the Department.  I am sorry but that is the truth.<\/p> <p>At the outset, I wish to convey my sympathies to any family experiencing delays in receiving timely treatment in our hospitals.  I can only imagine the distress caused by any disruption to a patient's treatment but particularly to a child undergoing chemotherapy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister, Deputy Harris, has been advised by the hospital that delays are being experienced as a consequence of essential maintenance works in three rooms in St. John's oncology ward.  As a parent of a son who, in his early years, spent time in this ward, I am aware of the extraordinary and exceptional job being done by the staff in caring and comforting young children and their families at a time when their lives are being turned upside down.  These works, combined with an increase demand on Crumlin hospital's oncology service for inpatient beds is proving a particular challenge at present for the site.  The hospital recognises, and sincerely regrets, the impact that the change in admission date has on had patients and their families.  Furthermore, any decision to delay admission or treatment is not taken lightly.  When such decisions are made, they are made to ensure a safe environment, with safe delivery of care to all patients the priority at all times.  <\/p><p>Last year, the Minister, Deputy Harris, launched the national cancer strategy under which cancer services for children and adolescents-young adults are an area of particular focus.  The strategy aims to further develop child and young adolescent cancer services in the new national children&rsquo;s hospital.  The schedule of accommodation of the new haematology and oncology unit in the hospital will significantly increase the capacity to deliver more comprehensive cancer care.  This could include treatment of specific clinically driven conditions for adolescents-young adults who have paediatric-centric tumours and are aged between 16 and 20 years.  The aim is to ensure that patients are treated in the centre - adult or paediatric - most appropriate to their needs.  <\/p><p>Nationally, the national cancer control programme leads the implementation of the new cancer strategy in the HSE.  This involves providing leadership across the continuum of care, from diagnosis to treatment to appropriate follow-up and support, in both the hospital and community setting.  The children&rsquo;s hospital group will work with the national cancer control programme in particular on the development of adolescent and young adults' cancer services, contributing to the development of the survivorship programme.  Services for the treatment of cancer include surgery, radiotherapy and systemic anti-cancer therapy, SACT, which includes medical oncology and haemato-oncology.  The majority, but not all, of cancer surgery now takes place in the designated cancer centres.  Our Lady&rsquo;s children's hospital, Crumlin is the designated cancer centres for paediatrics.  <\/p><p>I assure the Senator that in the context of improving hospital services for all patients, the Minister, Deputy Harris, is in ongoing contact with the children&rsquo;s hospital group and he will be engaging with it on this matter in terms of seeking assurances for the maintenance of oncology activity and targets at Crumlin hospital.  On my own behalf, and as Minister of State at the Department of Health, I apologise to Mr. and Mrs. Bolger and their son for the delay in the provision of his treatment.  As the report outlines, there are difficulties, particularly around the maintenance of this unit, and these are being addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#A00600","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply, which I will relay to the family.

I ask the Minister of State to relay to the Minister, Deputy Harris, that no child or cancer patient should be left waiting for chemotherapy or any other type of treatment.

I am seeking an update from the Minister of State regarding the reopening of the Garda station in Ballinspittle.  On page 101 of the programme for Government, there is a commitment to a pilot scheme for the reopening of some of the Garda stations closed in the last few years.  In this regard, there are six stations listed for reopening, one of which is my constituency in Cork South-West, namely, Ballinspittle Garda station.  The general public and the community welcome the proposed reopening of this Garda station.  The community had been seeking this for some time and when the announcement was made, it was a great relief to all concerned.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State will be aware, Ballinspittle is a thriving little village, with a busy rural hinterland.  It also has a unique tourism trade, with some fantastic beaches that are really busy in the summer.  This level of activity is one of key reasons the people of Ballinspittle and the surrounding areas sought the reopening of this Garda station.  Also, the community is concerned that because Ballinspittle is a coastal village any throughput of yachts or other vessels could be carrying contraband, as we witnessed during the week in relation to a vessel detained in Kinsale harbour.  When will this Garda station reopen in order that the community will have access to a facility and Garda with whom they could raise concerns regarding such issues should they arise?  Also, the reopening of this station might be one of the reasons such vessels would not come to that part of the world?  I hope that the Minister of State can provide me with an update on the re-opening of this Garda station.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#B00600","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, who regrets that he cannot be here today due to other official commitments.  He wishes to thank the Senator for raising this matter in the Seanad today.<\/p> <p>I agree with the Senator that Ballinspittle is a special and lovely place.  It is not part of my own area but I am familiar with it.  As the Senator will be aware the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works, OPW, which has the responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  This includes identifying and progressing any necessary remedial or refurbishment works required at  individual stations.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has no direct role in these matters.  <\/p> <p>As the Senator may also be aware, the programme for a partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen six Garda stations, urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.  I note the Senator's remarks with regard to contraband and so forth.  The Garda Commissioner's final report, which is available on the Department of Justice and Equality website, recommends that Ballinspittle Garda station be reopened along with stations in Bawnboy, County Cavan, Leighlinbridge, County Carlow, Donard, County Wicklow and Rush and Stepaside, County Dublin.  The Garda authorities have informed the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, that at the outset of the  process the Garda authorities provided a brief of requirements to the OPW in relation to the reopening of each of these six stations and requested the OPW to undertake technical surveys to determine the works which would be necessary to enable the stations to re-open.  The OPW, in turn, concluded the necessary technical surveys and advised the commissioner accordingly.<\/p> <p>I can confirm that the Commissioner, following consideration of the OPW technical surveys of each of the six stations, has now identified the organisation&rsquo;s preferred way forward, bearing in mind operational needs, costs, timeframe for delivery and other factors.  Engagement between the OPW and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has provided the necessary further detail to allow the pilot programme of reopenings to proceed to the next stage of implementation.  Finalisation of design, planning, where required, and procurement for each of the six stations included in the pilot programme, including Ballinspittle, will now be progressed by the OPW, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in line with all applicable processes and procedures.  It is not possible to say at this stage when Ballinspittle Garda station, or the other five stations will reopen as this depends on a number of factors, but implementation of the programme and reopening of all six stations is being pursued as a matter of priority.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> More generally, the Minister wishes to point out that the reopening pilot programme is part of the unprecedented attention paid by the Government in recent years to addressing the deficiencies in the Garda estate.  Unprecedented resources are being provided to provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and the public interacting with them.  It inevitably takes time to see the results of investment such as this.  It can be hard not to be impatient but the reality is that the design, planning and procurement for building projects take time if fairness and the best possible results at the best possible value are to be ensured.  However, we are now seeing the results of the unprecedented taxpayer funding provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recent years.  For example, three new divisional and regional headquarters in Galway, Wexford and Kevin Street, Dublin, have recently been completed and have entered into operational use.<\/p><p>I am pleased to inform the Senator on the Minister's behalf that more than 80 stations have now benefitted from works under the cell refurbishment programme.  Progress is now being made under the broader Garda building and refurbishment programme, which is progressing on the basis of &euro;60 million in Exchequer funding.  I reassure the Senator that, in this time of unprecedented investment in the Garda estate, implementation of the pilot Garda station reopening project, by which I mean completion of all works required to enable reopening of the six stations, including Ballinspittle, is being pursued as a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#B00700","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Once it is reopened for the next election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#C00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>It depends on when the next election will be.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution.

It is now two years and three months since the referendum vote; we are six months away from the final deal.  Theresa May still says she does not want to delay it.  There is no more talk of transition.  The issue becomes more critical by the hour.  Yesterday, there was what has been termed an informal summit and there will be a lunch of the 27 without the UK today.  With every day that passes, it seems there is another complication.  A new commentary has come out from the airport authorities discussing the catastrophe that will befall the aviation sector among the 27 and the UK if a deal on aviation-related security and the treatment of passengers between the 27 and the UK is not arrived at.  This is of particular interest to us as we often use the UK as a transit point<i>en route<\/i>to other cities.  I did so myself this week.  It is important that we have a deal on Brexit.  The language from the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste is far more pessimistic than it was, although to be fair, it is probably more pragmatic and realistic.  I ask the Leader to bring in the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade as soon as possible to update the House on where we are going.  We see it in the newspapers but it is important that we have a debate here where we can discuss it and tease out the issues.  The Border seems to continue to be a very challenging issue in terms of whether it is a land border, sea border or there being no border or whether Northern Ireland is in or out of some sort of special regulatory arrangement.  We need regulatory alignment in respect of our food sector, among other areas.<\/p><p>I will follow Senator Ardagh's example yesterday by raising the matter of BusConnects, which was debated in a Private Members' motion in the Lower House yesterday.  It is a matter of great concern.  Much of the plan is very good, such as the 90-minute transfer to connect between Luas, DART and Dublin Bus, which is excellent.  There is also the investment in infrastructure and in more buses.  I appreciate it is only a draft proposal and that we, as Members of the Oireachtas, will meet representatives of the National Transport Authority later today.  Many bus routes serve a valid purpose.  They are direct routes, sometimes from certain areas to colleges or hospitals, which will involve people connecting.  For people, especially those who are elderly or not particularly agile, getting off one bus and having to connect to another, being obliged to queue or perhaps missing that connection and being obliged to wait, are matters of concern.  The devil is in the detail.  Transport-related matters will be discussed later.  BusConnects is a matter that concerns many parties.  Fine Gael as a party is concerned about it, Fianna F&aacute;il has held many public meetings in Dublin on the matter and it is something we need to examine.  We should have time to talk about that specifically, separate from the debate today.  Each time the Minister, Deputy Ross, comes before this House, he tends to speak for a long time initially - he might not do so today - there are a certain number of contributions from Members and then the Minister has a very short time to respond, which is usually not sufficient.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask the Leader to schedule the debate. <br\/><br\/>I want to support another transport matter.  <i>Cyclists.ie<\/i>has called for 10% of the land transfer budget to be spent on cycling.

We do not have an affordable housing scheme currently.  Anybody who earns in excess of &euro;42,000 will not qualify for affordable housing and, certainly in Dublin, that level of income is not sufficient to buy a home.

However, a clinician and a pharmacist are in the AV Room and they have informed people that there is a drug that will arrest the disease and increase the life expectancy of these children.  I was impressed by a little nine-year old girl who made a presentation.  I am a grandfather and I found her words heartbreaking.  We should give whatever money is necessary.  Lack of money is a matter close to my heart.  Day after day, we receive emails about pre-budget presentations, which is a load of bloody nonsense because the budget is well sorted at this stage.  Making presentations now that seek adjustments to the budget is a nonsense and they are simply a PR stunt.  The kids with SMA II are not engaged in a PR stunt.  I invite anybody who does not believe what I am saying to go to the AV room to meet them and their parents.  The presentation is the most heartbreaking I have heard in the Oireachtas in a long time.  There are only 25 sufferers nationally.  I do not know whether my colleague, Senator Reilly, is in a position to comment on the matter and I will not test his knowledge of same.  If there is drug therapy available, then, for God's sake, let us spend whatever money is necessary to provide same.<\/p> <p>I commend the Members of this House and the Lower House who attended the parade for respect and loyalty that took place yesterday for the Defence Forces.

I make my request because the march was attended by 2,500 veterans.  They have put their lives on the line not just for this country but for peace.  Yesterday, my colleague, Declan Power, read out the names of the people from this country who have lost their lives serving the Defence Forces and the people of this country.

The one thing that appeals to me about her is not only that she is formidable, courageous and all of those things that I admire in any human being, but she is standing forward.  I would be proud to have her as our President.  She would be a president for all of the people and nobody would be left behind in a country where she was president.

It is the number one cause of death in infants and causes deterioration in muscle tone and strength, usually ending in premature death.  There has been a breakthrough with a new drug called Spinraza, which dramatically decreases the loss of the motor neurone function for patients with SMA.  Spinraza is the first drug to be approved for treating the disorder.  In May 2017, the European Medicines Agency granted market authorisation for this drug and, in October 2017, the HSE received a reimbursement application.  There was great disappointment among the SMA community when, in December 2017, the National Centre for Pharmaeconomics completed a health technology assessment of Spinraza and did not recommend the reimbursement at the price submitted.  The assessment was considered by the HSE drugs group in May 2018 but no decision has yet been arrived at.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask the Leader to bring our concerns about this issue to the Minister for Health and to ask him to speed up the process.

This happens so many times with these drugs for rare diseases.  Those living in this country - the children we met in the AV room - have the same rights as those living in other countries, and they deserve to get the drug as well.  It is not down to an issue of cost because if we can give charitable status to foreign vulture funds, which make billions out of this country, we can surely make these drugs available to a small number of children and people affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#H00600","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I welcome the Leader back and hope he had a very productive summer.  We will have a very intense period in the lead up to Christmas.  I am aware the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, have both been in this House in relation to housing and related issues.  I am still of the view that we need to have a further constructive debate on this issue.  I hope to see proposals from the Government on short-term lettings.  While such proposals will not fix the housing crisis, they will very quickly put at least 1,000 additional units on the rental market.  It may also have a positive impact in reducing rents in our main urban areas.  The record across the world is a reduction of between 1% to 4% when short-term lettings are regulated.  I hope to see these proposals very shortly and will welcome them.<\/p> <p>The Government constantly refers to this as being a supply issue that has to be dealt with.  An area I have repeatedly raised is Poolbeg West, the former Irish Glass site, where approximately 3,500 units could be developed over the short, medium and long term.  It was very disappointing that An Bord Plean&aacute;la could not make a decision in relation to this site in early August because of lack of resources.<\/p> <p>The Government has sent much additional work in the direction of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and this is tying up and delaying planning decisions, which are badly needed right across the country.  We allowed the number of inspectors to slip to as low as four or five.  It has recently been brought up to 13 but now all planning proposals of more than 100 units are going directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It needs to be resourced properly to deal with the level of work going in that direction.  Otherwise we are going to see delay after delay regarding housing developments.  We will need to see at least one additional staff member to do this work in a timely fashion.  This is an effort to highlight where we can improve the supply element of this issue.  It is not acceptable when we see a development that could supply 3,500 units delayed in An Bord Plean&aacute;la because of a resources issue.  It should not be acceptable to the Government and we need speedy action on this.<\/p> <p>I am aware Senator Grace O'Sullivan dealt with the issue of cycling and I am not going to go over that.

That is as frustrating for Fine Gael Senators as it is for Fianna F&aacute;il Senators and for everyone else.  We need proper interaction on transport when the Minister comes in.  There has to be sufficient time for the Minister to address those points.  I am aware it is difficult but it would be helpful to all in the House if we had a discussion with the Minister and proper engagement when he comes to the House rather than talking out issues.<\/p> <p>On one famous occasion in the House, the Minister spoke at length about the Rugby World Cup and addressed no other issue raised by Senators.  We have challenges in relation to the Metro line, BusConnects, cycling and pedestrians right across the country.  We need that level of engagement with the Minister.  I know it will be difficult for the Leader.  It is a big job but I believe he is up to it.

This goes to the core of what good governance is about in terms of planning.  I do not wish to be critical of anybody but there is a sense among Dubliners that this plan seems to reflect many other cities internationally that were built on grid systems, which ours was not.<\/p><p>There is tremendous concern in Fingal, particularly in Skerries, Balbriggan, Rush and Lusk, about the express bus service which gets people into town very efficiently and very effectively through the Dublin Port tunnel.  While we await the development of metro, a critical part of infrastructure which I am sure the Minister will address this afternoon, the issue of BusConnects needs proper consultation.  I know the project group is here today to discuss matters with Members and I hope to get to meet it.  The idea, however, of people having to get three buses in order to reach their destination in town and to have disruption of train services, some of which I understand has been addressed due to the loss of three trains during peak hours in Portmarnock, is an indication that there needs to be greater consideration given to the services people already have.  There is the unfortunate history of this not being properly co-ordinated, with buses arriving after the train leaves and <i>vice versa<\/i>and with people being left hanging around.  There are more specific instances that I hope to raise with the Minister this afternoon.<\/p><p>I agree with others who spoke about cycling and the need to spend more money and expend more energy providing safe cycling lanes for people.  Many more people would cycle longer distances to work if it was safe to do so.  I come back to the issue of the greenways.  I hope the Minister for Finance will reflect the need for further investment in the greenways in the budget.  In the north Fingal area where we have a coastline with six or seven train stations and the whole of Dublin city on our doorstep, we could avail of safe cycling through very nice coastal greenways to the benefit of all concerned.

It is shocking to realise that there are thousands of children effectively detained in detention centres across Europe at present.  Only this morning, I saw reports on Euronews about a camp on the island of Lesbos called Moria.  It has a capacity for 3,000 people but currently has 9,000 in the camp.

I refer to a commercial pillar bank that will be brought in under the auspices of An Post, outside community and social banking, and all the profits will go to it.  The reason Bank of Ireland does not want to get into the post offices is because it got into the post offices in England and it will take billions of pounds to get the bank out, which the British people are trying to do.

Year on year, consumers can see huge increases in their premiums and it has now reached the stage where many are struggling to pay them.  I appreciate that many factors contribute to the rise in insurance costs.  One such factor is fraudulent claims, something we definitely we need to get a grip on.  It is unfair that someone can currently make a fraudulent claim and walk away from it scot-free.<\/p> <p>A second contributory issue is that of insurance payouts, which are four and a half times higher in this country than in the United Kingdom.  The average payout in Ireland amounts to &euro;21,000, compared to only &euro;4,000 in the United Kingdom; between &euro;2,500 and &euro;6,000 in Germany; and approximately &euro;1,500 in France.  I read a report recently which claimed that Ireland is the whiplash capital of Europe as apparently we have very high level of whiplash claims in this country.  I always thought that many Irish people had hard necks on them but these statistics would seem to prove otherwise.  The most recent statistics available to us show that whiplash accounts for approximately 80% of motor insurance claims in this country, as compared to just 3% in France.  The average payout for whiplash in Ireland is &euro;15,000, which is three times higher than in the United Kingdom and five times higher than either Italy or Spain.<\/p> <p>I appreciate that a report has been carried out on insurance costs and recommendations made.  Unfortunately we have yet to see many of those recommendations implemented.  I would like the Leader to arrange for the Minister to appear before the House to advise as to where the Government stands on these recommendations.  I am sure the Leader and all our constituents would agree that insurance is a serious issue and one that needs to be tackled now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#L00300","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>With regard to Storm Ali, I want to extend condolences to the families of those who tragically died in the storm.  Nothing can prepare one for the shock of dealing with a loss from such a seemingly random event.  There have been some criticisms of the Government, perhaps unfairly, that we were somehow unprepared for Storm Ali this week.  It has been reported that the T&aacute;naiste commented that the public was not prepared, that storm fatigue might have kicked in, and that if people do not see a red warning then they fail to sit up and take sufficient notice.  At first this comment might seem almost insensitive in the circumstances, but perhaps the T&aacute;naiste has touched on an issue here which needs to be addressed somehow.  It has struck me over the last year that there has been a proliferation of yellow and orange warnings issued by Met &Eacute;ireann, even during what seemed to be relatively innocuous weather events.  Perhaps the public has been lulled into a false sense of security when it does not see a red warning: life is expected to go on as normal and people go to work and so on.<\/p> <p>The fact that we have seen highly competent responses to Hurricane Ophelia and Storm Emma over the last 12 months may have also led to people mentally taking the foot off the pedal.  This would seem to be connected to a succession of strange weather events.  The yellow-orange-red warning system has been relatively new to us in the last 18 months or so.  With climate change becoming more of an issue, perhaps we need to a debate over how we are going to deal with weather events in the future.  Do we need to have systems in place that do not need to be kicked in in times of emergency only?  Could some further assessment be done on the current warning system to see if it can be refined or reclassified?  We certainly need to have a system in place so that there be no doubt in people&rsquo;s minds about the danger of a particular weather events, even at times when life must go on and we have not quite reached the threshold of being told to stay at home and batten down the hatches.   Speaking of orange areas, there are no grey areas when safety is an issue.  We need to look at what more we can do to ensure we all enter the mode of alertness we need if we are going to avoid unnecessary fatalities and injuries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#L00400","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I would like to pay tribute to members of the emergency services for their work during the brief storm yesterday and, of course, pass on my condolences to the families of those who tragically lost their lives.<\/p> <p>We have heard much talk in the media and elsewhere about the housing crisis and the challenges facing this country when it comes to dealing with people who find themselves without a home, as well as the thousands in middle Ireland who cannot afford to buy a home in Dublin.

It is right that we should respect our tradition, our heritage and our culture.  At the same time, however, we must allow property owners to get permission to build, extend and renovate buildings regardless of whether they are listed.  What is the point in having a listed building that is empty and where nothing is happening but where the owner of the building cannot afford to have something happen?  The owner cannot do so because the requirements, difficulties and challenges make it so expensive to comply with the various conservation officers in local authorities.

It is hard to believe such a loss could come while holidaying in such a scenic spot in Ireland.  I have two simple queries for the Leader.  We tend to see many items floated in the newspapers first but they have to find their legs somewhere.  The first query is on local property tax, LPT.  I see a big whip being bandied around about taking the power to set local property tax from local government.  I refer to the discretion in changing the tax up or down 15%.  I am curious to know if this was kite flying by the Government.  The threat to take that power from local government certainly seemed to come through those natural channels.  It was brought to my attention by Councillor Cormac Devlin yesterday at the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, meeting in Mullingar and I read the piece in question afterwards.  Many councillors had extreme concerns because it is one of the few hard powers that have been left with them.  That is one concern and I am curious to know if the Leader knows anything about it.<\/p> <p>Second, a document is to be released in the next couple of days with particular reference to the midlands.  Some people who are city-based might not be aware of it but the Leader and many of my colleagues present from country areas - at least outside the M50 - certainly are aware of the national planning framework and its intentions for rural Ireland.  I refer in particular to planning and the number of hubs and zones for development that are being examined.  What is going to be done to one-off planning and even planning in towns and villages is dramatic.  If the proposals under this new national planning framework come to fruition, there will be a change in the Irish way of life.  When the planning proposals are fully ventilated and people are aware of what is being proposed, I believe groups involved socially in rural Ireland such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA, the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and others will be vehemently against some of them.  <\/p> <p>That is because it is going to be the death knell of rural Ireland.  Anyone travelling through rural Ireland at present can see shops in villages and towns are closing in front of us.  I was listening to the radio coming in this morning.  I did not hear the full extent but a chap who was incapacitated and had come through an arduous journey in Ireland was speaking.  I did not get the full gist of the story on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 this morning but he mentioned how he was met with generosity in rural Ireland.  He also spoke about closures in towns and villages.  I suspect there will be a serious backlash in respect of the national planning framework if cognisance is not taken of rural Ireland and the people who intend to stay there and live the lives their forefathers have lived.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#M00200","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I thank the 16 Members of the House for their contributions to the Order of Business.

The concerns expressed by many Members in this House today have been articulated across the city of Dublin via the BusConnects consultation.  The reorganisation of the bus system in Dublin is definitely exercising people's minds, not least those of public representatives but also the citizen commuters who want to see their travel experience not diminished but increased or enhanced.

I made that point yesterday.  We have a situation in my native city of Cork around the M28 where, had the NTA and the local authority engaged in a meaningful way, I believe there would not have been half the confusion that arose.  It is important that people engage.  In my case, I am ware that Councillor Emer Higgins, Deputies Rock and Brophy and Senator Reilly all have had public meetings on this matter.  The bus redesign in our capital city is complex and, as Senator Reilly said, we cannot just go on a grid system in Dublin.  It will have a profound impact and I hope we will see a positive outcome.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, will be in the House today.<\/p> <p>I am smiling at Senator Humphreys making reference to the Minister's participation in the debate here.  It was one debate where he spoke for a number of minutes on the Rugby World Cup but he has been here many times and, to be fair to the Minister, he has never shied away from debating transport matters.  If we need to extend the Minister's time at the end, then the House can do so if that is the request and requirement.  On the issue of cycling raised by Senators Horkan and Grace O'Sullivan, the Government has allocated &euro;8 million to the cycling policy.  There has been &euro;100 million allocated in capital funding for cycling and walking infrastructure.  In Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, &euro;55 million has been allocated in greenways and the Government is dedicated to implementing a cycling policy and improving cycling infrastructure.  In tandem with that, it is important to recognise that the reduced speed limits in our urban areas will assist cyclists, as will the legislation on the minimum passing distances, as well as a commitment to the bike scheme and cycle lanes.  I agree that the overarching thrust must be and should be about increasing the amount of money to be spent on promoting cycling as an alternative to the car and public transport.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senators Horkan, Conway and Colm Burke raised the issue of housing.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will come to the House in the coming weeks to discuss the matter of housing.  I will be happy to have him come to the House on that matter.<br\/><br\/>Senators Horkan and Feighan made reference to the issue of Brexit.  The news today from Salzburg, while not unexpected, is nonetheless disappointing because we do not seem to have any further progress.  A deal on Brexit, as we all know, is desirable and is what we want as a country.  It is a very important time for us as a small island nation which will be most affected.  We will be affected by Brexit, North and South.  It is fair to say that much has been agreed already but the issue of Ireland is the major one.  I commend the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and particularly the T&aacute;naiste and Minister, Deputy Coveney, on their work.  I commend the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the issue of Brexit and all involved.  We should not forget that the <i>status quo<\/i>that exists today will not be the<i>status quo<\/i>of the future.  A good deal on Brexit will not allow us to have what we have now.  We need to prepare ourselves for that.  It is not a case that we can click our fingers and Brexit will disappear.  There will be consequences.  We will feel an effect from Brexit no matter what happens.  We need to condition ourselves to understand that change will occur as a consequence of Brexit.  Those who think it will not are misguided.  There will be profound changes as a result of Brexit.  We do not agree with the vote in the United Kingdom and we will be affected the most by it.  We need to acknowledge that Brexit will have a profound impact.  As the Minister, Deputy Creed, said recently, it is a negative net gain.  There are no positives in it.  We need to make ourselves aware of that.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Craughwell made reference to the issue of the Defence Forces.  Yesterday the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, was here to address Senator McFadden's Commencement matter.  The Minister of State with responsibility for defence, Deputy Kehoe, has been very proud and proactive in his defence and support of members of our Defence Forces.  He has always come to the House to debate matters regarding defence.  That is why the Government has initiated the Public Service Pay Commission and why it is in the process of restoring pay and reversing the cuts that were introduced during the economic recession.  It is fair to say that the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, of all the Ministers who have served in the Department, understands and values the role of our Defence Forces.  It is demonstrated by his visits to Army barracks and to troops overseas.  That is in addition to the Minister, Deputy Coveney's, commitment in the Mediterranean.  That is why the Government set up the Public Service Pay Commission.  Senator Craughwell made reference to the Public Service Pay Commission's submission.  If Senator Craughwell took time, he would realise that like all public sector deals that submission will be published as part of the report.  When the report is published, it will be clear for all to see what has been submitted and agreed.  The outcome must be to enhance the pay and conditions of members of the Defence Forces.  I look forward to the report being published in due course.<br\/><br\/>Senators Craughwell and Conway-Walsh raised the issue of the drug Spinraza and the presentation in the AV room by young people who have spinal muscular atrophy.  It is a matter that is stressful for the families and the children affected.  They face profound challenges that some of us here can only imagine.  It is a progressive and life-limiting condition.  The NCP has conducted a full pharmacoeconomic evaluation and has not recommended the reimbursement but there is an application with the HSE.  I hope there will be a positive outcome in the case.  I am a former Chairman of the Oireachtas health committee which held hearings on rare diseases.  Perhaps a case could be made to the Minister for this drug to be considered under the orphan drugs scheme.  I understand and acknowledge the stress and difficulties that arise and which these families and children face every day.  I hope there will be a positive outcome.  I thank the families for being here today and apologise that I could not be at the briefing this morning.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of the presidential election.  I wish all candidates, of whatever hue, well, whether they are Independent, party or non-party.  The local authorities are correct to invoke their powers to nominate candidates.  I hope all who want to run can get a nomination to run and that we can have an election in which everyone can participate so that they can all be part of the debate.  Senator Conway-Walsh made reference to the debate.  Let us have the debate whatever it contains.  What we must do is ensure the election is a fair and democratic one and that it is done in a manner which is respectful of each candidate's position and personality and I hope that happens.<br\/><br\/>Senator Murnane O'Connor referred to the success of our eventing team.  I join with her in congratulating our eventing team on their silver medal.  It was a fantastic weekend for Irish sport.  Sam Watson, Cathal Daniels and Padraig McCarthy were joined in their success by the O'Donovan brothers and Sanita Puspure in the rowing.  It shows the importance of the Government's support and of our support, as a nation, in putting value on sport.  Sport is a great unifier and it brings great joy.  It can bring heartbreak but when we see the successes of eventing and our rowers it augurs well.  I congratulate the ladies of Dublin on winning the All-Ireland ladies' football last weekend.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach will join with me in congratulating Cork on winning the camogie All-Ireland.<br\/><br\/>When Senator Murnane-O'Connor comes into the House I am not sure if she is trying to provoke me with her contributions but I remind her that nine out of every ten new jobs created in the past 12 months were outside Dublin.  The Action Plan for Rural Development is committed to ensuring the economic recovery is felt throughout Ireland and the creation of rural jobs is vital in order to achieve this.  In the region in which Senator Murnane-O'Connor lives and which she represents, 19,851 jobs were created last year by foreign companies.  It is the third consecutive year of strong growth.  We have seen more than 210,443 people employed through foreign direct investment in our country.  Some people would not want any jobs or investment from abroad but 210,443 people have been employed by FDI companies in our country.  In the regions, Senator Murnane O'Connor should know there was a 9% growth in the south east, where she is from, which amounts to 14,918 people in total employment.  We should recognise there is employment happening and the Government is committed to the growth of the regions.  It links to Senator Davitt's point.  The national planning framework will be about improving the lives of people in rural Ireland.  It is about ensuring that rural Ireland is habitable and that people can be employed and live there.  The challenge we face in terms of shops closing is not only a rural Ireland one; it is an urban problem too.  It is part of the modern word in which we live.  If one listened to the debate yesterday on the post office network, it is a challenge we see in our post offices that has to be faced.  A similar issue arises if one looks at our banking system.  I will come back to Senator O'Donnell's comments in a minute.  I appeal to the banks not to take people out of the banks in any part of the country.  It beggars belief that we are now going into banks where there are no tellers or staff but only a machine.  It is wrong and should not be allowed to continue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Senator Marshall raised the issue of the National Ploughing Championships and their benefits, as well as the benefits to rural Ireland.

The importance of farming and agriculture to our country is well noted by Government and the industry is a priority for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. <\/p><p>I join Senator Feighan in congratulating the nations involved in the bid for the 2030 World Cup.  I hope it is successful.  It would be a fantastic achievement for the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, and for Ireland. <\/p><p>Senator Gavan raised the important issue of migration, in particular in the Moria camp, about which he is correct.  Where are European values when it comes to dealing with people who are displaced and dispossessed and living in migrant camps?  We have a duty and an obligation to highlight the inadequacies and the anomalies in that system, but also to be a harbour of welcome for people.  I congratulate the Senator for raising the matter. <\/p><p>I thank Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell for her work on end-of-life care.  Last week, the Irish hospice movement held a number of visible events around the country concerning end-of-life care.  People like Mr. Bryan Nolan deserve huge credit, praise and gratitude for the work they are doing, their language and the way in which they engage with people.  The Senator is so right.  I do not mean to be patronising, but it is about language and communication.  I heard a nice interview on \"Today with Sean O'Rourke\" last week.  People said that if they talked about the issue, they felt they were bringing a curse on themselves.  They did not want to talk about death and end-of-life care.  It is something that is before us all, as the Senator said, and we must plan for end-of-life care.

We will bring him back before the House to discuss the issue of banking.  It is about the post office network expanding its range of services and its remit.  I am not sure what the Minister has in mind and whether that will include community or social banking.  We will have him back in due course to discuss the matter. <\/p> <p>I join Senator Burke in welcoming the increase in construction and availability of student accommodation throughout the country.  The Senator is correct; we are only now playing catch-up in building student accommodation adjacent to our universities and institutes of technology, which we should have done at the beginning.  That is now taking place across our university towns and cities.<\/p> <p>The issue concerning coroners and a database of bodies is important.  Senator Burke's Bill addresses this in part, but it is something on which we need to keep a vigilant eye.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of insurance costs.  Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns commented as chairperson of the Personal Injuries Commission that payments have gotten out of hand and we are paying out an inordinate amount.  He is perhaps right in that regard.  The judicial council legislation containing guidelines for personal injuries is a priority for the Government.  We need to have a conversation on personal injury payouts.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, has been instrumental in coming into the House and updating us on the cost of insurance and the work of the cost of insurance working group, which has published six quarterly reports.  Of the 71 deadlines, 58 were met.  One of the key actions was the delivery of the final report of the commission, which I hope will be the launch pad for further reform.  The implementation of that recommendation should have an impact on the awarding of personal injury damages in the future.  Moreover, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, data for August 2018 show that motor insurance premia have decreased by 20% since their peak in 2016.  They are still too high, but we are taking action. <\/p> <p>Senator Mullen raised the issue of Storm Ali and notifications.  It is an interesting discussion to have.  The T&aacute;naiste made reference to fatigue.  Perhaps it is now the case that when people hear a storm warning, they do not take it too seriously.  I heard an interview on the radio earlier in which someone said that the only status red alert was for part of County Mayo because that was Met &Eacute;ireann's information.  To be fair to Met &Eacute;ireann, it takes its role seriously.  The national directorate for fire and emergency management has monitored the weather situation with Met &Eacute;ireann and its members met on Tuesday to assess the impact of the storm.  Some 17 counties were issued with a status orange storm alert.  That came into effect on Tuesday evening and ended at 1 p.m. yesterday.  It is worth noting that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government only convenes the national emergency co-ordination group for severe weather events on the advice given to him.  The Taoiseach was criticised for being at the front and centre of the response to Storm Ophelia.  When he was not there for Storm Ali, he was also criticised.  I do not say that Senator Mullen is doing that.  It is important that we have moved to a coded alert system.  People should take note of it.  The important point is that we should always take notice of what is being asked of us.  Again, we offer our sympathies to the families bereaved during the storm.  <\/p> <p>Senator Conway raised the issue of housing.  The points he makes are valid.<\/p> <p>Senator Davitt is flying kites regarding property tax.

At that launch, I was accompanied by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, who generously gave her time to lead a panel discussion on the topic.  Something particularly interesting which the Senator expertly drew from those panel members was the connections that exist across the different sectors.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is that emphasis on the bigger picture that Project Ireland 2040 seeks to focus upon.  We need to focus on the bigger picture because Ireland is changing and will continue to change during the next ten years and beyond.  We will have more people, more jobs, more commuters and more tourists.<\/p><p>It is not just Ireland, but Europe and the world is changing too.  Some of these changes are positive; others are challenging, but either way we cannot ignore them.  That is the reason we need to plan now for the challenges of tomorrow.  However, it is not just about tomorrow.  We already face challenges today in meeting the demand for public transport services, in improving our roads network, in providing the facilities needed for increasing numbers of tourists and in encouraging and funding greater participation in sport.<\/p><p>Some of these challenges stem from reduced investment during the period of economic and financial crisis.  The first priority is to return to what is called the \"steady-state\" funding level, which is the investment levels we need to ensure the services and infrastructure we have today are appropriately maintained.  Then we need to address the challenges we face because of our growing economy, such as the problems with congestion in our cities and towns and capacity issues on our public transport services.  We need to lay the groundwork for the future and start planning and delivering the projects we need for the future in an integrated way.  That is what we are seeking to achieve during the lifetime of this national development plan, NDP.<\/p><p>We will do this by linking people and places in the national, international and social spheres.  In terms of linking our cities and regions, we have ambitious plans for both public transport and our road network.  A greener and expanded public transport network will add greatly to the choice and experience of the travelling public, improve quality of life, ease congestion in our cities and help to deliver a low carbon society.<\/p><p>We have already started to increase the size of our bus fleets and expand services.  We are planning to invest in greener and cleaner buses and roll out BusConnects across all our major cities, starting in Dublin.  Many Senators who are interested in BusConnects in their home areas have asked questions and I am very happy to address this.  I think it is more appropriate if I do it at the end because I will have the advantage of having heard what most of the Members have to say.<\/p><p>BusConnects will help develop sustainable, living cities for families and communities and will support economic growth and jobs.  It will deliver new and improved bus services and corridors, faster journey times, next generation ticketing and cycle lanes to remove conflict between road traffic and cyclists.  I acknowledge the difficulties that people have encountered in their areas in some case and I hope to address them in any way possible.<\/p><p>Alongside this we are funding cycling and walking networks across the country, building on the investment of more than &euro;110 million to develop cycling and walking infrastructure in all our cities during the next four years.  In addition the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and I recently published a new greenway strategy, which sets out a framework by which we can develop more of these wonderful cycling and walking attractions in rural areas around the country.  In the way there are links between the national planning framework and the national development plan, we will back up this policy framework for greenways with a committed funding programme.  Some &euro;53 million will be invested in greenway infrastructure between 2019 and 2021.  Last week we opened up the application process and invited interested parties to make an application to access that funding programme.  Together with improved bus and cycling infrastructure, the NDP will fund improvements in the national rail network too; improving connections across the country and between North and South.  We are also examining the role that an extension to the western rail corridor can play in the Atlantic economic corridor.<\/p><p>In addition to these initiatives, we are also funding the construction of MetroLink.  This will provide faster, reliable journey times to and from key destinations such as Swords, Dublin Airport, DCU, Ballymun and the Mater Hospital, while offering interchanges with other public transport services.  We also will expand the DART network by providing additional carriages, improving signalling and extending electrification across the network to provide better services.<\/p><p>Those improvements have facilitated the introduction this month of the new ten-minute all-day service across the DART network.  That level of service effectively means people can just walk up to their local station without the need to look at any timetable.  The next step will be to provide fast, high-frequency electrified DART services to Drogheda, Celbridge-Hazelhatch and Maynooth.  In addition, new DART stations will provide interchange with bus, Luas and metro networks.  Building on the success of Luas and recent extensions, including Luas cross city, we have started a process of adding an additional 27% capacity to the Luas green line through lengthening existing trams and platforms.  The route for the remaining element of the DART expansion programme -  the DART underground tunnel - will of course be established and protected to allow for its future delivery.<\/p><p>We need to increase funding for the 100,000 km of roads around the country.  The sheer scale of our road network is not well known but it is actually twice the European average per head of population.  That is a lot of road.  The road network is the workhorse of our economic and social infrastructure.  Most of our freight is carried by road, all of our bus services rely on the road network and our regional and local roads are essential in linking communities across the country.  We need to restore funding to the levels required to appropriately maintain, renew and improve the road network as it is today.  Most importantly, Project Ireland 2040 provides the framework for that funding.<\/p><p>In terms of new schemes, the NDP lists 23 national road schemes that already are at planning, design or construction stages.  One of those is the long-awaited strategic road link between Cork and Limerick.  Another 20 national road projects have been identified by Transport Infrastructure Ireland for pre-appraisal and early planning work with a view to developing a pipeline of projects suitable for future development.  At a regional and local level, another 13 significant road improvement projects are currently being advanced under the NDP.  All of these schemes will better link local communities, reduce congestion and contribute to the local economy in their areas.<\/p><p>It is not just about linking our cities and regions.  We also need to build better links with the wider world.  That is why the investment planned by our State airports and ports is so important.  We are providing additional capacity at Dublin Airport through the new north runway and work is already under way on this by the DAA.  Complementing that investment, a new control tower, which will facilitate operations on the new runway is under construction by the Irish Aviation Authority.<\/p><p>Both Shannon and Cork airports are looking to sustainably grow their businesses into the future through targeted investment programmes and working with stakeholders to improve their offering.  The role of the smaller regional airports is recognised in the national development plan and there will be continued Exchequer support for safety and security projects.  All these projects will improve our links with the wider world and help to sustain and grow trade and tourism.<\/p><p>As an island, we need our ports to plan for the future.  In that regard I am happy to say there is a significant investment programmes under way in all our tier 1 ports of national significance.  Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes each has projects under construction that will help improve efficiency, connectivity and capacity.  This is important because all of our ports of national significance, whether it is the three tier 1 ports or Rosslare and Waterford in their role as tier 2 ports of national significance, have a crucial role to play in maintaining our trade and tourism connections with Europe and beyond as the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.  The State is supporting those investments through improved access to our international gateways.<\/p><p>I already have referred to MetroLink which will better connect Dublin Airport with the city centre, while the national development plan has details of a range of road projects to improve access to our ports of national significance.  These include the M11 to Rosslare, the N28 to Ringaskiddy in Cork and N69 to Foynes.<\/p><p>The national development plan is also about linking with one another and with visitors to our country, including through tourism, where we are looking to support and grow the industry across Ireland.<\/p><p>The tourism sector will benefit from the planned investment in both national and international transport links across the country, which I have already outlined.  The NDP commits almost &euro;108 million to F&aacute;ilte Ireland between now and 2021 and states that this level of investment will, at a minimum, be maintained out to 2027.  Priority areas for this investment include the development and enhancement of tourist attractions and activity-based tourism to provide the type and quality of experience that visitors are seeking.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We will use the investment to support and grow tourism in rural communities, in line with the further development and promotion of the regional tourism brand experiences - the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Ireland's Hidden Heartlands - which leverage the appeal of Ireland's natural, cultural and heritage offering.  NDP investment in tourism throughout the country comes with the added benefit that the new or enhanced attractions and activities will increase the attractiveness of local areas not just as places to visit but also as places to live, work or invest in.<\/p><p>We are increasing investment at all levels of sport from the grassroots to the elite, with a view to increasing participation and improving facilities.  The Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and I published a new national sports policy in July.  The policy sets out our vision for sport over the next ten years and provides the policy backdrop to the investments that are planned under the NDP.  Since then, we have announced a new round of the sports capital programme, which will make &euro;40 million available to support the development of sports infrastructure in communities across the State.  The NDP also commits to the establishment of a new large-scale sports infrastructure fund, which will be available to larger projects when the proposed Government contribution exceeds the amount available under the sports capital programme.  At least &euro;100 million will be provided under the new fund, which is designed to provide a more structured approach for this funding.  The full terms and conditions of the new scheme are nearing finalisation.  We will open the fund for applications in the coming months.<\/p><p>We are continuing our investment in the development of the Sport Ireland national sports campus.  It was a wonderful summer of sporting achievement for Ireland, with highlights such as the silver medal for the women's hockey team and the hosting of the European para swimming championships at the National Aquatic Centre.  I am pleased that many of our successful athletes are based at the national sports campus.  The Government's continued investment will ensure our athletes have access to world-class training facilities in Ireland.  The NDP commits &euro;42 million to fund the completion of a national indoor arena and a national velodrome and badminton centre at the campus.  The construction of the second phase of the national indoor arena is well under way and the arena is due for completion next year.  This covered facility will ensure our elite athletes and teams can train in training facilities that are always open all year round.  The national velodrome and badminton centre is expected to be completed by 2021.  It will consist of a 250 m cycling track with badminton courts in the track infill area.  The development of the campus will not stop there.  Sport Ireland is reviewing the master plan for the campus in consultation with the sporting bodies.  The review will guide the development of a ten-year strategic vision for the campus, which will be aligned with wider Government capital planning, as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p><p>I would like to conclude by acknowledging that Project Ireland 2040 sets out a vision for the future that is ambitious in its scale.  We need to be ambitious if we are going to build a better Ireland that addresses the demands of today, meets the challenges of tomorrow and is a place that we, our children and our grandchildren are proud to call home.  The investment committed by the Government under Project Ireland 2040 for the transport, tourism and sport sectors will help to ensure they play their part in realising that ambition and delivering for citizens.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators.  I thank the House again for the invitation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#O01000","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

I am reminded of Joe Stalin in Russia.  When things were not going too well in Russia, Joe would announce a five-year plan with all guns blazing and trumpets blaring.

This Government definitely takes the biscuit.  Joe Stalin would be impressed by the methodology here.  Anyway, we have a chance to discuss this plan.  It seems to me that transport is one of the few areas in which we are unambitious as we seek to project into the future.  If we are going to address the very serious problems in this country's transport infrastructure, we need better planning, better forecasting and more joined-up thinking.  Our transport infrastructure is haphazard, dysfunctional and anything but joined-up.  This will not come as any surprise to the Minister.  When I was perusing a number of his <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>columns, which were written when he was a Member of this House some years ago, I noted that he was scathing about aspects of our public services, especially our public transport system.  He wrote about the structure of that system and about the involvement of unions, for example.

I regularly use all modes of public and private transport with the exception of the DART.  It is fair enough to say that none of them is up to scratch.  None of them has the confidence of the paying public.  None of them seems to be equipped to serve the needs of Ireland into the future.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the much-needed investment in Ireland's transport infrastructure, which is creaking at the seams.  A strong public transport system is the backbone of any strong economy, but Ireland is seriously flagging in this regard.  Our transport system is completely unfit for purpose and our road network is experiencing similar capacity issues.<\/p> <p>The core question I must ask about Project Ireland 2040, which is an ambitious plan, relates to delivery.  The Government and its predecessor have failed to deliver key infrastructural projects in a timely or efficient manner.  We cannot allow another Luas cross-city debacle to grind our capital city to a halt.  There is an ongoing underspend issue in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  In 2016, there was a capital underspend of &euro;6 million as a result of delays and the non-completion of scheduled projects.  Chronic underinvestment is at the heart of the problem.  Years of underinvestment by this Government and its predecessor have left us in big trouble.  While budget 2018 resulted in a large increase in the capital budget for land transport, in the context of what is needed the increase is no more than a drop in the ocean, particularly as we are coming from a low base.  Over the past five years, Ireland has been one of the lowest net spenders on transport infrastructure in the EU.  Capital investment in transport of &euro;7 billion for the period from 2018 to 2021 is a huge 23% lower than our capital investment in transport between 2007 and 2010, when my party was last in government.  The huge backlog of work that has built up throughout Ireland's capital infrastructure is now posing a considerable safety concern.  The Minister cannot be happy about the crisis in the public service system.  I refer, for example, to the measly 8% increase in expenditure on the public service obligation.<\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il has proposed that a new national infrastructure commission be established and tasked with planning ahead, beyond the limited five-year cycle of current capital plans.  This would be set up by reforming Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and would draw from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the National Transport Authority, NTA, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and the local authorities.  The new commission would be responsible for setting out a new framework for the development of transport in Ireland over the coming years.  It would be tasked with overseeing long-term plans for the achievement of a series of targets: securing infrastructure investment of 4% of GDP, facilitating decarbonisation in Ireland, developing a strong transport network with balanced regional development, making Ireland an IT nation with telecommunications connectivity and providing for a balanced and secure energy mix.  In our time in government, huge investment was made in capital infrastructure.  I refer, for example, to the peak-level investment in infrastructure in 2008 under the most recent Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  Under this funding, we were able to deliver crucial projects, including the development of the Dublin Port tunnel, the creation of the Luas, the construction of hundreds of kilometres of top-notch motorways and the overhaul of the Irish Rail fleet.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While we talk about the future, I always say that politics is now and politics is local.  I am in my 12th year in this august House and when I started coming up by train from Charleville, there was not even a method whereby elderly people could traverse the platforms without climbing up rickety steel stairs with their suitcases.  I raised it here innumerable times and the former Cathaoirleach, the late Rory Kiely, who I assume the Minister knew well, and I waged a campaign and I was delighted when I saw a proper lift system going in place about three years ago.  That is the reality of how long it takes to get something done.  I had to get off a train in Clonmel recently - a fairly sizable town, one of the biggest in Munster, to find that there was no public toilet in the railway station and that patrons had to go out across the street and ask for the key to avail of the facilities of a small supermarket.  It is no harm to drop these real things into the debate and get our feet back on the ground.  I urge the Minister to nail down investment in transport.  I expect him to fight in Cabinet to secure the necessary funding to secure a modern, efficient system that is fit for purpose.  In this he will have the support of the people and he will also have the support of Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#Q00600","speaker":"1394","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister here today.  This is a timely debate.  I congratulate the Minister also on his script because with the exception of the development at the National Sports Campus there is not a single time or date commitment mentioned anywhere.  This worries me as a general proposition because it is easy to talk about things it is intended to do between now and 2040, but when will these things be done, how will they be done, what will they cost and will we get good value for money?  These are the issues with which I am primarily concerned.  I heard what Senator Ned O'Sullivan said about national rail and transport infrastructure and I agree with that.  I hope the Minister will forgive me if I look at the issues which arise for discussion today slightly from a Dublin perspective.<\/p> <p>First, I note he Minister's speech mentions the MetroLink project and I was struck by former Senator Sean Barrett's speech to the Dublin Economics Workshop, in which he developed the proposition at length that there has been no cost-benefit analysis for the MetroLink project.  The vaguest statements have been made about it but a cost-benefit analysis has not yet been published.  It should be done but more fundamental than that is that the alternatives to it should have been considered in some form of public dialogue and that never happened.  I note that the Minister, for instance in his contribution today, speaks about the Luas green line - which goes right past my garden so it is a thing which I have always supported and of which I am strongly in favour.  The Minister stated it is intended to increase the capacity on that line by 27% by lengthening platforms and lengthening tram sets.  That is a good idea, which I favour, but if the platforms on the Luas green line are to be lengthened let us remember that the MetroLink project, as it was explained to representatives of the Oireachtas, including me, Senator Humphreys and other people, involves a different form of platform, a different metro system, perhaps driverless trains and entirely different stations.  Consequently, are we spending money now on extending the capacity of the Luas green line at this stage in pursuit of one strategy, while at the same time preparing for a MetroLink which will go the whole way to Sandyford and which will involve the radical transformation of all of the stations on the intervening line?  I refer to the raising of their height to accommodate the kind of trains it is envisaged will run on them and the destruction of all of the existing platforms, including the extended platforms to which the Minister refers.  Which are we doing?  What is our plan?<\/p> <p>It is the case, and I remember it from my time in government, that the Luas green line as it is now called, was planned with a view to its incorporation into a metro system at the time.  That was a possibility but it was not done at the time and it was left aside.  Bodies such as Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann came up with alternative schemes for different metro configurations in Dublin, including an east-west link between Heuston Station, Pearse Station, Connolly Station and the like.  One thing that we should remember is that we committed &euro;368 million to the construction of the cross city Luas and if the MetroLink project, as currently envisaged and as is currently out for consideration for public consultation is proceeded with, the Luas green line will effectively cease to exist.  It will connect Charlemont station with Broombridge on one tram service and an entirely separate tram service from Sandyford to Bride's Glen on the other side.  I want some answers to these questions.  Why are we extending the platforms for trams when we know that we will be digging all of those platforms up and putting a high vehicle platform system in place if we are going to construct the MetroLink the whole way to Sandyford?  I note the Minister's speech did not mention connecting the MetroLink the whole way to Sandyford.  He talks about the city centre and Dublin Airport and I can see that there would have been a logic if a metro system was to be built from source to the city centre, to leave it at that and to have interconnectivity with the expanded green line Luas service, with longer trams and to stop the idea of trying to break up the Luas green line service into three separate components, one of which is the Broombridge to Charlemont section, the other of which is the portion of the metro which runs from Charlemont to Sandyford which would be a high speed train operation and then reverting to a tram system between Sandyford and Brides Glen.  This is not joined-up thinking and the cross city Luas would not have been built had it been intended to also serve places such as O'Connell Street with the MetroLink project.  We will have two stations on St. Stephen's Green and two more on O'Connell Street.  All of this money would not have been spent in that way if we had a clear view at that time when we authorised the construction of the cross city Luas, that MetroLink or something like it was in the pipeline.<\/p> <p>I return to the fundamental point, namely the absolute necessity for the publication of a clear, unequivocal and convincing cost-benefit analysis for such an investment.  I ask again why it is the case, if the capacity of the green line will be expanded by lengthening platforms and tram sets - which I fully support - we are also pursuing a different strategy, namely, to install a high vehicle train system on a portion of that line that will involve the destruction of all of the newly expanded platforms and the like and their replacement with a very different system which the engineers in the National Transport Authority have in mind?  If possible, I ask that at some stage, before we go further with all of these projects, the Minister will publish the detailed cost-benefit analysis for the MetroLink project.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important that the public, and particularly the Dublin public, are given a fair and reasonable estimate of the duration for which the entire Luas green line will be out of commission if this goes ahead.  It was suggested to myself and Senator Humphreys that the everything would be done in six months, which is laughable.  It was then admitted that however long it took to construct it, there would be a further three months for commissioning it.  The truth is that between 12 and 24 months is a much more likely timeframe for the temporary abolition of the Luas green line service. <br\/><br\/>Today the <i>The Times, <\/i>Ireland edition features a plea from cyclists for the investment of significant sums to make a cycling-friendly city.  It is an area on which the Minister's Department and Dublin City Council should now concentrate.  Dublin is not a hilly area and it could benefit greatly from the use of bicycles but most parents and people of my age fear going out on bicycles in city centre traffic.  There are not enough dedicated thoroughfares for the use of bicycles.  There needs to be a significant rethink of the commitment of the city council, which is the most relevant local authority, and the Minister's Department to making a major contribution to building new cycleways, new bridges across the canal, opening up old laneways, and dedicated ways of getting around Dublin by bike, which is unthreatened by heavy vehicles and traffic dangers.  I welcome the Minister's paper today.  It is short on specifics and I would like a clear picture of the Luas green line cost-benefit analysis and the project, as he has not mentioned it in detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#R00200","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate.  I welcome Project Ireland 2040.  I refer briefly to Senator Ned O'Sullivan who spoke of a plan, and a further plan and Joseph Stalin.  My view has always been that any plan is better than no plan, although I want it to be a good plan.  The Senator spoke of the investment by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government during the early noughties, which I acknowledge, but he also mentioned how planning went belly up in Joseph Stalin's era.  The Senator's memory might be questionable in this regard.  The Minister adverted to this himself in the sense that we are playing catch up because of under-investment as a result of the economic crash, which was challenging in itself.  This plan gives us a pathway to provide a modern, efficient transport infrastructure throughout the country and an efficient system of connectivity within our congested cities.  I defer to my Dublin colleagues on many of the issues raised, though I have a query which I will raise later regarding metro north, but I am more aware of what is happening in Galway.  Prior to having any involvement in politics, I recall hearing about this ring road in Galway city in 2000 that was being held up by the bats in Moycullen.  How near are we to having that bypass which is vital to opening up Connemara to tourism and so on.  <\/p> <p>There is an urgent need to open up the regions with modern infrastructure.  I refer again to Senator O'Sullivan's contribution.  Many projects were cancelled or stopped in 2007 or 2008 because of the crash.  I welcome the recent completion of the Gort to Tuam motorway, the N17.  This needs to be connected to Sligo and the north west and the N4 and N5.  There has been great increase in air connectivity and in the numbers of passengers coming through the three State airports, particularly Dublin where a second runway is proposed.  As a rural representative, I welcome the acknowledgment in this plan of the important part played by regional airports in the economic recovery and its sustenance.  Reference is made to Kerry and Waterford airports and so on, but I would highlight Ireland West Airport Knock.  I was chair of a study group there that recommended investment of &euro;36.5 million in projects, including the overlaying of the runway and the apron, as well as its designation as a strategic development zone.  The airport is as crucial to the west and north west as Dublin airport is to the eastern region.  I welcome the support that has been given on this and urge that it continue.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister's acknowledgement of the importance of developing the regions.  He noted he was examining the role that an extension to the western rail corridor could play in the Atlantic economic corridor, which is crucial.  Will he elaborate on that?<\/p> <p>Regarding metro north, I was a part of a transport committee delegation that visited Na Fianna GAA club and other areas on the proposed route prior to the summer recess.  Consultation is ongoing on that but club representatives contacted the committee again recently.  They say that, despite media reports of resolution, there has been no formal agreement with TII or any other body and the concerns about the impact and scope of the project in the community remain.  Will the Minister update us on that?<\/p> <p>The Minister mentioned the state-of-the-art sports campus.  I congratulate everybody involved.  As someone who has been passionately involved in sport over the years and who understands the needs of elite athletes and the supports they require, the campus is an example of what can be done when there is co-operation between all the sports governing bodies, Sport Ireland and the Department.  I very much welcome it.  I have visited it on many occasions and used it for sporting activities.  It is a great advertisement for the country and demonstrates what can be done.   The results in various sports recently have been brilliant and long may they continue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#S00200","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on behalf of Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In respect of transport, I refer first to the recent revelation published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that, in 2011, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, blocked EU funding for infrastructural projects in the west and north west.  The revelation proved the intention of this Government, and previous Governments, to concentrate economic growth and development in the eastern region.  The upgrade of road and rail networks, that has long been recognised by community and business groups as vital for the sustainability of the regions, were removed from the plans with the blame directed towards the EU.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes this is a scandalous revelation.  All of the spin, even in overdrive, by the strategic communications unit could not hide the betrayal of rural regions by the Taoiseach.<br\/><br\/>The programme for Government contained a commitment to seek a review of the Irish trans-European transport network or TEN-T projects by the European Union within the first three months of government.  I understand this review has not been carried out.  The TEN-T funding for major transport projects that have a positive carbon reduction impact can be in excess of 50% and up to 75%, yet the Government refused to use the opportunity to invest in rural regions.  Some weeks ago Sinn F&eacute;in asked the Taoiseach why the western rail project was not included in the much published 2040 plan.  We were told that the project did not meet the criteria contained in a cost-to-benefit survey.  Again, I suggest his reply is merely further spin.  A freight and passenger western rail project would open up the parts of the country that have the most potential for development.  It would transport goods to ports in the south of the country that export directly to European markets.  Obviously exporting directly to mainland Europe is becoming more part of the conversation.  This is the time for a real change in direction in terms of investment in our ports, airports, roads, modern rail and broadband services along the west, in the midlands and across the Border.  This episode shows the finances can be found and all professional analysis shows that the return to the economy would be enormous, thus leading to sustainable social balance.<br\/><br\/>I ask the Minister to urgently prioritise a plan to engage with the city councils of both Dublin and Belfast on the memorandum of understanding that includes the development of an hourly high-speed rail link between both cities.  The former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade stated that the project would be a priority for Government.  Any plan to link Ireland, its people and places must span all of Ireland and defy the illogical, incoherent and self-defeating harm of operating on a partitionist basis only.  Ireland works best when we work together. <br\/><br\/>On sport and cycling, I have resumed cycling to Leinster House with the resumption of the sittings and I find the commute frustrating.  I used to experience road rage when I drove my car in this city but now I experience road rage when I cycle to work on my bike.  My rage is not directed at anyone else on the road but stems from the poor network of cycle lanes.  I cycle from the Luas red line stop at Blackhorse to the Suir Road, navigate a pedestrian crossing and some vacant land and then I encounter the Luas line at Rialto Park.  Thankfully, I can then quietly cycle around the Guinness brewery and on into Pimlico and Meath Street.  There is a good cycle route from Blackhorse to the Suir Road and along the canal.  Unfortunately, it seems that the plan for the Luas lines did not take cyclists into consideration and provide two cycle lanes along the track.  If some areas can be patched up, then two cycles lanes could be provided but sadly, such ambition does not appear to be present.  When one reaches Meath Street one must go left and swing back up on to St. James's Street.  The one-way routes around the city are completely designed for car use, which frustrates cyclists.  I break the rules and cycle towards-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#S00300","speaker":"1372","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in has never been good with rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#T00200","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I have been trained well.

It is always nice to have the senior Minister in a Department here to discuss something, particularly something as far ranging as this development plan, Project Ireland 2040.  In common with other speakers, particularly Senator O'Mahony, I believe that it is important to plan.  For too long we have done things in a hip-hop way.  Long-term planning is very important.  I agree with Senator McDowell that plans need a timeframe.  It is okay to write a plan on paper but it is vitally important to set targets for what we want to achieve.<\/p> <p>When the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, was the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, he produced the Action Plan for Jobs that stipulated targets for every year.  He was accountable and people were accountable if targets were not reached.  It is important to outline targets because otherwise things lapse.  The key point is to have finance in place on a long-term basis and, therefore, to succeed we need a stable economy.  I always cite Germany as a model because it does not have boom and bust cycles.  As a result the German Government can make long-term plans for infrastructural projects because it knows the money will come in on a regular basis.  Unfortunately, Ireland has experienced boom-and-bust cycles on a regular basis and, therefore, cannot plan for the long term.  Ireland, from an economic perspective, is at the wrong end of a cycle.  During the bust part, we should invest in infrastructure and during the boom part we should save for the next bust.  As usual, we make a mess of things here but that is not the fault of Fine Gael.  The fault usually lies with Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael is left to clean up the mess.  <\/p> <p>Let me refer to planning.  In 1983, my mother opened the first motorway in Ireland, the M7, which is also known as the Naas bypass, along with Dick Spring.  The great thing is that the original plan ensured there was enough capacity for three lanes of traffic.  The motorway is being widened at the moment and, therefore, none of the bridges must be changes or moved as a result of such forward planning.  Almost 40 years later, the original infrastructure can be utilised to create a third lane.  That is an example of good planning.  I urge the Minister to ensure that when a Luas line or new road network is being designed that it is future proofed in order that the infrastructure can be utilised in 40, 50 or 60 years' time, thus ensuring that we do not have to build something new. <\/p> <p>I am sure the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is well aware that the M7 and Sallins bypass are being upgraded.  When towns and major hubs are being developed, people should support whatever is needed to provide the infrastructure for ring roads to be built around towns.  We must allow planners to design towns so that they have the correct infrastructure to facilitate the population of towns in 20 and 30 years' time, rather than the current five-year plans.  I am pushing hard for Naas to get an exterior ring road, for example.  At least there is a line on the map now.  A feasibility study must be conducted to ensure that in 20 years' time, there is a potential to build the road.  I urge everyone to plan for the long term.  I seek an assurance from the Minister that he and his Department will encourage long-term development.<\/p> <p>Someone built a tunnel under the Phoenix Park that was left idle for almost 100 years.  In fairness to the Minister's predecessor, the tunnel has been opened up and now links most of Kildare to the heart of Dublin.  Someone built the tunnel in the 1870s and we are benefitting from it now.  That just shows that a good plan pays dividends way into the future.  <\/p> <p>When the idea was mooted to have three lanes on the M7 motorway I proposed that the Luas line should run down the middle of the motorway all of the way down to Naas and build a large park-and-ride facility and provide additional transport links.  No one at the time gave me a logical reason for not doing so.  Again, I sought to future proof the project so that it could be utilised in ten, 15 or 20 years' time.  Unfortunately, many planners work on a five-year cycle or, worse still, a Government cycle.  We should break such practices and I am glad to say that the Project Ireland 2040 does so.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Anthony Lawlor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2283\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2283&amp;amp;pid=AnthonyLawlor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need four lanes of railway track to go to Kildare to service the commuter belt.  That must be a priority.  If we want to take people off the road network, the easiest way to commute from the greater Dublin area to the heart of Dublin is on the railway.  It makes sense and it should be a priority.<\/p><p>The National Transport Authority, NTA, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, have land holdings at the junctions of roundabouts.  This land should be used to provide park-and-ride facilities.  The buses would be able to pull in and take on passengers to bring them into the centre of Dublin.  Even in my village of Johnstown, the TII owns a two-acre patch that the buses pass on their route.  This could be levelled off and a park-and-ride facility could be made available.  Land in the vicinity of junctions should be considered for that purpose.<\/p><p>Tourism falls within the Minister's brief.  We need to work on creating a greenway along the canals.  The greenways that have been opened up, in particular in the west and in Waterford are fantastic tourist facilities.  I have always viewed the greenway as a major tourist boost for this country.  People who visit Ireland do not come for the weather but for other things, and those other things link into the greenways.  I put out the idea that Irish Water has a natural right of way from the Shannon to Dublin via the canals, that could be used for the transport of water straight from the Shannon into Dublin, with some storage place along the way.  While it would be doing that, it could up the canals as greenways as well.<\/p><p>The sports organisations would like to know whether it is proposed to continue the sports capital funding scheme in the long term.  Clubs are no longer the beneficiary of large-scale grants that were distributed during the McCreevy years.  I know that my club in Kill got a grant of &euro;750,000 on the condition that it would raise 30% of that sum, which caused it serious problems for a period of time.  Now that clubs are getting lower sums of money, their plans are broken down into many steps.  The clubs would like to know that the capital funding scheme will be available regularly so that they can apply for funding of &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000 each year.<\/p><p>Now, I will become very parochial.  Kildare County Council spent &euro;500,000 on transport infrastructure during the snow last winter.  The county council would like to get that money back to use it for the repair and maintenance of rural roads.  There are many rural roads that need to be repaired to make them passable.  People in rural areas pay their property tax, they support rural industries and they must be able to use their local roads.<\/p><p>The local authorities must be able to plan.  At present, the county council plans from year to year, depending on the allocation from the Department.  A multi-annual budget would allow the local authority to plan projects for a five-year period and it would allow a councillor to tell people when their road would be done because the money would be there to do it.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, for coming to this Chamber.  As I said earlier, it is great to have the Minister listen to our issues.  I hope that some of the ideas I have suggested may be taken on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#T00400","speaker":"1438","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Minister did not mention pedestrians in his speech.  Our footpaths in cities and towns are in a horrendous state and are a serious trip hazard, not just for older people.  We need to put that right.  I know the quick glib answer is that footpaths are the responsibility of the local authorities and they need to invest in the maintenance of footpaths.  The local authorities have not had the money in the past decade.  We need a serious level of investment to ensure that our footpaths, junctions and pedestrian lights are up to a quality and standard that encourages citizens to walk more rather than use the car.<\/p> <p>I, too, support the investment of 10% of the Department's annual budget in cycling infrastructure across all our cities and towns.  The Minister mentioned the cost-benefit analysis.  The return per euro on investment in cycling far exceeds anything put into roads or transport.  Again I make the argument for increased funding purely on a cost-benefit analysis.  It should be in and around 10% of the Department's budget and I ask the Minister to consider that seriously.<\/p> <p>The Minister said that he would deal with BusConnects during his closing remarks.  I wish to make a general comment because I do not think the Minister will be able to deal with the number of specific queries that everyone has.  People who telephoned me from the Lower Kimmage Road were crying on the phone because of the information they were given.  Whether the information is incorrect or misrepresented information, it does not matter.  The consultation process has not worked as correctly as it should, and this has created anxiety and fear among the public.  We have to examine it to see what has been done to create this anxiety.  I spoke to a representative from the National Transportation Authority this morning and I was told that it was a consultation document.  I accept that, but since it has created the spread of fear and anxiety among the public in the capital city, it has been done wrong.  We must learn from that mistake because we will have a bus corridor consultation process in November.  We need a clear analysis to ensure that we put out the information clearly so that it can be understood.  What has become clear from the BusConnects consultation process is that there was no origin and destination survey done in respect of the design of the routes.  That is showing up very clearly through the consultation process.  People want to go to different places and not where the routes are designed for.  We need to learn lessons from the BusConnects consultation process and make sure that we do not repeat those mistakes.  I will deal with the National Transportation Authority on specific questions.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell covered MetroLink exceptionally well.  Again, the papers and studies that came into the public domain show there was no origin and destination survey on the south side of the people travelling on the Luas green line.  I travelled on the green line and conducted a minor origin and destination survey in Dundrum.  I found that people were travelling great distances to use the green line to travel into town.  We need to collect data on who is using the green line if we are going to spend vast amounts of money to make it a metro line.  We do not know where the people are coming from or the distance of the radius from which they originate to travel on the green line, which causes capacity problems.  I am a big believer that there should be a metro system on the south side.  The location should be evidence based.  Having been in government through the recession, what was said over and over again was that future decisions would be evidence based.  There is very little evidence in respect of MetroLink on the south side.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would like to see an evidence-based decision making process on MetroLink on the south side of Dublin.  If the evidence is there to support it, I will hold my hands up and admit that I got it wrong.  What I see at the moment, however, is a waste of money in terms of the investment currently going into the green line which will be compounded by investment in a metro link.  We do not have sufficient information to make an evidence-based decision and I ask the Minister to review that.  <\/p><p>The Minister made brief reference to Dublin Airport which has a number of transport links.  One must look at the passenger numbers going through and in that context, I think we are missing a trick.  We are developing Dublin Airport as a hub but is the airport authority looking at connectivity for Irish people rather than just focusing on onward travel for passengers from America who are flying on to other capital cities?  I have received many complaints from passengers going through Dublin Airport who have told me that services are diminished and that much of the connectivity to other European cities has been lost.  The airport seems to be more focused on serving as a transatlantic hub rather than focusing on where people want to travel to and do business.  Again, I have no hard evidence but it has been said to me enough times for it to merit examination.  We must determine if that is a genuine complaint and if we are missing a trick in that regard.<\/p><p>Our main port facilities in Dublin and Cork face many challenges in the context of Brexit.  We must make sure that the infrastructure is in place so that whatever form Brexit takes, whether it be soft or hard, does not have a major detrimental impact on how our ports operate.  We need to be ready and to plan for the worst case scenario.  In that context, I must give credit to the CEO of Dublin Port, Mr. Eamonn O'Reilly, who is trying to do just that.  <\/p><p>It is very important that we invest in our top sports people.  While I welcome such investment, I would also like to see a focus on sport for life, that is, investment in what are often minority sports that people can play well into their latter years.  Such sports keep people active and healthy but many are not getting the funding that they need.  The Minister must prioritise spending and I accept that.  I will discuss the sports to which I am referring with the Minister at a later date.  <\/p><p>On train infrastructure and commuting, Councillor Mark Wall has been running a campaign relating to the train fare from Newbridge to Dublin.  If we want to get people out of their cars, we must recognise that places like Newbridge are now commuter towns.  It must be economically viable for people to commute from Newbridge and other parts of Kildare into Dublin city.  I ask the Minister to examine the fare structure for commuter towns like Newbridge.  I recognise that I am dropping this on the Minister's lap without prior consultation and would be happy for him to come back to me on it at a later stage.  I do not really expect an answer on it now.  I will not be comparing the Minister to Joseph Stalin, as others did earlier.  I do not think Deputy Ross looks anything like him.  I much prefer Lord Churchtown.  I will leave it at that and thank the Minister for coming into the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#U00400","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I took great interest in Project Ireland 2040 - Linking People and Places when it was launched in June.  There are many elements of the plan which are both necessary and welcome.  I particularly welcome the fact that the plan refers to an investment of &euro;53 million in greenway infrastructure between 2019 and 2021.  However, I have a difficulty.  Perhaps the problem lies not with the Department but with the local authority.  On four different occasions funding was announced for a so-called greenway between Boyle in County Roscommon and Lough Key Forest Park.  What did the local authority do with that funding?  It built footpaths in an area with the first round of funding.  When it got a second round of funding it built more footpaths and it did up some of the roads with the third tranche.<\/p> <p>Many local authorities did not really enter into the spirit of what constitutes a greenway.  When one goes to Germany, Amsterdam and other parts of Holland, one sees that little villages and towns are linked by walking paths and cycle paths.  We have applied again for funding for a greenway between Lough Key Forest Park and my town of Boyle.  This is necessary infrastructure because the park is a major tourist attraction.  The town of Boyle needs this investment and the greenway must be fast tracked.  Roscommon County Council has not entered into the spirit of greenways.  It has used greenway funding to repair roads instead of using road funds for such work.<\/p> <p>I have pointed out to members of my party who are in government that there are approximately ten towns in the country that are lacking the most basic infrastructure, namely, a hotel.  Boyle, for example, had two hotels 20 years ago but now has none.  Lough Key Forest Park is nearby and I urge the Minister to visit what is a huge success story.  In the early 2000s, Coillte owned Lough Key Forest Park which is the jewel in the crown of parks in the country.  Coillte could not draw down funding from the European Regional Development Fund because it was a semi-State company.  I came up with the idea that Roscommon County Council could get on board with Coillte in order to be able to draw down funding.  All the council had to do was come up with &euro;2 million, which it did and now the people of Roscommon and Ireland have a stake, with the semi-State organisation, in Lough Key Forest Park.  We have drawn down nearly &euro;20 million in funding and it is a huge success.  There are approximately 80 people employed in the park and the company is making around &euro;20,000 per year but Boyle does not have a hotel.<\/p> <p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la has refused planning permission for five hotels in the past ten to 15 years.  Lough Key Forest Park, a major tourist attraction drawing hundreds of thousands of paying visitors every year, is two miles from Boyle but there is no hotel infrastructure in the town.  The downturn following the boom has meant that nobody will build a hotel because one can buy one from NAMA for a fraction of the price.  I am trying to get the local authority involved.  I understand that funding cannot be given to a private developer but there must be some way for the local authority to build a hotel and then lease it out.  Boyle is dying because it does not have that necessary piece of tourism and social infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#V00200","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Who objected to the hotel?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#V00300","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I know who objected to the hotel and the objection was due to the lesser horseshoe bat.

Had it gone ahead, Boyle would now be a major tourist attraction.  It is frustrating and annoying.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister and his departmental officials to consider whether something can be done for the towns to which I am referring, namely, those without hotels.  Senator McDowell understands that Boyle needs a hotel but we cannot get a developer to build one.  If we build one, we will then have five.

The Coonagh to Knockalisheen bypass road will link Coonagh to Lisnagry on the way to KIllaloe in County Clare.  That is important for the development of the region because transport connectivity is vital in the development of businesses.  As a result of Brexit, a number of companies are looking to locate in Ireland.  Dublin is growing at a particularly fast rate.  New roads infrastructure along the Atlantic corridor from Galway to Cork via Limerick will be highly beneficial in attracting companies considering locating in the region, which will create jobs.  It is important to place an emphasis on that.<\/p><p>Senator Humphreys referred to some of the problems with Dublin Airport.  We have fine airports in Shannon and Cork and if infrastructure was put in place quickly to improve connectivity, the region would be a great counterbalance to the eastern region.<\/p><p>We also have a major plan for the development of Foynes Port.  While we have a port in Limerick city, there is also a deep sea port in Foynes.  The N69 upgrade and the bypass of Adare are very important projects for the development of Foynes, the second deepest port outside Dublin.  This project is vital for the development of the region and it must proceed as soon as possible.  Many businesses operate through the port.  Transporting goods from Foynes to other parts of the country is hindered by gridlock and a lack of transport infrastructure.  Adare is constantly gridlocked, with people spending up to an hour driving through the village, which is not satisfactory.<\/p><p>The mid-west region is working proactively to put fine projects together.  The educational institutes have had a major input in that regard and their work together as a unit has been very important for Limerick and the region.  Limerick city is the driver of the region.  Limerick City and County Council has reached out to Clare and Tipperary local authorities and the local authorities are working together to drive development in the region.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to consider prioritising some of the projects to which I have referred.  Regarding the Coonagh to Knockalisheen Road, I compliment Limerick City and County Council and Clare County Council, the lead authorities for the project.  It is vital that this bypass is completed.  It is estimated to be completed by 2021 but if it could be completed sooner, it would help the region a great deal in terms of development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#V00600","speaker":"1384","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The issue of transport is a very important as our population grows and our economy expands.  I welcome the Minister's comments on the metro and the electrification of the DART service to Drogheda.  However, in the interim, we could invest in hybrid trains that would deliver increased frequency before the line is fully electrified.  That would be very welcome.<\/p> <p>I do not need to remind the House that Fingal has the youngest population in the country, if not in Europe.  It also has a good deal of land rezoned for housing.  In the midst of a housing crisis, it is an obvious place to meet housing need quickly.  However, we need infrastructure in terms of schools and amenities - sports amenities fall within the Minister's remit - as well as road and transport infrastructure.<\/p> <p>I welcome the second runway and tower at Dublin Airport.  I mention metro again because 30 million people will pass through Dublin Airport this year.  Under a plan currently being considered, that figure would reach 50 million.  This new connectivity with the city is crucial for the development of Dublin Airport and the country.<\/p> <p>I welcome very much the Minister's comments on greenways.  I have been a long exponent of the coastal greenway extending through Fingal from Sutton and Howth all the way to Balbriggan.  This presents a tremendous opportunity for tourism, family activities and safe exercise.<\/p> <p>That brings me to the issue of cycle lanes.  Currently, one takes one's life in one's hands when cycling.  Many people would cycle from Lusk into Swords but there is not one cycle lane that is safe.  We need cycle lanes from Swords, Malahide and Portmarnock into the city centre.  Many people would use them and, as others have pointed out, they would be environmentally friendly but also very good from a health point of view.<\/p> <p>I raised the issue of BusConnects on the Order of Business this morning, as did the Acting Chairman.  There is much that is good in this plan.  There is no doubt that we need to plan ahead and develop a system that is more efficient than the current one.  The consultation process is extremely important and we need to up the game in terms of communication around this issue.  I met people in the Alex Hotel who pointed out that there are good aspects to the plan which will result in major improvements.  Swords will have an improved bus service, which is good, and Dublin Airport will also have a better bus service and greater connectivity with the city.  Against that, there is no proper coherent transport approach between Irish Rail and the bus service in Fingal.  People in north County Dublin now have to take two buses to travel to Beaumont hospital.  They will have to take three buses to make that journey if BusConnects proceeds without further proper consultation.<\/p> <p>Under the plan, there is to be increased frequency in the DART service from Malahide, with a train to run every ten minutes.  However, the schedule shows that on weekdays a DART train will run at 9.30 a.m. and the next train will not run until 10.10 a.m.  There is a need for connectivity between buses and trains because I am sorry to say the experience has been that the buses and trains are not co-ordinated properly.  Sometimes buses leave stops early and sometimes trains are late and people miss their connection.  A good deal of work needs to be done around that, and I mention only some of the points.<\/p> <p>Another major issue is the loss of the 33x bus service.  While I am aware that this proposal is being reconsidered, this plan will fail miserably if the 33x, which provides an excellent service into the city, is not maintained.<\/p> <p>Before I return to BusConnects, I will mention Donabate and land zoned in Fingal.  There are plans to build 1,200 houses in Donabate and a new road has been developed.  However, we still have a traffic jam on the M1.  What is badly needed is a slipway onto the M1 directly from the road that exits the peninsula on which Donabate and Portrane are located.  We need to keep the cost of transport at its current level.  When the cost of transport goes up, the cost of everything goes up, especially for hauliers who are competing against their European Union colleagues.  Any move to equalise the price of diesel and petrol would be a catastrophe for hauliers and put them out of business.<\/p> <p>I refer to the proposed gas station at Dublin Port.  People who bought and invested in gas lorries, with the encouragement of Government, cannot get the gas to run them in any meaningful sense.<\/p> <p>The Minister must ensure that current services are maintained until the new services are up and running.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is particularly important when it comes to the new rail services upon which we will be waiting.  There should be more buses, especially for rural link services.  As north county Dublin expands, villages such as Naul, Ballyboughal, Oldtown and others need connectivity with the likes of Balbriggan and Swords so people can get onto the main transport routes.  I look forward to the Minister's answer.  I will have to watch it on screen because I have another meeting to attend.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#W00200","speaker":"1421","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Ross, and his officials to the House.  In his speech, the Minister spoke about linking people and places.  It is not just desirable, it is essential.  That is why the overarching philosophy of the Minister to link people and places is one we must continue to develop.  Project Ireland 2040 is the platform that will not only allow Government, at both national and local level, to manage and plan but to develop a new Ireland, as the Minister said, not just for today but also for tomorrow.  Connecting people with place will be the Minister's legacy as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p> <p>Transport is the one thing we all desire and seek.  It includes public transport, in terms of the efficiency of our bus and rail services and airports and it also concerns motorists who commute from work to home.  I have in my mind the image of people travelling in Cork city from the Kinsale Road to the tunnel and the gridlock that has happened as a result of a growing economy and people going back to work.  It also means we must plan.  <\/p> <p>In today's debate, the Minister has listened to many people.  One thing he should take notice of from the Order of Business today is that the BusConnects consultation in Dublin is causing difficulty for both Members of the Oireachtas and citizens of the capital city.  Members who come in here are giving views that have been expressed to them at public meetings.  The Minister was correct when he said a greener and expanded public transport network will add greatly to the choice and experience of us all and will help improve our quality of life.  Congestion is now the cause of much stress and it causes huge annoyance for people.  <\/p> <p>Project Ireland 2040 provides the opportunity to develop the region in which I live in Cork for its people.  We will not go through the list of announcements.  It is critical in terms of connectivity of roads, rail and sea and air transport.  It is an opportunity for Cork, as the second city, to be the gateway to the south and a hub.  It will allow for the strengthening of the connectivity both between Cork and Limerick and between Cork and the east and Cork and Dublin.  The regeneration of Cork city is one I believe will happen in tandem with Project Ireland 2040.  That is why it is very important that Project Ireland 2040 has staging points so we can see the tangible delivery of projects whether for the M20 or the BusConnects project for which &euro;200 million has been announced.  In the Minister's discussion with the various authorities under his remit, will he discuss whether we will see, during the Minister's tenure as Minister, an enhanced public bike scheme for Cork city?  We have a university, an IT and a hospital all on the same side of the city.  It makes absolute sense to see an expansion of the public bike scheme.  Equally, when we speak about our cities it is also important - in the context of Cork, which I am speaking about now - to allow for the expansion of bus routes.<\/p> <p>It is important that there is a discussion with the NTA on a Ballygarvan to Cork bus route and a direct link with Ballygarvan from Cork city.  It is an area with a growing population.  If we recognise that cities cannot be the only place in which to live it makes absolute sense that in the case of Ballygarvan there would be a direct link with Cork city.  Under Project Ireland 2040, Cork city has the capacity to grow.  The new local government arrangements for Cork city will allow that to happen.<\/p> <p>I will conclude with one sentence.  I congratulate Cork Airport on its growth of almost 4% this year and its magnificent global marketing award achieved this week.  The Minister has been very supportive, I commend him on it, but it makes absolute sense for Norwegian Air to have a 12-month, 52-week service in and out of Providence.  I have used it myself on a number of occasions.  It is an excellent service.  It makes no sense to have the route cancelled for a couple of months when the route is open in Shannon Airport and Dublin Airport.  Why can we not have a service from Cork, the capital of the south, to Providence even if it is only one or two days a week?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#X00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House, with which he is very familiar, having spent a long time in the Seanad before he was elected to the D&aacute;il.  I welcome him back.<\/p> <p>I will make a number of points particularly on the transport matter.  I came in this morning by bicycle.  I was very glad I was cycling because there was a tailback through the heart of the Minister's constituency where I live, from Goatstown pretty much the whole way to Leinster House.  I appreciate that the Luas was not operating but it shows how popular the Luas is and how dependent many people are on it.  It was not raining at the time but the impending bad weather probably had more people in their cars.  We need to look at it seriously.  I know the Minister is looking at it through BusConnects and so on.  I thank the Minister for the mention I got in the Lower House yesterday.  I do not think I have been mentioned before in the Lower House.  I thank the Minister for mentioning it.  <\/p> <p>BusConnects has much merit.  There are very many good things in it such as the connectivity, the 90-minute journey fares and interconnectivity between Luas, DART and bus.  There is much good in it.  There are services that currently exist that seem to be very popular and seem to be altered in a certain way.  I completely accept it is a draft proposal but I hope Mr. Walker and his team will look at all of the consultation - I understand there will be a lot of consultation done and observations put in - and will try to keep the best of what is there while adding to it.  The concept of the spines is very good for those people lucky enough to live on spines.  The 46A is a very popular route in my former council area in Stillorgan.  There is much merit in BusConnects but I think the process and the people involved in it need to take on board people's concerns.<\/p> <p>I cycled in this morning.  It was fast and only took 19 minutes but there were cars the entire way in.  That is not acceptable.  We need to be looking at the amount of park-and-ride facilities for people who are travelling long distances who do not have great public transport.  Many people come up from Wicklow, perhaps not too far from the Minister.  They come in on the M50 down through Goatstown and Clonskeagh and into Ranelagh.  If they had a better option and there were park-and-ride facilities further out, I do not doubt they would use them.  We need to consider those people and give them options and alternatives to avoid having to bring their cars close to the city centre.  <\/p> <p>I apologise I was not here for the Minister's speech - I had another commitment elsewhere - but I have read it.  I do not know what other speakers mentioned.  Senator McDowell may have mentioned the metro and the concerns around it.  The metro is going as far as Sandyford at the very same time that we are building a brand new town in Cherrywood.  I think it is proposed there will be about 12,500 housing units for almost 30,000 people yet we are going to have the old service being provided from Brides Glen inward as far as Sandyford, which will then become a metro, which will then become either a Luas or an underground metro somewhere in the area where Senator McDowell lives.  We need to future-proof whatever is going on in terms of Cherrywood because it is a very significant residential development on almost 400 acres of land.  It is probably the last developable bit of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown left of such size.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If we are to do work on the line, we need to do it there where there are relatively very few people.  The work could probably be done there far more quickly and easily than in a city centre location.<\/p><p>On Brexit, Dublin Port is certainly making provision.  As Senator Buttimer said and as I have said, there is nothing good about Brexit.  It will be difficult but we need to future-proof our ports in this regard.  We need to examine road safety.  I did not hear the figures yesterday but I hope European Day Without A Road Death was a success in Ireland, despite the weather.  I encourage the Minister to consider road safety and speeding although it is technically not his brief.  When I drive at the speed limit on the M50, motorists fly past.  The level of enforcement on some of our major roads is not what it could be.<\/p><p>With regard to airports, I must state, to be fair to Senator Byrne, that I would prefer if there were more people flying out of Shannon.  Equally, there should be more travelling from Cork.  For all the abuse the former Deputy Noel Dempsey got ten or 11 years ago over white elephants, terminal 2 of Dublin Airport is now so full that Aer Lingus airplanes are going back to use terminal 1.  It has been a phenomenal success.  I congratulate Aer Lingus and the DAA on what they are doing but we need to keep an eye on future-proofing all our investments.<\/p><p>It is not all negative.  I am not trying to be negative at all.  I commend the work being done.  It is very positive.  I refer to initiatives such as the Leap card.  It is amazing how fantastic the Luas was when it was opened by S&eacute;amus Brennan only 14 years ago at the Sandyford depot, near where I live.  Much positive work is being done but we need to future-proof for the increase in population.  As much as we can, we need to get people out of their cars, not for the sake of it but because they will have faster journey times and better experiences.  There is nothing worse than sitting in a car and not moving at all for a time.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#X00300","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to respond to what has been a very useful and constructive debate.  I thank the Senators for the mature, sensible and constructive way in which they addressed this issue.  Everyone knows there are serious difficulties in the public transport sector.  Traffic congestion is a major problem that has to be addressed.  In some ways, it is worse than we would expect.  Certainly in Dublin, it is chronic.  This debate has been marked exclusively by pleas by Senators on behalf of people in their own areas, particularly Dublin.<\/p> <p>I will address the BusConnects issue first because it has been a common theme, certainly among those from Dublin.  I understand the difficulties that people from all constituencies and areas of Dublin are encountering with this project.  Radical change of this sort cannot be introduced without some very understandable, constructive, sensible and, in some cases, absolutely correct opposition.  One cannot do anything as radical as drawing on a clean sheet of paper a map of bus routes in Dublin to reduce journey times dramatically and relieve the traffic problem without upsetting certain people in certain areas.  There is no intention of doing that.  The intention of BusConnects is to relieve the traffic congestion.  The projections being made are quite dramatic in that regard.<\/p> <p>As everyone knows, the plans as produced will increase the frequency of buses, increase capacity and introduce new, very exciting and much-needed routes.  That must be applauded.  I will not go into the detail but there will be new routes introduced that have been necessary for a very long time and that will satisfy many of the demands many have made about UCD, St Vincent's and such places.  Quite understandably, those projects and initiatives tend to be banked by those who get them while all the more vocal responses are from those who are inconvenienced by some of the projects suggested.  Like all the Members who mentioned this, I am especially sympathetic towards those who could not reach hospitals, universities and schools before now.  Some of them see the project has not introduced a way for them to do so.<\/p> <p>It is important to state that the criticism is not so much of the project itself but of the communication of it.  There were circumstances in the past in which I would not have said this - Senator Ned O'Sullivan quite rightly referred to this - but the ambitions of the NTA and its constructive attitude towards this very difficult project have been commendable.  In many cases, it has gone the extra mile to involve the public regarding this initiative.  That is because the NTA, all politicians and I realise the heartbeat of the people of Dublin is contained in the trains and buses, which carry them every single day of the year.  It is the commuters who count and who must be accommodated.<\/p> <p>Buses, including those of Dublin Bus, are not run exclusively, and not even primarily, for profit.  They are run for those who are unable to travel by other means, sometimes for economic reasons.  We want to move as many people as possible into those buses.  The NTA realises that and the very important social role buses play.  That was a surprise to me.  Nevertheless, the criticisms of the consultations have been coming in faster than expected.  I suspect that is because there is a misunderstanding over what is going on.<\/p> <p>The NTA has held numerous public consultations across the city of Dublin in recent weeks, and staff from Dublin Bus were present.  They have been well advertised.  People have been invited at various fora and through various media to go to them.  Many have turned up and many have been reassured by what they have heard.  These consultations have not taken the shape of public meetings with people rabble-rousing or anything like that.  There are not politicians stirring people up at these meetings.  There are serious people going along with serious problems and explaining them to people from the NTA and getting an answer on how they may get from point A to point B most easily and quickly, or on why they cannot.  Many people have come away happy from those consultations, reassured after having been fed a lot of misinformation.<\/p> <p>Some people have come away from those consultations still worried about the links.  I refer in particular to old people and the disabled.  They are worried about links and having to change where they did not have to change before.  That is understandable.  Those views are serious and must be taken into account.  If communities are cut off, of course they must be looked after.  If groups of people who were habitually used to getting from point A to point B, including the elderly, now find they cannot do so for various reasons, their cases must be considered with great sympathy, and there must be a practical response.  My sense of what is happening now is that the consultation, which will end on 30 September, will prompt a constructive response from the NTA.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is not window dressing or cosmetic.  This is for real.  The public has responded to the invitation from the NTA to communicate.  It is not the only way the public can respond.<\/p><p>There are other actions the public is invited to take on the BusConnects website.  A telephone line is available where the public is invited to ring in and ask the questions it wants answers to and see if that is satisfactory.  Is it working?  I rang it myself.  I did not say who I was.  I just gave my Christian name.  I asked quite a complicated question and they came back to me with a full answer.  I rang again and asked another question and they came back to me.  I will not say whether the answer was satisfactory but the answer was full information about how to get from point A to point B.  That is a very good service because if someone gets that particular response, he or she can decide whether the new system suits him or her.  People are misunderstanding the maps, which are very complicated and very difficult to understand, and are unable to make decisions about whether this benefits them, but once they get a reply from this service, and they will get a reply, they are able to decide.<\/p><p>The next step they can take is to make a submission.  The NTA is taking submissions by email and letter and will consider them very seriously.  My sense is that the options are open and public representatives behaving responsibly will tell those who come to them with legitimate worries about what is going to happen that they can at least rectify the fact that they are not fully informed by ringing up, finding out the information, making a submission and seeing the result of that.  Submissions close on 30 September so there are another ten days or so.  There is plenty of time to do that.<\/p><p>After those submissions are made, and it is fair to give the NTA time to consider them, it is likely that a new version of that plan will emerge.  I am not making any promises but I appeal to the NTA to put the new version out for consultation again when it appears because this is a serious matter and entire communities are affected by it.  We realise that and we want to see a serious and proper toing and froing.  We know these measures will not come into force until 2020.  One or two might come into force very late in 2019 but, in effect, it is a 2020 project so there will be time to consider sympathetically the difficulties people encounter and sort them out.  I appeal to everybody to indulge and involve themselves in this process because that is the best way of getting a result.  They have a willing listener at the other end of this process who wants to see a new programme of buses that works where all the benefits of the new radials and orbitals will be seen and felt by the majority of people and where those who are or have been unable to find out or who are puzzled and worried about this can be reassured in the months to come.<\/p><p>I will answer some of the questions asked by some Senators because it is appropriate of me to do so.  Senator Ned O'Sullivan spoke about underinvestment in transport.  He is right.  I will not indulge in political blame for all of this because it is unhelpful, but there has been and there still is a problem with underinvestment.  This is why we need a plan.  If we could produce all the capital today, we would do all those things the Senator would like and do them faster.  There has been underinvestment because of the usual reason, namely, a shortage of money.  The reason there is a shortage of money is something we could probably debate for a very long time.  From what the Senator said, the projects of which he approves are projects of which we also approve.  We are not really on different sides.  We might be on different sides when it comes to the speed of it and the source of the capital that will come forward.<\/p><p>The Senator also referred to the Luas Cross City debacle.  Everyone knows there were problems to start off with but it is working pretty well now.  One of the great merits of a good transport company is being flexible.  There were serious mistakes and difficulties in the beginning such as overcrowding but they were responded to fairly swiftly by the company behind Luas and the green and red lines of Luas are now working very effectively apart from the damage caused by the storm last night for which we cannot blame the company or Government.  It is now working flexibly and is showing a willingness and an ability to adapt pretty quickly to changing conditions.<\/p><p>Senator McDowell said no cost-benefit analysis was done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#Y00200","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I should have said that no proper cost-benefit analysis had been done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#Z00200","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>A cost-benefit analysis was done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#Z00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>It has been criticised by everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#Z00400","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I do not want to engage with the Senator about what was proper and what was not proper but a cost-benefit analysis was done.

A final business case will be presented for Government approval before construction starts in 2021.  Will all the platforms be dug up?  I keep being asked detailed questions about matters that are not matters for me, but the answer to that question is that platforms will not be completely dug up.  They will be changed and enhanced in ways that are necessary, but the idea that there will suddenly be a complete and utter change is not true.  They will be adjusted accordingly.<\/p><p>Regarding the question about a cycle-friendly city, I probably ought to say a bit about cycling.  I have said quite often - maybe not in this House but certainly in the other House - that we have been behind the curve in terms of cycling, not just in Dublin but throughout the country.  We have spent a lot of money on greenways.  A total of &euro;53 million will be spent on them in the next four years.  This is a way of promoting cycling.  Greenways are used by a great number of cyclists.  I regret the fact that at certain times there has been a fall in our expenditure on cycling, whatever the economic condition of the country was.  However, we have committed fully in the national development plan to what is a big step change in cycling.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The national development plan commits a &euro;110 million spend on cycling, a trebling of capital spending over the next three to four years.  That is an enormous commitment by the Government.  It is an admission that we fell behind on this before.  I believe that was the case with all Governments.  However, we have now decided that cycling is absolutely necessary, not just to get the people from point A to point B, like Senator Horkan this morning, but for the health of the nation, as well as part of the drive to reduce carbon emissions.  That decision has been taken and will be followed through.  Senator McDowell is correct that in times past, including when he was in government, cycling was not promoted as much as it should have been or could have been.  We have now decided it is necessary for the sake of congestion and health.<\/p><p>If I am asked for concrete evidence of this, I would revert to BusConnects and the radial routes.  The proposal also has a commitment to 200 km of segregated cycling ways which will ensure whole new avenues open to cyclists which will contribute to more cyclists.  These will be adjacent to all bus corridors.  They will improve safety, health and the numbers of cyclists on the road.  That commitment should be not taken lightly.  It will cost money but will greatly benefit the cycling community and contribute to cycling safety.<\/p><p>Senator O'Mahony asked about the ring road around Galway.  Within two or three weeks, I will be seeking the Government's approval for the Galway ring road project in order the county council can go ahead to seek planning consent from An Bord Plean&aacute;la. <\/p><p>The Government is absolutely committed to Knock airport.  We realise its importance regionally, that it is vital for tourism and that it is the gateway to the west from overseas.  The Senator need not have any worries on that score.  The departure of the previous Taoiseach, although he was a great supporter of the airport, will not make any difference to the Government's solid commitment to the airport.<\/p><p>The western rail corridor is subject to review going ahead.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is doing a review which will be then examined by the Government.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield spoke about a blockage by the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, of developments in the west.  If there were blockages by the Taoiseach, they were done for economic reasons.  I do not believe there was ever a bar put on any project by the Taoiseach because he is open to these projects.  A stop or a delay may have been put on certain projects with the hope that when the economic crisis was over that they would be restored.  Some of them have been revived as a result of that.<\/p><p>The Senator also talked about the need for cycling, which I have dealt with.<\/p><p>Senator Lawlor referred to the need for a timeframe.  It may not have been in my speech but there is a timeframe in the NDP.  I cannot promise the Senator anything about the railway line to Kildare because it is a matter for the National Transport Authority, NTA, CI&Eacute; and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  He referred to the greenways which are an exciting project.  Up to &euro;53 million will be provided for them.  The application for the greenways is already out.  We opened it up last week and invited interested parties to make an application to be funded.  We are expecting massive competition in that.<\/p><p>The Senator also asked if the sports capital programme will continue every year.  That would be our ambition.  We would like to see it happen every year.  It is a phenomenal programme which fulfils one of the key pillars of our sports policy, namely, that there should be participation.  We have had phenomenal success recently with sporting achievements which has to be acknowledged day after day.  It is great for national morale and we are all immensely proud of it.  We must not forget the fact that 95% of those people who indulge in sport will not reach that extraordinary pinnacle which we have seen from Irish sport in recent weeks.  However, they are equally important, if not more so.  The great virtue of the sports capital programme on a whole is it filters everywhere.  It filters to people who are not athletic stars but will benefit enormously from it.  It is a community grant which is beneficial to both small and large communities.  It makes a significant contribution to social and health well-being but its primary purpose is not to contribute to winning gold medals at the Olympics.  That is another day's work.<\/p><p>Senator Kevin Humphreys devoted much time cycling.  He looked for a commitment to a 10% investment in it.  I will not give such a commitment but &euro;110 million is trebling the investment we had before.  That is an enormous commitment which we will keep.  It is a massive step change and an acknowledgement that those who have been advocating for cycling for so long were ahead of the curve.  We are doing something that others were not prepared to champion for various reasons.  We are committed and we have taken on board the real benefits as advocated by the cycling lobby.  We will continue to do that.<\/p><p>I take the Senator's point about consultation on BusConnects.  I do not accept it.  It has made an extraordinary effort to reach out to all those with difficulties with it.  I will be urging them to continue that consultation on a serious level to ensure communities in the Senator's area have every opportunity, even after the next version of the plan, to come back on it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This dialogue must end in a consensus, in agreement and in the vast majority of people being happy with the number of routes open to them and the access they have to the places which are important to them.<\/p><p>Senator Humphreys talked about MetroLink and an evidence-based decision.  I do not anticipate any decision made on MetroLink not being evidence-based.  My understanding is that the real reason for the provision of the metro is that the whole of Dublin will need greater capacity in its means of transport and in transporting people in and out of the city.  This means being speedier, being larger and being able to provide a service which the Luas cannot provide in terms of speed and numbers.  This is the whole purpose of MetroLink, with routes with which the Senator will be fully familiar.  I do not think this will be done without evidence-based decisions, but one need only see the extraordinary rise in population in the Senator's area, in my area and further afield to know that the demands on transport will continue for decades to come.  We will look for increased capacity on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>I will pass on what Senator Humphreys said about Dublin Airport to the DAA.  I think what he says is anecdotal, but there are real capacity issues at Dublin Airport constantly.  He says it is perhaps looking at being the wrong kind of airport, that it is looking at connectivity rather than where people are going in and out, etc.  I think the main problem with Dublin Airport is that it is so successful and, as Senator Byrne said, I think, or certainly implied, so big in comparison with Shannon and Cork that it makes the traffic very lopsided in terms of people going in and out of the country.  This is a problem for Dublin Airport and for Shannon and Cork.  It is a problem for Shannon and Cork because they do not have enough customers and it is a problem for Dublin Airport because it has too many.  The Senator has put his finger on it.  That is very difficult.<\/p><p>The Senator said Dublin Airport looks on itself as a hub.  It is an interesting debate.  I am not sure what the answer is, but sure, perhaps passengers are suffering because the airport sees itself as just transporting people across the Atlantic.  It may have to consider that.  There are various ways out of the capacity problems in Dublin Airport.  We have just got a capacity review, which is just being finalised and which will make some serious suggestions.  It will comment on the benefits or otherwise of a third terminal, which could help the capacity problems, and will also probably make suggestions as to whether or not that should be an independent third terminal.  The review will certainly outline the benefits and downsides of that and we will have to make a decision on it shortly.<\/p><p>The ports are absolutely vital in the context of Brexit, and the main emphasis in this regard is on Dublin and Rosslare.  Preparations are being made - I must be careful - for all scenarios involving the ports, for no deal and for a central case.  I have seen some of the preparations and I am very impressed with what is in line, but we should not underestimate the scale of what might happen in Dublin Port or Rosslare.  Large amounts of space would have to be made available in various situations, which would mean that both Dublin Port and Rosslare would have to find space.  I am absolutely confident, however, that Ireland is pretty well in a leadership position in preparing for Brexit in terms of the ports.  We are doing virtually everything that is necessary, particularly in respect of the two principal ports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#Z00500","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I do not want to interrupt the Minister, but he has responded to almost six Senators.

I cannot comment on the case he made for the greenway he proposes but he has made a very fine case, and no doubt those who are adjudicating on the matter will take it into account.  He talked about Roscommon and its difficulties.  Ireland's Hidden Heartlands will promote areas such as Roscommon, target investment into tourist facilities in the area and provide an opportunity to highlight the scope for a hotel investment outside the more fashionable areas.  Perhaps Senator Feighan would consider zoning a hotel site in the development plan.  That might help.<\/p> <p>I think I have addressed Senator Maria Byrne's plea about Shannon and Cork airports and the fact that Dublin has too much businesses.  She addressed the N21 and N69 Foynes to Limerick road.  Its estimated cost to the Exchequer is, I think, &euro;462 million, which is fairly substantial.  My understanding is that Limerick County Council is now preparing statutory documentation for submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  An environmental impact assessment report and statutory process will also be prepared.  There is an estimated completion date of 2026.  What she is saying is \"Please hurry up\".  I will bear that in mind.  I thank her for raising the matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Reilly addressed the issue of cycle lanes being unsafe, which I think I have responded to elsewhere.  I think we will be taking further initiatives to protect cyclists very shortly.  That will not be very long coming.  He also addressed the issue of communication in respect of BusConnects, which I have already dealt with.<\/p> <p>To respond to Senator Buttimer, I will do anything I can to support Norwegian Air.  It is in the interests of the nation, the consumer and the customer that it be encouraged.  Sometimes we do not have enough competition coming in and out of Ireland.  Ryanair has done an absolutely wonderful job on providing that, but the more we have, the better for the customer.  I would like to see Norwegian Air operating on a 365-days-a-year basis.  We encouraged it to come in and we will continue to encourage it to operate fully here.<\/p> <p>To respond to Senator Horkan's speech, I thank him for what he said about BusConnects.  There is an obligation on all of us, and I am not saying in any way that he is not doing this, to look at this very objectively and to assist people - Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, everyone - to get over the difficulties they are encountering.  I am sure, because Senator Horkan and I are both in the same constituency, that he is finding that one of the problems is that people do not understand, when they have been taking a bus for 45, 50 or 60 years, that it is now called the 44, for example, which goes through our constituency, and will suddenly be called the A-something else.  That is the first mental block they must overcome and it is a very difficult one.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They also have to deal with it taking a different route, which they automatically assume will be worse for them, although that may not necessarily be the case.  It would be helpful if when they understand that the route they are used to travelling to get from point A to point B will not be the same, they are told there are lots of other places they will be able to go.  This is happening throughout Dublin but people are not being told this.  As I said earlier, they are backing the good bits, which is that there are lots more routes open to them, and, at the same time, complaining about how they are going to get from point A to point B when there is a simple solution.  <\/p><p>Information will lessen the puzzlement and the resistance, if there is any.

The House will be aware that under the Referendum Act 2001, polling must be not earlier than 30 days and not later than 90 days after the date of the polling day order which can only be made by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government when the necessary referendum Bill has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is intended that the referendum on blasphemy will take place on the same day as the Presidential election, which is scheduled for 26 October.  In these circumstances, there are inevitable time pressures and constraints when it comes to progressing the Bill.<\/p> <p>The Bill's Title aptly describes the purpose and intent of what is a short, two-section Bill.  The purpose and intent is to remove the reference to \"blasphemous\" from Article 40.6.1&deg;.i of the Constitution.  <\/p> <p>Section 1 provides for the amendment of Article 40.6.1&deg;.i by providing that \"seditious\" shall be substituted for \"Blasphemous, seditious\" in the English text.  If this amendment is approved by the people in the forthcoming referendum, the relevant part of Article 40.6.1&deg;.i of the Constitution will read as follows: \"The publication or utterance of seditious or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law.\".  <\/p> <p>Section 2 is a standard provision and specifies the name of the constitutional amendment and of the Bill.  The publication of the Bill fulfils one of the commitments of the programme for a partnership Government.  It accords with the recommendations included in a series of reports which touched upon the constitutional provision on blasphemy and which, without exception, favoured the deletion of that provision.  Those reports include the Law Reform Commission, LRC, report on the Crime of Libel in 1991.  The 1996 report of the Constitution review group came to the conclusion that the retention of the current constitutional offence of blasphemy was not appropriate.  In 2008, the Joint Committee on the Constitution also considered this matter and concluded that the specific reference to blasphemy should be deleted from the Constitution.  Most recently, we had the valuable work of the Convention on the Constitution in 2014.  Following the trend of previous reports, the convention in its sixth report favoured, by a clear majority, the removal of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.<\/p> <p>It is somewhat difficult to come to a common understanding as to the nature of blasphemy within the framework of a modem society.  We can take it that in simple terms \"blasphemy\" means to vilify or show contempt for God or to abuse or treat with contempt or disdain that which is sacred.  However, there is a complex political and religious background to the development of this concept in this jurisdiction, which makes the simple definition less than helpful when it comes to considering the constitutional provision.  It seems to be generally accepted that our legal understanding of the term \"blasphemy\" has grown out of the understanding at common law as it prevailed in England and Wales over the centuries.  Once the Anglican Church of Ireland became the established church in the late 17th century, the rationale for maintaining blasphemy laws was inextricably linked with the need to protect that religion and, by  extension, the State.  Thus, as will be apparent to Senators, there was a clear and fundamental link between protecting the State on the one hand and, on the other, safeguarding the religious system of belief with which that State was identified.  However, the intellectual and philosophical movements in the 18th century that is now referred to as the age of enlightenment or the age of reason brought about a change in that approach.<\/p> <p>Over time, individual rights came to the forefront of social thinking.  In the blasphemy context, the rationale for defending and securing the established belief system was overtaken by an emphasis on the need to protect the religious sensitivities of believers.  By the time our Constitution was adopted, therefore, it would seem that the focus of blasphemy, as it was understood at the time, was very much directed towards speech likely to cause gross outrage to such sensitivities.  Furthermore, it would  seem to be the case that, arising out of the various equality provisions in the Constitution, the \"protection\" offered by the blasphemy provision, if such it can be called, was not confined to any one church or belief system.  <\/p> <p>The proposal  in the Bill should not be viewed as an attack on belief, nor is it intended to privilege one set of values over another.  It is simply an acknowledgement that a concept whose meaning is unclear, and which is rooted in a past where loyalty to a State and loyalty to a particular religion were virtually synonymous, has no place in our Constitution.  At the core of the proposal to remove the offence of blasphemy from our Constitution is the view that criminal sanctions are not appropriate in this context.  In a modern and democratic society, we should not accept or condone the criminalisation of expression.  That said, it is a different matter if that expression is geared towards inciting hatred or violence.  Where such is the intention, the criminal law must come into play.  In a society such as ours, whose members hold a wide array of beliefs, the State cannot guarantee that, on occasion, individuals will not be hurt and outraged because something which they might regard as deeply offensive is considered by others to be no more than humorous or satirical comment.  Additionally, it is not in keeping with best international practice that there should be a possibility, however remote, that a criminal prosecution of blasphemy would be taken  in such circumstances.  <\/p> <p>In our current society, maintaining the criminal offence of blasphemy in our Constitution, and as a consequence, on our Statute Book, has more to do with an unnecessary and anachronistic check on freedom of expression than with the protection of religious values.  Removal of the blasphemy clause from our Constitution would be a public affirmation of our belief in an inclusive society.  It would underscore that communication between those with different belief and value systems should take place on the basis of mutual tolerance and respect.  It would remove the inhibiting check on freedom of expression which a blasphemy law  inevitably represents.  The law on blasphemy has not been invoked with any frequency and it would seem that for more than a century and a half, there has been little interest in entertaining blasphemy prosecutions. The most recent prosecution for blasphemy in Ireland seems to have taken place in 1855 and that prosecution resulted in the acquittal of the person involved who was alleged to have burned a bible in the context of a general burning of \"evil literature\".<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> In more recent times, the position and particulars of the offence of blasphemy In Irish  law was considered by the Supreme Court in the case of Corway and Independent Newspapers.  During the course of the judgment the constitutional framework which guarantees freedom of conscience, the free profession and practice of religion, and equality before the law to all citizens was discussed.  It was noted that it was difficult to see how the common law crime of blasphemy, related as it was to an established church and an established religion, could survive in such a framework.<\/p><p>It should be borne in mind that the judgment gave particular emphasis to the fact that existing legislation had not adapted the common law crime of blasphemy to the circumstances of a modern state.  The court concluded, therefore, that given the current state of the law and the absence of any legislative definition of the constitutional offence of blasphemy, it was impossible to determine the nature of that offence.  This analysis and the implied criticism of the Legislature it contained brings us to the much-maligned provisions which are set out in sections 36 and 37 of the Defamation Act 2009.  It would be fair to say that there is a high threshold to be met if the offence created under the Act is to be successfully prosecuted and the Department of Justice and Equality is not aware of any prosecutions having taken place under it.<\/p><p>If the constitutional amendment is agreed to by the people, it is the intention of Government that sections 36 and 37 of the 2009 Act would be repealed.  Provision for such repeal is contained in the general scheme of a Bill which has been published on the Department&rsquo;s website, and which sets out the measures which would be drafted as a formal Bill in the event of the Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution being approved.<\/p><p>I am not going to deny that the proposal before the House is a modest one.  Indeed, there are those who say that it is without point or purpose, especially having regard to the Corway judgment and to the general lack of prosecutions in this area.  However, there are good, sound justifications for removing the reference to blasphemous matter from our Constitution and I will enumerate those reasons.<\/p><p>It is an undeniable fact that for as long as it remains in our Constitution, we have in being a constitutional offence of publishing or uttering blasphemous matter.  We  cannot wilfully ignore this constitutional provision.  There is also our international reputation to consider.  In 2013 the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom identified 71 countries where blasphemy was punished.  The ranking of our provisions as being at the upper end of mild does not gainsay the fact that we are in a minority of EU countries which featured on that list.  Indeed, since the data for that report was collated, both Malta, in 2016, and Denmark, in 2017, have moved to abolish their blasphemy laws.  Notwithstanding our relative ranking on the above-mentioned list, there is a  fundamental problem with the fact that we feature on such a list at all.<\/p><p>I have already referred to the difficulties in reaching a common understanding in this society as to the practical workings of a blasphemy offence.  Imagine, therefore, the widely varying understandings of the concept of blasphemy which may exist in other countries which do not necessarily share our liberal values.  In some countries blasphemy laws are applied in a discriminatory manner in order to protect a particular  religion.  In effect, the laws are used to justify the persecution of religious minorities, as well as the persecution of those who have a value system which is not based upon religious belief.<\/p><p>In addition, there is a wide divergence in the sanctions which may apply when blasphemy laws are breached.  Such sanctions range from fines, terms of imprisonment of varying lengths, physical punishment, hard labour and even death.  While we in Ireland may have our own particular views on our blasphemy provisions, when we think about them at all, an outsider looking in sees that Ireland is a country with a blasphemy law in its Constitution, and at the heart of its legal system.

Fianna F&aacute;il believes the current provisions on blasphemy in the Constitution are outdated and should be removed.  Ireland is one of only seven countries in Europe where blasphemy is still an offence.  The Bill proposes the removal of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution by way of referendum.  Article 40.6.1&deg;.i provides that the offence of blasphemy is punishable according to law, and the Defamation Act 2009 defines that offence, and provides that a person shall be liable upon conviction or indictment for a maximum fine of &euro;25,000.  The Minister of State outlined many reasons that we should remove blasphemy.<\/p> <p>Freedom of expression is very important.  It is the cornerstone of a democratic society, and any constraints on it must be clear and limited and this is not the case with blasphemy in Article 40.6.1&deg;.i  It tends to protect believers over non-believers in its current form.  Ireland has changed very significantly in recent times.  The Minister of State made the point that Islamic and other states are using Ireland's law as a defence of their blasphemy laws.<\/p> <p>Hate crime legislation will protect deeply-held beliefs more effectively than the blasphemy laws by ensuring that all religious groups are protected from incitement without unduly constraining freedom.  My party, Fianna F&aacute;il, introduced the Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill 2016 in July of that year and despite having undergone pre-legislative scrutiny in May 2017, the Government has not issued a message pursuant to Article 17.2 of the Constitution in order that a money message provision be issued in relation to the Bill, so it has been prevented from proceeding.  The Government sought and was granted an exemption from pre-legislative scrutiny for this Bill by the D&aacute;il Business Committee, but it is noteworthy that Bills introduced by other parties, in particular, the Social Democrats' 2017 Bill on this issue, have not been allowed to pass beyond Second Stage.<\/p> <p>I am certainly not going to delay this legislation.

I apologise to the Minister of State for arriving late and missing his contribution but I was at a meeting elsewhere.  I wanted an opportunity to speak on this proposed amendment of the Constitution.  The blasphemy clause in the Constitution was the product of another time.  We need a Bunreacht for today's society.  It is important the Constitution reflects today's values, and central to those values is freedom of expression and freedom of speech.  I would be confident, as has been said by colleagues, that the people will vote to delete it from the Constitution, as they have voted for on marriage equality and abortion reform in recent times.  These are expressions for the modern era in which we now live.<\/p> <p>In our island, partition created two conservative states.  The conservatism was reflected in the political culture and the religious ethos of both those states.  In the North the culture and ethos was used to create a one-party unionist religiously Protestant state, which discriminated against an entire community on the grounds of political, cultural and religious identity.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This was also reflected in the social morals of that State.  In the South, the State used its power differently but, nonetheless, the consequences were similar with power and privilege being in the hands of a political and Catholic religious elite.  Out of that, a society was created where the Catholic Church and its attitude to public and private morality held sway.  It suited the political interests of those in Government to cultivate a special relationship and special status for the Catholic Church.  The place of the church in the 1937 Constitution institutionally enshrined the power of the Catholic Church.  It was a different Ireland where the State and the Catholic Church moved hand in hand.  This hand in glove relationship prevented public accountability of both State and church and this unaccountability space was filled with scandals such as child abuse and its cover up, mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries, industrial schools and the list could go on.  <\/p><p>This amendment, like the marriage equality and abortion reform amendments, is a step towards a new Ireland, a diverse Ireland culturally and spiritually powered by people of all faiths and none.  Today, there is much more open criticism of the State and the church and that is good.  It is the core tenet of any republic.  No institution or body should be immune from challenge and criticism but it would be unacceptable if this were to extend to religious intolerance or prejudice against any particular faith or creed.  An inclusive Ireland must recognise and accept all religious faiths and none.  Religion plays a huge part in people's lives and is a source of great strength and solace.  Society is in a state of flux.  Each generation brings its own attributes with it and we have arrived at a point where an informed and an informative debate needs to take place in areas to do with health and education and the place of the Catholic Church therein.  <\/p><p>There can be no special place for any one religion now or in a future independent Ireland.  I stand for the republic of Wolfe Tone of Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter.

While it is proposed to hold this referendum on the same day as the presidential election, holding this poll is not without costs all the same.  Each additional referendum held on the same day will add approximately &euro;4 million to the overall cost due to additional ballot papers, counting staff and so on.  It was the former Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, not the Archbishop of Armagh or Dublin or any other religious leader that one might care to mention, writing in the LRC report on this topic in 1991, who said that a referendum devoted to removing blasphemy &quot;would rightly be seen as a time wasting and expensive exercise&quot;.  How right he was and how true that still is.  Why are we here ramming this through the Seanad in just one day?  Is it the case, as on many issues, that the Government feels that this issue is uncontroversial because Opposition and other non-Governmental parties are supine when it comes to any of these big philosophical discussions?  Why does the Government feel that it is so uncontroversial or with little or no opposition to it?  Does the Government, therefore, think that debate on it is unnecessary?<\/p><p>Introducing this legislation, the Minister referred to Ireland's reputation being somehow impugned by the blasphemy provision.  He made a spurious comparison between Ireland and those countries, chiefly in the Islamic world, that have the death penalty for uttering blasphemy against Islam.  This demonstrates the crass level of analysis which is being brought to this discussion.  A report just last year by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom found that the current laws on blasphemy in Ireland are among the least restrictive in the developed world.  So much for the notion that Ireland is some kind of international pariah.  What is really going on here is another expensive photo opportunity for this Government to talk about how progressive it is by proposing yet another amendment to the Constitution.  The fact that it has moved against the purely symbolic reference to blasphemy, in addition to proposing a similar deletion of the purely symbolic reference to women in the home, gives us a clue to the real intention here - more politically correct red meat to the liberal gallery of media supporters that fawn uncritically over this Government.  I refer, in particular, to the people who cannot help scratching the itch that is the God question.  <\/p><p>At least the Minister conceded in the D&aacute;il that there have been no prosecutions for blasphemy in this country.  The most recent one occurred in 1855 when we were still in the grip of the neighbouring jurisdiction.  The reference to blasphemy has effectively been rendered a dead letter by virtue of the decision of the Supreme Court in Corway <i>v<\/i>. Independent Newspapers in 1999 when a private prosecution against newspapers for blasphemy was thrown out.  The Defamation Act 2009 - and I participated in the debate in this House - introduced hurdles which effectively ensure that no prosecution could ever be brought and the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, openly admitted that this was the aim of that legislation.  As the 2009 Act was going through the House, many Senators, including Senator Bacik and her Labour Party colleagues, made outlandish claims that the 2009 Act would open the door to future prosecutions for blasphemy.  That scaremongering has been shown to be entirely and predictably wrong.  <\/p><p>In view of all of this, why not simply introduce a Bill to amend the 2009 Act and remove the offence from our law altogether?  That could be done in short order and at almost no expense.  It would also leave the purely symbolic words in the Constitution where they pose no threat to pluralism and free speech, but of course that would not allow any virtue signalling.  That is the problem and that is why we have to have a costly referendum.  It will not happen because there is a vocal minority of commentators and politicians, mainly on the political left, who are deeply offended by the reference to blasphemy and any reference to religion in our Constitution.  As I said, the God question is the itch they cannot help scratching.  Let us remember that we have no problem with legislation that protects certain classes of people from statements made by others through, for example, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989.  Through those laws, we acknowledge that speech is not unlimited, yet there are no proposals to repeal these laws in the name of free speech.  <\/p><p>In 2013, the Convention on the Constitution suggested that the proscription of blasphemy should be replaced with a new general provision to include incitement to religious hatred.  All religious denominations should be given equal protection.  Unsurprisingly, this Government ignored that suggestion.  Religious freedom is a fundamental right protected in international human rights law, yet we seem to be happy to erode it progressively in Ireland.  If we were going to spend millions of euro of taxpayer's money on a referendum, would it not be a more appropriate gesture to insert clear protections for believers, non-believers and others in the Constitution instead of just deleting words?  It seems that the aim is to ensure speaking out against certain belief structures will be unlimited.  That is a good whereas the profession or support for those same beliefs is to be limited and proscribed because they are bad.  That is the new definition of tolerance that is regnant in this country.  To be more specific, an American author wrote some years ago that anti-Catholicism is the last acceptable prejudice.  This is the bizarre form of free speech that many seem to have in mind.  <\/p><p>Just listening to the previous speaker, to link in the wrongs of our past on the side of Church and State and to see that as somehow relevant to this debate on a rather meaningless and toothless provision on blasphemy in our Constitution shows the superficial level of the debate that has been going on in this country.  I have been clear and consistent in my view that a blasphemy provision should not be in place to protect one religion or to protect God from offence.  God is not quaking in his boots at the thought of the Minster abolishing the constitutional provision on blasphemy.  However, the hard-pressed taxpayer should be livid at this latest raid on the public purse by our political rulers to pander to their liberal base, their cheerleaders in the media and the usual human rights quangos.  As I said in 2009, I find persuasive comments made in the past on the difficulty of determining what is offensive to God.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One person&rsquo;s meat is another person's poison and I suspect the same may be true for deities.  Clearly, if blasphemy were to be understood as giving offence to God, it would be completely unworkable in modern legislation, but that is not how it has been understood.<\/p><p>There is a distinction between seeking to protect God from offence and seeking to protect the reasonable and lawful practice of religion and religious expression.  A significant number of people in this country from all denominations and faiths have a profound religious belief which anchors the manner in which they view the world, interact with their fellows and seek the welfare of their families and their community.  We had an opportunity to amend the Constitution, if we were going to spend public money, to recognise the harmful effect of gross offence aimed at these people, but this Government has not taken that route.  Why?<\/p><p>The Government enjoys using the word \"progress\" in relation to its proposals to amend the Constitution, but it is a very strange concept of progress and one that is riven with hypocrisy.  We have heard much talk about championing rights, but there is no consideration of the rights of increasingly marginalised groups such as people with religious beliefs.  In addition to the reasons mentioned regarding costs and so on, I will oppose this proposal because it is a missed opportunity to achieve generous and appropriate protection for the rights of people of all faiths and none and because it is a scandalously self-indulgent raid on the public purse on behalf of an elite group of people in our society who are radically out of touch with the problems that beset most ordinary people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#EE00400","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.

As far as I can see, this is a tidying-up exercise to ensure that the Constitution is modernised and brought into line with contemporary thought.  As a criminal lawyer, I do not think it is appropriate that we would have criminal offences in the Constitution.  In that context, I am critical of the fact that we are leaving any offence within the Constitution.  I would like to see \"publication or utterance of seditious or indecent matter\" removed too.  I think the Government's proposal is simply to remove \"blasphemous\", but it is a missed opportunity not to take the offence out in its entirety.  I do not think the Constitution is an appropriate place for us to define criminal offences.  It is not our criminal code nor should it be.  It is a broad statement of aspirations and of governance of our State.  That is my only quibble.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State has set out very clearly that this is not some sort of whimsical, sudden move by the Government.  This is something that has been recommended for a long time.  As far back as 1991, the Law Reform Commission recommended that the constitutional prohibition on blasphemy be removed.  The expert Constitution Review Group made the same recommendation in 1996.  In 2013, I was proud to be a member of the Constitutional Convention which considered in great detail, with expert opinion and advice, the question of the removal of the offence of blasphemy and recommended same by a strong majority.  In 2014 the previous Government, of which my party was a member, through the then Minister of State, now Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, announced in September that the Government had agreed to put the question of the removal of blasphemy from the Constitution to the people.  Agreement was reached that a referendum would be held on the question of amending Article 40.6.1&deg;.i of the Constitution to remove the offence.  The previous Government accepted the report of the Constitutional Convention and I am glad that this Government has continued with that position and is now proposing to put it to the people.<\/p> <p>It seems sensible that it would be done on the same day as the Presidential election so that the cost will be minimal, given that polling stations will be open.  There will be some additional costs through printing extra ballot papers, but to start quibbling about the cost of this measure, as with any constitutional referendum, misses the point.  Let us look at the substance of this and be clear that this referendum has been recommended over many years by many different expert groups, peoples' groups and by successive governments.  The Minister also mentioned the Corway and Independent Newspapers case in 1999 in which Mr. Justice Barrington noted that it was for the Legislature to define the crime rather than for the courts.  It was that case which the then Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, referred to when he brought the Defamation Bill before the Houses, proposing to create a new statutory offence of blasphemy in section 36.<\/p> <p>Some, including Senator Mullen, have argued that this has not had any real impact, but I would beg to differ on that point.  It is very clear that the existence of that offence and its relatively recent introduction had an international impact.  Ireland went against the EU norm in adopting a new statutory definition of blasphemy.  We are an outlier within the EU in that regard.  Other states have used our blasphemy offence as a model.  It is fair to say that Pakistan and other states have pointed to our law as an example of a law they wish to pursue.  It has also been used as a stick with which to beat us when we have been critical of regimes that have, for example, discriminated against religious minorities, including Christian minorities that have been repressed in certain countries.  We need to be very clear that the existence of an offence of blasphemy, even if there have been no prosecutions, sends out a signal that other countries, individuals or regimes may use against us or against minorities in their own state.  While no one has ever been charged with this offence, back in 2015 there was a rather embarrassing case of a complaint made at Ennis Garda Station about comments made by the actor Stephen Fry on the \"The Meaning of Life\" programme.  At the time, the former Minister Dermot Ahern said that the blasphemy provision had been implemented with a view to making it virtually impossible to prosecute.  That is not an appropriate way to legislate for a criminal offence either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#FF00400","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>They would settle for it in Pakistan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#FF00500","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I am glad that the Government has said that it will repeal section 36 of the Defamation Act if the constitutional amendment is passed.  That is appropriate.  There should be no place in our law any more for blasphemy offences.  We know from the history of blasphemy offences, which I will not rehearse again because we went through it in 2009, that they have typically been used by individual religions or members of a religion against others.  They tend to be used not against non-religious people but rather to pursue religious ideological battles.  There is no place in modern law for this sort of offence, in either our Constitution or in statute.  The story about the actor Stephen Fry was picked up by the international media.  It was an embarrassing moment and it highlighted the need to delete this outdated and obsolete section of our Constitution.<\/p> <p>It is far from the case that believers are a persecuted minority in Ireland.  Anyone with a passing knowledge of our school system will be well aware that 90% of our primary schools remain controlled by and under the governance of the Catholic Church and 95% are under some form of religious control.  Yesterday, I raised in the Seanad the very current issue concerning a particular school in Greystones.  It is a Church of Ireland school in which a linkage has been made between church attendance and school enrolment to the distress of many parents in that community.  I will be raising the matter further with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton.  We need a further debate on the separation of church and State in reality and practice in our education and healthcare systems.

We have had decades of debate on the matter and, like the blasphemy provision, there have been many reports that have recommended deletion.  The time was now to delete that article and to have the bigger debate that is also necessary about how we can recognise the very important role of carers and the very important rights and needs of those who are cared for as well.

If one looks at the entire section of the Constitution and the article to do with free speech, it is quite clear that free speech and freedom of expression are guaranteed, subject to public order and morality.  It is not an unqualified right of free speech and this amendment will not change that.<\/p> <p>It is a curious feature of the proposed amendment of the Constitution that there has not been a fair analysis of what the term \"public morality\" as a constraint on the general right of freedom of expression actually means.  Would there be a right to use freedom of expression as a defence for making statements in public, or publishing them, that would be considered blasphemous by most people if the right of the State to protect public morality is taken into account?<\/p> <p>I approach this from a liberal perspective but I wonder why, in the terms of the Constitution, the criminalisation of blasphemy, indecency and sedition were expressly inserted by the sentence and paragraph with which we are dealing.  They were expressly inserted as a qualification of the right to free speech.  I have no doubt that historically it emanated from a desire to ensure that free speech would not have been used, in the context of 1937, as a defence for what would otherwise have been considered outright blasphemy in publications or utterances.  Therefore, this provision and this sentence must be looked at carefully.<\/p> <p>We are leaving an article in the Constitution which says, oddly, that the utterance of sedition or indecency is an offence that is, and must be, punishable by law.  That is an interesting concept.  To utter something indecent is mandated by the Constitution as a criminal offence and punishable in accordance with law.  The same is currently true of blasphemy.  When one thinks about it, clearly it was not desirable that this kind of criminal legislation was inserted into our Constitution and that something was asserted to be a crime without defining it and it had to be a crime as a matter of constitutional obligation on the State and punishable in accordance with law.  What is left when the word blasphemy is taken out?  There remains an article saying that the utterance or publication of indecency or sedition is an offence punishable by law.  Sedition has a clear meaning.  It is an undermining of the State and a challenge to the State's authority combined with some kind of urge of rejection and overthrow of the State's authority.  That is what most people would understand by the term \"seditious\".<\/p> <p>Indecency, on the other hand, is a concept that is utterly flexible depending on the mores of the time.  What was considered indecent in 1937 is different to what is considered indecent today.  Many things that are published and uttered today and are not considered indecent in 2018 would certainly have scandalised and shocked jurors and judges to the point of a certain conviction in 1937.  We have a conundrum now that a paragraph is being left in the Constitution that says that the publication of seditious or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law but that blasphemy can never fall into that category.<\/p> <p>Senator Bacik said she welcomes the proposal to repeal the section.  I wonder about a possible case in which utter and gross blasphemy is published in a magazine.  If something is published that would offend the great majority of practising Catholics, like a black mass, a complete inversion of the mass, or an association of it with something sexual, or defecatory, or something similar, is that not to be a criminal offence?  Is that to be decriminalised but indecency to remain criminalised?<\/p> <p>A better amendment would have been that the right of free speech and freedom of expression guaranteed by the article may be regulated by the State on the grounds of blasphemy, indecency or sedition and not to say that it is a criminal offence punishable by law but merely say that there is a right on the part of the Oireachtas to defend religious sensibility at some extreme level.  I am mystified that we should now say nothing in Ireland can be prosecuted on the grounds that it causes massive offence by its blasphemous character and it cannot be restrained in any way, whereas something which is indecent - pornography of some kind, although these days it would have to be extreme pornography - is still to be criminalised under the Constitution.  <\/p> <p>This is an all Stages debate and it can be discussed again later, since we are dealing with the Second Stage now, but I would like the Minister of State to explain to me if he thinks that nothing could be published in Ireland of a blasphemous nature that should attract any sanction at all in any circumstance.  To those who say that we need to consider Islam, Judaism, Christianity and various other religions, I say we should remember that Christianity was the central religion of the community that adopted this Constitution and the Preamble still reflects that.  I ask the Minister of State to be clear.  Is it to be the case, as we discuss the principle of this, that nothing of whatever foul, offensive and demeaning nature, striking at the very heart of the Christian faith, can be sanctioned in any way by the State?  That is a radical proposal.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would like people to realise that the withdrawal of this word from the Constitution, coupled with the Minister's stated intention to repeal the relevant sections of the Defamation Act, means this is the situation that will exist after those two steps are taken.

We could have said that the State \"may\" curtail the right of free speech to protect its authority through sedition, protect public morality through laws on indecency or protect religious sensibility on the grounds of blasphemy.  We could have had a different clause in the Constitution.  I doubt that most people would, hand on heart, say that in future anything, no matter how offensive, no matter how repugnant to religion, can be published with impunity in the Irish State.

Obviously, we are putting the question to the people, who will make the decision at the end of the day as to whether this is to be changed.  It is the people's decision and, as has been mentioned by Senator Bacik and others, there have been many reports over the years which have advised that this be put to the people.  The people will decide.  Colleagues who do not agree can obviously campaign on it but we will see what happens when it goes to the people.<\/p> <p>Again, I thank the Seanad for facilitating this debate.  Most speakers have welcomed the proposal to remove the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.  If it is passed here today, the work of the Referendum Commission can begin in earnest.  An order has already been made under the Referendum Act to establish the independent statutory Referendum Commission for the purpose of the referendum which is planned to be held on 26 October next, at the same time as the presidential election.  Again, I think it is good practice to do that because, as mentioned by Senator Bacik and others, it reduces the cost and also facilitates people going to the polls in that they will be voting in the presidential election, and when they are there, they can also give their views on this.  I understand that, in accordance with the Act, the Chief Justice has nominated Ms Justice Isobel Kennedy to act as chairperson to the commission.  The principal purpose of the commission is to prepare, publish and distribute to the electorate statements containing a general explanation of the subject matter of the referendum proposal, to promote awareness of the referendum and to encourage the electorate to vote.  The Government is immensely grateful to the commission for the work it will undertake.<\/p> <p>A number of points have arisen in the debate.  Some Senators, in particular Senator McDowell, queried the retention of the reference to sedition or indecent matter.  I agree that the language is somewhat outdated but this referendum is not a general modernisation of the Constitution.  The context is one aimed at removing a provision which may inhibit legitimate freedom of expression because it has the potential to criminalise that expression.  There is positive harm here which the proposed constitutional amendment is intended to address.  That amendment, if agreed, will also be a small step in emphasising the fact we are a tolerant and inclusive society where diversity and pluralism are evident and where engagement between those with different value systems can take place free of the shadow which the constitutional provision creates.  These broader issues around diversity and tolerance do not arise in respect of the reference to sedition and indecency.  Indeed, I am sure we can all agree it is right and proper that there would, for example, be an offence relating to the production and distribution of child pornography.  Senator McDowell mentioned in his comments that it would want to be very extreme indecency.  However, such damaging material is out there and very available, which we should all be very concerned about.<\/p> <p>As the years and decades go by, our understanding and definitions of these matters develop and change.  Some of what was considered indecent in 1937 would not be considered indecent today.  Likewise, I contend that some material and some offences will always be indecent, no matter what or when.  That is the way it should be.  We must be alert to that and keep debating it, and I welcome the questioning on that.  I agree with regard to the logic behind offences intended to criminalise acts aimed at attacking the constitutional order and institutions of the State, and I suggest we are at one on that.  However, the same imperative to amend the Constitution does not exist in regard to these matters as it does in regard to blasphemy.  The Senator spoke about extremes where religion is concerned.  If we go that far, we get very quickly into the area of incitement of hatred.  There is a balance to be struck there as well.<\/p> <p>I am not sure whether Senator McDowell is for or against the proposal.  I did not hear him say one thing or the other in the end.  However, I welcome the questioning, which is important.  We have general support for the Government's proposal in the House, which I welcome.  Hopefully, the tone of the campaign to come will also be respectful.  I hope that when people see the merits of the proposal, they will vote for deletion.  As I said, there have been repeated calls over the years for the removal of the blasphemy reference from the Constitution and there have been many advocates for change in this area.  It has taken quite a while to bring this to the Houses but we now have an opportunity to deal with the matter and put it to the people.  We are a modern and democratic society where freedom of expression is a core value and we no longer need a constitutional provision, however notional, that acts as an undesirable check to that value.  I very much hope the proposal to remove the offence of blasphemy will get widespread support on 26 October next.<\/p> <p>By way of response to Senator Mullen, the existence of our current constitutional provisions in regard to blasphemy creates an imperative to give effect to that provision in primary legislation.  It does not matter that there have been no successful prosecutions of the offence in living memory.  The provision is there and it identifies Ireland, however incorrectly, as a country which does not value freedom of expression and as a country which gives constitutional protections to a concept which many would regard as obsolete.  Its very existence supports those in other countries where the concept of blasphemy has a very real meaning, a meaning which can entail considerable suffering for those who fall to be punished under the law which supports it.  Senator Bacik and others have alluded to the fact our situation has been used in other jurisdictions in support of that.<\/p> <p>Senator Mullen also raised the possibility that the blasphemy reference should be replaced by a general provision to include a prohibition on incitement to religious hatred.  In reaching its decision as to the course of action to be followed, the Government is conscious of the fact the provision relating to incitement to hatred is likely to prove very difficult to draft at a practical level.  Furthermore, the Government took the view that the Constitution was not the place to address this matter and that the specifics of any incitement to hatred provisions were best addressed in primary legislation, which could, if necessary, evolve over time in an organic way.<\/p> <p>Again, I thank colleagues for a good debate and for raising some important matters.  I look forward to the remaining Stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#HH00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537435800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Cuireadh agus aonta&iacute;odh an cheist.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537435800,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#HH00400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#HH00500","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Repeal of offence of publication or utterance of blasphemous matter) Bill 2018: Committee and Remaining Stages - An Bille um an Seacht&uacute; Leas&uacute; is Tr&iacute;ocha ar an mBunreacht (Cion a aisghairm arb &eacute;ard &eacute; n&iacute; diamhaslach a fhoilsi&uacute; n&oacute; a aithris) 2018: C&eacute;im an Choiste agus na C&eacute;imeanna a bheidh F&aacute;gtha","time":1537435800,"counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#HH00700"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537435800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Aonta&iacute;odh alt a 1.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537435800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Section 1 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537435800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Aonta&iacute;odh alt a 2.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537435800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Section 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537435800,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Aonta&iacute;odh an R&eacute;amhr&aacute;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537435800,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Preamble agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":150,"content":"<p>We move to the Title.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#HH01300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I wanted to debate section 2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#HH01400","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>We have already agreed it.

The Minister of State indicated in his speech that he intends to repeal the criminalisation of blasphemy.  I should say that when I introduced a Bill to replace the Defamation Act 1961 I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, included nothing in respect of blasphemy, although I understand that a subsequent Attorney General was of the view that repealing the 1961 Act without substituting a corresponding offence might itself be seen to be unconstitutional.  I doubted that at the time.  I thought the provision in the Constitution made the offence of blasphemy much like a common law misdemeanour, something that was unlawful and punishable.  I thought that the phrase \"punishable in accordance with law\" did not require a statute but merely that there could be a criminal procedure to punish it and that a just penalty could be applied by the courts, as was the case with many common law misdemeanours for which no maximum penalty was ever set.

May I make the following point?  If the Minister of State does proceed with his stated intention to repeal the provisions of the Defamation Act he will be saying that nobody, in any circumstances, can ever be prosecuted for publishing anything which deeply offends the religious sensibility of the Christian faith in Ireland no matter how gross the offence is.  No matter how gross or how grotesque what is said or done, nobody can be punished.  I do not think that most people are aware that the Government proposes not merely to remove from the Constitution the obligation to criminalise blasphemy, but that it also intends to declare it absolutely open season to say or do anything in public which outrages religious sentiment without any sanction of any kind whatsoever.  I do not think most people are aware that is his intention and I do not think he has made that clear.  I do not think the Government - and I do not mean to personalise it to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, in any way - has said that it intends that, as of next week, any citizen will be able to put up on the Internet the grossest attack on religious belief in the most appalling and filthy way and that it will not be possible to do anything about it unless the Internet service provider intervenes to remove such material on the grounds of its own policies.<\/p> <p>By all means the Government could take this one word out of the Constitution, but if it goes the second step and says that it feels that a consequence of removing it is the decriminalisation of every form of blasphemy, no matter how gross it may be, and if that is its thinking, it should face up to the consequences.  God knows - and I use that phrase loosely - that we have many people here who will choose to go as far as the law permits to offend others and to cause them distress and anger.  We know that will happen.  We really should consider carefully whether we want to go that second step.<\/p> <p>The second point I want to make is that if we do repeal this particular reference to blasphemy in the Constitution it does not follow, either logically or in good sense, that any criminalisation of blasphemy must necessarily fall with it.  The right to free speech is subject to public order and morality.  It strikes me that there is a limitation written into the Constitution, which will not be affected by the particular amendment, which says that the exercise of freedom of expression is guaranteed subject to public morality.  Can the Minister of State say, on behalf of the Government, that anything, not matter how offensive or outrageous, can be published about religion and, at the same time, not involve an infringement of public morality?  I do not think he can.  <\/p> <p>If the Government does table legislation to amend the Defamation Act in order to decriminalise all forms of blasphemy, on the assumption that this particular measure will be passed by the people, that will have to be considered on its merits in those circumstances.  This is not just a package to be sold to the people like repealing the eight amendment and outlining the legislative consequences.  This is not the same as that.  I do not believe that the great majority of people in this country want to have absolute and total open season on causing religious offence by publication.  I do not believe that the people would be happy to see every single vestige of protection of religion from premeditated and vicious blasphemy swept away in the name of liberalism - and I speak as a liberal on that.  People are entitled to have some basic standards of decency or public morality enshrined in the law with regard to the protection of religion.  It is not a great expansion of freedom to tear down every barrier surrounding the sacredness to individuals of their religious beliefs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#JJ00900","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":162,"content":"<p>The section has been agreed and I do not want to open up a debate because I was just about to read the Title to the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#JJ01000","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>It is quite unusual to come back in again when a section has been agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#JJ01100","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>That is why I am saying the Minister of State might be better off not-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092000002#JJ01200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1537435800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I just want to make it clear that this Bill should not be viewed as an attack on belief.

Indecency is as flexible a concept as blasphemy.  There were times when people who doubted and publicly refuted the biblical explanation of the garden of Eden and the story of Adam and Eve were accused of blasphemy.  Obviously blasphemy as a concept is one which has changed with the passage of time, as has indecency.  There is no doubt about that.  The mere fact that the term &quot;blasphemy&quot; is difficult to pin down is not the problem here, because Members are quite happy to leave &quot;indecency&quot; in the Constitution and to say that the publication or utterance of indecent matter, whatever that means, must be punishable in accordance with law.  That is what this amendment is actually setting out to do; to consciously leave that in the Constitution and to leave it to the law, to lawyers and juries in certain circumstances, to decide whether something is or is not indecent in the context of a criminal prosecution.<\/p><p>I would not have put this phrase into the Constitution at all had I been a constitutional draftsman.  I do not think it is particularly necessary.  However, the stated intention of the Government as announced by the Minister of State here is to decriminalise everything that up to now could have been considered blasphemy.  It is not just a matter of hatred or violence.<\/p><p>I refer to the <i>Charlie Hebdo <\/i>incident in Paris.  The mere fact that one could say something about the Prophet Muhammad which was so offensive to people that they became violent could not possibly be grounds for prohibiting one from publishing the cartoon in the <i>Charlie Hebdo <\/i>case.  It is not the reaction, the extremity of the reaction or the probable consequences that I am talking about.  It is the actual concept of saying that freedom of expression carries with it the right to utterly deride, devalue and create contempt for the religious thoughts of others.  What we are actually doing in twinning this constitutional amendment to a proposal to decriminalise blasphemy of whatever kind and in whatever circumstance is declaring open season for blasphemy hereafter.  I repeat, open season.  There is no constraint, unless, of course, some clever lawyer comes up with the idea that public morality brings blasphemy back in through the back door.<\/p><p>I do not believe that we should simply passively watch this be removed in the context of a Government commitment to utterly decriminalise all forms of blasphemy no matter how extreme and let it go without comment.  That is the only reason I am contributing.  I am a liberal.  I have no problem whatsoever with people mocking each other's religions.  I am not simply talking about &quot;Father Ted&quot; or something like that.  I have no problem at all with people deriding the views of the Mormons or the Scientologists, if Scientology was to be considered a religion, or whoever.  I have no problem with people mocking and knocking the religious views of others.  I am saying there are things at the very extreme about which a society is entitled to say, &quot;That goes too far&quot;.
