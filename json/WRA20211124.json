The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention. <\/p><p>I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.\u00a0 <\/p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 12 November, over 277,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed or have surveys underway and over 125,000 premises have build currently underway. NBI has also advised that the first premises are connected in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan and over 30,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 12 counties.\u00a0Surveys are complete or underway in County Offaly in the areas around Brosna, Shinrone, Mount Heaton, Clonbrennan and Boherapucha Townlands and areas close to the county boundary with Tipperary. Surveys are also underway in the Moate Deployment Area. I understand that there are some\u00a01,500 premises in County Offaly with build works currently underway.<\/p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Offaly through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the Intervention Area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website <i>www.nbi.ie<\/i>. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range. Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. <\/p><p>In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. <\/p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 12 November, 389 \u00a0BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Irish Parachute Club (within 5.6km of all three premises referred to), Coolderry Community Hall, Croghan Community Hall, Seir Kieran Community Hall, Shannon Harbour, Primo Coaches, Ballycommon Telework\u00a0and Training Centre, Kilclonfert Community Centre and\u00a0Killavilla Community Centre. Further details can be found at <i>nbi.ie\/bcp-locations\/<\/i>. <\/p><p>Lumcloon National.School and Shinrone National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.\u00a0 Further details are available on the NBI website at <i>nbi.ie\/primary-schools-list\/<\/i>. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400077#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1479"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400077#WRC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[57897\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400077#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if personnel in his Department have been removed from their positions, have been transferred to another role or had their employment terminated from 2011 to date due to breaches of Departmental standards or professional misconduct or incompetence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>The Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour and the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995\u00a0set out clear expectations of the standards required for staff in their conduct and discharge of duties.<\/p><p>I can confirm that from 2011 to date, no staff member in my Department has been removed from their position or transferred to another role due to breaches of standards or professional misconduct or incompetence. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400077#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Fisheries","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400077#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[58021\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400077#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will provide an update on the development of the new policy and regulatory framework for inland fisheries in Ireland; the way in which stakeholders and the wider public will be involved in developing this framework; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>A number of draft policy papers are currently being finalised in my Department in the context of creating a new modern policy framework for the inland fisheries sector with a focus on protection and conservation.

The conditions under which motor vehicles can be placed on the market in the EU have been harmonised through the EU&rsquo;s internal market competence under Article 114 TFEU; in principle any vehicle meeting the requirements of the Type Approval Framework under Directive 2007\/46\/EC2 should be permitted to be sold anywhere in the EU.<\/p><p>Ireland was signatory to a non-paper to the Commission earlier this year requesting a phase-out date for the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the EU in line with the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 as well as the introduction of a legal framework that allows Member States to move ahead by taking action at national level to incentivise early phase-out of new petrol and diesel cars and vans.

The National Transport Authority (NTA) is also engaged with public transport operators regarding the issue of anti-social behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been engaging regularly with the NTA and the three CI&Eacute; companies, on the issue of anti-social behaviour and in relation to ensuring the safety of passengers and staff.  In their responses, all three companies stressed their strong and close working relationships with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to these issues. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, while I am of course concerned to ensure that the necessary arrangements are in place to ensure the safety of all passengers and staff, the allocation of all Garda resources, including the manner in which Garda personnel are deployed, is solely a decision for the Garda Commissioner and his management team.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the action being taken to ensure the safety of transport workers and passengers, my Department has been advised by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that a joint Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann\/Garda focus on public order and antisocial behaviour has been in place since May 2021. A particular focus has been across the Greater Dublin Area with emphasis on the DART, Northern Line and Heuston to Portlaoise services.<\/p>  <p>  A new security monitoring centre, which is in operation since January 2021, has played a key role in targeting high risk locations. A text alert service is in place to enable customers to discreetly report anti-social behaviour incidents and allow security personnel and\/or Garda&iacute; to be alerted and dispatched as required to an incident. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's annual spend on security has risen from &euro;3.7 million in 2016 to an expected spend this year of &euro;5.2 million. This has led to an increase in security resources with up to 20 security teams operating daily on-board trains and in stations.<\/p>  <p>  Transdev Dublin Light Rail, who operate the Luas network on behalf of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, employ 50 security staff. These staff are involved in maintaining safety and security on the Luas, along with enforcing the Luas bye-laws. They liaise with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly as part of their work.<\/p>  <p>  Both Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann have reported that the level of anti-social behaviour is relatively low on their services and noted a declining trend, which is positive.<\/p>  <p>  The entire Dublin Bus fleet is fully fitted with CCTV cameras, with up to 10 internal cameras and two external cameras fitted on the more modern vehicles in the fleet. Each vehicle is equipped with a radio, which facilitates immediate contact to the Central Control Centre.<\/p>  <p>  All of the company's buses are in radio contact with Central Control. Any instances of disruption or concerns around security are immediately reported and services are suspended as necessary. The company also has mobile inspectors in the city centre, who are available to attend incidents as required.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin Bus operates a schools education programme, which involves educating young people about the importance of the bus in their lives and in their local communities. This has proven highly successful in encouraging young people to respect their bus and has assisted in the reduction of incidents of anti-social behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has invested in extensive CCTV coverage throughout its fleet for the protection of passengers and staff and driver security screens are fitted to the entire low-floor, single-deck and double-deck bus fleet.<\/p>  <p>  Emergency support for drivers is provided through 24-hour control centres and any incidents of anti-social behaviour are fully investigated and followed up with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required.<\/p>  <p>  The measures in place and those planned are yielding and will continue to yield results, however this is an issue which will require continuing joint action.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister, I will continue to work collectively with all stakeholders to ensure the safest possible travel environment for members of the public, and safest possible working environment for the employees providing our valuable public transport services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400077#WRC05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400077#WRC05300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400077#WRC05200"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[57765\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400077#WRC05300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total tax take on the purchase of a standard one litre petrol driven car retailing at &euro;20,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[57766\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400077#WRC05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total tax take on the purchase of a standard one litre diesel driven car retailing at &euro;20,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":81,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[57767\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400077#WRC05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total tax take on the purchase of a standard one litre LPG driven car retailing at &euro;20,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[57768\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400077#WRC05600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total tax take on the purchase of a standard 1.6 litre petrol driven car retailing at &euro;33,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":83,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[57769\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400077#WRC05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total tax take on the purchase of a standard 1.6 litre diesel driven car retailing at &euro;33,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":84,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[57771\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400077#WRC05800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total tax take on the purchase of a standard 1.6 litre electric driven car retailing at &euro;33,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":85,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 to 63, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>I assume the Deputy is referring to Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT).

Government cannot instruct a company to provide insurance cover in any circumstance; this position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which prohibits Member States from intervening in such a manner.  <\/p><p>Nevertheless, the Government recognises the fact that a number of outdoor\/high-footfall activity sectors, including equestrian pursuits, are facing difficulty in terms of affordability and availability of insurance. It has therefore prioritised the implementation of the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform<\/i>. The first Action Plan Implementation Report, which was published in July, shows that tangible progress has been made, with 34 of the 66 actions contained in the Action Plan having been completed.<\/p><p>One of the key achievements in the first half of this year was the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines some six months ahead of schedule. Early data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) shows that since the commencement of the new Guidelines award levels have reduced by an average of 40%. This is an encouraging development and it is my hope that this trend will result in lower costs for businesses.  As the insurance reform agenda progresses, we will continue to hold the industry to account on its commitments to pass on savings from the Guidelines, and other elements of the reforms, to customers. Minister of State Fleming met last week with the CEO&rsquo;s of main insurance companies operating in Ireland, and he impressed upon them the need to both reduce premiums and increase their risk appetite to offer cover in new or underserved areas. <\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Cabinet Committee on Insurance Reform is tasked with overseeing the implementation of the Action Plan and is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste. Work remains ongoing on a whole-of Government basis to ensure the timely implementation of the remaining elements of the Action plan. Of particular relevance is the fact that the Minister for Justice has signalled her intention to bring forward legislative changes to the duty of care. It is understood that these are at an advanced stage and it is hoped that they will have a significant impact on the issue of &lsquo;slips, trips and falls&rsquo;, which will significantly assist the sporting and outdoor activity sector as a whole. <\/p><p>Securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government. Therefore I would like to emphasise that it is my intention to continue to work with my Government colleagues and ensure that the implementation of the Action Plan will continue to have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for all individuals, businesses and community groups across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400078#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400078#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[57858\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400078#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there are exemptions for a farmer who has zoned land from the proposed levy under the Finance Bill 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":97,"content":"<p>Finance Bill 2021 introduces the &lsquo;Residential Zoned Land Tax&rsquo; into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, giving effect to a measure I announced on Budget day.  This measure is part of the suite of measures included in the &lsquo;Housing for All&rsquo; Strategy, which was published by the Government in September 2021.  The Residential Zoned Land Tax is designed to prompt residential development by owners of land that is zoned for residential or mixed-use purposes and that is serviced.  It will replace the Vacant Site Levy when it comes into operation. <\/p><p>The Residential Zoned Land Tax is an annual tax, calculated at a rate of 3% of the market value of the land. It applies to land that is both zoned as suitable for residential development and is serviced. It will not apply to land on which development cannot take place by reason of its physical condition, for example land which is contaminated.  <\/p><p>There are a limited number of exclusions from the measure.

The purpose of publishing the draft map is to allow landowners, including farmers, to see if their land is within scope of the tax.

If the landowner believes that the land is not serviced, or falls into one of the specific limited exclusions from the tax, they can make a submission to the local authority seeking to have the map updated and their land removed from the map. <\/p><p>The local authority will consider the submission and make a determination on whether the land should stay on the map or be removed from it.

This variation procedure, and the local authority&rsquo;s decision on whether or not to commence one, is part of the normal zoning process. <\/p><p>Tax on land which is suitable for residential development on 1 January 2022 because it is both zoned and serviced on that date, and on which development has not commenced before 1 February 2024, will be due and payable in May 2024.  Where the land becomes both zoned and serviced after 1 January 2022, tax will be chargeable in the third year after it comes within scope of the tax.<\/p><p>Agricultural land that is zoned and serviced and which is, therefore, suitable for residential development, will be within the scope of the tax.  The application of the tax to such land must be looked at in terms of the ability of a local authority to plan effectively for the development of their area and the country&rsquo;s current need for additional housing. Land, including agricultural land, that a local authority zones as suitable for residential development and which is serviced, is land that can be objectively identified as suitable for the development of homes in an area in which a need for housing exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400078#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":98,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400078#WRD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":99,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[57898\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400078#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if personnel in his Department have been removed from their positions, have been transferred to another role or had their employment terminated from 2011 to date due to breaches of Departmental standards or professional misconduct or incompetence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":100,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy, that since 2011 there was one staff member in the Department of Finance who had their employment terminated, due to breaches of Departmental and Civil Service standards and professional misconduct. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400078#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400078#WRD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[57959\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400078#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to concerns of customers of some financial institutions that were mis-sold mortgages and the failure of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman to pursue legitimate complaints; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":103,"content":"<p>Firstly, I must point out that the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) is independent in the performance of his statutory functions.

At that time, apartments had become a more common form of dwelling in urban areas, comprising 11% of all occupied households in Ireland and almost one-third of occupied households in Dublin City (Census 2011).  By 2016, this had risen to 12%.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2018, my Department published updated Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments Guidelines for Planning Authorities to respond to continuing changing housing need, particularly in light of the dynamics in the urban employment market, as well as ongoing demographic trends.  Chapter 5 of the 2018 Guidelines addressed the relatively new 'build-to-rent' sector and set out a number of key distinct characteristics.  Build-to-rent projects are usually a single entity investment for long term rental undertaking, comprising individual residential units within the development that are not sold off separately for private ownership and\/or subsequent sub-letting individually, which is a key difference from the traditional housing development model. The guidelines provide for planning permission for specific build-to-rent developments to be sought from a planning authority. Build-to-Rent developments have specific planning requirements for the provision of dedicated amenities and facilities specifically for residents in terms of communal recreational space, work spaces and cooking\/dining facilities as well as a range of other support services such as laundry facilities, concierge, management, repair and maintenance. <\/p>  <p>  Build-to-Rent development forms a relatively small proportion of all planning applications lodged.  As of the end of October 2021, a total of 58,702  residential units in total had been approved under the Strategic Housing Development (SHD) process, comprising 14,118  Houses, 34,637  Apartments and 9,945 Build-to-Rent units.  Build-to-Rent continues to make up around 16% of the total residential units approved under the SHD process.  The amount of approved Build-to-Rent developments is a relatively small proportion of the total.  Following a review of co-living in 2020, updated Sustainable Urban Development guidelines were published and I have no plans to further amend the guidelines at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400078#WRD03775","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400078#WRD03800"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[57847\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400078#WRD03900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount collected under the Derelict Sites Act 1990 as amended by each local authority in 2018, 2019 and 2020, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":136,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[57848\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400078#WRD04000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of compulsory purchase orders undertaken under the Derelict Sites Act 1990 as amended by each local authority in 2018, 2019 and 2020, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":137,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 79 together.<\/p><p>The information requested is outlined the attached spreadsheet.<\/p><p>The Derelict Sites Act 1990 confers significant powers upon local authorities, including requiring owners or occupiers to take appropriate measures on derelict sites, acquiring derelict sites by agreement, or compulsorily, and applying a derelict sites levy on derelict sites.

The recent report on Afghanistan from the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom is troubling, outlining the constraints on religious freedom in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, including the reinstatement of the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. Reports of widespread persecution of religious minorities are alarming, as is the finding that those belonging to religious minorities are now living under fear of reprisals for practicing their religion.<\/p>  <p>  The right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion (more commonly referred to as freedom of religion and belief) is a fundamental freedom, provided for under Article 18 of both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights. It is a priority for Ireland&rsquo;s human rights engagement at both multilateral and bilateral levels and we consistently co-sponsors resolutions on freedom of religion or belief at the UN.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland fully subscribes to the EU benchmarks, set out in Council Conclusions on 15 September, which outline our expectations of the Taliban. Future EU support will depend on respect for the international legal framework and norms on human rights. The Conclusions call on the Taliban to promote, protect and respect all human rights, including those of persons belonging to minorities. <\/p>  <p>  This document forms the basis of EU contact with the Taliban, including the scheduled meetings in Doha this coming weekend, led by EU Special Envoy Tomas Niklasson. The conditions do not preclude a certain level of working contact required for humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people and evacuation of EU nationals. The Conclusions are clear that such contact does not confer any legitimacy on the Taliban. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also expressed concern about the human rights situation in Afghanistan at the United Nations Human Rights Council. On 7 October, at the 48th Session of the Human Rights Council, an EU-led Resolution was adopted on the Situation of Human Rights in Afghanistan. The resolution established a mandate for a Special Rapporteur (SR) to to monitor the situation of human rights in Afghanistan.

These drivers include: poverty; lack of access to services; weak state structures, including security; cross-border security threats; rapidly increasing populations; climate change; and diminishing access to resources.  Increased violence against civilians, including the killings of over 160 civilians in June and 59 civilians in August, is the regrettable outworking of these tensions, which also may have a sectarian dimension. <\/p><p>I condemn all attacks on civilians in Burkina Faso, in the wider Sahel and elsewhere, irrespective of who the perpetrators of such violence are, and their purported motives.

The Departments guidance outlines CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas\/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. <\/p><p>In excess of 35,400 monitors were delivered to schools nationwide at a cost of circa &euro;4 million. <\/p><p>A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation. Officers are also available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices etc.  Where it is not possible for a school to access the expertise of an engineer or architect, and where necessary, a technical assessment to assist the school can be facilitated through the Department.<\/p><p>Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.<\/p><p>The Expert Group also notes the potential use for air cleaners<i>&ldquo;consider using stand-alone high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter devices to further reduce airborne virus in poorly ventilated spaces&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>The Departments Guidance is clear that where the recommended measures in the Practical Steps and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room\/area, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available. This is line with Expert Group guidance which identifies that in areas with poor ventilation that structural interventions and measures to increase natural ventilation should be completed.

I fully appreciate the strong emotional attachment we all have to our pets and that theft not only leads to their loss in our lives, but also a high level of concern for their welfare. It is also a crime which often affects, and is indeed often targeted against, older and particularly vulnerable people, for whom their pet is of huge emotional importance.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that theft offences already apply to this crime, and can carry very heavy penalties. The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides for a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment in the case of offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment is provided for the offence of possession of stolen property.<\/p>  <p>  When imposing sentence, judges are not limited to considering the monetary value of a pet &ndash; the emotional distress to the victim caused by the offence is absolutely relevant and can be, and is, taken into account where appropriate. However, I acknowledge that the existing offence considers the offence as being one against property rather than a person or an animal and I am committed to examining the options to address the issue, including, if necessary, making legislative changes.<\/p>  <p>  From an enforcement perspective, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take this issue very seriously and have conducted several important actions against those responsible. Garda&iacute; have also disseminated information through the national Crime Prevention Officer Network regarding keeping animals secure and preventing these forms of theft. The Garda National Crime Prevention Unit's advice on pet safety, which is in line with the advice from animal welfare groups and animal insurance companies about keeping animals safe, can be viewed on the Garda website. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise the importance of microchipping. Every dog must be microchipped by the time it reaches 12 weeks of age, or earlier if it is sold or moved from its place of birth (Microchipping of Dogs Regulation 2015), and the microchip must be registered with an authorised database. Microchipping of all dogs protects the animals&rsquo; welfare, and assists with speedy identification of lost or stolen dogs and their owners. It is an offence to keep a dog over 12 weeks that has not been chipped; it&rsquo;s an offence to sell such a dog. Microchips can be easily checked at vets and by Garda&iacute;. They are by far and away the most effective means of tracking and identifying dogs. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture have also made regulations covering the advertising for sale of animals under the Animal Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pets Regulations) 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400081#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400081#WRG02600"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[57787\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400081#WRG02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the engagement her Department has had with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the booster vaccine roll-out includes the prison population given the nature of the congregated setting; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":309,"content":"<p>I can advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service continues to engage with Public Health\/Health Services Executive with regard to access to the Covid-19 booster vaccine. <\/p><p>Prisoners will receive their booster vaccinations in line with the roll of the booster vaccination in the general community. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that a prison vaccination programme commenced on a prison by prison basis in June this year and Covid-19 vaccinations were administered to all prisoners who wished to avail of them by the National Ambulance Service and Prison Service healthcare teams.<\/p><p>The vast majority of prisoners availed of the vaccine with over 85% of the prison population being vaccinated.

This includes the retention of emergency COVID-19 funding of &euro;400,000 to address the impact of the pandemic on support services and an additional &euro;785,000 in direct supports to NGOs and for specific domestic violence intervention programmes. This will be important to ensure the momentum gained in supporting victims of domestic and sexual violence throughout the pandemic continues to grow. <\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on ring-fenced funding, as part of the<i>Supporting a Victim's Journey<\/i>plan, my Department recently undertook a review of the Victims of Crime and Domestic, Sexual, Gender Based Violence funding in order to ensure that the grants we provide are as effective as possible in supporting victims of crime within criminal justice processes. <\/p><p>An important acknowledgment that has come out of the review is that that long-term funding commitments can offer organisations funding certainty and assist them to better plan for the future.

Details of all NCPE rapid reviews and Health Technology Assessments (HTAs) are available on their website.<\/p>  <p>  While the 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a different rule set when assessing orphan drugs, there are no legal barriers to the consideration of orphan drugs for reimbursement. In carrying out pricing\/reimbursement assessments of new drugs, the HSE is mindful to take into account the unique circumstances that apply to orphan drugs, such as the small patient numbers and the nature of the condition to be treated.<\/p>  <p>  The allocation of &euro;50m for new medicines in 2021, described by the pharmaceutical industry as &ldquo;a game-changer&rdquo;, has had a significant impact on the availability of orphan drugs in Ireland this year. This funding has enabled the HSE to approve 43 new medicines\/expanded uses of existing medicines to date (as of 12th November), 15 of which have been for the treatment of rare diseases.<\/p>  <p>  The allocation of &euro;30m for new medicines in 2022 will ensure that patients continue to get access to new and innovative medicines, including those for the treatment of rare diseases.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving an application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach reimbursement decisions on all medicines, including orphan drugs, in as timely a manner as possible. However, it must ensure that the best possible price is achieved, as these commitments often represent multimillion-euro investments on an ongoing basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a number of key changes in the HSE assessment process of medicines within the confines of the 2013 Health Act.  These have included changes to the HSE Drugs Group, whose membership has been expanded to include representatives from the National Patients Forum and more clinical expertise in the area of rare diseases.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2018, the HSE Leadership appointed a Technology Review Committee for Rare Diseases (RDTRC) to complement the existing assessment process. This Committee&rsquo;s reviews provide an opportunity for input from patients and families impacted by rare diseases, as well as from clinicians with expertise in the treatment of rare diseases.<\/p>  <p>  Any potential new work streams for 2022 in relation to new medicines (for the treatment of rare diseases or otherwise) will be considered in the context of the HSE&rsquo;s upcoming National Service Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400082#WRH01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":357,"content":"<p>Question No. 163 answered with Question No. 162.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":359,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[57866\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400082#WRH01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the review of the governance structures regarding the HSE drug reimbursement process by a company (details supplied) still remains under consideration by his Department despite being submitted to his Department in January 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":360,"content":"<p>Following a tender by the Office of Government Procurement, Mazars conducted a review of the governance structures around the HSE's drug reimbursement process.

These conditions are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.<\/p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.

In its most recent vaccine safety update (published 4th November) it noted that, whilst not experienced by everyone, all vaccines have some side effects, the vast majority of which are mild to moderate in nature. These side effects need to be continuously balanced against the benefits in preventing COVID-19 illness. Overall, the national reporting experience continues to support the favourable assessment that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines massively outweigh the risks. This, of course, does not detract from any adverse reaction individuals may experience but does provide assurance that the vaccines are safe and that we should continue to have confidence in them.  <\/p><p><i>Supports for Healthcare Workers<\/i><\/p><p>The Deputy is advised that work is ongoing with respect to the development of a scheme to benefit the families of frontline healthcare workers who died from COVID-19, where it is likely that they contracted the virus in work.

It was chaired by the High Court judge, Mr. Justice Charles Meenan. The expert group examined the system from the perspective of the person who has made the claim to explore if there is a better way to deal effectively, yet more sensitively, with certain cases. <\/p><p>Mr. Justice Meenan submitted the final report on the current system for managing clinical negligence claims to the then Minister for Health and Minister for Justice in January 2020, prior to the onset of the Covid pandemic. The Government subsequently published the Meenan report in December 2020. One of the report's recommendations is that a compensation scheme be established.<\/p><p>On foot of a request from my Department, the Health Research Board, HRB, carried out an evidence review on the vaccine injury redress programme in other jurisdictions, which was completed in March 2019. The expert group's report, in addition to the HRB's evidence review, and consultation with other Departments and relevant State agencies will inform the development of proposals regarding the establishment of a compensation scheme, including the need for primary legislation, and work to advance policy development in this regard is under way in the Department.<\/p><p>Finally, there are no plans at present for the introduction in Ireland of a COVID-19 specific vaccine compensation scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400083#WRJ06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":460,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400084#WRK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":461,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[57804\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400084#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a child (details supplied) in County Kerry will receive a date for an assessment by CAMHS; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":462,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400084#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":463,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400084#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":464,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[57806\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400084#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the impact of the current Covid-19 surge on outpatient waiting lists; and the way he plans to tackle same.","asker":"1478","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":465,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last twenty months as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently as a result of the ransomware attack. While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  The current surge in Covid-19 cases has put increasing pressures on hospitals and ICUs. As part of the response to this the HSE has advised all Hospital Groups to take a series of immediate actions which include a 14 day period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and time sensitive work in particular in Model 4 hospitals. The situation is to be reviewed after that period.<\/p>  <p>  On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.

The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.   <\/p>  <p>  For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400084#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":466,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400084#WRK00800"},{"type":"question","counter":467,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[57807\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112400084#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will advise on a matter raised in correspondence by a person (details supplied);
