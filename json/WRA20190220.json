Over the three year period 2016 to 2018, some 72,000 additional households across the country had their housing needs met.\u00a0 In 2018 alone, just over 27,100 households were supported, 6% ahead of the overall target for the year.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In January 2018, I committed to publishing individual targets for housing delivery in each local authority area to enable greater transparency and accountability when it comes to increasing the stock of social housing and responding to social housing needs more generally.\u00a0 With over &euro;6 billion committed to Rebuilding Ireland, it is vital that this public funding is used efficiently to deliver new homes and that this can be demonstrated clearly.<\/p>  <p>  Data in relation to 2018 social housing output against target, broken down by local authority area,\u00a0has just been published on the statistics page of my Department's website. Overall, a\u00a0very strong performance versus the national target for the year was achieved.\u00a0\u00a0That is not to say, however, that delivery by individual local authorities was consistently strong.\u00a0 At a Housing Summit with local authority Chief Executives last week, I took the opportunity to discuss their individual delivery pipelines and I heard from them about local plans and actions to further accelerate output. <\/p>  <p>  Looking specifically at build, acquisition and leasing schemes, Rebuilding Ireland supported local authorities to deliver 8,422 homes to households on their waiting lists in 2018. This included:<\/p>  <p>   - 3,410 local authority and AHB new build, 2,022 of which were delivered through local authorities, plus 841 local authority and AHB Part V homes, bringing the overall new build figure for 2018\u00a0to 4,251, up 85% on 2017;<\/p>  <p>   - 560 voids;<\/p>  <p>   - 2,610 local authority and AHB acquisitions, up 17% on 2017; and <\/p>  <p>   - 1,001 local authority and AHB leases, up 21% on 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The evolution of the social housing programme is clear from the overall 2018 performance.\u00a0 While the level of new build social housing homes was more than 8 times the level in 2015, the year before Rebuilding Ireland was introduced, the level of new HAP supports remained static last year and will decline over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that the blend of delivery will vary across areas depending on local circumstances. However,\u00a0my message to local authorities has been consistent and it is a message that every possible effort must be made to, at minimum, achieve our targets, if not exceed them.\u00a0 The range of delivery schemes, funding and resources\u00a0are in place\u00a0to support this and while I am pleased that 2018 showed a strong performance overall, there is no room for complacency.\u00a0 I will therefore be continuing to engage proactively with local authorities to ensure that any impediments to progress are addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000075#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":13,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 27 to 31, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Loan Scheme","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000075#WRA01150"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[8475\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000075#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the allocations of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan; if further allocations will become available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan launched on 1 February 2018.

It was felt that this was a good opportunity to highlight the ongoing reconciliation work taking place in Northern Ireland and the support provided by South Africa to the Irish Peace Process.  Stellenbosch University has an existing strong relationship with Queens University Belfast and is a respected institution in South Africa. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the conference organisers, faced with strong local protests about the participation of Israeli academics, tried to devise a formula which would describe the Israeli academics as being present in their personal capacities, and not as representatives of Israel or of their universities.

The absence of the Israeli participants from this conference was regrettable, and this is clearly also the view of Stellenbosch University.<\/p>  <p>  I am convinced that peacebuilding and reconciliation work is very important and a positive contribution to conflict resolution, and I believe that this conference, despite this unfortunate situation, nonetheless played a valuable role in this regard.

Future appointments will be made on foot of my rights as shareholder in each of the banks and not using the powers contained in the Credit Institutions Financial Support (CIFS) Act as was the case with public interest directors. Pursuant to these rights I, as Minister for Finance, can appoint up to two directors to the boards of both AIB and PTSB and one director to the board of Bank of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Public Appointment Service, PAS, established a transparent process to identify appropriately skilled candidates for nomination to the three banks in which the State holds a shareholding. This process involves an independent assessment panel compiling a list of suitable applicants following which a preferred candidate(s) is selected by myself, as Minister for Finance. This preferred candidate would then be proposed as the Ministerial nominee to the individual institutions, who in turn will conduct the required governance and submit the candidate for SSM approval in line with their regulatory requirements.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 separate processes began in AIB, PTSB and BOI to appoint new state nominated directors under the updated regime. With regard to AIB, the preferred candidates have been proposed to the bank and are currently undergoing the standard fitness and probity assessments by the regulators. The processes at PTSB and BOI are ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that any company director, regardless of whether or not they are a State nominated director, is subject to the requirements of company law to act in what he or she believes to be the interests of the company to which they are appointed. These are the director&rsquo;s fiduciary duties which are owed to the company rather than to the appointing shareholder. However under the Companies Act 2014 (as amended) there is a provision allowing a nominee director to have regard to the interests of the appointing shareholder.<\/p>  <p>  I would also note that the new appointment procedure for bank directors needs to have due regard to the distinct differences which exist relative to appointments to State boards. These include the requirements of the central SSM &lsquo;Fitness and Probity&rsquo; regime and the requirement to have a broad set of expertise relevant to large regulated entities in an ever more complex banking regulatory environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000077#WRC03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":176,"content":"<p>Question No. 89 answered with Question No. 87.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Staff Remuneration","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000077#WRC03400"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[8579\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000077#WRC03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the increased number of staff in NAMA that earn more than &euro;100,000 per annum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":179,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my response of 12 February 2019 in which I provided details of NAMA staff remuneration for 2018.

The Deputy will be aware that an overview of progress since the Strategy was published in relation to each of the nine areas of action is set out in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht&rsquo;s &lsquo;Action Plan 2018-2022&rsquo; which can be accessed here - .<\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that my Department&rsquo;s Third Irish Language Scheme 2018 &ndash; 2021, which can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website or via the link - , includes a number of commitments to increase the number and quality of the Irish language services provided to the public and to promote the use of the Irish language in the Department.  <\/p><p>The 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language provides that language schemes will specify the posts within an organisation that require an Irish language competency.  The Department&rsquo;s recruitment policy, which is subject to the framework of agreed national recruitment procedures, has regard to the need to improve Irish language capability on an incremental basis.  I can advise the Deputy that it is expected that the recruitment of staff to the Department through the Public Appointments Service, with the appropriate level of competence in the Irish language, will be the primary means of optimising the availability of services through Irish.  The Department keeps the requirements of posts under review, but currently there are no posts for which a competency in Irish is essential.  <\/p><p>The Strategy also provides that language awareness and language training programmes need to be developed so that a higher proportion of public service staff are functional in Irish and can deliver services in Irish to customers who seek them.  I can advise the Deputy that the Department&rsquo;s Language Scheme also provides that the Department will promote all forms of Irish language further education and it is committed to making available opportunities for staff to attend accredited Irish language training courses.  There is also a voluntary panel of Department staff in place who have competence to engage in Irish, as required.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that other commitments set out in the Department&rsquo;s Language Scheme include assigning an Irish Language Officer to oversee implementation of the Language Scheme and the Official Languages Act 2003 in addition to promoting cultural initiatives which support and encourage the use of the Irish language in the Department, increasing the number of press releases in Irish and creating a greater Irish language presence on the Department&rsquo;s social media platforms.  <\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to providing quality services in Irish to its customers and ensuring that there are adequate language resources within the Department to provide the required level of Irish language service.  <\/p><p>My Department is liaising with the Bodies under its aegis regarding their progress in implementing the relevant actions in the 20 Year Strategy and I will revert to the Deputy with those details in line with Standing Orders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000077#WRC04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000077#WRC04500"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[8638\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000077#WRC04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to situations by which persons who may need to go into a nursing home are seeing insurance companies in some instances increasing their house insurance premiums by nearly four times the original amount in addition to requesting that the electricity and water be turned off; if legislation can be brought forward which would allow a person who had to go into a nursing home to get public liability cover for their home in case of intruders on their property; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":189,"content":"<p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of policyholders.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland on foot of the Deputy&rsquo;s query to understand more about the process.  Insurance Ireland advised that generally, if a person vacates their property for an indefinite period, it may alter the level of cover provided or an insurer may require that the property is in a good state of repair and regularly maintained while left unoccupied.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland also stated that if a property is unoccupied, it is important to ensure that measures are taken such as draining the water system and turning the heating on frequently to protect against frozen pipes during periods of cold weather, and that any alarm system is monitored and maintained appropriately.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query regarding whether legislation could be introduced to allow for a person that had to go into a nursing home to get public liability cover for their home in case of intruders on their property, it should be noted that Public Liability policies protect an insured person in respect to their legal liability to third parties for bodily injury, and for any loss or damage to their material property.  Public liability insurance does not cover loss or theft of the policyholder&rsquo;s own personal property.  The decision of whether or not to take out public liability insurance is for each individual to make in respect of their own property and, as mentioned above, the provision or pricing of insurance products are commercial matters to be determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000077#WRC04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":190,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 95 to 97, inclusive, answered with Question No. 87.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Enforcement Activity","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000077#WRC05100"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[8734\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000077#WRC05200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that a person (details supplied) has supplied sufficient evidence to show that they reside in County Derry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[8735\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000077#WRC05300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that a person (details supplied) is resident in County Derry; the reason the person was issued a compromise release term to release a seized vehicle; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 99 together.<\/p>  <p>  As previously advised to the Deputy in my reply to Question 6323\/19, Revenue issued a compromise settlement offer (in lieu of forfeiture) to the person on 28 January 2019 following correspondence received from him in October 2018.

However the two issues are sufficiently closely connected that I believe there is a need to be careful about requesting such commitments, particularly in the context of competition in the sector, as it may send a signal to other insurers about what pricing levels might be.  This is particularly the case in the context of ongoing investigations into the insurance sector by both the European Commission and the CCPC.  <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  <\/p>  <p>  However, the above said, I would expect that insurers&rsquo; pricing for motor premia in general would take account of the measures that have been implemented and are being implemented as a result of the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s  (CIWG) recommendations.  In particular it is envisaged that the full implementation of all the recommendations taken cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, can achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and businesses, and a more stable and competitive insurance market.  <\/p>  <p>  I believe that insurers recognise that the implementation of the CIWG recommendations will have a positive impact on pricing.  In this regard, I would recall that Justice Nicholas Kearns, the Chairperson of the Personal Injuries Commission, noted in the foreword of the PIC&rsquo;s second and final report that insurance industry representatives on the PIC repeatedly stated that, as award levels and associated costs account for the bulk of the cost of insurance, if claims costs come down and are maintained at a consistent and predictable level, then premiums will also reduce accordingly.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I believe it is important to acknowledge that pricing in the motor insurance market has stabilised over the last year, albeit it is accepted that premiums are still at a high level for many people and that further decreases would be desirable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000078#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000078#WRD00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Children's Hospital Expenditure","counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000078#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[8584\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000078#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the details of all contacts which were made by an office (details supplied) in respect of cost overruns of the national children&rsquo;s hospital.","asker":"1222","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":201,"content":"<p>As I stated in the D&aacute;il on the 7<sup>th<\/sup>February I met the official to whom the Deputy refers on Tuesday 5<sup>th<\/sup>February.

Formal Notice to that effect was issued to the Government by the European Commission in November 2013 drawing attention to \"a potential breach of Article 24\" of that Directive. This also sought the Government's observations, including by reference to the on-going development of what was then the Legal Services Regulation Bill of 2011. As public documents, the 2013 Notice of a potential breach and the related Reasoned Opinion issued by the European Commission on 24 January 2019 are matters of public record. While the main focus of these documents is on certain aspects of the current regulations that apply to advertising under the Solicitors' Acts 1954-2015, they also reflect my Department's earnest engagement with the Commission since 2012 in seeking to address these matters as part of the Government's structural reform of our legal services sector.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will recall, the 2011 Bill has since been enacted in the form of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. The basis of a legislative solution to a potential breach of the Services Directive in this instance is now provided under section 218 of that Act, the terms of which were completed in consultation with the European Commission.  In its Reasoned Opinion of 24 January 2019 the Commission remains of the opinion that section 218 of the 2015 Act \"is in compliance with EU law, in particular Article 24 of Directive 2006\/123\/EC.\" Under section 218 the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, which was duly established on 1 October 2016, will have responsibility for the regulation of advertising by both solicitors and barristers - thereby replacing the professional bodies who have historically exercised that function. Under section 218 the Regulatory Authority may make regulations in this area \"including in relation to the information that may be contained in advertisements published or caused to be published by legal practitioners in relation to legal services they provide and any areas of law to which those services relate\". In the making of these regulations the Authority must consult with the legal professional bodies and other interested parties as considered appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  However, it should also be recalled that, to date, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has been heavily engaged in meeting its initial statutory consultation and reporting obligations, the building-up of its staffing and other working capacities and the on-going roll-out of its statutory functions under its Strategic Plan 2018-2020. This is set to include the introduction of Legal Partnerships and of Limited Liability Partnerships in Quarter One of this year and the coming into operation of a new public complaints regime to deal with allegations of misconduct by legal practitioners which will be supported by the establishment of an independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal at the end of Quarter Two of 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Reasoned Opinion of 24 January 2019, the European Commission has invited Ireland to take the necessary measures to comply with it within two months of its receipt. My Department is, therefore, working closely with the Legal Services Regulatory Authority in order to meet the Commission's request building on the previously negotiated legislative solution that is offered by section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 and in further detailed consultation with the European Commission, the legal professional bodies and other stakeholders concerned.  This will include my commencement, as Minister, of section 218 of the 2015 Act and the completion and issue of the relevant advertising regulations by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority as appropriate to ensure full compliance with our obligations under Article 24 of the Services Directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000078#WRD04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gambling Legislation","counter":240,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000078#WRD04600"},{"type":"question","counter":241,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[8545\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000078#WRD04700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason the 2014 EU consumer protection guidelines for online gambling have not been implemented in view of a recent study carried out by a person (details supplied).","asker":"1302","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":242,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has policy responsibility for general consumer protection legislation, while the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has overall responsibility for the enforcement of general consumer protection legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2013 General Scheme of the Gambling Control Bill contained a number of provisions relating to the protection of consumers of gambling services.  Officials involved in the preparation of the General Scheme also had an input into the 2014 guidelines produced by the European Commission, through participation on the Commission's  Expert Group on Gambling Services. A sizeable component of the guidelines are reflected in the 2013 Scheme's provisions.<\/p>  <p>  In the Report referred to by the Deputy, implementation of these voluntary guidelines has generally occurred in jurisdictions where there is a dedicated regulatory authority for gambling.

This included the 2014 European Commission Guidelines, the provisions of the 2013 General Scheme and any other relevant matters arising since. My intention is that the establishment of a gambling regulatory authority will introduce an improved licensing and compliance regime and a regulatory environment that can ensure fairness and transparency for persons engaged in gambling.

Under the Terms of the Scheme, the Tribunal is entirely independent in the matter of individual decisions on applications for compensation. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the level of resources allocated for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, as for any area of the Justice Vote, must be determined having regard to the overall budgetary context and the many demands for funding within the sector.  Nevertheless, I can inform the Deputy that I have maintained the current level of funding of &euro;4 million for a number of years, and again into 2019. Moreover, an increased allocation of some &euro;2.4m was provided as part of a Supplementary Estimate for the Vote in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Applications to the Tribunal are processed with a minimum of formality compared to court proceedings where compensation is sought under the Civil Liability Acts. However, in making their decisions Tribunal Members must be satisfied that all supporting documentation has been provided and is in order, for example, Garda reports arising from criminal investigations and medical reports.  The absence of such information can sometimes lead to delays in bringing cases to finalisation.<\/p>  <p>  Tribunal members, who are practising barristers and practising solicitors in the Courts system, provide their services on a part time basis to the Tribunal.  I have ensured that a full Tribunal membership has been maintained in order to continue to address claims as promptly as possible. The term of office for all Ordinary members has been extended to June 2019 pending the completion of a recruitment process for new members. <\/p>  <p>  The Department's Customer Service Action Plan and Culture and Values Charter commits the Department to delivering public services to a high standard. I can assure the Deputy that staff in my Department receive appropriate training as required on an ongoing basis and as identified through the performance management process. All new members of staff attend a half-day induction programme which covers their responsibilities under the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviours, including dealing with the public. Specific training courses are organised from time to time in response to identified needs. For example, this month the staff of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal received resilience and stress management training due to the particular nature of their work. Suicide awareness training has also been made available recently to staff dealing with members of the public. I have asked my officials to identify if there are any further training needs specific to the Tribunal staff that need to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that I have requested an assessment of the caseload of the Tribunal and have asked my officials to examine this assessment and to obtain the views of the Tribunal in this regard. Furthermore, in view of the length of time since the Scheme was last revised, my Department has submitted a request for a review of the Scheme to the Law Reform Commission (LRC) for consideration in the context of its Programme of Law Reform. I expect that this review should cover all aspects of the scheme including training of staff and the nature of the Tribunal's interactions with applicants. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly it is the case that victims of crime not only in this jurisdiction but elsewhere can report dealing with the criminal justice system to be an intimidating and sometimes negative experience which can result in secondary or repeat victimisation.

It is operated by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), working together with the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI), the Legal Aid Board and the Citizens Information Board.<\/p>  <p>  MABS acts as the gateway to the Abhaile suite of services and will direct the borrower to the advice services best suited to address his or her individual mortgage arrears situation. Financial advice and negotiation assistance may be provided under Abhaile by a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) on the Abhaile PIP panel, a (Dedicated Mortgage Arrears) DMA adviser working with MABS, and\/or an accountant on the Abhaile panel, as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  The role of a Personal Insolvency Practitioner in advising and assisting the borrower is to be future focused, aims to make the mortgage sustainable, and to help the borrower to identify the most appropriate solution and to get it into place. Personal Insolvency Practitioners already deal with tracker arrears cases and will always review the history of the mortgage account in front of them. Even in cases where it is assessed that no tracker issue exists, the ISI indicates that many PIPs include a term within the Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) such that if a tracker issue only becomes known in the future, the Arrangement already provides for how it is to be treated. The PIP is required to ensure that a restructured home mortgage within a PIA is sustainable for the debtor, and returns the debtor to solvency. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, if any legal issues emerge in relation to the mortgage, the PIP can refer the borrower to receive free legal advice from a Consultation Solicitor under Abhaile with relevant expertise.<\/p>  <p>  MABS provide a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears Service (DMA), which has been incorporated into the Abhaile Scheme, across the MABS network and this will often be the first point of contact under the Scheme for a person in arrears with their home mortgage. Specialist DMA advisors are working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.<\/p>  <p>  The DMA process is a structured one which involves both gathering and analysing full borrower history and information together with supporting documentation, including original loan agreements, in order to complete a Standard Financial Statement (SFS) and generate a proposal to the lender.  In the course of this process, advisers may identify issues relating amongst others, to the operation of the account, the Tracker Review and potential legal issues relating to the underpinning contract.  Where such issues emerge, borrowers can be referred under Abhaile for additional expert support from an Abhaile accountant or a consultation solicitor with relevant expertise. MABS can also provide further support to borrowers with relevant appeals to lenders and to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. <\/p>  <p>  I can reassure the Deputy therefore, that the Abhaile Scheme does not need to be specifically broadened as it is already dealing with the types of cases she has highlighted. Whether a borrower is provided with financial advice and assistance by a Dedicated Mortgage Adviser through MABS or by a PIP, the suitability and sustainability of the mortgage is being assessed with a view to providing the borrower with a sustainable solution to their arrears, including in cases impacted by the tracker mortgage issue.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of the Abhaile Scheme is regularly reviewed and reports for the first two years of operation illustrating the high take-up and positive outcomes of Abhaile have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000079#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Language","counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000079#WRE00800"},{"type":"question","counter":257,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[8624\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000079#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress made on implementing all aspects of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010 to 2030 that are relevant to his Department and bodies under his remit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":258,"content":"<p>Among the most significant achievements in Irish by the Department of Justice and Equality in the past nine years is the publication of an official Irish version of the Rules of Court, translated by the Department or under the aegis of the Department.

In that regard, it should be noted that once a grant of naturalisation is made in respect of non-EEA nationals, they are no longer required to register their immigration permission or pay the registration fee of &euro;300 each time. <\/p>  <p>  There is no provision in the Regulations for the discretionary waiver or reduction of fees, or for differing fees to apply to different nationalities, or based on length of residency.  <\/p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  The Deputy will be aware that formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.

While many Irish businesses already have plans in place to mitigate the impacts of Brexit, I am conscious that a proportion of businesses have delayed their Brexit planning due to the degree of uncertainty in the UK surrounding the Brexit negotiations and the withdrawal process. As we approach the withdrawal date, I am urging all businesses to prepare, make all necessary decisions, and complete all required administrative actions. I am also encouraging businesses to apply for a working capital loan under the Brexit Loan Scheme. Once a loan has been sanctioned by one of the participating banks, it will be available for draw down as and when its needed. <\/p>  <p>  Extensive work has been ongoing in my Department and across Government to help businesses prepare for all Brexit eventualities. This includes research and development of supports to help ensure that businesses are prepared for potential difficulties arising as a result of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU. It is important that businesses understand that there are supports and advice available to help them prepare for Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are fully engaged in preparing Irish businesses for Brexit and have participated in the Government of Ireland&rsquo;s series of Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events in Cork, Galway, Monaghan, Dublin, Limerick and Donegal. As part of awareness-raising activities, EI continues to roll out regional Brexit Advisory clinics. To date, these clinics have been held in Letterkenny, Tralee, Portlaoise, Claremorris, Cootehill, Charleville, Dublin, Galway, Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick. Further events are planned in Galway, Cork, Letterkenny and Dublin ahead of the withdrawal date. <\/p>  <p>  EI has also been running a PrepareforBrexit communications campaign, featuring the &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo; and the PrepareforBrexit.ie website, which offers information on the likely impacts of Brexit on Irish businesses and how these impacts might be mitigated. The Brexit SME Scorecard is an interactive online platform that can be used by all Irish businesses to self-assess their exposure to Brexit. EI has also made available a &lsquo;Be Prepared Grant&rsquo; which offers up to &euro;5,000 for exporting client companies to conduct further research and use external expertise to develop a Brexit Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>  Funding to the Local Enterprise Offices has been increased by 22% and they, along with InterTradeIreland, are offering a range of Brexit focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland. InterTradeIreland continues to offer its Brexit: Start to Plan voucher scheme, which makes available financial support of up to &euro;2,250 towards professional advisory services to address Brexit-related challenges.<\/p>  <p>  The LEOs offer Brexit supports to micro and small businesses through the 31 LEOs nationwide. These include a &ldquo;Technical Assistance for Micro-enterprises&rdquo; grant, designed to support qualifying businesses to diversify into new markets, enabling companies to explore and develop new market opportunities. This is accompanied by tailored mentoring to address Brexit-related business challenges, and targeted training on specific Brexit challenges, including financial aspects and capability building in innovation, competitiveness and opportunity diagnosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000079#WRE02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Language","counter":273,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000079#WRE02700"},{"type":"question","counter":274,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[8613\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000079#WRE02800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the progress made on implementing all aspects of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010 to 2030 that are relevant to her Department and bodies under her remit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":275,"content":"<p>The Department continues to be committed to providing a quality service to the public through the medium of the Irish language having regard to the demand for services in Irish, and the Irish language skills and proficiencies of officials.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has made good progress over the last three years in implementing the commitments made in it&rsquo;s Second Irish Language Scheme.

GPs are also remunerated for services they provide on behalf of the HSE under other public health schemes, such as the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, Primary Childhood Immunisation Scheme, etc.<\/p>  <p>  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 imposed a range of adjustments to health contractor payments.

It identifies nine areas of action: education; the Gaeltacht; the family; public services; the media and technology; dictionaries; legislation; the economy; and cross-cutting initiatives. Responsibility for implementation within the State bodies under my remit is an operational matter and those bodies have been requested to respond directly to the Deputy. The aspects of the Strategy which are relevant to my Department are being implemented as follows: <\/p><p>In October 2016, my Department put in place its second Irish Language Scheme under the Official Languages Act 2003. The scheme was prepared with a view to developing and advancing the level and quality of service which the Department provides to Irish language speakers. The Scheme remains in force for a period of three years and my Department will commence work on its third scheme later this year with a view to having our third Irish Language scheme in place by October.<\/p><p>My Department has taken several measures to improve its Irish Language output. Our Irish Language Scheme sets a target of 20% of press releases to be published in Irish. However, in the second half of last year my Department began to target the publication of 100% of press releases in Irish. The following table sets out the progress made in recent years:<table><tr><th><div> Year   <\/div><\/th><th><div>Percentage of Press Releases published bilingually   <\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>2015<\/div><\/td><td><div> 0%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2016 <\/div><\/td><td><div> 7%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2017 <\/div><\/td><td><div>22% <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2018 <\/div><\/td><td><div>60% <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2019  (up to 18 February)<\/div><\/td><td><div> 100%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In addition to meeting its obligations under Section 10 of the Official Languages Act 2003, to publish certain documents in both official languages simultaneously, my Department publishes other corporate documents, such as the Customer Charter and Customer Action Plan, the Farmers&rsquo; Charter of Rights, our Statement of Strategy and the Schemes and Services booklet, in both Irish and English. Budgetary constraints prevent the publication of every document in Irish. <\/p><p>Correspondence to my Department in Irish is responded to in Irish. Business areas of my Department in receipt of correspondence in the Irish language are assisted, where necessary, in translating the response into Irish. The quality of the response to correspondence in Irish is equal to that of the response to correspondence in English.<\/p><p>In May 2018, my Department ran a competitive procurement process, in conjunction with the Office of Government Procurement, and subsequently engaged in a contract with a service provider for the provision of Irish translation services. This contract has enhanced the timeliness of translation services provided to my Department and in turn the ability of my Department to respond efficiently to Irish Language correspondence.<\/p><p>One of the nine areas for action under the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 is the provision of services in the  Gaeltacht. My Department provides services through Irish in our two offices in Gaeltacht areas, thus helping with two of the objectives of the strategy related to the Gaeltacht:<\/p><p><i>- The Irish language community inside and outside the Gaeltacht will be given encouragement and support to transmit Irish to the next generation as a living household language. Towards this end, a wide range of services in Irish will be provided.<\/i><\/p><p><i>- The Gaeltacht will be given special support as an Irish-speaking area. <\/i><\/p><p>Both of my Department&rsquo;s Gaeltacht offices are Fishery Harbour Centres. One is located in Ros a Mh&iacute;l, Co. Galway and the other in An Daingean, Co. Kerry. These offices represent the most direct interface which my Department has with Irish speakers and, as a consequence, their capacity to provide a high level of services through Irish is very important to the Department and its customers. <\/p><p>In the two offices, of the 13 staff employed, 10 can fully transact Department business in Irish while the remaining three members of staff have conversational Irish. My Department therefore can provide a full service through Irish where it has offices in Gaeltacht areas.<\/p><p>With a view to maintaining and enhancing Irish Language competencies at these two Fishery Harbour Centres, my Department is committed to filling all future vacancies with Irish speakers as far as possible. All competitions which involve posts headquartered in an office situated in a Gaeltacht area will place requirements in terms of Irish and English on an equal standing. However, it is necessary that my Department reserves the right to fill a post in a Gaeltacht area with a non-Irish speaker if no suitably qualified Irish language speaker presents. It is hoped that this will not be necessary but my Department must ensure that it carries out its functions at Fishery Harbour Centres.<\/p><p>In the context of Government policy for enhanced provision of services in Irish, in addition to what has been outlined above regarding our two Gaeltacht offices, my Department has identified a further four posts which require functional bilinguals. This is with a view to being able to facilitate customers who wish to transact business through Irish. Three of these posts are currently filled by officers with competence in Irish. My Department was unable to recruit an Irish speaker to fill the remaining post but hopes to be able to do so when the opportunity arises. In particular, these designated posts enhance the ability of my Department to provide services through Irish in areas where there is a demand including Cork, Kerry, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim and Galway. In accordance with Government policy, future language schemes of my Department will specify the posts\/areas which have an Irish language competency requirement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000082#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Meat Processing Plant Inspections","counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000082#WRH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":430,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[8636\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000082#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of carcasses graded by mechanical machine before it was found to be out of sync rechecked to determine if their respective grades were accurate on occasions when a mechanical grading machine in a meat processing plant was found to be working out of sync and the factory reverted to manual grading; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":431,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[8637\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000082#WRH01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 526 of 12 February 2019, the number of carcasses checked at the start of each day to ensure the machine is operating within the limits in view of the fact that the return to service protocol of mechanical grading machines require at least 100 carcasses to be checked to make sure that they are working within the legal tolerances; the person or body that oversees this protocol; the location it is recorded; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":432,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 184 and 185 together.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding operations in a meat plant operating mechanical classification, at the start of each day the meat plant performs a &lsquo;daily system check&rsquo;.

The institutions of the European Union are very well aware of the likelihood of a significant impact of a disorderly Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s economy because this has been part of the discussion from the beginning, and indeed this is explicitly recognised in the Commission&rsquo;s own communication on contingency planning. <\/p>  <p>  Most recently, I held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors.

As well as clear environmental and climate benefits, the BEEP will provide farm gate investment at a time of market volatility and uncertainty relating to Brexit.

This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd. Also, it should be noted an additional &euro;23 million was secured for the ANC scheme in 2019, which, effectively restored the Budget to pre-downturn levels. <\/p>  <p>  While, I am aware of the current challenges facing beef farmers, I cannot intervene directly in any commodity price; cattle prices are a matter for the processing industry and the farmers who supply it.

Under this  Agreement the Government is committed to provide funding of &pound;75 million (sterling) towards the cost of Phase 1a of the A5 upgrade scheme.  The aim of this commitment was to facilitate the delivery of this phase of the scheme as soon as possible once the planning process in Northern Ireland was concluded. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Capital Plan Review in 2017 financial provision was made for meeting the Government's commitment regarding the A5 in 3 tranches over the period 2019 to 2021.

Should the Local Authority decide to proceed with the renovation works and investment required, agreement would need to be reached with one local sports club, whose lands surround the swimming pool.  It would be expected that any works to the pool would cause significant disruption to the activities of the local sports club.

Sport Ireland has experience in resolving sport related disputes and grievances and use a panel of experienced facilitators in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the relatively slow pace of progress in recent years, my official suggested to the Local Authority and the sports club that the services of a facilitator might be useful.

My Department will be making a formal submission within the next 2 months to the European Commission calling for an early review of the TEN-T Network, taking into account our National Development Plan, our National Planning Framework, and the potential implications of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  My Department have previously informed the European Commission of the intention of the Minister to make a submission and, in recent weeks, it has also raised the matter of an early review of the TEN-T Network in Brussels at the relevant Working Party. <\/p>  <p>  The TEN-T Regulation explicitly states that the European Commission should take into account national implementation plans when carrying out the review of the TEN-T Network. In Ireland's case, these would include both the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework. Both of these Government documents will shape the future development of Irish planning and infrastructure across a range of sectors, including transport. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the UK's Withdrawal from the EU has been an evolving process over the last number of years, both in terms of the negotiations between the EU and the UK and in terms of contingency planning for a range of possible Brexit scenarios, which has been a whole-of-government effort coordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. <\/p>  <p>  The preparation and making of a submission calling for a review of the TEN-T network should be strengthened by the proposals under the NDP and the National Planning Framework and by the added urgency of the implications of Brexit. However, the fact that a submission has not yet been made has no relationship to the development of the Dublin Metro.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), the funding instrument of TEN-T, awards co-funding to eligible project proposals on a competitive basis. A strong business case must be made, including a cost-benefit analysis, which demonstrates high European added value and, crucially, a committed funding source for the balance of the project's funding.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the European Commission's contingency plans for Brexit, it is seeking to introdude a new Regulation with regard to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union in the event of a no-deal scenario. If adopted, the effect of this will be to reallign the NSMED Corridor to take account of the UK's exit from TEN-T. As part of this measure, supported by Ireland, it is proposed that a review the TEN-T Guidelines should be advanced to 2021 instead of 2023 as a result of posible changes in the flow of goods after Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  A proposal for a new Regulation for CEF - the funding mechanism for TEN-T from 2021 - is also currently under consideration.  In the latest draft, the Commission has accepted Ireland's proposal, made jointly with Malta and Cyprus, that funding be provided for infrastructure on the Comprehensive Network in Member States where there is no land border with another EU Member State.

This five year action plan sets out a range of agreed actions, with associated timeframes, to be implemented in support of the overarching 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language for the period 2010 to 2030.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has committed to a range of actions designed to affirm the importance of the role that early years settings can play in fostering Irish language proficiency.  The aim of these actions is to build on existing measures, supports and partnerships in the area of Irish-medium early years education.

The inaugural meeting of this group has taken place.  My Department is also represented on the oversight group .<\/p>  <p>  My Department is working to ensure improved communication with Irish speaking childcare services, in particular in the context of the major national childcare schemes that my Department funds.  For example, in relation to the forthcoming Affordable Childcare Scheme, the website currently in development will be available in Irish, as will the parent application portal.  Communications in relation to the launch of the new Scheme will also be available in Irish.  The contact support centre will have Irish speakers on its staff.  Training for the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) that helps children with a disability to participate in the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme (ECCE) is available through Irish for Gaeltacht pre-school settings and the AIM website and materials are available in the Irish language.  <\/p>  <p>  The City\/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) are funded by the Department to act as a local agent in the delivery of the national early learning and care and school age childcare programmes and the implementation of Government policy at childcare committee level.

The NRP carries out its work independently and the quality of the findings, judgements and systematic learning provided in the Panel&rsquo;s reports have consistently been found to be of the highest standard.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) conducted a monitoring exercise in respect of the NRP, on the basis of revised guidance produced in November 2014. HIQA shared a draft report with Tusla and my Department in June 2016, and submitted a final report in January 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the HIQA report found that the reviews completed by the NRP were thorough, consistent, and of good quality. The NRP reports reviewed by HIQA were clearly written, fair and balanced, and highlighted both good practices and any deficits, if found. Key learnings were identified and recommendations were made, based on the findings of the reviews. The report found that reviews were consistent in their approach, quality assured by the NRP chair, and the final reports were structured in the same manner. In addition, the report found that the work of the NRP was carried out independently of Tulsa and operated at a national level. The range of professionals selected to each review was found to be appropriate, and it was confirmed that the NRP liaised with Tusla to ensure that learning was shared from these reviews.<\/p>  <p>  However, the report found a number of issues with the NRP in relation to governance matters, with the concerns raised largely relating to matters outside of the control of the NRP, and arising from the ad-hoc nature of the Panel&rsquo;s establishment in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  On this point, the report acknowledged that the circumstances surrounding the genesis of the NRP were less than optimum. The NRP was established during a time of particular focus and pressure on the Health Service Executive in relation to severe criticism of its management of cases where children in State care had died. The urgent need for a solution, at a time of severe national economic challenge, impacted on planning for the body. In addition, it was originally estimated that the Panel would be dealing with approximately five cases per annum, involving an estimated two child deaths and three serious incidents. In fact, the NRP has been dealing with cases significantly in excess of this original estimate. This has on occasion contributed to delays in the publishing of reports.<\/p>  <p>  In order to address concerns identified by HIQA, my officials prepared an action plan to identify the best governance solution for the NRP. These actions were to be addressed, in the main, by my officials and their colleagues in Tusla, with the assistance of the Chair of the NRP. The plan was forwarded to HIQA in October 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In seeking to implement this plan, my officials continued to explore a number of options for the NRP, to address not only governance matters, but issues highlighted by the Chair of the Panel which have impacted on the efficiency of that body in concluding its work. This process was seen as a unique opportunity both to address the various challenges the NRP faces in producing its reports, and to maximise the Panel&rsquo;s value.  Factors identified as challenges for the NRP included (i) a perception in some quarters that the NRP was not fully independent; (ii) access to files and personnel for review purposes (outside of those in Tusla); and (iii) governance and structural issues.<\/p>  <p>  Having examined several options to address these issues, Government, last November, approved my recommendation that the NRP be established as an independent statutory body in its own right. Appointments to the Panel will be conducted by the Public Appointments Service.<\/p>  <p>  This course of action will address the governance issues noted by HIQA in its monitoring exercise of 2016. Furthermore, it is intended that the Panel will have the power to seek cooperation from relevant parties. This will facilitate access to all pertinent files and personnel across relevant agencies. The final construct and interventions available to the NRP will of course be refined during the drafting of the relevant provisions and will be subject to legal advice and the advice of Parliamentary Counsel. <\/p>  <p>  My officials have begun the preliminary work to draft the necessary legislation. It is not possible to provide a timeline for this legislation at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000084#WRK01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services Data","counter":567,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000084#WRK01500"},{"type":"question","counter":568,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[8770\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000084#WRK01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of level 5, 6, 7 and 8 childcare workers supported under the learner fund in 2017 and 2018, in tabular form; the average funding provided to workers seeking levels 5, 6, 7 and 8; and the percentage of the training cost covered by the funding.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":569,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for her question. <\/p>  <p>  The Learner Fund for Early Learning and Care practitioners first opened for applications by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in March 2014. <\/p>  <p>  Between 2014 and 2016, four strands of funding were opened.  The Learner Fund at that time had two primary aims:<\/p>  <p>1. To support Early Learning and Care practitioners working directly with children in registered centre based and home based services to meet the mandatory minimum qualification requirements which (subsequently) came into effect on December 31st  2016. The specific qualification subsidised was a QQI award at NFQ Level 5 in Early Childhood Care and Education.<\/p>  <p>  2. To support Early Learning and Care practitioners who already held a major award  in Early Childhood Care and Education at Level 5 on the NFQ (or equivalent), to attain an NFQ Level 6 qualification in the same discipline, in order to meet ECCE contractual requirements and facilitate expansion of the ECCE programme. <\/p>  <p>  Through these specific funding strands, up to 4,488 Early Learning and Care practitioners were approved for funding to support them to raise their qualification levels in Early Learning and Care. To allow practitioners time to complete their qualifications, the final payments to training providers were made in late 2018. A final breakdown of the total spend per region and per person is not yet available. Funding was made available based on need, to a maximum of &euro;950. Preliminary figures would indicate that not everyone who was approved for funding took steps to avail of the full amount. <\/p>  <p>  There is not one uniform price for undertaking QQI awards, and the amount charged by training providers varies. My officials estimate that the amount paid would have covered between 80% to 100% of the cost of the programmes. <\/p>  <p>  Since the introduction of these initial Learner Fund strands, DCYA regulations have ensured that the workforce now meets regulatory qualification requirements and as need has changed, the focus of the Learner funding has pivoted to support of continuing professional development.  This year and into 2020, funding will be provided for Early Learning and Care services, including registered Childminders, to avail of First Aid Responder training accredited by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council. There will also be supports put in place for Childminders to upskill to a major QQI award in Early Childhood Care and Education.  Since January 2017, a bursary has been available to experienced Early Learning and Care practitioners, who graduated from DCYA recognised Early Childhood Education and Care degree programmes. In 2017, 1080 individuals received a bursary as this included practitioners who achieved awards between 2013 and 2017. In 2018, 550 individuals received a graduate bursary. <\/p>  <p>  The degree bursary amount per individual is &euro;750. There is more variation in the cost of ECEC degrees in the country than might be expected; it is estimated that this amount would represent between 25 and 40% of the cost.  As the Deputy is most likely aware, there are a variety of funding streams available to students of degree programmes in the State. Many Early Learning and Care providers pay for, or heavily subsidise the cost of this training for existing staff given the higher capitation payment that is made to ECCE services by a level 7 or 8 graduate. This additional Higher Capitation payment amounts to approx. &euro;200 per week for an ECCE room of 20 children to cover the 15 hour programme.<\/p>  <p>  Building a professional Early Learning and Care workforce is a key component of First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, which was launched on the 19th  of November. First 5 commits to establishing a Workforce Development Plan for the ELC workforce. Preliminary work has already begun on this. The Department of Education and Skills has also recently developed enhanced criteria and guidelines for Higher Education Institutions providing Early Childhood Education and Care degree programmes. The aim is to ensure a more unified approach to professional training for ELC practitioners at degree level. This forms part of a range of measures to be introduced in the future.

Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding these programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs believes that our approach to compliance and  supporting services strikes the right balance. Our approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended.<\/p><p>A high level of compliance with the rules of the various childcare schemes is vital to maintaining existing investment as well as ensuring future investment. It is a requirement that services operating the early learning and care programmes funded by my Department must be compliant with the <i>&lsquo;Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo; <\/i>, the most recent of which was published on 9<sup>th<\/sup>August 2018. These Rules clearly state the need to maintain attendance records and keep registrations updated in line with attendance. Compliance with these Rules is overseen by Pobal on behalf of my Department. Because subsidies for the early learning and care programmes are paid based on attendance (and not just enrolment), this is a vital governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible. <\/p><p>I appreciate that community childcare settings, such as those  referenced, provide a valuable service to children and families across the country and may face a variety of challenges to their sustainability. However, significant support is available to them to bring their service onto a more sustainable footing, whilst being necessarily compliant with the scheme rules. My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges. This Case Management service  provides non-financial assistance or support. Financial supports are also available for services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment. <\/p><p>Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the programme year 2018\/2019 show issues in relation to non-compliance which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. I am encouraged however that most services have engaged constructively with the process so far. I would recommend all other services to get in contact with Pobal or their local City \/ County Childcare Committee if they need support or advice, particularly in relation to the re-registration issues you reference. <\/p><p>With regard to the particular service the Deputy referred to, I understand that they the are meeting with Pobal representatives this week and I would expect that the matter can be resolved then. It is open to the service to register children on CCSP at any time in the programme year.  <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by 117% over the last four budgets, now totalling  &euro;575m per year. Community services access much of this growing investment. The Affordable Childcare Scheme, which will be introduced later this year, will mark another significant milestone, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade, This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies , Young Children and their Families, I published last November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000084#WRK02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":574,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000084#WRK02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Language","counter":573,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000084#WRK02100"},{"type":"question","counter":574,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[8626\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000084#WRK02200","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the progress made on implementing all aspects of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010 to 2030 that are relevant to his Department and bodies under his remit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":575,"content":"<p>My Department was established on 19 July 2017.

The Department has assessed Irish language training requirements through consultation with managers and staff and arranged for Irish language training for staff.  During 2017 and 2018, in-house training was delivered at the regional locations of Athlone, Galway, Roscommon and Longford by Gaelchult&uacute;r.  Pre-entry language proficiency assessments are provided by Gaelchult&uacute;r to ensure staff members are supported to attend the appropriate level.<\/p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s workforce planning process, and in order to deliver on commitments under the Department&rsquo;s Irish Language Scheme, the Department in consultation with Managers reviews the locations where staff are required to provide a service to customers in Irish.  When a post becomes vacant in a location where a functional bi-lingual is required, my Department seeks to have it filled from panels established by the Public Appointments Service.  Currently, there are 184 people serving in both Branch Offices and Departmental offices who are available to deliver services through Irish.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s staff are familiar with their obligations under the Official Language Act and Regulations.  In areas where the staff available are unable to deal with a person through Irish, a language interpretive service is offered to the customer.  This service, which can be arranged at very short notice, can be provided either by 3-way phone call, or in-person, as required.<\/p><p>The Department has also ensured that the obligations under the Official Languages Act and Language Scheme are brought to the attention of staff at relevant staff training courses including new entrant induction courses and managers training courses.  To this end, Irish Language Training is promoted by Staff Development Unit in &ldquo;Meet &amp;amp; Greet&rdquo;, &ldquo;Induction &amp;amp; Orientation&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Frontline Customer Service&rdquo; Training.  Obligations under the Official Languages Act are specifically referenced throughout, with emphasis also placed on Departmental interpretation and translation services and language training supports, including Refund of Fees.<\/p><p>My Department has given serious consideration to ensuring that the significant changes in the way the Department will do its business in the future takes account of the preference that some of our customers have to interact with us through Irish.  <\/p><p>The government-wide platform MyGovID is a single, secure, online identity and access portal that provides access to a range of government services.

There will be an initial focus on a series of proposals including those made by the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht in its report on the consultation it carried out on the proposed Electoral Commission in 2016. The proposals currently under consideration include an optional online registration process in parallel with the existing paper based system; the creation of a unique identifier for individuals; proportionate and limited data sharing between public bodies, essentially to improve the accuracy and timeliness of changes to the register information, e.g. in respect of those that are deceased. It is not envisaged that individuals will require a public services card (PSC) to engage in the registration process; however, if an individual wishes to engage through an optional online registration system, there will, of course be requirements in terms of identity verification and the PSC may be selected to meet requirements in this respect. <\/p><p>Conscious of the importance of the register and its role in our democracy and the need to ensure security and integrity are key priorities for any changes being considered, significant consultation is planned to engage all stakeholders, including registration authorities, the political system at all levels and the public.<\/p><p>An initial technical consultation with franchise teams in local authorities was completed in September 2018 and the constructive inputs received informed the further development of proposals which have now been put to a public consultation which is due to end March 15 this year.

The preliminary work previously completed has now been externally reviewed. However, the results of the initial assessment remain unchanged in that significant environmental impact would occur to the designated Lough Oughter habitat and a works project would not be permitted under current environmental regulations.<\/p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland manages and maintains the navigation on the River Erne in County Cavan as part of the Shannon&ndash;Erne Waterway. Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s public jetties are provided in both Belturbet and Kilconny and the navigation channel is provided with navigation markers and signage as and where required. The upper limit of the managed navigation on the River Erne is currently just below Erne Bridge between Belturbet and Kilconny. <\/p>  <p>  Whilst there is no specific legal obligation on Waterways Ireland to deliver a Navigation Plan for the Lough Oughter complex, the preparation of a draft Navigation Plan was initiated in line with the organisation's overall recreational remit in 2008.  Waterways Ireland initiated a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of this draft Plan to establish a new navigation on Lough Oughter from Belturbet to Killeshandra.<\/p>  <p>  Lough Oughter has a number of international conservation designations including being a candidate Special Area of Conservation, a Special Protection Area, a proposed Natural Heritage Area, a Ramsar site and a Natura 2000 site. Also there are a number of national and local monuments, and sites of historical\/archaeological interest located within the Lough Oughter area.<\/p>  <p>  During the initial data gathering process required for an SEA, the extent of concern for the protection of environmental and architectural heritage was raised by the statutory environmental authorities in both jurisdictions {National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service (NPWS), Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)}.  <\/p>  <p>  A critical issue was the level of impoundment, the extent to which water levels would be raised throughout the system and impacts on the habitats on the extensive water margin. Detailed hydrological modelling and analyses of the entire Lough Oughter complex and potential impacts downstream from the development would be required to determine the actual extent\/significance of impacts on the site. In addition as indicated by NPWS and NIEA during the Scoping Phase, given the site&rsquo;s ecological significance, a detailed habitat survey of the entire shoreline area and comprehensive ecological assessment of the potential impacts on protected species is necessary to fully assess the proposal.<\/p>  <p>  The SEA process indicated that considerable environmental and hydrological assessment would be required to complete any proposed Lough Oughter Navigation Plan.  The expenditure necessary to carry out this work is estimated to be in the region of &euro;300,000 and the result is likely to confirm the initial assessment that significant environmental impact will occur to the Designated Lough Oughter habitat and a works project would not be permitted under current environmental regulations.  In addition to this, it was estimated in 2014 that development of the navigation would cost between &euro;922,000 (lowest tender) and &euro;1,382,000 (highest tender). <\/p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland has concluded that without an imperative reason of public interest (IRPOI) for the project, creating navigation is not a prospect either in terms of the adverse impact on the European site or in terms of offering value for money in public expenditure. <\/p>  <p>  There is already extensive existing underused navigation for example at Belturbet and Waterways Ireland has reiterated the potential in the waters of the Lough Oughter area being promoted as a distinct Blueway.  The national context is that Blueways Ireland (National Trails Office, Canoeing Ireland and other state bodies) is currently considering the establishment of Blueways beyond the Waterways Ireland network of inland waterways. <\/p>  <p>  To this end, Waterways Ireland has met with the Chief Executive of Cavan County Council, other council officials and elected representatives concerning Blueways developed successfully on the Waterways Ireland network to advise on possible ways forward.

Subsequently, in June 2018, my Department published the 5-Year Action Plan 2018-2022 which contains specified strategic priorities for the next five years, along with a timeline for their implementation. The focus of the Plan is on the measures to be implemented in the period to 2022 to further support the Irish language and the Gaeltacht in the overall context of the nine areas for action as set out in the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish language.<\/p><p>The Plan outlines over 180 specific measures that will be implemented in conjunction with approximately 60 stakeholders on a cross-Departmental basis in support of the Irish language and the Gaeltacht from now until 2022. The Plan also outlines a revised approach to monitoring progress in order to provide for greater accountability.<\/p><p>Even at this early stage, I am satisfied that significant progress has been made already in relation to implementing the plan.<\/p><p>I should also add that my Department provides significant co-funding to Foras na Gaeilge to carry out its statutory mandate to promote the Irish language on an all-island basis.  In 2018 total funding of &euro;12.6m was provided to Foras na Gaeilge from my Department, including provision for Bliain na Gaeilge 2018.  This funding, along with funding from the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland, enables Foras na Gaeilge to provide support, advice and financial assistance to many groups and the six lead organisations, who are working to promote the Irish language in the community, including Conradh na Gaeilge who has responsibility, <i>inter alia, <\/i>for Seachtain na Gaeilge. <\/p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that Seachtain na Gaeilge will take place from 1- 17 March in 2019 from within co-funding provided to Foras na Gaeilge and it is expected that Conradh na Gaeilge will organise another excellent Irish language festival this year.
