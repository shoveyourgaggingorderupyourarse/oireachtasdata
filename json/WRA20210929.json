It is important to note that without a customs declaration, goods cannot be imported in compliance with the Union Customs Code.<\/p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that in the context of parcels and packages, while customs declarations are often submitted by the courier business or postal operator on behalf of the recipient (importer) in Ireland, the information required to complete the declaration is generally supplied by the exporting party although the importer (the recipient in Ireland) may also provide information to the postal operator or courier business that is needed to complete the declaration. Where the postal operator or courier business does not have the necessary information, it may contact the exporting party or the importer to gather the necessary information to enable them to complete the declaration. This highlights the challenge for each economic operator and the importance of each economic operator considering and examining their supply chain to ensure that they are in possession of the necessary information to enable timely and accurate completion of the customs declaration. Alternatively, where sufficient information to complete the customs declaration in not available, the postal operator or courier business may choose to return the goods to the sender. It is a matter for the relevant postal operator or courier business to determine, based on its business model, how to deal with instances where they do not have the data needed to complete the necessary customs declaration. <\/p>  <p>\u00a0 I would like to assure the Deputy that Revenue provided extensive guidance and assistance on the customs rules and requirements, particularly leading up to and after 1 January 2021, when the UK left the EU, to both businesses and consumers and also followed this up with relevant advice and information relating to the changes that came into effect from the 1st of July last. I know that Revenue works very closely with individual businesses that may be experiencing particular challenges in meeting their customs obligations in order to assist the businesses in understanding what is required and I know that Revenue is fully committed to continuing that collaborative and positive engagement with affected businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900073#WRB06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900074#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[47076\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900074#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if help and advice can be provided in relation to a facility (details supplied) in County Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[46903\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900074#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the EWSS scheme will continue for childcare services until 31 December 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1449","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[46907\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900074#WRC00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to review the employment wage subsidy scheme for the childcare and early years sector on 30 September 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1449","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82, 85 and 86 together.<\/p>  <p>  Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides for the operation of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees. It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment. <\/p>  <p>  While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover, as a result of the pandemic and having regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of childcare facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, positions of employment, the legislation provided that childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS. <\/p>  <p>  The objective of the scheme is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;4.844 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;769 million have been granted to 51,400 employers in respect of 660,400 workers. <\/p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made in June, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021. For Q3 2021, the Government decided on 1 June to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%. <\/p>  <p>  Further, as announced yesterday, the Government has agreed that there will be no change to the EWSS for the month of October 2021, which means that the scheme will continue to operate in its current form as per the arrangements for Q3 2021. Issues around the configuration of the scheme beyond October are currently being considered and full details will be announced on Budget Day, 12 October 2021<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900074#WRC00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900074#WRC00700"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[47187\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900074#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason persons cannot pay the local property tax in post offices (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>Revenue is currently contacting 1.4 million residential property owners to advise them of their statutory requirements in respect of the next Local Property Tax (LPT) &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; (2022 to 2025).

The broader skills ecosystem also encompasses entities including the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU, hosted in SOLAS), the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment) and the National Training Fund Advisory Group (NTFAG, DFHERIS). While DFHERIS has responsibility for skills policy, this broader skills ecosystem informs and drives responsive, flexible forecasting, planning, and provision.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In terms of supporting learners to develop skills and achieve relevant qualifications to support the industries set out below, there are a wide range of programmes available across the further education and training and the higher education sectors to support the agri-machinery field.\u00a0 Examples include work based learning through traineeship (HGV Professional Driver Traineeship, Welding Fabrication Traineeship) or apprenticeship (see below) and the general further and higher education programmes from welding and motor technology to electronic engineering. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Eight of the ten occupations listed are craft apprentice occupations. Apprenticeship is a demand driven, employer-led offering based on a contract of employment between the apprentice and their respective employer. Therefore the number of apprentices in any specific sector is determined directly by employer provision. \u00a0Recognising the importance of these occupations to the economy and the opportunity offered by apprenticeship to support economic recovery, the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme (AIS) was launched in March 2020 to support employers to continue to recruit apprentices during the COVID-19 period. \u00a0The\u00a0establishment, funding and success of the\u00a0scheme is a strong demonstration of\u00a0 the Government's commitment to\u00a0the development and growth of apprenticeship in Ireland, which\u00a0will be\u00a0sustained and intensified through the implementation of the Action Plan\u00a0for Apprenticeship. \u00a0In addition to the existing apprenticeships, a Commercial Driver Apprenticeship is in development and due to be launched shortly.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The closure of face to face training in education and training institutions resulted in a backlog of off-the-job training delivery for craft apprentices in phases 2,4 and 6 of their seven phase apprenticeship. SOLAS and the HEA have been working with education and training providers to agree a significant response which commenced in September and will clear the waiting lists by April 2022 for phase 4 and 6 and by year end 2022 for phase 2 apprentices.\u00a0 An update issued on www.apprenticeship.ie on 23rd September.\u00a0 Published minimum entry requirements for apprenticeship include an age restriction and academic entry requirements &ndash; apprentices must be aged 16 years or over and must hold a junior cycle certificate or equivalent or have relevant experience.\u00a0 The actual entry requirements to access to employment may be higher than the minimum entry requirements and are set by employers in accordance with the level of education or experience required to deliver the role effectively in the workplace.\u00a0 Apprenticeship qualifications range from QQI level 5-10, with a number of programmes requiring post-school level qualifications and experience as entry requirements.<\/p>  <p>  General expansion of\u00a0apprenticeship\u00a0as a route to career development\u00a0is a key priority for Government.\u00a0 As such,\u00a0an Action Plan for Apprenticeship\u00a02021-2025 was published in April of this year which sets out\u00a0a strategic approach to broadening the visibility of apprenticeship as an opportunity for school leavers and career changers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900078#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education and Training Boards","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900078#WRG02000"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[47001\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900078#WRG02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when outstanding claims for incremental credits will be finalised in the case of a person (details supplied) given that this matter has been ongoing for some time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>Claims for incremental credit pertaining to the personal salary of an employee is a matter for the\u00a0employee concerned and their employer, Louth Meath Education and Training Board (LMETB).<\/p>  <p>  The criteria required to have incremental credit awarded to primary and post-primary school teachers is set out in the Department of Education and Skills Circulars 10\/2001, 29\/2007 and 29\/2010.\u00a0 The terms and conditions set out in these circulars were agreed\u00a0under the auspices of the Teachers' Conciliation Council (TCC).<\/p>  <p>  I understand from LMETB that the staff member referred to by the deputy\u00a0has been working to progress this query in conjunction with the HR Department of LMETB.\u00a0\u00a0LMETB HR department continues to work on this matter as an active case and are\u00a0liaising in this regard with the staff member concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900078#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Grant Payments","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900078#WRG02300"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[47054\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900078#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the total allocated Exchequer funds for 2021 for the student grant scheme, student assistance scheme and associated supports, respectively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":361,"content":"<p>The principal support provided by my Department in financial terms is the Student Grant Scheme.

The CSO report also acknowledges other improvements in PULSE data quality, such as the classification of crime incidents and timeliness of recording incidents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900078#WRG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[46862\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900078#WRG04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the person or body that is responsible for the collection, input and centralisation of data under the new Garda operational model; and the person or body that will hold the position of data controller in each division.","asker":"1489","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":382,"content":"<p>As the Deputy\u00a0will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is by law\u00a0responsible\u00a0for the general management and administration of the Garda\u00a0organisation under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.

These traditionally include respite, convalescent, rehabilitation, assessment and palliative care beds.\u00a0 In recent years transitional care beds have been made available in areas where acute hospitals are experiencing service pressures with delayed transfers of care. These beds have proved to be extremely effective for easing pressures on the acute hospital services and facilitating the planning and management of older peoples&rsquo; health needs in a more appropriate environment.\u00a0 As outlined in the National Service Plan for 2021,\u00a0 funding in the order of &euro;125m has been provided by the Department of Health for an additional 1,110 rehabilitation and short stay\/intermediate care beds in 2021.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of a reduction of long term residential care beds, the HSE recognises the importance of providing a quality service experience for residents even in the challenging environment of ageing infrastructure where many of our public units are between 100 &ndash; 150 years old. In order to fully address this challenge and to bring all of its units to the required HIQA and legislative standards, the HSE, with the support of the Department of Health, are working through a systematic programme of development through the Community Nursing Unit Programme.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the timeline for the implementation of the CNU Programme. However, it has also provided an opportunity to incorporate some of the learnings from the Covid-19 pandemic, including the recommendations of the Nursing Home Expert Panel Report into the overall Reform Programme. The current programme of works provides for nearly 90% compliance by the end of 2024 with the remaining 11 projects being completed in 2025.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A key priority of the 2021 HSE Service Plan is to implement the recommendations of the Covid-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel Report and to progress the overall reform and development of both residential care and home support services to ensure that a wider range of options are available within the community in supporting older people. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the requirement for enhanced infection control measures together with the necessity to improve compliance with HIQA standards there has been a reduction in the order of over 240 long stay beds in the service with a further 10 beds to be reduced during 2021.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE will continue to support older people and their families across the health service to ensure that people are accommodated as close to their homes and local communities as possible and will continue to work with the Department of Health on the overall programme which is referenced in the NSP 2021 and in the associated Capital Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900080#WRJ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":475,"content":"<p>Question No. 210 answered with Question No. 209.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":476,"content":"<p>Question No. 211 answered with Question No. 209.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates","counter":477,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900080#WRJ02100"},{"type":"question","counter":478,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[46948\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900080#WRJ02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a primary medical certificate will be expedited in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":479,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900080#WRJ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"question","counter":481,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[46951\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900080#WRJ02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a primary medical certificate for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":482,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900080#WRJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Procedures","counter":483,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900080#WRJ02700"},{"type":"question","counter":484,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[46952\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900080#WRJ02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of tests for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":485,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The legislation also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900081#WRK04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900081#WRK04800"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[47025\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900081#WRK04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the primary care, disability service and school inclusion waiting lists that were referred to in a statement by Minister of State with special responsibility for Disability in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in June 2021 are set to be finalised;

Menopause has been identified as a priority under the Women's Health Taskforce.\u00a0The Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce was established in September 2019 with the aim of improving women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare. The Taskforce has met fourteen times since it was established in September 2019. A number of initial priority areas for action were determined by the Taskforce in 2020, with the issue of menopause recognised and included as one of these priority areas.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of menopause has also been emphasised through the nationwide &ldquo;Radical Listening&rdquo; exercise carried out by the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This exercise enabled women across the country to share their views and experiences of the health sector and health services. A report on the findings of this &lsquo;radical listening&rsquo; exercise was published on September 14th 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to support for women at work through the menopause, women&rsquo;s health will be represented at the Healthy Workplace implementation group which is to be established in 2021, following the publication of the Healthy Workplace Framework in the coming months. Following publication, an Implementation Group will be established with responsibility for developing an action plan. A representative from Women&rsquo;s Health will be included on the Implementation Group to ensure the needs of women in the workplace are incorporated. Through this representation, the particular issues for women at work will be highlighted for consideration. This has particular reference to menopause within the workplace.<\/p>  <p>  At present, there is existing guidance available from CIPD.ie for organisations who wish to consider their response and support to women throughout their menopause journey within work. They provide resources for people managers and professionals to use in the workplace to help break the stigma of women going through the menopause. This includes a menopause at work document which can help organisations consider how they can make their workplaces more supportive for women throughout their menopause journey.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health and the Women's Health Taskforce are committed to improving the experience of women in Ireland through the menopause. This is underscored by the announcement on September 10th of a new approach to menopause care in Ireland, beginning with the establishment of a dedicated specialist menopause clinic. This forms a core part of a new approach to menopause care for women in Ireland and will be supported by enhanced community and primary care supports as well as the publication of targeted and trusted sources of information for women experiencing menopause.<\/p>  <p>  Menopause will continue to be a priority for the Women's Health Taskforce for 2021 and 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900082#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":590,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900082#WRL01500"},{"type":"question","counter":591,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[47035\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900082#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he plans to increase the number of child and adolescent mental health service units made available nationwide given they are only in counties Dublin, Cork and Galway and only two of them take out-of-hours admissions;

These recommendations recognise the very significant impact of the previous testing and tracing requirements on children in these settings. The changes which came into effect on 27 September 2021 are as follows: <\/p>  <p>  - Automatic contact tracing of close contacts in childcare facilities and primary education will be discontinued (not including special education facilities).  <\/p>  <p>  - Testing of asymptomatic close contacts in childcare facilities and primary education will be discontinued (not including special education facilities). <\/p>  <p>  - Children aged 12 yrs or under, who are identified as close contacts in childcare, educational settings, special education settings or other non-household settings and who are asymptomatic will no longer be required to restrict movements, unless indicated by the local public health team.  <\/p>  <p>  - Children aged 12 yrs or under who are identified as household close contacts in household settings will still be required to restrict movements and get tested, regardless of symptomatic status.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the public health advice remains that any child aged 12 yrs or under who displays symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should rapidly self-isolate and not attend school or socialise until 48 hours after they are symptom free.<\/p>  <p>  Further information is available in the Guidance for COVID-19 Contact Tracing for Children (>3 months to under 13 years of age) published by the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre, available at www.hpsc.ie\/a-z\/respiratory\/coronavirus\/novelcoronavirus\/guidance\/educationguidance\/Contact%20tracing%20under%2013s.pdf<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The recommendations which have come into effect are based on what has been learned throughout the pandemic, primarily<\/p>  <p>  - Children seem more likely than adults to have no symptoms or to have mild disease<\/p>  <p>  - Investigation of cases identified in school settings suggests that child to child transmission in schools is uncommon and not the primary cause of Sars-CoV-2 infection in children, particularly in pre-school and primary educational settings<\/p>  <p>  - Children are rarely identified as the route of transmission of infection into the household setting<\/p>  <p>  - Children are not more likely than adults to spread infection to other people.<\/p>  <p>  On that basis, from a public health perspective there is no clinical need for information to be routinely shared with contacts of cases and Public Health do not recommend telling parents of other children that there has been a case of COVID 19 within a class or group. Sharing of health data relating to positive cases in the manner envisaged in the question should only be done on the advice of Public Health and according to the provisions of the Infectious Disease Regulations. Since the provisions of the Infectious Disease Regulations no longer apply in this instance, it is important to note the importance of an individual&rsquo;s confidentiality not being broken by others, in line with normal GDPR requirements. It is important that families are aware of the need to ensure they do not send children in to school and childcare facilities or to participate in activities if the child has new symptoms consistent with COVID 19. In these circumstances they should observe their child and contact their GP as appropriate. It is also important to regularly re-enforce the benefit to all of continuing to abide by infection prevention control and mitigation measures in place within school and childcare facilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the changes in guidance outlined above do not apply to special educational needs (SEN) schools or SEN-specific classes or children attending respite care. In these circumstances close contacts amongst children may well still be identified and asked to restrict their movements, following a Public Health Risk Assessment conducted by a public health doctor. However, close contacts will generally be requested only to restrict their movements for 5 days and be referred for one COVID-19 test. This is to balance the observation period required for children for signs of infection, with testing at the most relevant time, whilst not prolonging restricted movements and the harms to children from these restrictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900083#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":639,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900083#WRM00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":638,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900083#WRM00500"},{"type":"question","counter":639,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[46896\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092900083#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the amount his Department has spent on a hand sanitiser (details supplied) before its manufacturer recalled the product in October 2020; and if the State has been reimbursed for these costs.","asker":"1504","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":640,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Department implements the Biocidal Product Regulation (EU No. 528\/2012) to ensure that biocidal products placed on the Irish market are safe for humans, animals and the environment.
