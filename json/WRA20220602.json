This continued to be available until the end of April. This significant level of funding to the sector has ensured that fees have remained largely static for the last two years, as demonstrated in the Annual Early Years Sector Profile Report 2020\/21.<\/p><p>Following the tapering of EWSS and prior to the introduction of a new Core Funding Scheme, I put in place a Transition Fund. The primary conditionality of the Transition Fund is an agreement not to increase fees from September 2021 levels.

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months. <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. To date, more than 32,000 people have arrived in Ireland and just in excess of 23,000 of those have been referred to us\u00a0seeking accommodation from the State.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has contracted approximately 17,800 beds currently in hotels, guesthouses and B&amp;Bs, hostels, self-catering accommodation and certain other repurposed settings with additional capacity also being pursued through accommodation pledged by the general public, state-owned or private properties which may be suitable for short-term accommodation, accommodation belonging to voluntary bodies, student accommodation, holiday homes, religious order properties and Local Authority facilities. <\/p>  <p>  Within my Department, a dedicated Ukraine Response Division\u00a0has been newly established.

The Division also includes new staff and those seconded from other Departments and Agencies.<\/p>  <p>  Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging. Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted, including emergency accommodation.

Numbers seeking international protection have also increased adding to accommodation capacity issues.<\/p>  <p>  I want to recognise the hard work and commitment of Department staff in providing accommodation for so many people in such a short period, as well as maintaining work progress in other key areas. Many staff have volunteered their own time, at night and on weekends, to work in the welcome centre in Citywest to provide that immediate welcome to people fleeing Ukraine as they arrive here.

This Strategy was developed in consultation with stakeholders, and the process included consultation with civil society and with the public.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; includes a commitment that the Government will develop and implement a new National Strategy for Women and Girls. I will work with stakeholders to examine what has been achieved over the term of the outgoing Strategy, and consider how we can bring forth the next iterations of the suite of national equality strategies and ensure they are even more robust and effective. In this regard, my Department has commissioned a study to evaluate the processes for implementation of three equality strategies, which includes the National Strategy for Women and Girls as well as the Migrant Integration Strategy and the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy. Consultations in regard to the successor strategy will commence during 2022. In the interim, the principles and priorities of the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 continue to guide my Department's work to advance gender equality and women's rights.<\/p>  <p>  The gender pay gap in Ireland, which was 14.4% in 2017, fell to 11.3% in 2018, the most recent year for which statistics are currently available. Addressing the factors behind the gender pay gap is a key commitment in the outgoing Strategy. Employers and their representative organisations have contributed to the public consultation undertaken on the matter in autumn 2017 and to the symposium that followed in January 2018. Tackling this issue contributes to equality and makes good business sense, as firms that can report a low or non-existent gender pay gap will have an advantage in recruiting and retaining employees. Initiatives to address the gender pay gap can also be expected to have a positive impact on disparities in income for women across and after their working lives.<\/p>  <p>  Consultations have taken place with unions and employer representative organisations about the gender pay gap, especially in the context of the Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021. The aim of the Act is to provide transparency on the gender pay gap and incentivise employers to take measures to address the issue insofar as they can. Regulations have been made under the Act. Under these Regulations, organisations are asked to select a &lsquo;snapshot&rsquo; date in the month of June, and those organisations having not less than 250 employees on that date will then have six months to prepare their calculations before reporting six months later, during December. My Department has issued guidance to employers on calculating their gender pay gaps. It is also continuing to engage with trade union and employer representative bodies on the implementation of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200059#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency","counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200059#WRB03200"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[28535\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200059#WRB03300","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if there is a staffing shortage in fostering assessment teams in the south-east;

and<\/p>  <p>  28% families were working more because of NCS, with 8% reporting that they would not be in work without it.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I recognise however that the burden on some families remains high and we need to do more to ensure affordability and sustainability.<\/p>  <p>  An Expert Group to develop a new funding model for the early learning and childcare sector made recommendations to Government in December which were accepted in full. This new funding model is now beginning to be implemented to improve quality, affordability, sustainability and accessibility of services.<\/p>  <p>  The package of measures for the sector announced in Budget 2022 was informed by the Expert Group recommendations. The package includes a new Core Funding stream valued at up to &euro;221 million in a full year. Making early learning and childcare more affordable to parents and improving services' sustainability are central objectives of Core Funding, along with improving quality including through better terms and conditions for the workforce.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A central condition of Core Funding will be that providers agree not to increase fees above those which were charged last year. This will give parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensure that increases to NCS subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases.

A number of safeguards have been put in place to ensure no unintended outcomes of Core Funding including a funding guarantee and a Sustainability Fund which is open to services.<\/p>  <p>  In order to contribute to services' stability and sustainability, Core Funding will be allocated based largely on capacity. Higher levels of funding will be available for capacity for younger children, to support the higher operating costs for these children arising from the higher staff ratio requirements.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Core Funding will give providers a stable income source based on the nature of the service they deliver. A provider&rsquo;s income will now consist of Core Funding, NCS and ECCE subsidies, and parental fees. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children&rsquo;s attendance.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Since August 2020, early learning and childcare services had been able to access the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS)\u00a0without having to demonstrate a reduction in turnover. This continued to be available until the end of April. This significant level of funding to the sector has ensured that fees have remained largely static for the last two years and that providers have continued to be sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  Following the tapering of EWSS and prior to the introduction of Core Funding, a Transition Fund is available to providers. The primary conditionality of the Transition Fund will be an agreement not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. I am delighted to report that so far 93% of services have agreed to operate a freeze on parental fees by coming into contract for the Transition Fund.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Fund is designed to support the stability and sustainability of services in the interim period between the end of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme and ahead of the introduction of the new Core Funding Scheme in September 2022.<\/p>  <p>  As you can see, I am committed to putting in place a strong foundation to improve affordability for parents and sustainability for services, as well as improved quality of provision, including pay and conditions for the workforce. This foundation will allow for further developments in future years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200059#WRB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":73,"content":"<p>Question No. 34 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200059#WRB04200"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[28404\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200059#WRB04300","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the work that his Department has done in relation to using existing community facilities including schools as youth facilities on evenings, weekends and during school holidays such as the upcoming summer months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>Youth organisations use a wide range of facilities to provide the services which my Department is funding.

My Department continues to monitor the issue. <\/p>  <p>  According to the Annual Early Years Sector Profile, the annual staff turnover rate across the sector was 19% in 2021, which was down from 23% in 2019 but remains high. While at least 28% of these moved to another service in the sector, others left the sector.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, while 57% of services reported no staff turnover, when the size of service is taken into account, as much as 70% of small services retained all their staff, compared to 39% of medium-sized services and 27% of large services.<\/p>  <p>  In general, staffing pressures in the sector are caused not by insufficient supply of qualified personnel, but by high levels of staff turnover, and recruitment and staff retention difficulties are undoubtedly linked to pay and conditions, with for example the average pay being &euro;12.60 per hour in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  However, as the State does not employ early years educators or school-age childcare practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector.

The Action Plan for Online Safety 2018 &ndash; 2019, which was launched by the then Taoiseach in July 2018, set out the range of actions and activities which were underway across six key Government Departments ((the then named) Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Education and Skills; Justice and Equality; Children and Youth Affairs; Health and Business, Enterprise and Innovation) to keep children and adults safe online. While the lifespan of this Action Plan has ended, I remain committed to working with my colleagues in a co-ordinated Government response to address issues arising.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Children First legislation and guidance, which is under the remit of my Department, operates on the premise that it is the responsibility of everyone in society to keep children and young people safe from harm. This responsibility includes keeping children safe from harm online. As part of the Action Plan for Online Safety, in January 2019, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs published an addendum to the Children First National Guidance to include a specific reference to the need to consider online safety in the preparation of statutory risk assessments and Child Safeguarding Statements. In addition, Tusla revised its template for the completion of Child Safeguarding Statements to refer to the need to consider online risks to children if a service provides access to the internet.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to three national youth organisations that provide online safety resources for the youth sector. The National Youth Council of Ireland provides the Web Safety in Youth Work Resource, SpunOut has developed an Online Safety Hub which provides guidelines for young people on online safety and For&oacute;ige has rolled-out an online safety programme, which enables young people to engage online with safe and creative digital learning experiences.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The 2020 Programme for Government contains significant commitments relating to online safety. These relate to the enactment of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and the establishment of an Online Safety Commissioner.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Online Safety and Media Regulation (OSMR) Bill provides for the appointment of an Online Safety Commissioner, as part of a wider Media Commission, to oversee a new regulatory framework for online safety. The Commissioner will govern this new framework through binding online safety codes and robust compliance, enforcement and sanction powers. The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media published the OSMR Bill 2022 in January 2022 and it was initiated in the Seanad later that month. The OSMR Bill sets out defined categories of harmful online content (e.g. cyberbullying material and material promoting eating disorders), a definition of &lsquo;age-inappropriate online content&rsquo; and the process by which additional categories of harmful online content may be specified.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Online Safety Commissioner will also have a role in promoting positive digital citizenship among children and young people, in conjunction with Webwise and other educational partners, schools as well as the Ombudsman for Children. The Webwise programme, funded by the Department of Education, is a key educational resource in the promotion of online safety, providing information and advice to children and young people, teachers and parents.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My colleague the Minister for Education has also brought forward significant policy initiatives in this area this year including the publication of the new Digital Strategy for Schools in April, which focusses on further embedding the use of digital technologies in all teaching, learning and assessment activities and includes building awareness and knowledge around online safety. The Department of Education is also currently reviewing the Action Plan on Bullying and the Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools. The review will take account of the significant developments and relevant research since the Action Plan and Anti-Bullying Procedures were first published in 2013 and it will specifically consider cyberbullying, among other areas. My Department is represented on the Steering Committee established to carry out the review and to develop a new Action Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200060#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Priorities","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200060#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[28368\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200060#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if consideration has been given to introducing bereavement support for parents who suffer the loss of a child; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":97,"content":"<p>I recognise the enormous impact that the loss of a child has on parents, and I wish to extend my sympathies to all parents who have suffered such a loss.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, work to examine the needs of bereaved parents coping with pregnancy loss is being advanced at present.

In collaboration with the Local Authorities there has been a focus on designing the supports that will be required at a local level. The proposal is to expand the current model of interagency working groups and resettlement and intercultural workers that is in place for the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.\u00a0 The aim is to establish a permanent integration system at local level that will provide support both to programme refugees and to applicants for international protection.

Over 30 organisations were in attendance and were provided with a comprehensive update on how the implementation of the White Paper is progressing. Further briefings with the NGO sector will be held periodically.<\/p><p>Development of a Communication strategy including in February 2022 the launch of a dedicated webpage where all members of the Public can find updates on the progress being made in implementing the White Paper.

Upwards of 33,000 Ukrainian refugees have come to Ireland under the Temporary Protection Directive, and over 23,000 have been accommodated by the State. <\/p><p>Over the coming weeks, a review will be undertaken of project timelines with a view to presenting a revised implementation plan to the Programme Board.\u00a0 This will take account of the delays that have arisen as a consequence of the Ukraine crisis and will consider its impacts on project implementation.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the impact of the Ukraine crisis, the implementation of the new model is and will continue to be a key priority for my department.  <b><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200060#WRC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200060#WRC02500"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[24949\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200060#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the student housing supports that his Department is offering to help Ukrainian student refugees live on campuses across Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":117,"content":"<p>This is a matter for my cabinet colleague, the Minister for\u00a0Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200060#WRC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200060#WRC02800"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[28119\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200060#WRC02900","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"his plans to reduce the costs of childcare for ordinary families.; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1460","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p>Significant steps are being\u00a0taken to support families with the costs of early learning and childcare.<\/p><p>The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) is currently supporting thousands of families to offset these costs.

This new funding model marks a new departure in State funding of the sector and is a significant step towards ensuring high-quality, affordable, sustainable and accessible services.<\/p><p>An essential and top priority for the Funding Model Expert Group was to make recommendations for a mechanism to control fee rates for different types of provision for early learning and childcare.<\/p><p>There are four specific recommendations on fee management, including the introduction of a fee freeze in the first instance, improvements to price comparability, and developments to the fee management system further to the assessment of cost data.\u00a0<\/p><p>Fee management will start with a requirement of providers not to increase fees on September 2021 levels. The fee management system will be further developed in subsequent years, informed by income and cost data analysis.<\/p><p>The Expert Group made a further three specific recommendations on affordability, including amendments to the NCS and further development of subsidies linked to household income and expenditure or other criteria.<\/p><p>The Expert Group report informed the transformative package of measures for the sector committed to in Budget 2022, including the new &euro;221 million Core Funding stream.

This means that parents may use their full awarded subsidised NCS hours &ndash; benefitting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families.<\/p><p>In September 2022, the NCS Universal subsidy will be extended to all children under 15 years of age &ndash; benefitting up to 40,000 children.<\/p><p>Both of these changes will result in more parents getting additional subsidised hours for early learning and childcare.<\/p><p>Since the start of the pandemic, my Department has ensured the sustainability of services and prevented the additional costs from public health measures being passed on to parents. ELC and SAC employers continued to benefit from the exemption to the turnover rule for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) until April 2022.\u00a0<\/p><p>In advance of the introduction of Core Funding, a Transition Fund is available to providers, contingent on an agreement not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. This fund will operate from the end of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme until the introduction of Core Funding (May-August 2022). <\/p><p>So far 93% of services have signed up to the Transition Fund.

This is the beginning of fee management that will now make it possible for substantial future investment to reduce parental fees over time. <\/p><p>Government has approved the recommendations of the Expert Group.

With input from the Taoiseach, Minister McEntee and I have worked intensively with our officials on the Audit of the segmentation of Government&rsquo;s response to Domestic,\u00a0Sexual and Gender Based Violence and how the results of that audit fits with the Third National Strategy on Domestic,\u00a0Sexual and Gender Based Violence.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of those discussions and in response to the Audit, we have agreed that the Department of Justice will become the lead Department with responsibility for responding to Domestic,\u00a0Sexual and Gender Based Violence, and that responsibility for policy, accommodation and services will also sit within the Department of Justice. In the meantime, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, will continue to have responsibility for accommodation and services while the new administrative arrangements are put in place.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2022, the Minister for Justice and I jointly submitted a memorandum to the Government on the publication of Tusla's Accommodation Review.

The draft Heads of\u00a0a Mother and Baby Institutions Payment \u00a0Scheme\u00a0 Bill were published on 29 March. They were referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for pre-legislative scrutiny, requesting the Committee's\u00a0assistance in meeting the urgent need to deliver this Scheme for survivors as soon as possible. In April, the Joint Oireachtas Committee undertook a public consultation process on the draft legislation. Hearings on the Heads of Bill have now commenced and my Department has engaged with the Committee.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel with the legislative process, my Department is working on the administrative arrangements needed to operate the Scheme and deal with applications.\u00a0  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department has also published two substantial pieces of legislation this year.  \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>The Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 was published on 12 January. The Bill has passed all stages in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and is scheduled for Committee Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on Wednesday the 1st June. This legislation will provide a full and clear right of access to birth certificates, birth and early life information for all persons who were adopted, boarded out, the subject of an illegal birth registration or who otherwise have questions in relation to their origins.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Institutional Burials Bill 2022 was published on 22 February. The Bill completed D&aacute;il Second Stage on 3 March and D&aacute;il Committee Stage on 3 May. Report Stage in the D&aacute;il is to be held on 15 June.

My officials have examined these materials and issued a comprehensive response to the FECP and are awaiting further information by means of follow up.\u00a0<\/p><p>While I accept that Core Funding is a new way of providing funding for the sector, and there is a lot of detailed material to be absorbed, I do not believe that there is a solid foundation in evidence for the concerns expressed by some that Core Funding will compromise services' viability.<\/p><p>In examining all of the data available to the Department, including that provided by the FECP following our meeting on 4<sup>th<\/sup>May, there is no evidence about a significant lack of sustainability for ECCE-only services or to suggest that services will face closure as a result of Core Funding.\u00a0<\/p><p>The sectoral information on income and costs does not show signs of financial unviability for ECCE-only services. In fact, the evidence suggests that ECCE-only services see the highest levels of income in excess of costs compared to other types of provision.<\/p><p>I am\u00a0committed to ensuring more stability of income for services, and that is one of the key objectives of Core Funding.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The vast majority of services will see an increase in funding, and around 1% of service will see no change. No service will see a decrease in funding. For any service that does experience financial difficulties, a Sustainability Fund will be in place. This new strand of the Sustainability Fund, linked to Core Funding, will be designed to provide an extra safety net for providers.\u00a0 This will be open to both private and community providers.<\/p><p>The Government is committed increasing investment in early learning and care and school-age childcare. As part of this, the new Core Funding package amounts to &euro;221 million in full year costs (&euro;173 million of which is new investment).\u00a0<\/p><p>Every year a number of services close and others open. Current data on service closures and openings are not markedly different to the trend in previous years. This data also shows that services close for a wide range of reasons including retirement of owners or other personal circumstances and only a small minority relate to sustainability issues.\u00a0<\/p><p>The &euro;221 million Core Funding budget is distributed to services in a fair and proportionate manner, based primarily on the features that determine services&rsquo; operating costs.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Importantly, Core Funding and this significant increase in investment is the vehicle through which the Government will deliver improved pay and conditions for staff through supporting the drawing up of Employment Regulation Order for different roles of the sector by the Joint Labour Committee and through introduction new mechanisms to control parental fees.\u00a0<\/p><p>It may be of interest to the Deputy to know that there is significant material relating to Core Funding available at\u00a0<i>www.first5fundingmodel.gov.ie\/Core-Funding\/<\/i>. This public material was prepared in response to a number of queries received by my Department.<\/p><p>The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, educators and\u00a0practitioners, and society overall.<\/p><p>This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides. Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding.<\/p><p>It is my ambition that the maximum number providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding. Core Funding however is optional for providers.<\/p><p>I look forward to working together in partnership with providers to deliver ELC and SAC services for the public good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200061#WRD02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200061#WRD02200"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[28357\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200061#WRD02300","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the supports that are being made available to youth services for young people and teenagers who have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine; the additional funding that is being made available in this regard; the distribution of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1515","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>While no formal requests have been received, the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department is actively monitoring the emerging needs as the situation moves from an emergency footing to a more settled picture.

On 14th March 2022 I published the report which sets out 17 numbered recommendations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 17 of the report by the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection was that a State inquiry into illegal adoptions (broadly defined) should be established on a non-statutory basis. <\/p>  <p>  The question of creating an effective non-statutory inquiry is a sensitive, complex and challenging one.\u00a0 The Special Rapporteur acknowledges this and, in particular, notes the challenges associated with access to records for a non-statutory inquiry.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to delivering on the comprehensive suite of actions set out in the Government Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions.

In addition, it will contain a research centre and central repository of records related to institutional trauma in the 20th century, which will form part of the National Archives. It is anticipated that the central repository will sit at the heart of the Centre and will ultimately be underpinned by legislation. One unique aspect of the central repository will be the intended inclusion of the personal testimonies of survivors; allowing the lived experiences of survivors to be formally accepted as part of the official record. Inclusion of the personal testimonies of survivors will ensure that the lived experiences of survivors will be captured in their own words, for publication and archiving for posterity in the National Centre.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Government Action Plan also contains important measures which are focused on access to records.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In setting out this comprehensive suite of commitments, the Government recognises the potential for a future centralised archive of institutional records and personal testimony to support further analysis and research on these important matters.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As a consequence of all of this ongoing work, the Government will need to give further consideration to the specific recommendation on the Truth Commission.

It is also available to families with children over 3 years who have not yet qualified for the free pre-school (ECCE) programme.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Income Assessed Subsidy is available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. It is means tested and is calculated based on individual circumstances. Those on the lowest incomes receive the highest subsidies. <\/p>  <p>  The NCS is\u00a0 designed to be flexible and accommodate busy parents&rsquo; lives. The attendance rules for the scheme facilitate the need for flexibility and recognise that, in practical terms, parents are constrained by a range of individual circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme acknowledges that early learning and childcare needs differ widely across different families. That is why subsidies are offered on an hourly basis. The NCS allows for flexible arrangements to be made depending on the parents&rsquo; needs. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme has been designed to be flexible in its application process as well. The online application allows for the parent to complete the process at their own pace, and parents have the option of completing a paper application by post. The system caters for applications from all family types, and no one family type is in any way disadvantaged.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the monitoring, review and evaluation of the NCS, Frontier Economics was commissioned to undertake a formal review of the first year of the NCS, with the report published in December 2021. The report noted that early learning and childcare costs in Ireland have been found to be a significant factor in contributing to low levels of participation in employment, education and training for mothers, particularly for lone parents. The NCS was designed to make early learning and childcare more affordable and, in some instances, free. In this regard, the report highlights that among claimants of the income-assessed subsidy, around a third were lone parents. It further noted that lone parents had a substantially higher mean hourly rate than couples, leading to a substantially higher mean weekly value for claims.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, Minister O&rsquo;Gorman announced a number of changes to the NCS, which will be of significant benefit to many parents. <\/p>  <p>  These changes will result in more parents getting additional subsidised hours for early learning and childcare in Tusla registered services by extending the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15 - benefitting up to 40,000 children. <\/p>  <p>  A further change, introduced in May of this year, ended the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours, benefitting an estimated 5,000 children.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, is a universal programme available to all children within the eligible age range. The programme is provided for three hours per day, five days per week over 38 weeks, and the programme year runs from September to June. A child must have turned 2 years and 8 months on or before the 31st August of a given programme year in order to be eligible (and cannot turn 5 years and 6 months during the programme year).<\/p>  <p>  2022 will see up to &euro;73m being made available for Core funding, which equates to &euro;221m in full year costs. It will require a commitment not to increase fees to parents\u00a0from September 2021 rates. This feature of the scheme will ensure that parents\u00a0feel the full affordability benefits of the NCS and ECCE.<\/p>  <p>  Once core funding is embedded and the concurrent changes to ECCE and NCS take effect, my Department will be looking to build a wider strategy targeting disadvantage informed by the work of the Expert Group across ELC settings.

This marked an important milestone in a process to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland that has gathered momentum since Ireland became a signatory to the Convention in 2007. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's approach to meeting the obligations of the UNCRPD is one of progressive realisation - each year moving forward on key reforms, with the obligations arising from the Convention being met over time. Initial priority has been given to meeting legislative commitments and requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland submitted its Initial State Report on the implementation of the UNCRPD to the UN Committee in November 2021, following extensive consultation with persons with disabilities, disabled persons organisations, representative organisations, and families. My Department is currently awaiting a review date from the UN Committee to evaluate progress made to date. The review was originally anticipated to occur in 2022. However, this has been postponed due to backlogs at UN level. There is no indication at this time on a likely date for Ireland&rsquo;s appearance at the Committee.<\/p>  <p>  My Department coordinates delivery of two whole-of-government national strategies, which aim to support delivery of Ireland's\u00a0obligations under the UNCRPD.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy\u00a0(NDIS), contains 123 actions to support effective progress in meeting the needs of people with disabilities in Ireland.  Implementation of the NDIS is monitored in regular NDIS Steering Group meetings through a reporting system which requires Government Departments and Agencies to detail their progress biannually. The group is supported by independent analysis and advice from the National Disability Authority (NDA).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES), is the primary disability employment policy initiative in Ireland. It is a cross-government approach, bringing together actions by Government Departments and Agencies to address the barriers and challenges to the\u00a0employment of persons with disabilities. Implementation of the CES is undertaken through agreed action plans and is monitored by an Implementation Group with an independent chairperson. <\/p>  <p>  While there is still much work to be done, important progress has been made\u00a0in implementing the\u00a0UNCRPD to date.\u00a0This includes\u00a0the formation of a number of whole-of-government working groups to address specific challenges in areas such as transitions across state services, transport and the use of assistive technologies. Various policy actions and financial supports have also been introduced under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy to address the specific challenges faced by persons with disabilities in accessing equal employment.\u00a0The introduction of the Access and Inclusion Model for early learning and care and the legal recognition\u00a0granted to\u00a0Irish Sign Language are also key achievements. <\/p>  <p>  On 1st May this year I introduced the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 to the D&aacute;il, and will work with colleagues to see the law passed before the end of the summer session. This will be a key step\u00a0 in Ireland's realisation of the Convention, and will introduce a number of important legislative reforms, such as the abolition of wardship and the establishment of new, rights based decision support arrangements, a doubling of the statutory minimum targets for the employment of persons with disabilities, legislating for IHREC's role as the monitoring body for the UNCRPD, and removing references to persons of \"unsound mind\" standing for election.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200062#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200062#WRE00800"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[28466\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200062#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"his Department&rsquo;s strategy to deliver increased domestic violence refuge provision across the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":218,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for highlighting this matter.

This will be administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and will become available to the non-domestic sector for installations up to 6.0kW in July this year. <\/p><p>In addition, on 15 February this year I signed the Regulations that create an obligation on suppliers to offer the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff to new and existing micro-and small-scale generators so that they will receive payment for excess renewable electricity that they may\u00a0export to the grid, reflective of the market value. <\/p><p>In Quarter 3 of this year when the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) will consult on an implementation plan for the Clean Export Premium (CEP) tariff, a guaranteed export tariff support for new installations which is fixed for 15 years for non-domestic applicants for installations greater than 6.0kW up to 50kW in size. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200063#WRF06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":298,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200064#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[27392\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200064#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will detail his engagement with youth groups on climate action issues, their role in policy development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>The Climate Action Plan 2021 commits to engaging with young people through the National Dialogue on Climate Action (NDCA) which has been established under my Department to engage,\u00a0inform and empower everyone in society to address climate change.

One measure identified within the communication relates to subsidising the cost of gas used for power generation, which the Commission highlights, depending on their design may entail significant costs.   However, while this measure has been identified in regions with very limited interconnection and where gas has a strong influence on the price of electricity, as is the case in the all-island Single Electricity Market (SEM), it is also considered most effective where consumers are particularly exposed to pass-through wholesale electricity prices. While this is the case in Spain, for example, where a considerable proportion of consumers are on electricity tariffs that are directly linked to the wholesale price, this is not true of the SEM, where very few consumers are on such pass-through tariffs. Irish domestic customer contracts are almost exclusively based on hedged contracts by suppliers, limiting the exposure of customers to sudden increases in wholesale gas costs. We await further detail from the Commission regarding the implementation of this option in Spain and Portugal, which will allow for further consideration by Member States. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200064#WRG04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Conservation","counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200064#WRG04600"},{"type":"question","counter":343,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[28416\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200064#WRG04700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the way that he can support the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland with the increased number of queries that it is receiving regarding retrofit schemes.","asker":"1557","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":344,"content":"<p>Earlier this year, Government announced a package of supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills.

the Circular Economy Programme; the National Food Loss Prevention Roadmap; and the Circular Economy Fund.\u00a0<\/p><p>The\u00a0Bill will also\u00a0provide for the power\u00a0to introduce environmental levies on certain single-use disposable items, including single-use disposable cups, containers and packaging, and to prohibit their placing on the market where a suitable re-usable alternative is, or could be made, readily available. These levies will work in a similar way to the plastic bag levy, which has been so successful in tackling plastic bag litter.\u00a0 These new environmental levies will be introduced incrementally, with\u00a0the initial focus on the introduction of levies on single-use disposable hot drinks cups later this year as well as a ban on their use in sit-in caf&eacute;s. <\/p><p>All proceeds from levies introduced under the Bill will be ringfenced in a Circular Economy Fund to support environmental projects and initiatives. The purposes for which payments may be made from the Circular Economy Fund are specified in section 8(9) of the Bill.<\/p><p>Numerous Life Cycle Analyses (LCAs) of re-usable cups have found that these cups have a lower overall environmental impact than disposable cups, provided the re-usable cup is used enough times and washed efficiently. The &lsquo;breakeven&rsquo; number of uses required will vary depending on the material a re-usable cup is made from, and the type of disposable cup compared to, but can be as low as between 10-25 uses.

Initial proposals in relation to additional environmental levies were also subject to an earlier public consultation launched in November 2019.

In 2020, the ESRI estimated that 17.5% of households in Ireland could be at risk of\u00a0energy\u00a0poverty. Lower income households living in inefficient homes are more at risk of\u00a0energy\u00a0poverty\u00a0when\u00a0energy\u00a0prices increase, as the proportion of their income needed to meet their\u00a0energy\u00a0needs increases.   The Government has put a range of policies and measures in place to support households who are at risk of\u00a0energy\u00a0poverty. These measures supplement lower income households through the Fuel Allowance, the Household Benefits Package and other payments, as well as providing free\u00a0energy\u00a0efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable\u00a0Energy\u00a0Authority of Ireland schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. This year, 58% (&euro;203 million) of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million will be spent on dedicated\u00a0energy\u00a0poverty\u00a0retrofit supports and local authority retrofits. Recognising the unprecedented rise in\u00a0energy\u00a0prices facing people the Government put in place a number of additional measures earlier this year including:<\/p>  <p>  -an increase in the weekly rate of the Fuel Allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 a week so that &euro;914 was paid to eligible households over the course of the winter, an additional lump-sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to the 370,000 households receiving the fuel allowance in mid-March.<\/p>  <p>-   the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of &euro;176.22 (excl. VAT) credited to domestic electricity accounts.<\/p>  <p>  -specific measures in the new National Retrofit Schemes to support householders in taking actions to reduce\u00a0energy\u00a0bills, including up to 80% grant funding for low-cost, high-impact measures such as attic insulation.<\/p>  <p>  To further manage the impact of recent price increases the Government, in the recently published National\u00a0Energy\u00a0Security Framework, announced a number of additional measures for households and businesses including:<\/p>  <p>  -A new targeted &euro;20 million scheme for the installation of Photo Voltaic (PV) panels for households that have a high reliance on electricity for medical reasons.<\/p>  <p>  -A package of measures to enhance protections for financially vulnerable customers and customers in debt in the electricity and gas sectors.<\/p>  <p>-   A review of the price-drivers behind electricity and natural gas bills (including network costs) with a view to mitigating cost increases for consumers and businesses in the near term.<\/p>  <p>  -The continuation of the excise duty reduction on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil until the Budget in October 2022.<\/p>  <p>  -A reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October.<\/p>  <p>-   An additional payment of &euro;100 for all recipients of the Fuel Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  -The reduction to zero of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy on electricity bills.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the measures outlined above,\u00a0electricity and gas suppliers, which are overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, have a range of protections against disconnections in place for consumers. In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year. Additionally, under the supplier led voluntary\u00a0Energy\u00a0Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them at any time. Accordingly, any customers who are experiencing difficulties with their Bills should engage with their supplier to discuss the various options and assistance\u00a0available.<\/p>  <p>  A research network on fuel\u00a0poverty\u00a0chaired by the Economic and Social Research Institute was established in 2021.

As also set out in the Framework, work is ongoing to consider additional measures to help consumers meet the cost of energy taking into account available resources. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200067#WRK02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200067#WRK02200"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[28767\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200067#WRK02300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the extent to which wind, wave or solar energy are being developed to meet Ireland&rsquo;s climate change targets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":486,"content":"<p>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) annual Energy in Ireland report sets out the final annual figures of total electricity generated and the percentage of electricity generated from renewable sources in Ireland.

It is hoped that increasing taxi fares, particularly the premium fare, will encourage more taxi drivers to operate during that time, as well as making the sector more attractive to new entrants, thus increasing availability to passengers nationally.<\/p>  <p>  The 2022 driver survey, undertaken by the NTA, shows that 93% of drivers are now working but only 29% currently work this period. 30% of drivers (up from 17% in 2019) reported that they would consider working these hours if fares were to increase for this &ldquo;night work&rdquo;.\u00a0\u00a0 In recognition of this, the proposed fare has been weighted in favour of the Premium Rate period.\u00a0 The increase in cents\/euro for each taxi user per journey is not substantial; however, the cumulative impact of the increase is significant for drivers and it is hoped that this will encourage more taxi drivers to operate during these periods and also encourage drivers to reactivate their licences.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the NTA introduced a number of supports during the Covid-19 pandemic to reduce the costs for licenced SPSVs to continue in the industry during this very difficult period. These included an increase in the maximum vehicle age, and licence fees at no cost. The NTA also introduced a regulatory measure to allow licence holders to be inactive for 24 months (previously 12 months) to allow them to remain attached to the industry with no associated costs during this very uncertain period. It is hoped that a significant proportion of these licences will return now that demand for services is increasing.<\/p>  <p>  The SPSV Motor Tax Refund Scheme was introduced as an additional financial support to assist the SPSV industry in its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. and I provided &euro;2m in funding for this Scheme. The Scheme commenced on 1 September 2021 following NTA&rsquo;s extensive efforts to put in place the necessary process to ensure SPSV licence holders could receive a reimbursement of &euro;95 for their SPSV Motor Tax. The Scheme will end on 31 August 2022.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The NTA also introduced the NCT Initial Test Fee Waiver Scheme for the SPSV sector on September 1st 2021, with funding of &euro;1.5m from my Department.\u00a0 As a result, SPSVs presenting for the NCT received, and continue to receive, this test for free.\u00a0 This Scheme also ends on 31 August 2022.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has made available funding to the NTA to provide grants for the provision and conversion of vehicles to being wheelchair accessible which is a requirement for new entrants to the SPSV industry.\u00a0 The uptake of the Wheelchair Accessible Taxi (WAT) grant scheme has been strong, with 3,341 grants allocated for the purchase of a WAT between 2014 and 2021, with associated funding of over &euro;3 million given over that period.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero\/low-emission vehicles.\u00a0The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use.\u00a0 The Scheme is funded by the Department and administered by the NTA. &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support the industry to switch to electric. The Scheme is kept under continuous review and is currently paused to allow for the drawdown and payment of provisional grant offers.\u00a0Once these grant offers have been drawn down, there will be a clearer picture of the funding available for the second half of the year and, at this stage, I anticipate the scheme will reopen for applications in the summer, allowing SPSV operators to again apply for the supports on offer.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200067#WRK05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":513,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200067#WRK05100"},{"type":"question","counter":514,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[28664\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200067#WRK05200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 20 of 25 May 2022, the date that was provided to his Department by Kerry County Council confirming that works were completed in respect of this project;

Some of the main features of the current regime are its simplicity and that it applies to a broad base. Changing the tax rate (or imposing additional levies on certain sectors) could have unforeseen consequences. There is a risk of such taxes leading to higher consumer costs and negative impacts on investment in the energy sector, in particular in the area of renewables.<\/p>  <p>  Proposals for a windfall tax must take into account wider energy policy, under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. A well-functioning EU electricity market is crucial for the integration of our Internal Energy Market and supporting investment in new renewables. The best long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and generating power from our own renewable sources will ensure a cleaner, cheaper energy future in the long term.<\/p>  <p>  The complexities of the energy market and the range of producers and contracts must also be taken into account. For example, the Renewable Energy Support Scheme (RESS) contains strong consumer protection measures, with wholesale market revenues above the auction price returned to electricity consumers through the Public Service Obligation Levy.<\/p>  <p>  As noted in the previous discussion cited by the Deputy, these are all important matters for consideration by the Government when looking at the wider context for energy taxation proposals.  In this regard, the Government approved and published the National Energy Security Framework on the 13th April. The Framework sets out that the Government will work with the European Commission and other Member States to consider the policy proposals outlined under REPowerEU, designed to aid consumers and businesses to deal with increasing energy costs. REPowerEU is a joint European action for more affordable, secure and sustainable energy.  The European Commission published the REPowerEU Plan on 18 May and analysis of these proposals is currently being undertaken. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has taken a number of measures to reduce the burden on consumers in relation to the cost of energy. This includes providing &euro;200 worth of energy credit to every household in the country; reductions in fuel excise duty; and a reduction in the VAT rate for electricity and gas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200068#WRL03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":550,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[28595\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200068#WRL03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a person who works at sea in international waters for the majority of the year is liable to pay income tax to any state; if so, the state to which this tax will be paid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":551,"content":"<p>I am informed by Revenue that it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the question put by the Deputy in the absence of more specific information.<\/p><p>However, in general, the state where an international seafarer is liable to tax on income derived from the exercise of an employment on board a ship in international waters will depend on a number of different factors, including, but not restricted to the following:\u00a0<\/p><p>- the domestic tax rules in the state of residence of the seafarer;<\/p><p>- the tax rules applying to the employment income of international seafarers in the state where:<\/p><p>- the employment is held and from where the employment income is paid<\/p><p>- the vessel is registered<\/p><p>- the vessel is managed.\u00a0<\/p><p>In cases where the employment income of the international seafarer is subject to tax under the domestic tax rules of two jurisdictions, the terms of a double taxation agreement (DTA) concluded between these jurisdictions may apply to alleviate double taxation.

However, this information\u00a0may be available or requested\u00a0from each individual local authority.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2013, Exchequer funding has been provided through my Department's Energy Efficiency Retrofit Programme (EERP) to support local authorities with the retrofit of local authority owned homes requiring insulation and energy upgrade works. Since the programme commenced in 2013 over 75,000 homes have been retrofitted with a total exchequer spend of &euro;184 million under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the Programme for Government commitment, my Department launched a newly revised\u00a0ten year Energy Efficiency Programme in 2021 for local authority owned housing. This new programme set a BER performance requirement of &ldquo;B2&rdquo; or cost optimal level. The upscaling of the works included in the programme sees a substantial overall increase in funding being made available for insulation, windows and\u00a0doors and heating\u00a0upgrades, specifically\u00a0the installation of a Heat Pump and associated works. The installation of gas\/oil boilers are no longer supported under the energy efficiency programme funded by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The 2021 EERP provided funding for the installation of 604 heat pumps, while the Midlands Retrofit Pilot allowed for the installation of heat pumps on all 146 properties. The funding available for the installation of a heat pump last year was &euro;13,000. This has been increased to &euro;16,000 for the 2022 programme.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, my Department announced that funding of &euro;85 million will be provided for the upgrade of approximately 2,400 social homes in 2022. Each local authority received an individual allocation along with a minimum target of homes they are required to retrofit. The programme has been devised in a way to\u00a0give local authorities\u00a0a level of flexibility when selecting properties\u00a0to retrofit ranging from those\u00a0requiring minor levels of works\u00a0to properties needing the maximum level of retrofitting\u00a0required to bring them to a B2\/cost Optimum standard. <\/p>  <p>  Under the 2022 EERP, my Department funds costs of up to\u00a0&euro;48,850, plus project management fees, on individual local authority homes. The actual\u00a0cost of retrofitting works on each\u00a0home will depend on its pre-works\u00a0BER but can be as low as &euro;16,350 in some cases.\u00a0Targets\u00a0set and\u00a0funding allocated to local authorities under the new programme calls for local authorities to undertake retrofitting on a variety of house types, from those requiring minimal investment to those requiring major investment, in order to achieve the B2\/Cost Optimal BER. Local authorities are asked\u00a0to ensure that the average cost per home drawn down under the programme is circa\u00a0&euro;36,000, including project management fees. Adhering to this average will\u00a0ensure that the maximum number of homes can be retrofitted with the available budget.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Work in relation to the 2022 programme\u00a0is underway but it will be later this year before significant recoupment claims are lodged with my Department.\u00a0Full details in relation to the 2022 EERP will be available early in 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200069#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":582,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200069#WRM00800"},{"type":"question","counter":583,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[28559\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200069#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will provide the full list of all nominations received by prescribed bodies pursuant to section 106 of the Planning &amp;amp; Development Act 2000 as amended for membership of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2014; the way that the selection process was conducted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":584,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy regarding nominations received from prescribed bodies\u00a0 for membership of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2014 is\u00a0being compiled and will be provided to the Deputy in accordance with Standing Orders.<\/p>  <p>  The appointment of ordinary members of the Board is governed by section 106 of the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended, and by Part 7 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.

The Passport Service will work to issue a passport or respond to a request for further information to the customer within two working days.<\/p><p>While Deputies often hear of the most complex and pressing cases, the overwhelming majority of passport applicants have their passport processed without any recourse to their local TD.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Passport Service is already out-performing any previous year, despite the challenges that it has encountered over the past two years. In 2019, which was the busiest year for passports pre-Covid, the Passport Service had issued 470,000 passports by the end of May. In the same time period this year, over 540,000 passports have been issued. In 2021, 634,000 passports were issued in the whole year. In five months the Passport Service has issued over 80% of the total number of passports that were issued in the whole of last year.<\/p><p>Passport applicants can track the status of their passport application online via the Passport Tracker which is available on my Department's website - <i>www.dfa.ie\/passporttracking\/<\/i>. The information on the tracker has recently been upgraded, and is an excellent guide as to where an application is in the system.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is a unified service composed of three constituent offices located in Lower Mount Street and Balbriggan in Dublin and South Mall in Cork, respectively. Passport applications from all citizens - whether at home or abroad - are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices, on the basis of the type of application rather than the place of residence of the applicant.<\/p><p>Over 90% of all passport applications, including first time applications, are now being made through Passport Online and Passport Online is available to 97% of all applicants across the world. The Passport Service is committed to continuing to offer a range of application channels, including an offline service for citizens who are not eligible or do not wish to use the Passport Online service.<\/p><p>Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.<\/p><p>The paper-based, mail-in &quot;Post Passport&quot; service is available to citizens at almost 1,000 An Post post offices. A paper-based, mail-in service is also available at over 70 post office locations in Northern Ireland. The Passport Service continues to see a steady, but increasing demand for passports from citizens in Northern Ireland. With the availability of both Passport Online and the postal application channel, very few applicants are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport.<\/p><p>In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an Urgent Appointment service for passport renewal with a 1 or 4-day turnaround. The Passport Service offices in Dublin and Cork have processed over 5,000 Urgent Appointments to date in 2022. These Urgent Appointment applications represents just 0.9% of the total 540,000 applications received by the Passport Service since January of this year.<\/p><p>I am satisfied overall that the range of service options available meets the current needs of passport applicants and that recent service improvements allow the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner. While there are no plans to open additional passport offices, the Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience for citizens.<\/p><p>I would again encourage all those applying for passports to apply online well in advance of any planned travel.\u00a0 The current processing\u00a0times\u00a0for passport applications are:<\/p><p>- 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals<\/p><p>- 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals<\/p><p>- 30 working days for First\u00a0Time\u00a0Applications on Passport Online (applications received from 19 April)<\/p><p>- 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Post Passport&quot; service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200069#WRM03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Radon Gas Levels","counter":614,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200069#WRM03100"},{"type":"question","counter":615,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[28575\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200069#WRM03200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of offices operated by his Department that are in high-risk areas for radon; the number that have been tested for radon; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":616,"content":"<p>Following the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report of last week, my Department noted that one of our offices\u00a0is located in a high risk radon area.

programme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,506 schools and organisations benefitting 230,000 children.\u00a0 The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.\u00a0 The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>A budget of &euro;68.1 million has been provided for the programme in 2022.\u00a0 The allocation for the school meals programme was increased substantially over a series of budgets - increasing from &euro;35million in 2012 to &euro;68.1 million in 2022 (almost 95% of an increase).\u00a0 The amount of school meals funding that has been provided for the past five school years by county is provided in the attached tabular statement.<\/p><p>I am committed to continuing to grow the school meals programme and in particular the hot school meals element of the programme, building further on the significant extension announced as part of Budget 2022. \u00a0In this regard, I have commissioned an evaluation of the school meals programme to be undertaken in 2022 to inform future policy decisions on the scheme.<\/p><p>This evaluation will assess all aspects of the provision of school meals and will engage with all stakeholders.\u00a0 This evaluation will consider:<\/p><p>- The extent to which the school meals programme has improved school attendance and educational achievement\/outcomes. <\/p><p>- The extent to which the school meals programme has alleviated food poverty and\/or improved deprivation measures among families of children who benefit from the programme. <\/p><p>- Whether or not the current method of targeting the programme vis the DEIS categorisation is effective\/the implications for the outcomes measured in (a) and (b) of extending the scheme to non-DEIS schools. <\/p><p>- Whether the current school meal programme is effective.<\/p><p>- How the scheme compares with programmes in peer states.<\/p><p>- Identify gaps and recommend changes to the current programme and propose a design for an effective impact evaluation of the school meals programme.<\/p><p>- Implications of the EU Child Guarantee for the SMP.<\/p><p>The evaluation is due for completion in November 2022.<\/p><p>I

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments. Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.\u00a0 Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.\u00a0 Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.\u00a0\u00a0 Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care. This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.\u00a0The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.<\/p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.\u00a0 A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.<\/p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted the need for the foster care allowance to be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Tusla is currently preparing a paper on this matter, which will then be considered by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and the provisions in relation foster care will form part of this review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200073#WRQ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":835,"content":"<p>Question No. 314 replied to with Question No. 56.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Programmes","counter":836,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200073#WRQ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":837,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[28747\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200073#WRQ03000","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the extent to which integration programmes are currently in place with a view to addressing the needs of children and adults; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":838,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has responsibility for migrant integration policy, including the outgoing Migrant Integration Strategy, that sets out the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the promotion of migrant integration as a key part of Ireland&rsquo;s renewal and as an underpinning principle of Irish society.

This marked an important milestone in a process to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland that has gathered momentum since Ireland became a signatory to the Convention in 2007. Every Government Department and every Agency\u00a0plays a role in\u00a0ensuring implementation of the UNCRPD.  \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting the obligations of the UNCRPD is one of progressive realisation - each year moving forward on key reforms, through delivery of two whole-of-government national strategies - the National Disability Inclusion Strategy and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities. This model involves obligations arising from the Convention being met over time. Initial priority has been given to meeting legislative commitments and requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland submitted its Initial State Report on the implementation of the UNCRPD to the UN Committee in November 2021, following extensive consultation with persons with disabilities, disabled persons organisations, representative organisations, and families. My Department is currently awaiting a review date from the UN Committee to evaluate progress made to date.<\/p>  <p>  My Department coordinates two major national strategies, which aim to address the needs of people with disabilities in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy\u00a0(NDIS), contains 123 actions to support effective progress in delivering on the obligations set out in the UNCRPD, including in relation to children and women with disabilities. Implementation of the NDIS is monitored in regular NDIS Steering Group meetings through a reporting system which requires Government Departments and Agencies to detail their progress biannually. The group is supported by independent analysis and advice from the National Disability Authority (NDA).  \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES), is the primary disability employment policy initiative in Ireland. It is a cross-government approach, bringing together actions by Government Departments and Agencies to address the barriers and challenges to the\u00a0employment of persons with disabilities. The CES&rsquo;s strategic priorities are to build skills, capacity and independence, to provide bridges and supports into work, to make work pay, to promote job retention and re-entry to work, to provide coordinated and seamless supports and to engage employers. Implementation of the CES is undertaken through agreed action plans and is monitored by an Implementation Group with an independent chairperson. <\/p>  <p>  Efforts are also underway to address the specific needs of people with autism. Last year, on World Autism Day, I announced my intention to develop an Autism Innovation Strategy. The Autism Innovation Strategy will identify key areas where individuals with autism face particular challenges and barriers, focusing on areas which may not be addressed by other national strategies. Once published, the Autism Innovation Strategy will utilise the key themes of innovation, empowerment and awareness raising to shape future policies and strategies to accelerate our journey towards being a more autism-inclusive and neurodiverse-friendly society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200073#WRQ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"question","counter":843,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[28749\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200073#WRQ03600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the extent to which women with disabilities are receiving sufficient attention and correspondence from his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":844,"content":"<p>I engage on an ongoing basis with a range of stakeholders, including people with disabilities and Disabled Persons Organisations (DPOs), to make progress on the issues and challenges facing people with disabilities and to further realise the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  I consider\u00a0the input of all stakeholders, including women with disabilities, to be fundamentally important to the development of effective and inclusive disability policy.

The aim of Tusla&rsquo;s Prevention Partnership &amp;amp; Family Support (PPFS) Service is to prevent risks to children and young people arising or escalating through early intervention and family support. <\/p>  <p>  The Children First Act 2015 places a number of statutory obligations on specific groups of professionals and on particular organisations providing services to children. Additionally the Children&rsquo;s First Guidance 2017 includes information on the statutory obligations for those individuals and organisations under the Act. It also sets out the best practice procedures that should be in place for all organisations providing services to children.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the safety of children in the care of the State, Tusla is committed to promoting safe practice in all areas of alternative care including residential care and foster care.\u00a0 Safe practice is defined as the implementation of appropriate safeguarding measures necessary for working with young people in a manner that acknowledges their need to live in as normal an environment as possible. Regulations govern the placement of children in care.\u00a0 These provide for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions. The Regulations also provide that the allocated social worker oversees the implementation of the child's\u00a0 care plan, visits the child and consults with family members, foster carers and other people involved with the child to ensure that his or her needs are being met and that the care being provided is optimal.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA carries out announced and unannounced inspections of children&rsquo;s services including Child Protection and Welfare Services, Foster Care Services, statutory Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres and Special Care units. HIQA carry out these inspections against Regulations and Standards, by reviewing files on site, interviews and questionnaires with staff and service users and their families. Following an inspection, HIQA share their initial judgements and draft report with the service\/area. HIQA then works with the management of the centre or area in order to agree an Action Plan to address any identified deficits. Final reports are published, and are submitted to the Department with the area or service&rsquo;s Action Plans and are monitored as necessary by DCEDIY officials.<\/p>  <p>  It has been shown that the best environment for most children in care to thrive and reach their potential is best achieved within a foster care placement. Such placements also offer the child a loving and stable environment in which to live. Ireland can be proud of the fact that over 90% of all children in care, reside in foster care, a figure that compares favourably with our European neighbours. In some instances a child&rsquo;s needs are best met in Residential Care. Residential centres are typically domestic style homes where between 2 to 6 young people are being cared for. Young people in residential centres have an allocated a Key Worker, and their friends and family are free to visit in line with their care plan. Where possible these young people attend local schools and are supported to take part in local sporting and community activities.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200073#WRQ04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services","counter":851,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200073#WRQ04400"},{"type":"question","counter":852,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[28752\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200073#WRQ04500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the efforts currently in hand to ensure that Ireland can have a national childcare scheme where the prices paid for childcare are similar to prices paid for childcare elsewhere across the European Union; the recent progress in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":853,"content":"<p>The most recent edition of 'Key data on early childhood education and care in Europe' published by the European Commission in 2019, highlighted the\u00a0high level of fees for full time early childhood education and care for under 3s in\u00a0countries which rely on market mechanisms to including Ireland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.

Consequently, Impact 2030: Ireland's Research and Innovation Strategy was published recently and positions research and innovation at the heart of addressing Ireland's societal, economic and environmental challenges. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Impact 2030 is structured around five pillars.<\/p>  <p>  - maximise the impact of research and innovation on the economy, society and the environment;<\/p>  <p>  - impact, evidence and evaluation will be central to the alignment of research and innovation activity with national needs<\/p>  <p>  - promote innovation driving enterprise success, particularly in the SME sector<\/p>  <p>  - ensure that talent is at the heart of the research and innovation research system<\/p>  <p>  - strengthening all- island, EU and global connectivity. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A wide-ranging consultation process informed development of the strategy, which included a public consultation process held in summer 2021. An online survey yielded 115 written submissions and an online stakeholder event and workshop attended by 120 participants from across Ireland&rsquo;s R&amp;I system. A clear message arising from the consultation process was the need to position research and innovation at the heart of responding to national challenges. Another was the need to improve how the R&amp;I system itself works. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Arising from this context, a key initiative in Impact 2030 is to bring a landmark Research Bill to government to create a new competitive research and innovation funding agency, combining and building on the missions of the Irish Research Council and Science Foundation Ireland. The agency will not only support research across all disciplines, but it will enable greater interdisciplinary research activity in Ireland. This amalgamation will also improve coordination of funding activities, administrative efficiencies and it will simplify the suite of supports for researchers, while building on both funders&rsquo; respective existing track records and international reputations. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A critical first action toward the new agency&rsquo;s establishment will be a mapping of existing supports in order to identify any duplication or gaps, as well as complementarity with other funding agencies that come under the remit of other Government Departments. Its creation will be based on extensive consultation and a due diligence process which will identify the optimal structure needed to give effect to the intended role, functions and activities of this new agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200074#WRR01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":887,"content":"<p>Question No. 331 answered with Question No. 330.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":888,"content":"<p>Question No. 332 answered with Question No. 330.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further and Higher Education","counter":889,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200074#WRR01800"},{"type":"question","counter":890,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[28632\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022060200074#WRR01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department provides funding towards hardship funds administered by third-level colleges and universities to assist students facing financial difficulties; and, if so, if he will provide details of the way that this fund is managed by each institution.","asker":"1519","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":891,"content":"<p>My Department provides funding on an annual basis to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) to assist students who are unable to meet costs associated with day-to-day participation in higher education.<\/p><p>The core funding allocation\u00a0for the SAF\u00a0is &euro;9.1m.\u00a0This includes &euro;1 million of ring-fenced core funding allocated in 2017\u00a0for the support of part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups identified in the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021.

The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) has been liaising with stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU), on efforts being taken within the sector to understand and address the issue.  In February 2022, PSI met with a number of superintendent pharmacists and the IPU. The PSI also circulated a survey on behalf of the IPU to all registrants to support in efforts in understanding and addressing the issue in the short term, the results of which are pending. I understand that the IPU is seeking to establish a stakeholder group to examine the issue.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In developing its Corporate Strategy 2021-2023, PSI was aware through its work and through reports from stakeholders, of an increasing risk to the continued availability of a pharmacist workforce, with a focus on community and hospital pharmacy, with a concern being that the issue might be exacerbated into the future. It is currently undertaking a project, due to run across 2022-&rsquo;23, &lsquo;Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce&rsquo;. In 2022, this project is set to &ldquo;assess emerging risks to the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce within community and hospital pharmacy in Ireland&rdquo;.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission is also currently supporting a health and social care workforce planning strategy and action plan, a health and social care workforce planning model, health and social care workforce projections and gap analysis project. Support includes recommendations for health and social care workforce reforms.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the number of training places available for persons wishing to obtain the qualification to practise as a pharmacist, the pharmacist qualification is a PSI-accredited five-year fully integrated Master&rsquo;s degree programme in pharmacy (MPharm). \u00a0There are three Schools of Pharmacy within universities in Ireland &ndash; TCD, RCSI and UCC.\u00a0 On successful completion of the five-year programme, graduates are then eligible to apply to the PSI for registration through the National Route of registration.\u00a0\u00a0As part of their Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce project, PSI have committed to share any relevant data emerging as part of that project with relevant Government departments, along with relevant first-time registration data with the relevant Government departments, particularly if trends are identified that indicate a future deficit. <\/p>  <p>  This is a complex problem with many contributing factors and multiple stakeholders.

A variety of transport solutions are pursued nationally, including service provider transport, and I do acknowledge that transport to day services can be a significant issue for some service users.<\/p>  <p>  In CHO1 however, as this is a particularly rural area with limited public transport options, and many service users require assistance to access their disability services, the HSE has developed a transport service in conjunction with Local Link and SITT, an Seirbh&iacute;s Iompair Tuaithe Teoranta, the Rural Transport Service Ltd. in Co. Donegal.<\/p>  <p>  There is a shared commitment in CHO 1 to provide a quality driven and person-centred health care service, within allocated resources, that meets the needs of service users as close to home as possible. There is also a history of partnership, working with local community and voluntary agencies, local authorities and the educational sector, all with a shared commitment to improve the health of the population living in those counties.<\/p>  <p>  A process was initiated in Donegal in 2008 to create a partnership with Local Rural Transport Companies around transporting people to HSE services, and following a successful pilot this was rolled out on a phased basis to the rest of the county between 2009 and 2012, and there is now a transport service in place across all five counties within CHO1.<\/p>  <p>  Service users from a number of HSE services avail of this dedicated transport service, including Older Persons, Disability and Mental Health services.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE cover the cost of 90% of this service, and day service passengers in all areas of CHO1 have been asked to pay &euro;4 return on these HSE transport routes as a contribution to the overall transport costs incurred. Passenger fares commenced in 2008 in Donegal, 2012 in Sligo and Leitrim and 2019 in Cavan and Monaghan.<\/p>  <p>  Some service users in these counties are able to use public Local Link services to reach their day service, and they can use their Free Travel pass on these. However, these routes do not always meet the needs of service users in terms of routes available or supports needed, and so there remains a need for the closed, HSE funded, transport routes where the &euro;4 return daily contribution charge is collected.<\/p>  <p>  Passengers receive a high-quality, door to door service, provided by Garda vetted drivers and bus assistants, with the shortest possible journey times incurred. This dedicated transport service is safe and fully accessible and focused on the needs of those people with disabilities who use it every day.<\/p>  <p>  This transport service is crucial in getting people to their day services and other HSE services, services which so many missed attending during the worst periods of the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Given the increasing costs of providing transport, and to enable the continued delivery of this essential service, the continuation of the &euro;4 charge is necessary to keep the service running. At a national level, the government is seeking to improve access to public transport, particularly in rural areas and for those with disabilities, and much work is underway to ensure that in the coming years more people will be able to avail of public transport services where they can use their Free Travel Pass.<\/p>  <p>  There is no standard approach to transport throughout the disability services sector, some providers do not provide transport while others provide transport to some service users and not to others, due to the historical nature of many of the arrangements.
