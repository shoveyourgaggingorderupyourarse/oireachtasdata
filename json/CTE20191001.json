I am accompanied by my acting chief executive officer, CEO, Ms Marion Kelly.  I am happy to answer any and all questions the members of the committee might have.  Ms Kelly and I have been working closely on this project and she will intervene wherever appropriate.  Our aim is to ensure that questions are answered fully and accurately.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Banking Culture Board was established to regain public trust in banking.  The only way banks can regain this trust is to earn it.  Rebuilding the confidence of wider society in the industry will require time, patience, courage and commitment.  I believe the board can play a key role in this process, through our own activities and through supporting and partnering with other relevant organisations.  I view the establishment of the board as a positive development and an opportunity not to be missed.  It is notable that 85% of the public and stakeholders who contributed to our public consultation exercise supported the establishment of the board.  <\/p> <p>  The board is a unique body.  Nothing like it has ever been established in Ireland previously.  The board is comprises individuals with very different perspectives and backgrounds.  All of them are stakeholders in the banking sector who have, for the first time, agreed to work together to improve banking culture.  We have created a structure that represents the best means to contribute to real and authenticate change in a way that delivers for the citizens of our country.  The fact that the banks are represented on the board, but in a minority, represents, to my mind, the best of both worlds.  The non-bank majority, who are representative of a cross-section of society, will ensure that the voice and perspectives of the public will be heard.  I believe that the changes necessary in banking culture have a far greater chance of being delivered because of, and not in spite of, the five member banks having representatives on the board.  <\/p> <p>  I am not of the banking world, so how did I come to be the chair of the Irish Banking Culture Board?  I read an advertisement in the newspaper, almost exactly one year ago.  It stated that the five retail banks in Ireland had resolved to establish such a board to act as a transformative influence on culture within the banking sector, focused on earning the public's trust.  It sounded to me like a very good idea and one not before its time.  I replied to the advertisement.  My appointment was entirely independent of the banks.  It was conducted by way of an open competition.  A selection panel was chaired by Dame Colette Bowe, the then chair of the United Kingdom Banking Standards Board.  She was joined by Sir Callum McCarthy, the former head of the Financial Services Authority, FSA, in the UK and our own Dr. Martin McAleese.  <\/p> <p>  I was appointed and commenced in the role of chair in January 2019.  My first task was to select and appoint the members of the board.  This selection process was, again, entirely independent.  The criteria, in my mind, as I was selecting and appointing the board included ensuring that its membership would reflect the feedback received during the extensive public and stakeholder consultations, while still remaining at a manageable size.  I was clear at the outset that each of the five founding banks had to be represented on the board by the most senior bankers.  Why did I take that view?  It was because the banks own the problem and they must own the solution.  I am convinced that it is through vigorous, open dialogue and concerted action between these senior bankers and the non-bankers of the board that true, lasting and meaningful change will occur.  <\/p> <p>  The composition of the board was announced at our launch on 15 April 2019.<\/p><p>It comprises 14 members, and committee members have had biographies of these people circulated to them beforehand.  Along with the five senior bankers, there are seven non-banking members, who represent a wide range of stakeholders in the banking sector.  They reflect what we heard during the public consultation process.  They are as follows, in alphabetical order: Ms Angela Black, chief executive of the Citizens Information Board; Professor Blanaid Clarke, a leading authority on corporate ethics from Trinity College Dublin; Mr. Padraic Kissane of Padraic Kissane Financial Services; Mr. Gareth Murphy, head of industrial relations at the Financial Services Union; Mr. Philip O&rsquo;Leary, managing partner at FitzGerald Legal &amp;amp; Advisory, chair of the Legal Aid Board and a lifelong advocate for consumer protection; Ms Sue O&rsquo;Neill, chair of the Small Firms Association and board member of Microfinance Ireland and; Mr. Martin Stapleton, chair of the national farm business committee of the Irish Farmer&rsquo;s Association.  Mr. Stapleton is a dairy farmer from Limerick.  The five senior bank representatives on the board represent a range of different skill sets.  I asked for that and I got it.  This includes a chief executive officer, a chief risk officer, a chief operations officer with IT and artificial intelligence expertise, a head of human resources and a head of consumer banking.<\/p><p> I refer to what we intend to do and why.  From the outset, we have been conscious that it was critical to ask for and, listen to, the views of societal stakeholders, including banking staff, and bank customers on current banking culture and how the Irish Banking Culture Board can work to change this for the better.  During our establishment phase, we conducted the extensive public and stakeholder consultation I have referred to.  We received 747 submissions from the public via an online survey, and we commissioned a survey of more than 25,000 bank staff.  We conducted 38 face-to-face interviews with individuals and organisations from right across society, including consumer organisations, small and large business, farmers, charities, youth groups, students, trade unions, rural interests, older customer groups, media, politicians and regulators.  Some of committee members contributed to these proceedings and we thank them for that.<\/p><p> Our objective in determining what the board should first focus on was to reflect the concerns and suggestions we heard from the public, stakeholders and bank staff.  We promised to address these concerns and that is what we are doing.  Our work programme up to April 2020 comprises nine key themes, each of which has been identified from the findings of our public consultation.  These themes are customers in a vulnerable position; services to bereaved customers; respectful and transparent communications; financial education and awareness; small medium enterprises, SMEs, including farmers; support for community and society; speaking up; embedding ethics and behaviour and; staff resilience and pressures.<\/p><p> During our work, we will partner as appropriate with the expertise in our member banks, with other relevant industry bodies such as the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, and the Institute of Bankers, as well as with other relevant bodies, to achieve our aims as efficiently and transparently as possible.  However, we will always be protective of our independence and our overall goal of being a trusted, independent voice and a transformative influence on banking culture in Ireland.  We will call out poor conduct when we find it and we will acknowledge good things when we can identify them.  The chief executives and boards of the five founding-member banks of the Irish Banking Culture Board have clearly and repeatedly committed to me their full support for the board and its activities.  The leadership of the banks recognises that this board is independent.  We do not speak for the banks.  We speak for the stakeholders of the industry.  We see ourselves as a critical friend to the industry in many ways.  We will promote an environment in which ethical behaviour lies at the heart of banking, values are restored, and a reputation for competence is rediscovered.  We will hold the banks to account on their progress.<\/p><p> I accept the scepticism that exists around this endeavour.  I am also a sceptic.  It would be difficult to spend 42 years in the practice of the law without developing a healthy degree of scepticism.  I have encountered a lot of bad places and bad people in my time as a judge and barrister in Ireland and as a judge at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  However, I have never lost my faith in human nature.<\/p><p>I am convinced that the vast majority of Irish men and women who work in the banking industry are decent, honest, honourable people who wish to serve their customers and their country well, to be an example to their families and friends and to feel proud of the work they do as guardians of a great national interest.  Our task is to help and empower them to regain public trust in the banks by pursuing the highest ethical standards and levels of competence and by ensuring the fair and humane treatment of customers.  <\/p><p> This is just the beginning.  A long road lies ahead but I believe that we have made a good start.  Identifying and changing culture is difficult for us and society.  We must dare to believe that we can do this.  Irish society and culture have changed dramatically over the years and bank culture must also change.  People today demand better of everything, including their banks.  We see ourselves as being part of this change in the banks, change that is not before time.  Embedding ethical behaviour in banking culture is an ideal whose day has come in Ireland and around the globe.  We dare to believe that we can do this.  We can and we will.  <\/p><p> Finally, should we be invited to return to this committee next year to update it on our activities, we would be delighted to do so to answer members' questions regarding our progress.  I again thank the committee for the opportunity to present the IBCB to the committee this afternoon.  We are very happy to take its questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019100100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justice John Hedigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569884400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Justice Hedigan and Ms Kelly and thank him for his opening statement.

It was a truly terrible situation; that after all of the trouble we had had back in the early days with the collapsing banks and with efforts being made by everyone to try to regain some trust in the banking sector, that something like this should suddenly arrive.  The Deputy is quite correct.  I think it was the catalyst.  There was talk of setting up a banking culture board because the UK had set one up in 2015 or, interestingly enough, a banking standards board.  We see ourselves as somewhat different.  We do not focus so much on the staff, which is what the UK does, we are focusing on the customer, which I think is a better approach.<\/p> <p>  There was pressure on the banks to do something in terms of setting up a culture board and I think the tracker mortgage scandal situation sparked that and was the catalyst for it.  In terms of recent events in that regard, when I became aware of the letters that had been sent to the committee by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman concerning the invocation of time limits, I immediately emailed all the five banking members of our board in order to find out the facts of the situation.  I asked them which of the banks were invoking those time limits.  I asked those who were to please contact me to discuss what I described in the email as \"this troubling issue\".  Over the following days - it was less than a week - I was very pleased to see that all of the banks made public statements saying that they would no longer invoke the time limits.  Subsequently, Ms Kelly and I met the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman to see what was going on, from his perspective.  He seemed to be satisfied with the way things were going.

To that end, at our most recent board meeting we resolved to set up a small group consisting of Mr. Philip O'Leary, a senior solicitor and the chairman of the Legal Aid Board, Professor Blanaid Clarke, and myself.  We will meet people from the legal services on an informal basis to find out what is happening, what the problem is, and what we can do to sort it out.

One is the question of how banks deal with the breakdown of relationships.  We as politicians often encounter couples, whether married or unmarried, separating, and they might have a joint mortgage, for example, which can cause major problems.  It is a complex and difficult area in which communication is a big issue.  Problems also arise when one person wishes to remain in the home.  Though that person is prepared to pay the mortgage and is trying to get the other person removed from it, the bank will say that it is an entirely new mortgage and that the person staying has to qualify in his or her own right.  There are many issues around that.  I have made this point to the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland, BPFI, as well.  Banks should have an agreed protocol or mechanism for dealing with relationship breakdowns, particularly when it comes to joint mortgages, because it often involves a family home and children.  It can get very difficult.  It would be positive if the IBCB could play a role there.<\/p> <p>  One of the nine areas the witnesses are focusing on is customers in a vulnerable position.  The Mental Health Commission made recommendations in 2011 about providing specific training to staff within the financial services on dealing with vulnerable customers.  Based on the work Deputy Browne has done, those recommendations do not appear to have been fully followed through on.  We are often contacted by people in vulnerable positions, and the nature of the communication from the bank, even down to the way they are spoken to on the phone, can leave much to be desired.  I ask the witnesses to look into that as well.<\/p> <p>  I wish both the witnesses and their staff well, as they have a difficult task ahead of them.  There is much scepticism about this issue, which they have acknowledged.  However, it is a worthwhile effort, and my party and I support their efforts and hope they succeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019100100002#J00300","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569884400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019100100002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justice John Hedigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1569884400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Pearse Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019100100002#J00500","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1569884400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and their opening statement.

We have been in very dark places.  There were times when we thought we would not make it as a country and an economy, but we managed to come through.  I said at the time, and I still believe, that in respect of all the trouble we had, which we should not have had, right up to the present time with tracker mortgage scandals, I would like to think that that is yesterday's story and that today and tomorrow's story is what we are doing.<\/p> <p>  I share the Deputy's scepticism.  He might be more sceptical than me, although from what he said not much more.  However, it came into existence, and I am sufficiently cynical to agree with the rationale the Deputy put forward for the reason it came into existence, but here we are and we have a pretty powerful group of people.  Some of the heaviest hitters on consumer advocacy, particularly regarding banks, are on that board.  We would be very difficult to ignore at this stage.  The banks have had to create something, and we are it.  I have great hope that we will be able to effect considerable change.  Am I happy with the way things are now?  I can only say that all of the bank people I have met so far, from the highest to the lowest, seem to be very committed to the project in which we are involved.<\/p> <p>  In the course of my preparation for the selection process, I read of events around the world.  I studied very carefully what the UK Banking Standards Board was doing, and it was impressive.  I looked at what the Dutch were doing.  Apparently, they are the leaders in this area of cultural change in the banking world.  I looked at what was happening in Hong Kong.  I read the Australia Royal Commission report, which is scarifying, about how the banks were operating in that country.  I read what the people in New Zealand are doing, and I have read the reports from the New York Federal Reserve Bank's annual conference concerning matters of this sort.  That is why I said that effecting cultural change in banks is an ideal whose day has come, both here in Ireland and around the globe, and it does appear to be so.<\/p> <p>  So far, I have reason to be cautiously optimistic.  I am assured by the chief executives and the chairmen of the banks that they fully support this endeavour.  I have been told that, in effect, anything that we reasonably need in terms of financial backing we will get to do this.<\/p> <p>  All the staff that I have met seemed to be very enthusiastic.  I refer to the workshops we have had, especially in respect of bereaved customers.  There are 50,000 bereaved customers across the banking industry every year and a great deal of trouble occurs in that respect.  We want to have one standard level of care for all of those people so that, for instance, they do not have to keep ringing different people and explaining again that their husband or wife has just died, or much worse.  When we met, three people from our board volunteered to be the nucleus of that working group.  Each of the banks sent their people along who were expert in that area.  It was a truly uplifting discussion.  The sheer vigour and enthusiasm of everyone and the knowledge of the people who were there about the problems that arise in cases of bereavement was very impressive.  They have gone away to work on programmes to ensure that there will be a common standard of care.  We will be making an announcement on that very soon.<\/p><p>I have good reason to be optimistic, but I have occasionally referred to the Russian proverb Ronald Reagan quoted to Mikhail Gorbachev during the strategic arms limitation talks: \"Trust but verify.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019100100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justice John Hedigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569884400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I take Mr. Hedigan's point.

Nevertheless, I like to think of myself as a pragmatic idealist, an optimist, and someone who has not lost his faith in human nature.  I believe we can turn the matter around.<\/p> <p>  As for the current banking culture, I can only say the bankers I have met at the top level, that is, the chief executive officers and chairpersons, have assured me they are fully committed to it.  I can believe that because even if there was not a moral element, the Shearman &amp;amp; Sterling report on banking conduct, which was published in March 2019, stated that between 2009 and 2017, financial institutions globally paid &euro;345 billion in fines and penalties.  That is no way to do business.  It is just total incompetence and has to be addressed.  If one wishes to take a hard-nosed view, bankers have good financial reason to change, irrespective of any moral dimension.  I believe they do have such a dimension, however, although I will not name names.

The intervention is helpful from Mr. Justice Hedigan in that regard.  Where I differ from him, however, is in the statement that he issued.  In his opening statement, Mr. Justice Hedigan said the financial institutions and banks needed to regain trust.  He referred to the scepticism because his board is funded by the five main banks.  It is an industry initiative.  Therefore, the board must also gain trust with the public.  Putting out a statement that the culture board welcomed the bank decision to waive the mortgage complaints timeline was wrong.  There was no ability for them to do that.  They were fighting the ombudsman and had no legal basis to do that.  It was never actually determined in law whether they were right or wrong.  The legislation is very clear and provides that it is three years from when one becomes aware not three years from when one had suspicions of the event.  It is three years from when one became aware.  The KBC and Bank of Ireland idea that a person ringing up ten years ago to say he or she thought he or she might not be on the right tracker rate had awareness is not correct.  That was not awareness, it was a suspicion.  However, the board came down on the side of the banks on this.  It came down on the core argument to suggest there was a problem.  I would welcome Mr. Justice Hedigan's insight as a judge in that regard because if there is a problem with the legislation, we need to address it.  The board did not call out the culture of the banks when they were trying to argue a point of law which had not been adjudicated in court and on which the financial services ombudsman had a different view.  As the author of the legislation, I also have a different view.

The situation that was made quite clear to us was that unless the Ombudsman was told that his jurisdiction was not being challenged under section 51 - the time limitation - he was obliged to investigate whether there was a delay involved.  The complaint he articulated to Deputy Michael McGrath was that it took him as long to do that as it would take to conduct the investigation.  I do not know if there is a misunderstanding at work, but I do not agree that we came down on the side of the banks.  The banks made no representations to me.  As soon as I heard about this affair - I was deeply troubled when I did - I emailed all those who were invoking the time limits and asked them to come and talk to me about this troubling issue and said we would see where we would go from there.

Some of these cases will be dealt with on a legal basis and it is to be hoped that others will get satisfactory resolutions at the level of the ombudsman.  In 40,000 cases, the banks have had to put their hands up, state they had wrongly taken money from their customers and to pay that money back and compensate them.  Many of the cases before the ombudsman relate to the level of compensation or the rates onto which the customers were put back.  On the culture of the banks, I probably speak with personal experience as one of the first people to challenge one of the banks on the tracker mortgages issue.  The reason for this was that an extended family member of mine was one of the first victims who came to the ombudsman on this issue.  They are still with the ombudsman after all of this time, even after the bank has acknowledged the wrongdoing but it has not dealt with it properly.  There are many people like that.  I understand, as Mr. Justice Hedigan has mentioned, that as a judge, one will hear the cases.  When one sees this material at first hand, however, when one sees what opportunities people missed out on, when one hears what happened and one lives through or shares part of that, one can then see the damage the banks have done.  After all of their apologies, we still have a large group of people who have taken cases the ombudsman.  We have 1,200 people who have taken cases to the ombudsman.  Before this tracker mortgage investigation started, there were only 18.  If some of these cases are resolved by the ombudsman, thousands more will go in because not everybody who is unhappy is taking a legal case.  What can the board do to satisfy itself that the culture that currently exists within the banks is the appropriate one?  Mr. Padraic Kissane, who has appeared before this committee many times, has talked about banks that have put customers back on the prevailing rate.  Indeed, I imagine he is representing some of the those who are taking cases to the ombudsman.  These are people with serious financial experience, who understand all of the detail and sit on the Irish Banking Culture Board.<\/p><p>Is there something the board can do to satisfy itself that the cases it is fighting through the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman are appropriate to the culture Mr. Justice Hedigan believes the bank should be adopting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019100100002#O00500","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569884400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>After the circular email about the time limits we met the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman who certainly gave me the impression that he felt that once he could get the time issue out of the way, he could get through a lot of cases.

I am aware that the board does not have a regulatory role as such, as does the Central Bank, but I believe that the easiest and fastest way to change the culture is for honesty and admissions around what has gone wrong and where it went wrong.  As for the behaviours we are trying to change now and the behaviours that make up that culture, we must remember that in other countries, people are serving time in jail for those exact same behaviours.  This is why the witnesses will forgive us for having some degree of cynicism around all of this.  Mr. Justice Hedigan spoke of the board trying to achieve and promote an environment in which ethical behaviour lies at the heart of banking.  This is what we all want to achieve from here.<\/p><p> I have a couple of questions to frame that.  The committee received evidence on 28 June that contained an admission by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales that its advice to British and Irish banks on accounting for non-performing loans did not comply with company law.  We approached the Irish banks about this and they advised members that they were not concerned about it and there was nothing to see.  This is astounding given that as a result of this flawed advice, Irish banks were forced to sell mortgages and home loans to vulture funds at substantial discounts.  If the banks are taking this attitude, is it reasonable to assume that the culture of the banks remains as \"let us see what we can get away with regardless of the consequences for the consumer\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019100100002#P00700","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569884400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I certainly hope not.  The issue of the sale of non-performing loans gives rise to a lot of very complicated and difficult problems.  On the one hand the European Central Bank requires the Irish banks to bring the percentage of their non-performing loans down to below 5%.  The banks are having to do a lot of sales in this way.  I am aware of the fact that the rights and privileges under a contract will move to the new purchaser, the so-called \"vulture funds\", but I am also aware of the fact that it is much harder to try to organise a restructuring of a mortgage with a vulture fund.  Such funds do not seem to be quite so able to do that as are the banks.  On the other hand, if a person just wants to settle a loan, the vulture funds are much easier to deal with.  The inability to restructure has recently come into question and I have been told that in fact the funds are in a position to do that.  This leaves me in a position where I am not sure what the situation is.<\/p> <p>  To be honest with the Senator, it is news to me about the advice the banks got from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.  I had not heard that before and do not know anything about that.  It is very interesting to hear, but I had not heard it before.  As far as the non-performing loans are concerned, it is a worry, but on the other hand I can see the problem that is there.  The so-called \"securitisation\" process, by which banks operate the sale of sections of their portfolios, has long been regarded as a way of controlling their exposure to risk.  That gives rise to problems where, after the loan has been sold, a person might want to restructure his or her loan but finds that it is much more difficult to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019100100002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justice John Hedigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1569884400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Does the board have much liaison with the vulture funds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019100100002#Q00300","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569884400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>No we do not.

We have heard evidence from one group, which gave very strong evidence before this committee and subsequently supplied affidavits that were lodged with the High Court, which successfully secured a judgment when the judge outlined the following in his ruling:<\/p><blockquote>As an aside, I would have thought that a competent mediator could bring sense to bear and mediate a solution to the dispute between the parties.  If the parties are committed to doing business with integrity and in accordance with the regulatory requirements that exist, then what possible obstacle stands in the way of both sides starting on a new page even if some re-arrangements and compromises are required of both sides?  Large banks and financial institutions, and smaller ones, wish the public to forgive the past and to move on with a positive attitude.  They should lead by example.  What the parties have enjoyed in business together ought not to be lost if it can be salvaged.  That exercise in itself might serve to help restore in the public mind the trust and confidence and faith that they should have in banks and financial institutions and which is being slowly rebuilt with effort over and above any required to solve this ongoing dispute.  That may be a high minded and naive recommendation on my part but it is something I would urge on both sides in any event.<\/blockquote> <p>That sounds like an imminently sensible judge.  Indeed, officials from the Central Bank also told the committee that after examining the evidence in this group provided, that &quot;clearly there were cultural issues there and there was pressure on selling&quot;.  So we have culture, integrity and a judge giving sensible advice on this matter.  The ruling dates back to February, which is almost eight months ago, and since then no attempt has been made by the bank to mediate.

Someone asked how much each bank contributed.  I think the answer given was that each bank made a contribution, according to its size.  It would be worthwhile letting people know the actual amount each bank gives.  The banks also give to the Irish Banking Federation, IBF.  When we asked each of the CEOs of the banks to tell us how much they gave to the federation, every one of them, except the CEO of KBC, stated in writing that they gave to many such organisations but that they would not tell us the amount.

I want to put my experience on record.  As bad as the banks are, and I believe they are very bad, the vulture funds are even worse.  One cannot get through to them by phone.  One cannot speak to a human being at any stage during the course of this.  It is almost impossible for the ordinary citizen of this State who wants to resolve his or her affairs to deal with a vulture fund.  They are untouchable.  I can give Mr. Justice Hedigan several examples of attempts that I made on behalf of people - not my constituents but generally throughout the country - to try to help them to resolve issues.  The banks in some cases do not even tell the client that their loan is sold.  The major problem we have is that the banks are outsourcing their dirty work and are allowing the vulture funds to appoint receivers and go to the courts for eviction orders.  They are using the courts and the courts are not helpful to individuals who appear before them.<\/p> <p>  Recently, I was in the High Court with a family, and I have been there a number of times as well as to the Appeals Court, and it was shocking.  I thought that it would be conducted in a far different way.  For a friend or supporter of people who attend the court, even though it is moral support, to be denied any right of audience or any comment in an extremely difficult situation is something that judges should review.  I am not saying this because Mr. Justice Hedigan is a retired judge and is here before us.  It is a view that I have having examined and been present in the courts.  It is not a recommendation I would make to any individual to go to court.  I found it so disturbing for families how justice is administered, and I would have great concerns.<\/p> <p>  I would love to find a vehicle that was independent like the IBCB that would look at all the stakeholders.  The IBCB has a firm on board with it from the commercial-legal end of things.  The judges should be asked as well.  Again, this is not just because this is Mr. Justice Hedigan's background, but I have seen cases where the paperwork from the banks has been appalling, and yet they will not admit it.  They allow a lie to be compounded by another lie or misleading fact or whatever it is, and the citizen, who is relying, perhaps, on a McKenzie friend, has no advantage or support whatsoever.  The banks use this for referring their cases to the courts and then they are almost forgotten about.  The legal process, the solicitors and the barristers take their own course and the banks are sometimes not even familiar with it.  They do not even know the hardship that they are dishing out to their own customers, customers who perhaps tried to settle their accounts or reach some settlement with the banks.  Once it goes to court, they do not have the money.  They are a beaten docket when they go to court and they are often beaten down by the banks that bully and harass them, and it is still going on.<\/p> <p>  I admire the work that Mr. Justice Hedigan is undertaking but he is in quite a pit of company that he would not normally work with, I would say.<\/p><p>That is why I go back to the issue of transparency and the cost of the operation.  The judge said that when he was involved in Amnesty International, his motto was \"as unthinkable as slavery\".  What is happening to Irish citizens is as unthinkable as slavery.  The judge may think that is harsh, but I deal with it at the coalface every day and the culture that has been established and passed on to the next generation of bankers is shocking.<\/p><p> The vulture funds have hired young people who are learning the business.  I sat in at a meeting with a vulture fund to make an appeal for a family and the young woman said, \"You owe us X and we want it.\"  The man was trying to explain his situation and settle, but she did not care from where he got the money, whether he had to ask his neighbour, friend, mother or father or the credit union.  She just said, \"We want money, money, money.\"  I will never forget it.  I thought not only was the culture out of control but that it was being passed on to a new generation of bankers.<\/p><p> When the bankers come here, they say with a great presentation of sincerity, \"My God, we don't do business like that.\"  They do.  They are shocking and hate being called out, but they have not changed.  I am not lecturing the judge about this, but it upsets me greatly when I see what they are still doing and I cannot get over the fact that they are still getting away with it.  I understand how people are sceptical about the work the delegates are doing because of how the banks have infiltrated every place.  I would like to hear the judge's view on some of my thoughts.<\/p><p> I have learned so much at this committee and it has been a steep learning curve.  One of the things that shocked me at the beginning of the tracker mortgage crisis was that the Governor of the Central Bank told us that there were 3,800 affected.  It turned out that there were more than 30,000.  Some families have been treated so appallingly that they are broken.  Some have special needs children and made special cases to us.  They have had to pour out their hearts.  They are the very people in the banks with whom the judge now finds himself dealing.  I will not be going for a pint with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019100100002#V00900","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569884400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>The Chairman is articulating very well the anguish and distress caused to people by the conduct of banks during the years and that is occurring in respect of vulture funds.  I hear what he is saying.  I understand entirely that the Deputies are at the coalface and meeting their constituents to discuss their problems.  As a judge, I did not have quite the same level of exposure, but, like some of my colleagues, I had people in tears in my court.  When I could not do anything for them, I called them up to the bench to let them to tell me their whole story in order that they could see a human being had actually listened to them.  That was the best I could do in some circumstances.<\/p> <p>  All I can say in response to the matters raised so well by the Chairman, with such obvious personal pain, is that we will do the best we can to try to improve the culture in the banking sector.

What strikes me is the amount of information that banks send out to their clients in answer maybe to a freedom of information request.  It is never all of the paperwork.  Without going into any detail the Bank of Ireland recently gave out so much paperwork on a second occasion that the case the client had against the bank was proven.  The bank had been sitting on it all the time.  It then said to its customer that it would not write to him anymore and he was left to battle as a lay litigant.

As the committee will be aware, the Data Protection Act was enacted on 25 May 2018.  On foot of that Act, it is necessary to make updated regulations under section 60 to provide for certain restrictions on obligations of controllers and rights of data subjects for important objectives of general public interest in respect of the work of the Central Bank of Ireland.  Similar restrictions that the Central Bank relies on are in place under the Data Protection Act 1988 (Section 5(1)(d)) (Specifications) Regulations 1993 and, on foot of the resolution sought, they will be replaced by the draft regulations before the committee.<\/p> <p>  The proposed regulations restrict, in limited circumstances, the rights and obligations provided for in specific provisions of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  These restrictions apply only where necessary and proportionate to the need to safeguard specified important objectives of general public interest pursued by the Central Bank of Ireland \"relevant objectives\" set out in the regulations.   <\/p> <p>  These relevant objectives include, for example, regulating financial service providers and markets, protecting the best interests of consumers of financial services, supervising or enforcing compliance with financial services legislation, carrying out monetary policy functions, and contributing to the stability of the financial system.<\/p><p>The regulations provide the bank with the necessary powers to protect the public against harm arising from dishonesty, malpractice, breaches of ethics or other improper conduct by, or the unfitness or incompetence of, persons currently or previously authorised to work in the financial services industry.  <br\/><br\/>To give a very real life example, these regulations are vital to allow the Central Bank of Ireland to investigate whether individuals in regulated financial services providers have committed wrongdoing to customers, and to record where they have found breaches by individuals so they can be prevented from taking on similar roles in the future.  In accordance with the provisions of the 2018 Act, the Department consulted extensively with the Data Protection Commission and the Minister for Justice and Equality throughout the drafting process in order to assess the necessity and proportionality of the measure, and to ensure compliance of the proposed measure with EU law on data protection.  This consultation involved a cross-functional liaison group led by officials from the Department of Finance and consisting of officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Data Protection Commission, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, and the Central Bank of Ireland. <br\/><br\/>Following that consultative process the Data Protection Commissioner wrote to the Minister for Finance to confirm that pursuant to Section 60 (11) of the 2018 Act, the commission has identified no matter which is of significant concern in relation to the proposed regulations.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has also acknowledged his agreement with the proposed regulations.  Section 6(5)(<i>a<\/i>) of the Act provides regulations may be made only if a draft of proposed regulations is laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  I thank the Chairman for the time of the committee here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019100100002#CC00300","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569884400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>A copy of this draft was laid before the D&aacute;il on 20 September 2019 and was referred to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, in accordance with Standing Order 84A(4)(<i>k<\/i>) which not later than 8 October 2019 shall send a message to the D&aacute;il in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 90 and Standing Order 89(2) shall apply accordingly.

The example we gave was that these restrictions could apply where the exercise of the right may interfere with the prevention, detection or investigation of breaches of the enforcement of compliance with financial services legislation.  These regulations are vital to allow the Central Bank to investigate whether individuals in regulated financial service providers have committed wrongdoing to customers.  The restrictions could also apply where, for example, the exercise of the right would disclose that the Central Bank of Ireland is carrying out certain tasks and that such disclosure may prejudice the achievement of a relevant objective.<\/p> <p>  To put this into context for the Senator, if the Central Bank is investigating an individual, and the individual may know of this, that individual could require under the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, to have all data relating to that person deleted.
