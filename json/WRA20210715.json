The Project Board overseeing the project is actively engaged having had eight meetings to date. They intend to produce interim reports to update all interested stakeholders on the progress on implementation of the project, the first of which will be published in the next fortnight. <\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned, there are four WGs examining the suite of recommendations made in the MacKinnon report. Among their key recommendations to the Project Board to date are:   <\/p>  <p>  - examining the backlog and producing specific recommendations for improving output, including a definition of the backlog, which have been presented to the Project Board for consideration.  <\/p>  <p>  - licensing process improvement. A business analyst has commenced work on an end-to-end process review.  In addition, proposals for a pre-application process and a planning grant  have been submitted to the Project Board for their consideration.  <\/p>  <p>  - a regulatory review of the licensing system be carried out. I have agreed with this proposal and have asked the Project Board on how best we will do this. It will be undertaken by independent expert. The review will include an examination of  experiences in other Member States in licensing forestry activities and how they comply with EU legislation and from this what lessons we can bring to our licensing systems. <\/p>  <p>  - putting forward proposals for a review of the organisational structure of forestry within my Department, and reviewing the roles Coillte, Coford and Teagasc in terms of supporting the Department on delivering forestry outcomes.  <\/p>  <p>  - developing a template for a new Customer Charter for forestry, which will be finalised in tandem with the work on the licensing process.  <\/p>  <p>  - Training of all actors within the sector and ways in which to  positively communicate with customers and all stakeholders  will be looked at  in detail by two sub-working groups.  <\/p>  <p>  - developing a shared vision for forestry in Ireland and aims to deliver a new Forest Strategy in middle of 2022. On this, a preliminary analysis has been completed which includes a detailed SWOT analysis, stakeholder mapping  development of proposed scenarios. This work and other work to take place will inform the next steps which will include a wider public and stakeholder engagement process and I expect this to take place later this year.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to recognise the momentum and progress made under Project Woodland and I applaud the commitment shown by all involved, in particular the representatives from the Forestry Policy Group who make up the membership of the Working Groups.  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett who has overall responsibility for the sector, I am committed to the success of this Project  and by  working together I believe we can deliver on its ambitions for the benefit of the forestry sector and society at large.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel with Project Woodland, the Department continues to pursue continual improvement on all its work on forestry particularly licensing. I am pleased to say that is yielding dividends and that licensing is 30% ahead of the same point last year. There is still considerably more work to do but we are fully committed to maintaining this momentum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500048#WRA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":20,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 14 to 16, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Horse Racing Industry","counter":21,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500048#WRA02000"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[38523\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500048#WRA02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he is satisfied that the current structure of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board is sufficiently independent to ensure maximum confidence that any allegations concerning doping, animal welfare abuses or other illegitimate activities are adequately investigated.","asker":"1495","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":23,"content":"<p>Since 1st January 2018, the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board (IHRB) is the regulatory body for all horseracing in Ireland.

Minister Noonan and his officials are currently examining the report.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these developments, the Department is actively looking at alternatives to peat and has funded two research projects to date. It has also recently sought further research be conducted here to explore alternatives to peat based growing media for horticultural production in this area in its latest Research Call for 2021. These must be available, affordable and sustainable and meet quality as well as environmental requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The Department also provides a support to the horticulture industry through the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Horticulture Sector. Financial support is available to assist growers and businesses through grant aid for capital investments in specialised plant and equipment including renewable energy, as well as technology adoption specific to commercial horticulture production. A 50% budget increase to &euro;9 million has been secured for 2021 reflecting the importance of the sector.  This Scheme is 100% funded by the Irish Government.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Department administers the EU Producer Organisation Scheme for Fruit and Vegetables which allows growers jointly market their production in order to strengthen the position of producers in the marketplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500049#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Industry","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500049#WRB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[38151\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500049#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on introducing legislation to prohibit the granting of aquaculture licences within or adjacent to special areas of conservation and marine protected areas.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>The Department considers all applications for aquaculture licences in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act, the 1933 Foreshore Act and applicable National and EU legislation.

I fully understand the seriousness of the situation with many landowners in terms of the delays encountered and the various supply issues with the sector and Minister of State Hackett and I are engaging intensively with all parties to try to resolve the issues. <\/p>  <p>  Many measures have been put in train to progress felling licences within the Department. Approximately 75% of homegrown roundwood that is processed by the sawmills in Ireland comes from Coillte forests and approximately 25% from private forests and it is therefore important that both Coillte and the private sector have sufficient licences to harvest and supply the sawmills.  I can report that Coillte is fully licensed for this year.  <\/p>  <p>   In relation to the private sector supply we have increased substantially the number of felling licences in recent months due to several system improvements and continued investment in ecology resources.  This resulted in June being the highest month for private felling licences in over 5 years.<\/p>  <p>  To date this year (9th July), 1,836 forestry licences have issued &ndash; 1,164 tree felling; 308 afforestation and 364 forest road works licences.  This represents 40% of the target of 4,500 licences to issue in 2021.  The afforestation licences cover 2,695ha of potential new forestry.  This is an increase of 21% on the area licensed to the same date in 2020 and a 5% increase in the number of afforestation licences issued.  <\/p>  <p>  Forest road works licence covering 151km of forest roads have issued to date.  This far exceeds the Climate Action Plan target for 2021 of 125km of forest roads licensed.     <\/p>  <p>  The volume of tree felling licences issued has also increased substantially and is 77% ahead of the same point last year. A total volume of 3.594 million cubic metres has been licensed which is a very encouraging figure.   <\/p>  <p>  As part of Project Woodland we are examining all options.  This includes an end to end review of our systems and processes to be carried out by an external systems analyst that has already started work on this review.

It provides renewable timber products  for both the export and domestic market, it is an important source of employment in rural Ireland, it contributes to our climate change and biodiversity objectives and affords people  throughout  the country a much appreciated outside space to enjoy.  Productive forestry or commercial forestry is of course an important economic driver and is generally in Ireland considered to mean conifers particularly Sitka spruce.  While broadleaves are important for biodiversity, conifers make up the bulk of timber that is processed through sawmills. <\/p>  <p>  Harvested wood products are a key part of our climate policies in Ireland as they can serve to replace fossil fuel based products particularly in construction for example.

This was possible for several reasons, the most important of which is that the Department supports the Agri-Food sector which, itself, is an essential service and had to continue as part of the country&rsquo;s food supply chain. <\/p>  <p>  Business continuity has been always been important to the Department and all its Divisions are required to have an up to date Business Continuity Plan. The Department&rsquo;s staff are aware of the critical role they play in the sector and, in the context of the public health restrictions, showed great flexibility in adapting to new working environments. Approximately half of our staff were required to work from their usual locations, such as laboratories, ports, harbours, farms and meat plants as well as some offices which provided access to specialised resources. Appropriate public health measures were put in place for these staff. <\/p>  <p>  As a countrywide organisation, the Department already operated an extensive remote IT infrastructure and this was extended and enhanced to accommodate the move to remote working for the staff who could carry out their duties away from the office. The Department will be reviewing its experience in responding to the pandemic and will use this information to adapt and improve its business continuity planning.<\/p>  <p>  While the work of the sector and the Department was largely able to continue, albeit sometimes in a restricted manner, without the huge impacts felt in other areas, we are aware that no one was unaffected. We acknowledge that our customers and staff are also people who experienced stress and loss and were affected by the health restrictions that were necessary throughout the pandemic.  We must recognise also that staff in meat plants continued to work through significant COVID-19 outbreaks and participated in serial testing and Rapid Antigen Testing programmes, due to the very particular circumstances in which Covid-19 affected these environments and that they demonstrated great resilience and dedication in doing so.<\/p>  <p>  Thus, there are no substantial COVID-19-related backlogs in DAFM&rsquo;s work, however there were a few very limited exceptions.  These exceptions included the Food Dudes programme which had to be scaled back to include DEIS schools only, but which was adapted to provide packs of fruit and vegetables to DEIS school children in their homes while schools were closed.  Food Dudes and Moo Crew returned to the classrooms after Easter 2021, with the resumption of the opening of schools. Food industry usage of the Prepared Consumer Food Centre, established and funded by my Department, was hampered due to Covid-19 restrictions in 2020.  However, the PCF Centre did provide virtual advice sessions for the sector.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is possible that the public health restrictions have resulted in indirect delays. For instance, restrictions in the construction industry may have affected farmers&rsquo; structural improvement plans and consequently, delayed their application under the TAMS schemes. As a supportive measure, initially our on-farm inspections were deferred for a brief period. They quickly resumed in line with public health Guidelines, as the Department implemented a suite of new protocols to protect both Farmers and Departmental staff.<\/p>  <p>  The Department was fortunate, as almost all schemes had developed online application systems.  However, with Public Offices closed, we were unable to run our Nationwide clinics during the BPS application period, so we developed a new system of telephone\/email supports to provide assistance to farmers that had utilised the clinics in previous years. These new measures ensured that applicants were able to lodge their applications on time.<\/p>  <p>  The Department also availed of processing and administrative flexibilities provided by the EU due to COVID-19. This allowed the Department to make all Scheme payments on time and in line with previous years.  From September to December 2020, the Department issued in excess of &euro;1.7 billion to farmers which mirrors the performance of previous years.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Department provided additional supports to the sector through a number of financial schemes, co-delivered with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and some sector-specific schemes including the Aid for Private Storage (APS) measure and the &euro;50 million exchequer funded Beef Finisher payment provided in 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department continues to monitor all areas and sectors under its remit to identify and address any difficulties that may have arisen due to the pandemic.

I have already committed to commencing an end to end review of our systems and processes to be carried out by an external systems analyst that has already started work on this review.  In addition there will be a review of our legal and regulatory processes.  This review, to be carried out by an independent expert, will include an examination of  experiences in other Member States in licensing forestry activities and how they comply with EU legislation without experiencing the same issues that we have experienced in Ireland.

Improvements have been made to the system to optimise the time of the ecologists to concentrate on the ecology aspects of each application.  <\/p>  <p>  Currently, these improvements are only applied to private tree felling licence (TFL) applications, which has already yielded results with increased licences issued.  The ecologists have been working mostly on these felling applications in advance of the system being developed further for other licensed activities.

At the same time, we must remember that commercial landlords have their own financial obligations that still need to be paid. Where a landlord has debt in place, their flexibility will likely be driven by what their bank\/lender will accept. One person&rsquo;s rent might be another person&rsquo;s income or pension.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has urged commercial landlords and tenants to talk to one another and come to some arrangement, as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed. Landlords should be willing to do what they can to help their tenants to continue to operate rather than facing the risk of a vacant premises and inability to obtain new tenants. Equally, tenants should pay what they can and speak with their landlord when difficulties arise.<\/p>  <p>  Last October, I published the Code of Conduct between landlords and tenants for commercial rents. The aim of this Code is to facilitate discussions between landlords and tenants impacted by COVID-19. It sets out a structured approach for engagement between both commercial landlords and tenants, based on their mutual interest in continuing to work together.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Code should not be seen in isolation. The Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses through the crisis including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), the forthcoming Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates.

Typically, the new rent is based on the evidence of new lettings of comparable properties at the time the review falls due.

As a consequence of the US measures, there was an increased risk of steel originally destined for the US market being diverted to the EU market and thereby distorting or severely disturbing the EU steel market. To address this risk, the EU introduced Steel Safeguards Measures in 2018 and these Measures have been continued by decision of the EU last month. The market situation has also been impacted by Brexit with the UK now a 3rd Country since 1 January this year and therefore also subject to the EU's Safeguards Measures. Accordingly, imports from the UK have a Tariff Rate Quota applying under the Safeguards Measures also. <\/p>  <p>  The Measures currently in place allow for the importation of steel from 3rd Countries by way of quotas, determined in line with traditional volumes of trade in steel. The recent decision to continue the Measures for a minimum period of 2 years was based on a Commission-led review of the need for such Measures, undertaken at the request of several Member States, and which was conducted in the first half of 2021. The current Measures will be subject to a full review before 30 June 2023, to determine whether the Measures should be terminated in response to market conditions of trade in steel at that point in time.  <\/p>  <p>  Since applying the original Safeguard Measures in 2018, the European Commission has completed 3 reviews of the Measures, with the most recent review published in June 2021. The findings of that most recent review included details on the availability of quotas across the product categories impacted by the Measures.  The Commission's review found that during the first three years of application of the Measures (July 2018 &ndash; May 2021), there have been consistent and increasing free-of-duty TRQ volumes available at the end of each period in nearly all product categories. For example, in year-3 of the measures up to 20 May 2021, 36% of the available TRQs in steel remained unused, some 11 million tonnes. Thus, the data available indicated that the application of the EU's Safeguard Measures does not affect the availability of supply, as quotas, under which imports do not attract the Safeguard Measures' tariff, are not exhausted before the end of a given period.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Commission has also noted that some 3rd countries continue to demonstrate  what it has described as \"opportunistic behaviour\" and \"aggressive export tactics\" under which they seek to maximise their market presence under the safeguard measures.  This means that, in some extreme circumstances, a 3rd country maximises or exhausts their specific quarterly quota on day-one of the TRQ becoming available (e.g. on I July).  This is despite the current Measures being designed to allow for traditional trade flows of steel, and, moreover, being designed to prevent, insofar as is possible, overcrowding the market and pushing out other 3rd country producers that are operating within the parameters of the Measures.  At the same time, the Measures are designed to allow EU producers continue to compete in a fair and sustainable manner.<\/p>  <p>Specifically, in relation to the additional detail provided regarding imports of Category 21 Hollow Sections from Turkey, the Commission Implementing Regulation, brought into effect on 1 July 2021, allocated a country-specific TRQ for Turkey of some 70,000 tonnes of hollow steel for the quarter 1 July 2021 &ndash; 30 September 2021. The online TRQ calculator confirms that the full quota was exhausted on 1 July 2021, which supports the Commission position that some 3rd   country exporters are applying damaging and aggressive trade tactics in relation to the utilisation of the available TRQ and is relevant to the case of interest to your enquiry.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Turkey was assigned the largest TRQ when compared to the other major exporters of Category 21 Hollow Sections. Comparatively, the next ranked 3rd country, the United Kingdom was assigned a TRQ of 42,000 tonnes for the same period and as of 12 July 2021, there remains a balance of 10,000 tonnes that can be imported from the United Kingdom within the available TRQ. Similarly, North Macedonia was assigned nearly 23,000 tonnes for the same period and there remains some 19,000 tonnes of the TRQ available. My Department&rsquo;s analysis suggests that of the 7 countries assigned a specific quarterly TRQ, only Turkey and Russia have exhausted their quarterly TRQ already and there remains TRQs available in the other 5 countries with a country specific TRQ and some 64,000 tonnes available within the global quota.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the general level of availability of TRQs across the system, it is recognised that importers can face significant administrative burdens when trying to source material from 3rd countries where there is a limited commercial relationship between the producer and the importer. In that regard, officials in my Department have routinely raised this concern with Commission officials and will continue to do so on foot of the information that has been included as part of this Parliamentary Question. It is in the interest of our steel importers that they develop strong commercial relationships with a range of 3rd country producers to ensure that they can source their requirements from a diverse range of 3rd country providers.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, it is important to note that the current Measures in place include a 3% year-on-year liberalisation rate which means that the available TRQs increase each year by 3% from the benchmark period of 2015-2017. Therefore, TRQs for the periods 2021\/22 and 2022\/23 will reach the import highs recorded in 2018 when the Measures were first introduced, meaning that imports of steel into the EU will have to exceed the import levels of 2018 before the 25% safeguard tariff would apply. In designing the Measures, the European Commission has sought to ensure full compliance with the safeguard rules provided for under the World Trade Organisation and the Commission has reassured Member States that it continues to monitor the situation for both producers, users and importers to limit any negative impact of the application of the Measures.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, officials in my Department continue to engage with Irish industry and representative groups on the matter and liaise closely with EU officials regarding the operation of the safeguard measures to ensure that they continue to meet their objective in guarding EU steel producers from the harmful impact of trade diversion of steel while at the same time ensuring that the EU market stays open to fair and sustainable competition where EU importers can secure supply at competitive prices.  <\/p>  <p>  As always, steel sourced within the EU is not subject to any such tariffs as part of the Single Market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500056#WRK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":350,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500056#WRK02000"},{"type":"question","counter":351,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[38850\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500056#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the number of staff by location and function in each office of his Department nationally; if the property is State owned or leased; and the detail of these leases in the case of those properties on a lease in terms of cost, term and next break date.","asker":"1597","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":352,"content":"<p>The table below lists the number of staff in each office\/building of my Department by function and location, nationally.

Surveys are complete or underway in County Westmeath in Mullingar, Sonna, Stonehall, Taghmon, Jamestown, Hopestown, and Athlone. Pre-works have commenced in the areas around Mullingar. NBI has advised that surveying is underway in the area where the premises referred to is located and they anticipate that high speed broadband should be available for connection in the first half of 2022. <\/p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Westmeath through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.<\/p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays to aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors, restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays (both nationally and internationally).  Covid 19 has affected the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale up including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staffs are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact posing further challenges. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract to address the impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic on the project. <\/p>  <p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 8 July, 335 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are connected at Whitehall Community Centre, Streete Parish Park &amp;amp; Community Hall, Milltown Emper Community Centre, Ballycomoyle GAA Club, and Clonkill Hurling Club. Further details can be found at nbi.ie\/bcp-locations\/  . <\/p>  <p>Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhride and Naomh Micheal have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.

I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that, as of 8 July, over 233,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed including 8,281 premises in Co Mayo. Surveys are completed or ongoing in the areas of Aghagower, Ballyhean, Breaghwy, Burren, Castlebar, Clogher, Cloonkeen, Croaghmoyle, Islandeady, Killavally, Manulla, Pontoon, Strade, Tawnynagry, Turlough, Drumsheen, Bunnyconnellan, Ballina Town, Carrowntreila, Ardagh, Campbells Crossroads, Rosserk, Shanvoley, Derryhick, Kilhale, Tawnylaheen, Turlough, Ballyvary, Keeloges, Castlebar Town, Rinnaseer, Bellaburke, Killawullaun Mountain, Carn, Carnacon, Ballyglass, Belcarra, Balla and Ringarraun, Newport, Carrowbeg, Inishgort, Inishcottle, Myna, Fahy, Ashbridge, Glenisland, Srahmore, Glenhest, Comploon, Slogger and Tawnameeltoge. <\/p>  <p>  Build works are currently underway in the Deployment Area that covers Castlebar and surrounding townlands including Turlough, Ballyhean, Clooneen, Kilhale, Tawnylaheen and Burren. I am advised by NBI that it expects some 2,100 premises in these areas to be passed and available for connection by early 2022. <\/p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays on delivery of aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors with restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays (both nationally and internationally), as well as the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale up, including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staff are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact posing further challenges. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract to address the impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic on the project. <\/p>  <p>Further details are available on specific areas within Mayo through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. <\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 8 July, 335 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible locations and the Department of Education for schools. BCPs installed with high speed publicly accessible broadband include Bofeenaun Community Centre, Killaser Community Centre, Keel Community Centre, Taugheen Community Centre, Kilmovee Community Centre, Finny Community Centre, Islandeady Community Centre, Cushlough Community Centre, Clare Island Community Centre, The Black Tom Freeman Sport And Community Amenities Centre and Belderrig Community &amp;amp; Research Centre.<\/p>  <p>  Midfield National School, Rathnamagh National School, Dooagh National School, Valley National School, Dookinella National School, Scoil N&eacute;ifinn, Tavraun Central National School, Errew National School, Facefield National School, Gortskehy National School, Kinaffe National School, Meelick More National School, Saint Coleman's National School, Cloghans National School, Shraigh National School and Rathbane National School are also installed as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.

The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises.  This means that in the case of a travel agent that operates from a business premises, they may qualify for support under the scheme provided they meet all the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises under the public health regulations.<\/p>  <p>  As non-essential retail, including travel agent businesses, were permitted to open from 17 May 2021, they are no longer subject to Covid restrictions which would require them to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises.

However, subject to meeting the relevant criteria, a business such as a travel agent business, reopening after a period of restrictions, may claim a &ldquo;restart week payment&rdquo; under the CRSS scheme to assist it with the costs of reopening. <\/p>  <p>  For businesses reopening between 29 April 2021 and 1 June 2021, an &ldquo;enhanced restart week payment&rdquo; may be claimed, which is computed at double the normal weekly CRSS rate, for two weeks, subject to a maximum weekly amount payable of &euro;5,000.<\/p>  <p>  On 1 June, I announced that an additional business support scheme, the Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), would be available for businesses whose turnover in the period from 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021 is reduced by 75% compared with their 2019 turnover.  To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D.

Outstanding tax liabilities are automatically identified by the presence of an appeal stop marker that is input to suspend the collection of the disputed tax, if not already paid, pending the determination of the appeal.

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D. The legislative basis for the scheme is set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, are published on the Revenue website. <\/p>  <p>  A qualifying business must operate from a business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan. For the purposes of the scheme, a business premises is defined as a building or other similar fixed physical structure from which a business activity is ordinarily carried on. Trading activities that are ordinarily carried on outside of a business premises are not eligible for the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the business in question was originally approved for the CRSS but on review was found to be ineligible because it does not conduct its operations from a business premises. Revenue accepts that repayment of the amount owed as a single payment could cause financial difficulty for the business and due to the exceptional circumstances involved will add the amount owed to its warehoused debt even though the Debt Warehousing Scheme does not specifically provide for CRSS related liabilities. <\/p>  <p>If the business disagrees with Revenue&rsquo;s determination that it is not eligible for the scheme, it has the right to appeal the decision to the independent Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) within 30 days of receipt of the determination notice. Information and guidance on how to make an appeal to the TAC is available at www.taxappeals.ie.  <\/p>  <p>  You may also be aware of the Business Resumption Support Scheme which may be of interest to your constituent. The BRSS will be implemented in September 2021. This scheme is being introduced for vulnerable but viable businesses, particularly in sectors that were significantly impacted throughout the pandemic, even during periods when restrictions were eased. Businesses whose turnover is reduced by 75% in the reference period, 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021, compared with 2019 will be eligible.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme will not be restricted by location, rate-paying or physical premises. Businesses which previously availed of other schemes such as the small business assistance scheme for Covid and the tourism business continuity scheme, for example, as well as the Covid restrictions support scheme, will be eligible to apply for a once-off payment based on a percentage of their average weekly turnover for 2019, subject to a maximum payment of &euro;15,000, provided they meet the qualifying criteria.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue has confirmed that the business is continuing to avail of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Debt Warehousing Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500057#WRL05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":443,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500057#WRL05300"},{"type":"question","counter":444,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[39061\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500057#WRL05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will give consideration to the introduction of new arrangements for the collection of the vacant site levy whereby the Revenue Commissioners would take over responsibility for collection based on a self-certification system in order to bring these sites into use for housing development and in view of the inability of local authorities to collect these levies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":445,"content":"<p>In the context of my reply to the Deputy's priority question regarding the Vacant Site Levy of 15 June 2021 (question number 32046\/21) I indicated that I am giving consideration to the future of the Vacant Site Levy, its role and whether there is a case for it to be strengthened. On that occasion the Deputy mentioned a suggestion from a legal practitioner as to how to enhance the operation and effectiveness of the levy.

My understanding is that the suggestion is to introduce an element of self-assessment under which the onus would lie on a landowner to register their site with the local authority and pay the Vacant Site Levy.

The role of the Commissioner will be to oversee a systems and risk-based regulatory framework for online safety that will focus on measures that regulated online services can take to progressively minimise the availability of harmful online content on their services. This will apply to both the delivery (e.g. recommendation engines) and moderation of content.<\/p>  <p>  The defined categories of harmful online content are set out in the General Scheme of the Bill and include criminal material, serious cyberbullying material and material promoting self-harm, suicide and eating disorders. Provision is also made for the addition of further categories following a rigorous assessment, recommendation by the Media Commission and Oireachtas approval. <\/p>  <p>  The regulatory framework will be operationalised through binding Online Safety Codes made by the Online Safety Commissioner that will set out expectations and rules for how regulated online services, including social media services, deal with user-generated content on their platforms that falls within one of the above categories. <\/p>  <p>  The powers of the Online Safety Commissioner will include a range of standard setting and information gathering powers, including the following powers; to set standards for how regulated online services handle complaints; to audit those complaints handling mechanisms; to set up a scheme to receive information from nominated bodies about systemic issues, and to issue guidance materials and advisory notices.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner will also have a range of compliance and enforcement powers;  to appoint authorised officers to investigate cases of suspected non-compliance; to seek the imposition of a financial sanction of up to &euro;20 million or 10% of the turnover of an online platform found to be non-compliant; to require the removal or limitation of availability of individual items of content in discrete instances, and to seek an injunction to block access to a non-compliant online service in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill takes a systemic approach to regulation.   The Online Safety Commissioner will not operate a mechanism which rules on complaints about individual pieces of content.  There are serious concerns about the ability of any such statutory mechanism to operate effectively.   For example, many of the larger online services will be regulated under this Bill on an EU wide basis, i.e. for 450 million people, raising numerous issues around scale, effective operation, the application to apply fair procedures, cultural and linguistic challenges in resolving complaints and the speed of response.   However, members of the public may raise concerns with the Online Safety Commissioner and this will feed into their assessment of risk in relation to a particular service or type of content.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, where the content may be criminal in nature, the appropriate point of contact would be An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   In these circumstances, it is considered that a systemic and risk based approach, with powers for the regulator to set standards, oversee and audit complaints mechanisms and take account of information from nominated bodies about systemic issues, will prove more effective. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to anonymity or psuedoanonymity online, any consideration of restrictions on such practices has broad implications, including freedom of expression, the right to communicate and data protection, and would require an evidence-based and whole of Government approach.  The implications of such measures therefore extend far beyond the scope of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.  <\/p>  <p>  Detailed legal drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Attorney General is progressing well and the General Scheme of the Bill is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Oireachtas Committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500058#WRM01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Regulations","counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500058#WRM01800"},{"type":"question","counter":473,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[38875\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500058#WRM01900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will consider bringing in regulations that would make digitally altered photographs illegal for advertising purposes unless the photographs were clearly labelled as edited.","asker":"1566","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":474,"content":"<p>I have no function in relation to the regulation of photography, digital editing of photographic material or advertising in general.

For example, the 2015 scheme was intended to be financed by the interest payable on deposits lodged; this is no longer viable, given the current financial market conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is noteworthy that disputes relating to deposits are no longer the most common dispute type referred to the RTB. <\/p>  <p>  Financing the operation of the scheme is an important consideration, particularly in terms of ensuring that the likely outcomes of a new scheme are achieved efficiently and effectively and that the best value from public funds is secured. Careful consideration is therefore required to introduce any necessary reforms and enhancements to the 2015 scheme, with a view to considering whether and how to introduce a re-designed scheme that is fit for purpose and suitable for current and future rental and financial markets. <\/p>  <p>  Any review of the scope and provisions of a Deposit Protection scheme will need to take account of changes in the residential sectors since the 2015 Deposit Protection Scheme legal provisions were enacted, to inform any necessary legislative change. Consideration will need to be given as to whether or not it is feasible to proceed to revise and implement a deposit protection scheme at this time, or to defer to a later point in time, when the RTB's Change Management Plan has been fully implemented and more robust data and information is available for consideration.<\/p>  <p>  The RTB has cut case times for deposit-related disputes as the introduction of new processes has borne fruit and the question of proportionality is key and it is imperative to question whether the scale of spending and intervention required is commensurate with the scale of the issue.

A restriction of the equivalent of 1 month&rsquo;s rent is also placed on the amount that a tenant is obliged to pay as a regular advance rent payment to a landlord during a tenancy. Provision is made for a student residing in student specific accommodation to choose to pay a greater amount of advance rent, if he\/she so wishes.<\/p>  <p>  These measures are intended to greatly reduce any financial exposure to tenants, including students who do not opt out of the new protections, on foot of paying such restricted upfront payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500058#WRM05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":505,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500058#WRM05100"},{"type":"question","counter":506,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[38756\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500058#WRM05200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of Departmental reports that are pending publication; the titles of these reports; the dates he anticipates the publication of each; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":507,"content":"<p>A number of Departmental reports are pending publication, i.e. expected to be published in Quarter 3 2021, the details of which are set out in the following table: <table>    <tr>       <th>Title of Departmental Report<\/th>       <th>Completion   Due<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Housing for All &ndash; A New Housing Plan for Ireland<\/td>       <td>July 2021<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Impacts of 2018 Fires on the Biodiversity of Killarney National Park<\/td>       <td>July 2021<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Report on the outcomes of the consultation on Significant Water Management Issues in Ireland<\/td>       <td>August 2021<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage Annual Report 2020<\/td>       <td>September 2021<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Construction Status Report Quarter 2 2021 <\/td>       <td>September 2021<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>In addition to the above, my Department and the HSE are co-authors of a Report on the National Traveller COVID-19 Accommodation Preparedness Checklist.

Chapter 5 of the Guidelines address the relatively new and emerging 'build-to-rent' sector and set out a number of key distinct characteristics.  Build-to-rent projects are usually a single entity investment for long term rental undertaking, comprising individual residential units within the development that are not sold off separately for private ownership and\/or subsequent sub-letting individually, which is a key difference from the traditional housing development model. The guidelines provide for planning permission for specific build-to-rent developments to be sought from a planning authority. Build-to-rent developments have specific planning requirements for the provision of dedicated amenities and facilities specifically for residents in terms of communal recreational space, work spaces and cooking\/dining facilities as well as a range of other support services such as laundry facilities, concierge, management, repair and maintenance. <\/p>  <p>  Build-to-Rent development forms a relatively small proportion of all planning applications lodged.  As of February 2021, 48,397 residential units in total had been approved under the Strategic Housing Development process, comprising 12,991 Houses, 27,624 Apartments and 7,782 Build-to-Rent units.  Build-to-Rent continues to make up around 16% of the total residential units approved under the SHD process.  The amount of approved Build-to-Rent developments therefore is small.  Following a review of co-living, updated guidelines were published in 2020 and I have no plans to further amend the guidelines at this time. <\/p>  <p>  'Urban Development and Building Height' Guidelines for Planning Authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la which were also published by my Department in 2018, pursuant to Section 28 of the Act, support the achievement of compact growth, in line with the National Planning Framework.   <\/p>  <p>  In determining planning policy and making planning decisions regarding appropriate building heights, the planning process has to strike a careful balance between enabling long-term and strategic development of relevant areas, while ensuring the highest standards of urban design, architectural quality and place-making outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  Specific Planning Policy Requirement (SPPR) 3(A) of the Building Height Guidelines provides that where an applicant for planning permission sets out how a development proposal complies with the relevant criteria and the assessment of the planning authority concurs, taking account of the wider strategic and national policy parameters, then the planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la may approve such development, even where specific objectives of the relevant development plan or local area plan may indicate otherwise.  <\/p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that in order to better align decision making processes between local authority development plans and the context of overall Government policy including the promotion of compact urban growth to support the more sustainable use of urban land and existing services, the Building Height Guidelines require planning authorities to identify through statutory plans, areas for increased building height, where appropriate, and to not provide for blanket numerical limitations on height (SPPR1).  This work is underway as part of statutory planning processes in many local authority areas.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these guidelines are necessary and appropriate to give clear context and direction to the overall requirement to promote increased density and building height in appropriate locations within our urban centres.  I currently have no plans to review these guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500060#WRO05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Properties","counter":631,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500061#WRP00200"},{"type":"question","counter":632,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[39059\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500061#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his specific plans and timescale for bringing underused and vacant housing stock into use; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":633,"content":"<p>My Department is committed to ensuring that existing housing stock is utilised to its fullest extent including providing a targeted, effective and co-ordinated approach to identifying and tackling vacancy across Ireland.  There are a range of measures to assist in meeting housing needs by ensuring that our existing housing stock is used to the greatest extent possible. My Department published the National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy, in 2018, which contains a range of objectives and key actions to be pursued in partnership with stakeholders and agencies across the housing sector to address vacancy in our housing stock.  The Strategy is underpinned by a number of supports and guidance put in place by my Department to assist in bringing vacant housing stock back into use including: <\/p>  <p>- The Repair and Leasing Scheme which assists private property owners, local authority and Approved Housing Bodies to utilise existing vacant housing stock throughout the country as social housing.  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for a rental property.  The maximum loan for property repair available under the Repair and Lease Scheme is &euro;60,000.<\/p>  <p>- The Buy and Renew Scheme particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community.  It provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased by local authorities, rather than leased, if that is the preference of the owners. <\/p>  <p> - In December 2018 my Department published the Bringing Back Homes Manual for the Reuse of Existing Buildings.  Revitalising our main streets through well designed refurbishment of residential units, particularly above shops, could help to rejuvenate smaller town centres and city streets as well as produce more houses. <\/p>  <p>  To further support this work at local authority level, my Department has secured funding for each local authority to support the work of a Vacant Homes Office. The provision of central funding reinforces the capacity of my Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit to liaise with and seek information\/statistics from a dedicated contact point within each local authority. The Vacant Homes Office plays a key role in the co-ordination of this work within each local authority. <\/p>  <p>  The Government set out its housing priorities in the Programme for Government across numerous areas, including homelessness, affordable home ownership, private and social housing delivery, rent reform and planning and my Department is focused on moving those priorities forward. <\/p>  <p>  To deliver on these commitments, my colleague Minister O'Brien will publish a new housing policy and action plan 'Housing for All' this month which will provide a whole of Government approach to housing policy and is at an advanced stage of development at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500061#WRP00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":634,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500061#WRP00500"},{"type":"question","counter":635,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[39060\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500061#WRP00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the actions he plans to deal with the serious problem of land hoarding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":636,"content":"<p>The Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 introduced the vacant site levy, which is aimed at incentivising the development of vacant, under-utilised sites in urban areas. The Act provides that the levy shall apply to vacant sites exceeding 0.05 hectares on residential land or regeneration land, as designated in local development plans, which meets the relevant criteria set out in the Act. Under the Act, planning authorities were empowered to apply a vacant site levy of 3% of the market valuation of relevant properties which were listed on local authority vacant site registers in 2018, which relevant owners were liable to pay in January 2019. The levy rate has since been increased to 7% for sites on local authority vacant site registers from 2019 onwards. <\/p>  <p>  All levies due on an individual site remain a charge on the land concerned until all outstanding levies due are paid. Accordingly, under the vacant site levy provisions, there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year that a site remains vacant or idle.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Derelict Sites Act 1990 imposes a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.<\/p>  <p>  The Derelict Sites Act 1990 confers significant powers upon local authorities, including requiring owners or occupiers to take appropriate measures on derelict sites, acquiring derelict sites by agreement, or compulsorily, and applying a derelict sites levy on derelict sites. It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, local authorities are required to maintain a derelict sites register, which includes the name and address of each owner and occupier, where these can be ascertained by reasonable enquiry, of any land which, in the opinion of the local authority, is a derelict site.  Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the derelict sites register for any local authority can be inspected at the offices of that authority during office hours. Members of the public can engage with their local authority in relation to addressing individual derelict sites in their local areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, the derelict site levy was also increased from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020. This levy is applied annually for as long as relevant sites remain derelict. The changes in the rate of the derelict site and vacant site levies is intended to ensure that the levies have more meaningful impact and that the powers of local authorities in tackling dereliction and vacancy are strengthened for the purpose of bringing relevant sites into productive use, thereby facilitating urban regeneration and development in designated areas while also combatting land hoarding.<\/p>  <p>  I continue to keep the relevant provisions under review.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500061#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Sites","counter":637,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500061#WRP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":638,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[39062\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500061#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will give consideration to the introduction of new arrangements for the collection of the vacant site levy whereby the Revenue Commissioners would take over responsibility for collection based on a self-certification system in order to bring these sites into use for housing development and in view of the inability of local authorities to collect these levies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":639,"content":"<p>Under the vacant site levy provisions in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, planning authorities were empowered to apply a vacant site levy of 3% of the market valuation of relevant properties which were listed on local authority vacant site registers in 2018, which relevant owners were liable to pay in January 2019.

The Government's support for the recent D&aacute;il motion reflected our grave concern about the scale and character of settlements and their negative impact. <\/p>  <p>  We will continue to proactively raise theses issues at EU level, in national and EU statements at the UN Human Rights Council, the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council, and in our bilateral contacts. <\/p>  <p>  On 12 July I joined EU Foreign Affairs Ministers in a first meeting with the new Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, Yair Lapid.  During our discussion I emphasised the need to respect international law and underlined that settlement expansion and the ongoing threats of evictions, demolitions and violence against Palestinians, all of which undermine prospects for peace, must be stopped. I called on Israel to engage constructively in a process for peace and to do all it can to address the humanitarian situation and support reconstruction in Gaza. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland remains firmly committed to a negotiated two-State solution based on international law, relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and agreed parameters.<\/p>  <p>  I have been clear in my engagement with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority of the commitment of this Government to advancing a Two-State solution for a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The EU has an important role in this effort, including through revitalising the Quartet, which is being supported by the new EU Special Representative on the Middle East, Sven Koopmans.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government states that the Government will &ldquo;Honour our commitment to recognise the State of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict, or in advance of that, when we believe doing so will progress efforts to reach a Two-State solution or protect the integrity of Palestinian territory&rdquo;.  As I have stated previously, I would be prepared to recommend to the Government early recognition by Ireland of a State of Palestine, if and when it might be helpful, and this is a matter which I discuss with EU colleagues.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500061#WRP03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":663,"content":"<p>Question No. 247 answered with Question No. 246.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":664,"content":"<p>Question No. 248 answered with Question No. 246.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":665,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500061#WRP03300"},{"type":"question","counter":666,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[38929\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500061#WRP03400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when a passport is likely to be issued for a person (details supplied); the reason the due date on the online passport tracker has not been updated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":667,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service was in contact with the applicant on 14 July to provide an update on the status of the passport application and requested necessary documentation not originally provided by applicant.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service scaled up operational levels on 4 May 2021, in line with the phased easing of restrictions set out in &ldquo;COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 &ndash; The Plan Ahead&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Passport Online will continue to be the priority channel given the efficiencies that are in-built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service.

Similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department engaged with patron bodies, including in the areas in question, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate action.  <\/p>  <p>  Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional post-primary school places in a number of school planning areas (SPAs) including South Kildare. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of building projects planned for South Kildare including the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Curragh Post Post-Primary School - It is intended that significant additional capacity to address this demand will be provided by the planned new 1,000 pupil building for the existing Curragh post primary school.  The school has an enrolment of 145 pupils in 2020\/21.  As the Deputy may be aware, a new site is required for the replacement Curragh post-primary school. The project is also proposed to address demographic need in the Kildare\/Curragh\/Newbridge school planning areas.  Officials in my Department are presently in advanced negotiation with a landowner in respect of the acquisition of a suitable site to cater for the permanent needs of the previously announced 1,000 pupil post primary school that will serve the Kildare\/Newbridge\/Curragh school planning areas. My Department also continues to work closely with officials from Kildare County Council in order to progress the transaction, under the Memorandum of Understanding between my Department and Local Authorities for the acquisition of school sites with a view to securing a suitable site for this school. Should agreement on the proposed acquisition be reached, the process will advance to the conveyancing stage when draft contracts are prepared and legal due diligence is undertaken in respect of the proposed transaction. It would be expected at that stage that the project to deliver the new school accommodation can simultaneously progress to architectural planning stage. As this negotiation is live and given the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally, I am not in a position to comment further at this time.<\/p>  <p>  - St Conleth's Community College have agreed to enrol an additional 1st year class for the 2021\/22 school year and the Patron has agreed to the expansion of the school to cater for a total capacity of 1,000 pupils.

The provision of own-door accommodation represents a substantial improvement in terms of allowing families to attain independence, privacy and develop a normal family life while within the system.<\/p>  <p>  These moves are in context of the wider Government commitment to end Direct Provision by the end of 2024 as set out in the &ldquo;White Paper to End Direct Provision and to establish a new International Protection Support Service&rdquo; that I published earlier this year. The provision of own-door accommodation for all applicant families is the goal of the White Paper.<\/p>  <p>  The use of temporary emergency accommodation had to regrettably be continued for longer than anticipated due to the advent of the pandemic and the overriding need to ensure all residents could be accommodated in as safe an environment as possible. As a result some families, for whom the intention was that the use of temporary emergency accommodation would be brief, spent longer periods in this type of accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that moving to a new location is difficult for any family, particularly those in the International Protection Process, but moving from emergency accommodation to own door accommodation will provide greater independence and privacy for the families in accommodation more appropriate to their needs. <\/p>  <p>  Despite the efforts of IPAS officials, there is at present no other suitable accommodation for these families available to IPAS in the Munster region.<\/p>  <p>  It is a requirement for IPAS to re-accommodate people from temporary emergency accommodation to dedicated IPAS accommodation centres as soon as appropriate vacancies become available, and as such no formal appeals process exists, however IPAS officials do engage with families individually where concerns emerge about an intended move. IPAS encourage any family with specific concerns about moving to their new accommodation to contact IPAS directly. The dedicated Resident Welfare team will be on hand to provide support throughout the moves. <\/p>  <p>  I am absolutely committed to improving conditions for International Protection applicants in the accommodation provided by IPAS.  To this end, IPAS a new dedicated Customer Service unit to engage with IPAS residents, as well as a new Resident&rsquo;s Welfare Team were established earlier this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500062#WRQ06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":754,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500063#WRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":755,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[38858\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500063#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of staff by location and function in each office of his Department nationally by location; if the property is State owned or leased; and the detail of these leases in the case of those properties on a lease in terms of cost, term and next break date.","asker":"1597","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":756,"content":"<p>The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth's offices are located as follows:<\/p><p>- 2nd and 3rd floors, Block 1, Miesian Plaza, 50 - 58 Baggot Street Lower, Dublin 2; and <\/p><p>- 2nd and 3rd floors, Montague Court, 7 - 11 Montague Street, Dublin 2.<\/p><p>The number of staff by location and function in each office of my Department is set our below.<\/p><p>Note that the staffing numbers provided refer solely to direct employees (headcount) of the Department as of 30 June 2021. <table>    <tr>       <th>Function <\/th>       <th>Location <\/th>       <th>Number of staff<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Minister's Office,   Management Board, Project Management Office, Internal Audit<\/td>       <td>2nd and 3rd floors, Block 1, Miesian   Plaza<br \/><br \/>50 - 58 Baggot Street Lower<br \/><br \/>Dublin 2<\/td>       <td>28 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Child Policy &amp;amp; Tusla Governance Division<\/td>       <td>As above<\/td>       <td>41 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Early Learning and   Care and School Age Childcare Division<\/td>       <td>As above<\/td>       <td>80 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Adoption and Mother and Baby Homes Division<\/td>       <td>As above<\/td>       <td>26 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Corporate and Business Support Division<\/td>       <td>As above<\/td>       <td>81 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Youth, Governance, Communications and Research Division<\/td>       <td>As above<\/td>       <td>109 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>International Protection, Integration and Equality<\/td>       <td>2nd and 3rd floors, Montague Court<br \/><br \/>7 - 11 Montague Street<br \/><br \/>Dublin 2<\/td>       <td>99 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Departmental Staff <\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>464 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>The leasing arrangements in place for the Departmental buildings are as follows:<\/p><p><b>Block 1, Miesian Plaza, 50 - 58 Baggot Street Lower, Dublin 2: <\/b>The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY) occupy the second and third floors at this leased property.

It is a priority of mine to ensure that community groups continue to be supported in their valued contributions to their local CCTV schemes while ensuring sufficient and proportionate oversight of statutory data protection considerations. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme was extended in 2019 to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is open for applications from all counties. 34 schemes have been funded to date with commitments of almost &euro;940,000 made to these schemes across 10 counties and I can confirm that funding continues to be available for 2021. Further details are available to download from my Department's website and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that community-based CCTV is governed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (Section 38(3)(c)) and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework sets out a number of safeguards, requiring that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:<\/p>  <p>  -  be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,<\/p>  <p>  -  have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and<\/p>  <p>  -  have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded. These key legal requirements have operated since 2006.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the general scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recordings) Bill was published on 27 April. This new bill will also cover CCTV authorised in local communities by the Garda Commissioner. I intend to conduct a further review of the terms and conditions of the current scheme to bring it into line with the proposals for this new legislation, and in keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government. Once this review is completed, appropriate guidance will issue to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the control and supervision of CCTV systems. This new legislation is intended to replace Section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500064#WRS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Service","counter":812,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500064#WRS00800"},{"type":"question","counter":813,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[38780\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500064#WRS00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of complaints made by prisoners&rsquo; family members to the Irish Prison Service in 2019, 2020 and to date in 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":814,"content":"<p>The information sought is not readily available, it will need to be collated and verified by officials within the Irish Prison Service.

This involves a major updating of the proposals of the General Scheme of the Gambling Control Bill which was published in 2013. <\/p>  <p>  A considerable amount of further work has been done in the meantime. The Inter-Departmental Working Group on Future Licensing and Regulation of Gambling reported in 2019 and a European Commission funded report on the structure of a gambling regulator was produced in late 2019. The task now is to bring all three elements together, and having regard to the on-going evolution of the gambling industry, into one coherent scheme of a Bill that will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment. <\/p>  <p>  My objective is to ensure that gambling will be a safe, fair, crime free and entertaining activity for the majority of those who take part in it. The new legislation will ensure that the regulatory authority is given sufficient powers to protect consumers and, in particular, minors and those vulnerable to problem gambling behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that operators offering activities in whole or in part online, will be subject to the same licensing terms and conditions as any other licensee, with any necessary additions. When established, the regulator will have the necessary enforcement powers for licensing and powers to take action where individuals or operators are failing to follow rules and regulations.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the publication of the General Scheme, it is intended to finalise the appointment of a CEO Designate by the end of the year, providing a clear path towards the regulator being fully operational in early 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500064#WRS02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Peace Commissioners","counter":827,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500064#WRS02300"},{"type":"question","counter":828,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[38895\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500064#WRS02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will expand the role of peace commissioners to include the signing of forms which would prevent the need for persons to attend a Garda station to have such relevant forms signed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":829,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, Peace Commissioners are appointed (and may be removed from that appointment) by the Minister for Justice under Section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924. <\/p><p>The powers and duties of Peace Commissioners consist primarily of:<\/p><p>-  Taking statutory declarations<\/p><p>-  Witnessing signatures on documents if required by various authorities<\/p><p>-  Signing certificates and orders under various Acts<\/p><p>-  The Courts of Justice Act 1924 also gives Peace Commissioners the power to issue summons and warrants but these powers are less frequently used these days. <\/p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that I have no plans at present to review or expand the current powers and duties of Peace Commissioners.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500064#WRS02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":830,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500064#WRS02600"},{"type":"question","counter":831,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[38917\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500064#WRS02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; stationed in each Garda station in County Wexford by station in each of the years 2011 to date in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":832,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the general management and administration of Garda business, which includes the deployment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the State.

The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider. This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards. <\/p>  <p>  HIQA, in discharging its duties determines, through examination of all information available to it, including site inspections, whether a nursing homes meets the regulations in order to achieve and maintain its registration status.  Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Expert was established, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. This Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified.  HIQA and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) recently jointly published an &ldquo;Analysis of factors associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes in Ireland&rdquo;, delivering on recommendation 6.7 of the Expert Panel report, to further the learning from the pandemic. Further data analysis work and learning will also continue, in line with other recommendations of the Expert Panel, but unfortunately have been impacted by the recent cyberattack on the health system. <\/p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the short- and medium-term recommendations have already been implemented. The significant examination undertaken by the Expert Panel provides important learning and a framework for enhancing older persons services both in the short and long-term and this work is progressing.<\/p>  <p>  A number of supports have been made available to nursing homes throughout the pandemic, including:<\/p>  <p>  -  the provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE);<\/p>  <p>  -  COVID-19 Response Teams; <\/p>  <p>  -  the HSE temporary accommodation scheme;<\/p>  <p>  -  serial testing for nursing homes<\/p>  <p>  -  HSE training and development resources, which were opened up to private and voluntary providers<\/p>  <p>  -  IPC support and advice; and<\/p>  <p>-    the suite of guidance developed to support the sector<\/p>  <p>  At a broader level, there has been significant and ongoing consideration of this impact since the start of the pandemic, with various examinations and development of reports with a focus on COVID-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons. There has been a very clear national commitment to continue to learn from the pandemic as the national and international understanding of the virus evolves, and where necessary to ensure that the public health-led approach evolves, as evidence and learning materialises. Findings of these reports confirm that the very infectious nature of COVID-19 makes it difficult to prevent and control in residential care settings.  The reports produced nationally identify findings consistent with international evidence, which have highlighted that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into nursing home depends on the levels of the disease circulating in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community.<\/p>  <p>  While significant progress has being made in relation to the roll-out of the vaccination programme and the current situation in nursing homes is broadly stable, the prevalence of the more transmissible Delta variant is rapidly increasing in Ireland and this poses a significant risk, in particular to those who are not yet fully protected though vaccination.  It must be recognised that the pandemic has not concluded and at this time a priority focus of Government remains on the ongoing management of the COVID-19 response, to ensure that the positive gains now been experienced are preserved, and that those most vulnerable to the virus continue to be safeguarded, having regard to the residual risk.<\/p>  <p>  While we are still dealing with a level of risk in nursing homes, we are continuing to look at options which may be available to the State in relation to listening to the voices of those who have lost a loved one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500065#WRT00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":882,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500065#WRT00500"},{"type":"question","counter":883,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[31714\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500065#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of protected disclosures made by staff in the HSE since 2010; the action taken to protect those making such disclosures; the number of protected disclosures that have led to actions or changes in policy as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":884,"content":"<p>\"As this Parliamentary Question relates to an operational issue, it is a matter for the HSE.

It is not however a substitute for other control measures, such as vaccination, physical distancing, cleaning, face coverings and maintaining good hand and respiratory hygiene.<\/p>  <p>  Ventilation requirements will vary depending on the workplace and the type of work being undertaken. The transmission of viral particles very much depends on the interaction of multiple factors such as the viral emission rate, the duration of exposure, the level of occupancy, environmental conditions, and ventilation rate. Focusing on air changes per hour (ACH) is not practical and would require engineering expertise to take account of specific settings in respect to the nature of the individual premises, the workspace, and the type of work being undertaken. Page 35 of The Work Safely Protocol contains a section on ventilation that offers advice to business owners. The advice is to focus on ways that ventilation can be increased in all work areas and the need to undertake a risk assessment for each indoor workplace to determine if there are any occupied areas that might be enclosed and poorly ventilated.<\/p>  <p>  The Protocol also acknowledges that re-occupying workplaces should not, in most cases, require new ventilation systems but rather that improvements to ventilation will help increase the quantity of clean air and reduce the risk of exposure to airborne concentrations of the virus. The advice is to improve ventilation to increase the fresh air and reduce the level of recirculated air. Increasing ventilation can be achieved through natural means, like opening a window, or by mechanical means. <\/p>  <p>  Building ventilation has remained one element of broader infection prevention and control (IPC) response over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As the pandemic continued, additional support measures for private and voluntary nursing homes have been delivered through the Health Service Executive (HSE).<\/p>  <p>  As of 14th July 2021, 7,683 claims had been submitted as part of the Scheme. In total, &euro;134.5 million has been made available under TAPS between 2020 and 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the ongoing high level of risk associated with COVID-19 during this period, the Department of Health responded by extending the scheme twice, far beyond the originally planned timescale of three months. The further extension of the scheme was outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Plan 'Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19', published in September 2020. This provided reassurance of the Scheme&rsquo;s availability and a planned timeframe of operation to the end of June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The cessation of TAPS at the end of June, as planned and previously announced, was communicated with all relevant stakeholders, including Nursing Homes Ireland &ndash; the national representative body for the private and voluntary nursing home sector.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a marked improvement in the status of the virus in the community and in nursing homes due to the rollout of the National Vaccination Programme &ndash; COVID-19 cases and outbreaks in nursing homes are now at a very low level compared with the first quarter of the year and, overall, the epidemiological situation is very positive. It is the Department&rsquo;s understanding that currently there is one open outbreak in a nursing home.<\/p>  <p>   (Please note that the cyber-attack on the HSE on 14 May 2021 has prevented the routine notification of cases, associated deaths and outbreaks of COVID-19 to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) system. As an interim measure, provisional epidemiological reports are being prepared but have not undergone the data validation procedures undertaken through CIDR. For this reason, data continues to be provisional at this time.)<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme has fulfilled its temporary purpose of providing financial support to nursing homes to address COVID-19. Although the risk is greatly reduced, it has not been completely eliminated, therefore the outbreak assistance element of the Scheme will continue to be available to nursing homes until the end of 2021. Availability of outbreak assistance is subject to the overall sanctioned amount of &euro;42m for 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The substantial package of non-financial supports outlined below will continue to be provided for the time being:<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The continued supply of PPE is a key support mechanism and will be provided in line with clinical and public health recommendations;<\/p>  <p>  - The COVID-19 Response Teams established to support Public Health Outbreak teams covering all residential services as well as home support settings. All stakeholders, including the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel, have highlighted the significant contribution these new teams have made to supporting nursing homes throughout the pandemic;<\/p>  <p>  - The HSE Temporary Accommodation Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - HSE training and development resources, including the opening up of HSeLanD to private and voluntary providers.<\/p>  <p>  - IPC support and advice;<\/p>  <p>  - The substantial suite of publicly available guidance developed to support the sector.<\/p>  <p>  These measures and supports reflect a significant investment by the State to support nursing homes and other services and measures, such as the COVID-19 Response Teams, and are a clear signal of the work that is ongoing to integrate the wider health system.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to reflect that all nursing homes, as registered providers with HIQA, have well established obligations under the legal framework in terms of the delivery of safe care to residents. Nursing homes are required, by law, to ensure that procedures, consistent with the standards for the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections published by HIQA, are implemented by staff. The current infection prevention and control standards have been in operation since 2018. Good and effective IPC procedures should be in place across the entire health and social care service as a matter of course.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2021, a revised plan 'Resilience and Recovery 2021 Plan: The Path Ahead' was published by the Government. This plan recognises the need for longer-term reform of both older persons and nursing home care, broadly reflecting the lessons learned from the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel and the pandemic. However, these structural reforms, including the policy and regulatory framework, extend beyond the scope of a temporary financial support scheme aimed at a specific, time-limited public health objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500067#WRV03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1027,"content":"<p>Question No. 370 answered with Question No. 316.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":1028,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500067#WRV03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1029,"qnumday":371,"qnumall":"[32389\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500067#WRV03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if medical cannabis can now be prescribed to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1030,"content":"<p>There are two separate pathways for accessing cannabis for medical use in Ireland.<\/p><p><b>Medical Cannabis Access Programme (MCAP)<\/b><\/p><p>The provision of the Medical Cannabis Access Programme (MCAP) as a result of recommendations by the Health Products Regulatory Authority in their &ldquo;Cannabis for Medical User &ndash; A Scientific Review&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The review stated that if the policy decision is to make cannabis available for medical purposes, the HPRA advised that it should recognise patient need, but be evidence based.

This represents an increase of over &euro;400 million since 2012. The Government is committed to further development of all aspects of our mental health services, in line with our current policy\u00a0Sharing the Vision - A Mental Health Policy for Everyone.<\/p>  <p>  To plan for the ongoing and increasing need for mental health services, including 24\/7 mental health care, the refreshed national mental health policy,\u00a0Sharing the Vision, was published in June 2020. This policy sets out a 10-year plan for our services that addresses the needs of the population though a focus on the requirements of the individual. This policy was developed following a process of research into international innovation and best practice in mental health and an extensive national consultation of over 1,000 service users, family members, friends and carers and other stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  As our mental health effects and contributes to our overall health and wellbeing, it is only right that this refreshed policy is very closely aligned with\u00a0Sl&aacute;intecare, our ten-year roadmap to transform our health and social care services, and shares the\u00a0Sl&aacute;intecare\u00a0vision of the right care in the right place at the right time.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover,\u00a0Sharing the Vision\u00a0recognises that mental health is not a matter for the health sector alone. It sits in a much broader context of how society views mental health and how decisions can be made right across the spectrum of relevant public services to invest in the mental health and wellbeing of the population. Good mental health for the population of Ireland cannot be achieved without a whole-of-government approach. Consequently, implementation will be characterised by substantial cross departmental engagement.<\/p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision\u00a0seeks to create additional access routes to treatment and to work in partnership with service users and their families to ensure that service users have timely access to supports. The policy contains recommendations with regards alternative access routes to emergency care and proposes out-of-hours crisis caf&eacute;s as a new referral option.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the policy is aligned to and supports additional roll out of online mental health service provision accelerated by the advent of Covid 19, including initiatives such as:<\/p>  <p>  - The national Crisis Text-Line, a voluntary, clinically supported texting service, free and available 24\/7, which provides immediate support for people going through a mental health or emotional crisis;<\/p>  <p>  - Availability of free online and face to face counselling;<\/p>  <p>  - The new CAMHS Connect telepsychiatry service for HSE West which is expected to be rolled out nationally and which will pave the way for enhanced care provision for children and young people, ranging from presentations in Emergency Departments to more regular monitoring after crisis episodes. CAMHS Connect will improve access, reduce waiting times and address some staff recruitment and retention issues;<\/p>  <p>  - The\u00a0www.yourmentalhealth.ie\u00a0website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Out of hours crisis supports will be enhanced in line with Sharing the Vision and commitments set out in the HSE National Service Plan 2021. Funding has been allocated in 2021 for crisis resolution teams, crisis or community cafes, and CAMHS telehealth hubs.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, following investment from the Programme for Government Funding 2017, additional funding was obtained for the development of a model within all Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) areas for the provision of extended seven-day mental health services within general adult services.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the pandemic most Community Mental Health Teams provided some form of seven day week service, this is still in place and available for existing mental health service users in a blended format in compliance with COVID-19 restrictions.\u00a0 Online supports are also available from YourMentalHealth.ie\u00a0and through NGO partners, who can offer information and support via text, phone or video.<\/p>  <p>  If a person is in crisis they are strongly recommended to contact the out-of-hours GP or attend the local emergency department where they will be seen by a mental health professional for appropriate assessment.\u00a0 The textline 50808 also offers 24\/7 anonymous support by trained counsellors.<\/p>  <p>  The outbreak of COVID-19 throughout the world is a source of significant stress and anxiety for many people. The Department of Health and the HSE continue to work with clinicians, healthcare providers and NGO&rsquo;s to promote positive mental wellbeing and provide services and interventions for those experiencing poor mental health.\u00a0 In addition to maintaining existing services, the HSE delivers and funds a wide range of mental health and psychosocial support services including online training, counselling and national health and wellbeing promotion initiatives.

A Chronic Disease Management (CDM) Programme, having regard for COVID-19, was developed in conjunction with the IMO and the Department of Health.

The ECC workstream will ensure maximum impact for citizens in avoiding hospital admission as far as possible through initiatives that will see care delivered within the community, at or near a person&rsquo;s home where appropriate. These initiatives include chronic disease management by GPs and direct GP referral to community radiology. <\/p>  <p>  Project 3: Streamline Care Pathways from Prevention to Discharge focusses on the development of integrated care pathways that are based on delivering the best outcomes for patients can help to drive streamlined integration between care settings at a national, regional and local level.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person<\/p>  <p>  - Bed and board<\/p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living<\/p>  <p>  - Laundry service<\/p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.<\/p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body with a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law in Ireland. CCPC&rsquo;s mission is to promote competition and enhance consumer welfare. The CCPC has published consumer protection guidelines for contracts of care in long-term residential care services for older people. The guidelines set out the obligations and responsibilities that providers must adhere to under consumer protection law and are aimed at providing greater transparency, clarity and certainty for consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500069#WRX03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1143,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500069#WRX03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1144,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[32816\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500069#WRX04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of money allocated to each CHO area in tabular form for mental health in each of the years 2017 to date in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1145,"content":"<p>As this Parliamentary Question relates to an operational issue, it is a matter for the HSE.

As the pandemic continued, additional support measures for private and voluntary nursing homes have been delivered through the Health Service Executive (HSE). <\/p>  <p>  As of 11th June 2021, 7,148 claims had been submitted as part of the Scheme. In total, &euro;134.5 million has been made available under TAPS between 2020 and 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Due to the ongoing high level of risk associated with COVID-19 during this period, the Department of Health responded by extending the scheme twice, far beyond the originally planned timescale of three months. The further extension of the scheme was outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Plan 'Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19', published in September 2020. This provided reassurance of the Scheme&rsquo;s availability and a planned timeframe of operation to the end of June 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The cessation of TAPS at the end of June, as planned and previously announced was communicated with all relevant stakeholders, including Nursing Homes Ireland &ndash; the national representative body for the private and voluntary nursing home sector.  <\/p>  <p>  There has been a marked improvement in the status of the virus in the community and in nursing homes due to the rollout of the National Vaccination Programme &ndash; COVID-19 cases and outbreaks in nursing homes are now at a very low level compared with the first quarter of the year and, overall, the epidemiological situation is very positive. It is the Department&rsquo;s understanding that currently there is one open outbreak in a nursing home. <\/p>  <p>  (Please note that the cyber-attack on the HSE on 14 May 2021 has prevented the routine notification of cases, associated deaths and outbreaks of COVID-19 to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) system. As an interim measure, provisional epidemiological reports are being prepared but have not undergone the data validation procedures undertaken through CIDR. For this reason, data continues to be provisional at this time.) <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme has fulfilled its temporary purpose of providing financial support to nursing homes to address COVID-19. Although the risk is greatly reduced, it has not been completely eliminated, therefore the outbreak assistance element of the Scheme will continue to be available to nursing homes until the end of 2021. Availability of outbreak assistance is subject to the overall sanctioned amount of &euro;42m for 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The substantial package of non-financial supports outlined below will continue to be provided for the time being:<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The continued supply of PPE is a key support mechanism and will be provided in line with clinical and public health recommendations;<\/p>  <p>  - The COVID-19 Response Teams established to support Public Health Outbreak teams covering all residential services as well as home support settings. All stakeholders, including the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel, have highlighted the significant contribution these new teams have made to supporting nursing homes throughout the pandemic;<\/p>  <p>  - The HSE Temporary Accommodation Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - HSE training and development resources, including the opening up of HSeLanD to private and voluntary providers.<\/p>  <p>  - IPC support and advice;<\/p>  <p>  - The substantial suite of publicly available guidance developed to support the sector.<\/p>  <p>  These measures and supports reflect a significant investment by the State to support nursing homes and other services and measures, such as the COVID-19 Response Teams, and are a clear signal of the work that is ongoing to integrate the wider health system.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to reflect that all nursing homes, as registered providers with HIQA, have well established obligations under the legal framework in terms of the delivery of safe care to residents. Nursing homes are required, by law, to ensure that procedures, consistent with the standards for the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections published by HIQA are implemented by staff. The current infection prevention and control standards have been in operation since 2018.

HIQA&rsquo;s role is to develop standards, inspect and review health and social care services and support informed decisions on how services are delivered. HIQA's role includes monitoring the safety and quality of health services and investigating as necessary serious concerns about the health and welfare of people who use these services.    <\/p>  <p>  HIQA, is the statutory independent regulator in place for the nursing home sector, whether a HSE managed or a private nursing home. The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider. This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA does not investigate individual complaints, however the Department understands from HIQA that concerns it receives are used to inform its inspection and monitoring processes, informing the risk profile for the service and where appropriate are passed on to the relevant bodies.     <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with Regulation 34 of S.I. No. 415\/2013 - Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013, registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure. The registered provider is required to make each resident and their family aware of the complaints procedure as soon as is practicable following admission.     <\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies including complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. Regulatory bodies such as the Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland also has a role in the investigation of individual complaints. The appropriate pathway for making a complaint is dependent on the particular issue of concern.   <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently working on a policy and legislative framework to provide a fit for purpose streamlined and consistent clinical complaints and patient safety incidents legislative scheme that meets the needs of patients and families across health services. This work will include legislation, regulation, and policy and will seek to incorporate a Programme for Government 2020 commitment to expand the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman to consider clinical decisions in health and social care complaints.    <\/p>  <p>  In August 2020, the Nursing Home Expert Panel (NHEP) report was published which contained 86 recommendations, across 15 thematic areas, many of which will require legislative measures to implement. HIQA also submitted a paper outlining a number of suggested amendments to the legislation governing the operation of designated centres for older people.     <\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the NHEP recommendations, learning from the pandemic and HIQA's suggested regulatory enhancements, the Minister for Health and I approved a two-phased approach to examining the legislation with a view to proposing enhancements to the primary and secondary legislation governing nursing homes, with a primary focus on enforcement, governance, oversight and certain regulatory areas including infection prevention and control.

Since their inception 20 years ago, up to the current Food Wise 2025 plan, these strategies have ensured that the sector has a coherent vision and strategy to underpin the sector&rsquo;s continued development. The development of a new strategy for the agri-food sector is a key commitment of the Programme for Government, which called for an ambitious blueprint for the sector for the years ahead, adding value sustainably into the future, with a strategic focus on environmental protection. <\/p>  <p>  The need to improve sustainability in all its forms, environmental, economic and social, has been at the core of the deliberations of the Stakeholder Committee established to develop the new Strategy. A draft of this Strategy was published in April as part of a public consultation and it sets a vision for Ireland to become a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems over the period to 2030. This vision will see Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food sector continuing to produce safe, nutritious, high-value food while protecting and enhancing our environment and contributing to vibrant rural and coastal communities and the national economy.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear from the draft Strategy that careful consideration has been given to the issue of meeting environmental targets, while also supporting the ongoing development and viability of the agri-food sector. The draft Strategy has established four high level Missions and these in effect will guide the sector to achieving the triple objectives of economic, environmental and social sustainability:<\/p>  <p>  - A Climate Smart, Environmentally Sustainable Agri-Food Sector.<\/p>  <p>  - Viable and Resilient Primary Producers, with Enhanced Wellbeing<\/p>  <p>  - Food that is Safe, Nutritious and Appealing, Trusted and Valued at Home and Abroad.<\/p>  <p>  - And An Innovative, Competitive and Resilient Sector, Driven by Technology and Talent.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that the draft Strategy has set challenging environmental metrics for the sector to achieve, including the over-arching ambition to develop a climate neutral sector by 2050, with substantial verifiable progress by 2030. I note that a series of well-thought out actions are contained in the Strategy to help deliver on that ambition. These build on the Ag Climatise Climate &amp;amp; Air Roadmap for the Agriculture Sector that I launched in December last.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the new Strategy will serve the sector well and that its vision can be achieved, notwithstanding the challenges that exist in terms of sustainability, dealing with the aftermath of Brexit and building back better after COVID-19.  Working together we will become a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems over the period to 2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500072#WRAA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1306,"content":"<p>Question No. 471 answered with Question No. 470.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry","counter":1307,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500072#WRAA03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1308,"qnumday":472,"qnumall":"[38949\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500072#WRAA03900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total production in the dairy sector here in each of the past five years to date; the degree to which action has been taken to minimise greenhouse gases associated with the sector in the same period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1309,"qnumday":474,"qnumall":"[38951\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500072#WRAA04000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which beef production has fluctuated in each of the past five years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1310,"qnumday":475,"qnumall":"[38952\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500072#WRAA04100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which the poultry production sector here continues to maintain production and sustainability throughout the poultry sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1311,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[38956\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500072#WRAA04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which sustainable production levels continue to be maintained in the beef, dairy, poultry, pig meat and lamb sectors; the potential for growth in the future; the extent to which measures continue to be taken to limit the growth of greenhouse gases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1312,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 472, 474, 475 and 477 together.<\/p><p>I am very aware of the contribution of the meat and dairy sectors to Irish agri-food as a whole, supporting significant levels of direct employment as well as their role in supporting rural economies and the wider national economy.

The average price for R3 Steers in 2020 was 362.73c\/kg (excl VAT), which represented a 1% increase on the previous year.<\/p><p>Sheepmeat export values increased by 11.5% on the previous year values to reach almost &euro;354 million, while volumes rose by 3% to almost 64,000 tonnes.Slaughtering increased by 3% in 2020 to just under 2.9 million head. The national average price in 2020 was &euro;519.92\/100Kg, a 13% increase on the previous year.<\/p><p>Pigmeat exports increased by 0.21% in value terms on 2019, totalling just over &euro;893 million. Over the past two years the value of pigmeat exports have grown by 7.9%.  The average price for 2020 was 2.9% higher than 2019.<\/p><p>Irish poultry production hit record levels in 2020, with a total of 111m birds slaughtered, representing an increase of 33.8% (just over 28 million birds) in the past five-year period.<\/p><p>The OECD long term forecast to 2030 predicts an increase in the consumption of poultry meat over the forecast period, but a reduction in beef consumption and a stabilization of the consumption of other meats.  While EU consumption is projected to continue this downward trajectory, international demand for beef is increasing. However, competition is high and EU beef prices are expected to follow world price developments. The EU long term outlook for dairy is positive and it is predicted that by 2030, the EU could command up to 35% of the global market share, particularly for value added products. However, remaining global risks include higher stocks, slow return of foodservice, and the impact of weaker economic growth on currency and buying power.  <\/p><p>Global trade conditions will be crucial in determining the outlook for the Irish meat and dairy sectors over the medium to longer term. While the outlook for the sector remains broadly positive, the sector continues to face challenges including the ongoing uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring the continued operation of Irish food supply chains and the pursuit and development of new markets remains a key priority for my Department.<\/p><p>The need to respond to evolving consumer expectations on welfare and sustainability as well as global demand are key to the continued sustainable  development of the sector. The transition to become carbon neutral by 2050 is going to require significant investment, innovation and R&amp;amp;D. For this reason, I am heartened to see that these are also at the core of the draft 2030 Strategy. It is also worth noting that support will be available in the new Common Agricultural Policy which has a significantly increased environmental ambition. This will involve a change in the way farmers receive support, with the emphasis shifting much more definitively to a focus on better environmental outcomes, delivered through the green architecture. This green architecture combines greater environmental and climate ambition with Pillar 1 payments with further environmental achievement through Pillar 2 schemes.<\/p><p>All of the evidence suggests that the long term fundamentals for dairy and meat are generally positive.  The Department and I will continue to monitor the sectors closely and support their ongoing sustainable development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500072#WRAA04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1313,"content":"<p>Question No. 473 answered with Question No. 470.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1314,"content":"<p>Question No. 474 answered with Question No. 472.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1315,"content":"<p>Question No. 475 answered with Question No. 472.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pigmeat Sector","counter":1316,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500072#WRAA04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1317,"qnumday":476,"qnumall":"[38953\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500072#WRAA04800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which new regulations are being imposed on the pig production sector given that new regulations have only been introduced in the past number of years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1318,"content":"<p>No changes to the regulations in relation to pig husbandry or welfare have been introduced in recent years; the current law dates back to 2008 (Council Directive 2008\/120\/EC).

All policy is underpinned by broad consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including rural and urban stakeholder groups, young people and the wider public, Government Departments and State Agencies. This engagement process provides important insights into issues impacting on rural and urban communities and in identifying areas for response relevant to the work of my Department. <\/p>  <p>  My Department introduced specific supports, interventions and funding packages, having assessed the emerging needs of urban and rural communities impacted by COVID-19. A range of COVID-19 related supports were introduced to support the response and recovery from the pandemic in 2020 including; COVID-19 Stability Fund; Broadened Community Enhancement Programme; Town &amp;amp; Village Renewal &ndash; Accelerated Measure; Philanthropy Fund &lsquo;Innovate Together&rsquo;; Broadened CL&Aacute;R Programme; Comic Relief match funding; Libraries Development- Small Scale Capital Works Programme; Community Services Programme (CSP) Support Fund; Social Enterprise Funding; Volunteer Support Programme and the COVID-19 Emergency Fund. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to provide COVID-19 supports to communities right across the country. On 6th May I launched the 2021 Stability Fund, with an allocation of &euro;10m, targeting organisations which deliver critical services to vulnerable people within their community but which now face closure or loss of service due to the impact of the pandemic. This &euro;10 million investment builds on the &euro;45 million Stability Fund 2020, which supported almost 600 organisations across the country. <\/p>  <p>  The application process for the 2021 Stability Fund has now closed, with applications appraised and assessed in batches to facilitate timely drawdowns. Decisions will be released on an ongoing basis. I was pleased to announce Tranche One of successful grantees under the 2021 Stability Fund on 9th July 2021, supporting 180 organisations with close to &euro;4.5m in allocations. Further tranches will follow in due course.<\/p>  <p>  The recently launched &euro;4.5 million 2021 Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) 2021 will also support local groups to re-open their facilities post COVID-19. The application window is open, groups should contact their LCDC for information on making applications. <\/p>  <p>  The COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on the invaluable role played by Social Enterprises in their communities. Across Ireland throughout this pandemic Social Enterprises have made an important contribution in areas such as mental health, social inclusion and the circular economy.<\/p>  <p>  In February, I announced a &euro;800,000 call for proposals from Local Development Companies to provide supports to assist Social Enterprises in their recovery from COVID-19. given the high level of interest and quality of the applications, on 8 July I increased this allocation to &euro;945,000.<\/p>  <p>  The programme, which is funded through my Department&rsquo;s Dormant Accounts Fund, will provide free training and mentoring to social enterprise managers, directors and staff across the country. It is estimated that over 550 social enterprises will benefit from these supports over the next year, which will build their capacity in areas such as strategic planning, digital innovation, capacity building and governance.<\/p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Social Enterprise Regeneration Programme builds on successful schemes for Social Enterprises funded by my Department in recent years, such as the Training and Mentoring Scheme and the Small Capital Grants Scheme for Social Enterprises. This announcement underscores my commitment to supporting Social Enterprises and to delivering the National Social Enterprise Policy 2019-2022 which was published by my Department in 2019 and is part of a suite of policy initiatives from the Department of Rural and Community Development to support those who work with communities and disadvantaged groups. <\/p>  <p>  The programme will be delivered by the Local Development Companies on a regional basis and will be managed on the Department&rsquo;s behalf by the Irish Local Development Network (ILDN). The regional rollout of the scheme contributes positively to the commitment under Our Rural Future to deliver a suite of new measures to support the development of Social Enterprises in rural and to contribute to job creation locally.<\/p>  <p>  Other supports provided by my Department for communities impacted by COVID include:<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;50 million 2020 support package for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Charities and Social Enterprises launched by Government and administered by my Department. This funding was made available from the Dormant Accounts Fund through the COVID-19 Stability Fund and the Innovate Together Fund. <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;4.2 million for 2 rounds of the 2020 COVID-19 Emergency Fund which was focused on groups participating in the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Community Call&rdquo; initiative. <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;7 million was provided in funding for the Community Enhancement Programme in 2020. This comprised of &euro;2 million in June and a further &euro;5 million in August under the Government July Stimulus package. <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;4.75m Community Services Programme, or CSP, 2020 additional support fund, developed by my Department in response to the difficulties being experienced by organisations due to COVID-19, to continue to retain their CSP supported employees on their payroll, regardless of whether the organisations are in a position to continue to provide normal activities or whether they have had to close their facilities\/services as a result of the COVID restrictions.  The programme currently supports over 420 community organisations under the Community Services Programme, or CSP, to provide local services through a social enterprise model, in both urban and rural communities. Our 2020 allocation is &euro;46.89m and we achieved full spend in 2020. We have an additional &euro;2m for 2021. Some &euro;49m is available to support community organisations under the programme in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;25 million under the 2020 Town and Village Renewal Scheme focused on interventions to support the economic and social recovery of our rural towns and villages and assist them in responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  - My Department worked with Pobal to put in place guidelines for the community and voluntary sector for reopening or operating their premises safely, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  - My Department worked to support the Community Call initiative which was an unprecedented mobilisation of both state and voluntary resources to combat the effects of COVID-19. This included providing funding for a COVID-19 Community Outreach initiative implemented by the Wheel and Irish Rural link, which supported the voluntary sector. <\/p>  <p>  - My Department provided flexibility under the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP 2020, &euro;39.1 million) to allow Local Development Companies work to support initiatives put in place to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  Groups or organisations qualify for support schemes or programmes provided by my Department where they meet the requisite eligibility criteria. Some examples of key supports, interventions and funding provided by my Department for communities throughout the country are as follows: <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;6.5 million funding towards the regeneration of Dublin&rsquo;s North East Inner City (NEIC) support in 2020, and the same amount will be available in 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;340,000 under the CL&Aacute;R 2020 programme through the addition of a new funding measure - Meals on Wheels and Linked Services which placed a particular focus on supporting CL&Aacute;R communities to deal with the impact of COVID-19 in their areas. <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;5.8 million in funding was approved under CL&Aacute;R 2020 for 186 projects. The CL&Aacute;R 2021 budget is increased by 10% to &euro;5.5 million.  <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;1.3 million support for voluntary organisations who provide transport for service users in rural areas under the 2020 Mobility and Cancer Care Measure. <\/p>  <p>  - I have secured an additional &euro;2 million in Budget 2021 as part of the expanded Town and Village Renewal Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;20 million, initial allocation in December 2020 for Transitional LEADER Programme which will come into effect from 1st. April 2021. A key focus of the Transitional Programme will be on building capacity within communities which have not received LEADER funding to date.  The programme will also support job creation, foster and encourage entrepreneurship, and support projects which address the climate agenda, digital transformation and the Smart Villages approach to building on local strengths and assets. Under the Transitional Programme, the grant rate for enterprises and commercially-focused community projects will be increased from a maximum of 50% to a maximum of 75%.  This will further help to support enterprise development and job creation in rural areas in a post COVID and Brexit environment.<\/p>  <p>  - Since the establishment of the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, 164 projects have been approved for funding of &euro;249 million for projects costing &euro;328 million. <\/p>  <p>  - The projects approved for funding are large scale, ambitious projects that have the potential to allow rural communities to transform and reshape their towns and villages and position them to take advantage of the opportunities arising from the pandemic in terms of remote working and of people returning to rural areas to live and work. <\/p>  <p>  - I announced the third call for Category 2 applications to the Fund on 12th May with a closing date of 30th July. I am seeking large scale projects that will drive economic growth, combat dereliction and breathe new life into town centres.   <\/p>  <p>  - The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, or SICAP, is our country&rsquo;s primary social inclusion intervention. It is a national programme delivered with funding of &euro;190 million over a five-year period from 2018 to 2022. The work in each area differs to support local structures and needs rather than imposing general solutions. It will include work to combat isolation experienced by disadvantaged individuals. SICAP supports a range of groups in society which are disadvantaged and marginalised. <\/p>  <p>  - My Department provides support to Local Authorities towards the cost of additional staff to support the community function in Local Authorities. These are key posts which continue to support the coordinated Local Community Development Committee arrangements and the implementation of Local Economic and Community Plans in particular monitoring the emerging needs of urban and rural communities throughout the country with a view to responding specifically as required.<\/p>  <p>  In addition my Department has published a number of important policies which will bring tangible benefits to communities throughout the country, including:<\/p>  <p>  - The recently launched Our Rural Future, a new whole-of-Government Rural Development Policy for the next five years, which sets out a range of measures to strengthen the resilience of our rural communities and economies, including addressing the impacts of challenges experienced by people living and working in rural Ireland and maximising opportunities for rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  - The development of the National Volunteering Strategy provided an opportunity to engage with the sector and the establishment of a National Advisory Group representative of all stakeholders and chaired by the Minister of State, including engagement with our young people through a consultation event with For&oacute;ige. &euro;5.1m is allocated in 2021 to provide support to Volunteer Centres, Volunteering Organisation and to assist with the implementation of the new National Volunteering Strategy 2021-2025. Supporting the role of volunteers in our society is an important element of my Department&rsquo;s work. <\/p>  <p>  Ongoing dialogue is maintained by my Department with rural and urban stakeholders, in order to identify and respond to issues impacting on individuals and communities. I will also continue to collaborate with my Government colleagues and will monitor the issues which impact our urban and rural communities in order to respond to emerging needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500073#WRBB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Digital Hubs","counter":1356,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500073#WRBB03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1357,"qnumday":489,"qnumall":"[38966\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500073#WRBB03200","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the extent to which her Department has progressed the concept of digital hubs in order to minimise long commutes to work while at the same time replicating a work place environment both from the point of view of the employer and employee; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1358,"qnumday":490,"qnumall":"[38967\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500073#WRBB03300","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the number of digital hubs envisaged by her Department throughout the country with a view to enabling persons to remain in their own communities while in a work place environment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1359,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[38976\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071500073#WRBB03400","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the number of persons currently benefitting from the use of urban or rural digital hubs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1360,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 489 to 499, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The increased shift to remote working as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has given us the opportunity for a greater regional distribution of jobs and to support a better quality of life for many people who previously spent many hours in long commutes. This is a key focus of the Government's new rural development policy Our Rural Future.<\/p>  <p>  Remote working, supported by appropriate infrastructure and facilities, has the potential to encourage more people to live in rural areas while working in good quality jobs, no matter where their employer is based. It can also help revitalise our rural towns if remote working hubs are developed in their centres. <\/p>  <p>  The National Hub Network expanded from a &euro;1m scheme that was funded under the 2019 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plan. This project was originally scoped to develop a hub network, supported by a shared online platform for remote working facilities in the Atlantic Economic Corridor. However, in light of the clear demand for such a network across the county, this was expanded to a national project that would support both Our Rural Future and the National Remote Working strategy.<\/p>  <p>  I launched the National Hub Network, connectedhubs.ie, on 31 May in the Swinford Digiwest Hub in Co. Mayo. Since the launch, 113 hubs have signed on and are now using the platform, with an additional 49 hubs in the process of being onboarded. Furthermore, the number of hubs identified through the Western Development Commission's hub discovery process has increased to 505. These are in the process of being verified before they are mapped on connectedhubs.ie\/nationalhubsmap.html. This interactive map provides useful information in relation to each of the hubs and the services that are available at each site. <\/p>  <p>  My Department does not record definitive figures of the number of people currently using the facilities across the range of hubs at this time.
