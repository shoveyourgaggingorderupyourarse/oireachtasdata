An early resumption of more normalised international travel is of key importance.  However, we are acutely aware that inappropriate easing of restrictions could undo the tremendous progress to date.  Critically, Covid-19 and international travel will coexist for a considerable time to come.<\/p> <p>  International connectivity is critical for Ireland.  It drives business growth and development and underpins 75% of the tourism economy.  Our airport activities facilitate more than 140,000 jobs and support thousands of Irish businesses.  Our airports fully pay for themselves and are not supported by the taxpayer.  They have delivered a return of &euro;125 million in dividends to the Exchequer over the past five years.  They deliver record route connectivity for the economy, with both Dublin Airport and Cork Airport achieving record traffic volumes in 2019.<\/p> <p>  Financial sustainability is key to delivering critical and strategically important national airport infrastructure.  We have managed our finances accordingly and entered the Covid-19 crisis in a strong financial position, with good liquidity and limited debt.  However, this crisis has quickly eroded this strong starting position.  In line with Government policy, our role has been to keep our airports open to ensure critical personal protective equipment, PPE, and medical supplies were able to reach Ireland at a time when they were most needed.  We are immensely proud of the efforts of our airport staff, who became front-line workers in their own right, facilitating the repatriation of our people and enabling the delivery of much-needed cargo.<\/p> <p>  However, open airports with minimal traffic have led to losses of around &euro;1 million per day.  Passenger numbers in Dublin Airport may fall to 9 million from almost 33 million last year, while Cork Airport passenger numbers may fall below 1 million from almost 2.6 million last year.  Industry predictions foresee a slow and protracted recovery for the aviation sector.  We have had to take action.  In conjunction with staff and unions we have constructively engaged in a large programme of work to rightsize and reshape our organisation.  We have cut costs and are reviewing investment programmes pending greater clarity on the pace of recovery.<\/p> <p>  Dublin Airport faces strong international competition.  Aircraft are mobile assets and can and will be reallocated to where they earn the best return.  Cork Airport faces particular challenges, including maintaining a level playing-field.  The process of identifying a path to reopening the country to international travel has commenced, starting with the publication of the 15-country green list, which we welcome.  However, this list will only have a marginal impact on passenger numbers and is unlikely to add more than 100,000 passengers to the  number currently flying in any month, which is less than would fly in a single normal day.<\/p> <p>  We have adopted the recommendations of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and have implemented a series of health measures to protect both passengers and staff.<\/p><p>We are working closely with the Government to build a more robust process for tracking inbound visitors using passenger locator forms, with the intention of having a call centre in place in August.  There may also be merit in pursuing an evidence-based system for all non-green list countries whereby arriving passengers are required to undertake a Covid-19 test 72 hours or less before travel and submit proof of a negative test prior to travel.<\/p><p> The significant losses we are currently experiencing are not sustainable and put the strategic airport infrastructure of our small and open island economy at risk.  It is important that the State intervenes now to offset this risk.  This should include continuing short-term supports by extending the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, funding grants for pandemic safety measures, waiving rates and setting up an incentive fund for the development of air services.<\/p><p> Second, Cork Airport requires specific support as its revenue base has all but disappeared.  A specific mechanism is required to offset essential operating costs and incentivise route development.  Cork Airport should also be admitted to the existing regional airport programme and offered the associated capital funding.<\/p><p> Third, we need to look beyond the crisis and draw on the lessons of the past.  Despite the need for significant investment, airport charges, our key revenue source, were continually lowered through the aviation regulatory process before Covid-19.  The most recent reduction last year amounted to 22%.  This left our charges well below those of most peer international airports.  This came at a cost to the economy in the form of lower or slower investment and unnecessary financial risk or instability.  The recovery phase should see renewed investment in long-term strategic airport infrastructure to support economic growth, especially post Brexit, and to meet our commitments to the European Green Deal policy framework.  This will require a new and more supportive regulatory pricing framework.<\/p><p> DAA continues to operate in uncharted territory with little sign of recovery at this point.  We are committed to working with all stakeholders to find ways for international travel to coexist with the virus, as it must, in a manner that reduces risk and builds confidence.  Our airports can be engines for economic recovery, as they have been in the past.  We welcome this opportunity to engage with the committee regarding the role our airports can play in assisting in the recovery effort and the support mechanisms we require to bring this about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Gray","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595890800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to outline the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on Shannon Group and the aviation and tourism sectors more generally.  Most importantly, I will refer to the support measures required to assist us as we navigate this crisis.<\/p> <p>  Shannon Group is a commercial State company.  Like DAA, we are not funded by the Exchequer.  Our mandate is to promote aviation and optimise the return on our land and property assets.  We employ more than 600 people across our businesses: Shannon Airport, Shannon Commercial Properties and Shannon Heritage.  Through our International Aviation Services Centre, IASC, we also support the development of a cluster of more than 80 aviation companies based in the Shannon Free Zone.  The Shannon Group is a key driver of economic growth in the mid-west and along the Atlantic seaboard.  Our activities support a significant number jobs in the region.  The connectivity the group provides through Shannon Airport is vital for the business and tourism interests located in our region and enables them to live locally but trade globally.<\/p> <p>  We in Shannon Group started out this year with great optimism, projecting growth for each of our businesses.  We had secured new routes for the airport, were continuing our strong investment strategy through Shannon Commercial Properties, and anticipated growth at our Shannon Heritage visitor sites.  We have been through many crises in the past but never on such a scale.  Two of our three businesses, Shannon Airport and Shannon Heritage, have been devastated by this pandemic.  Like airports all over the world, Shannon Airport witnessed an almost total collapse of airport traffic, connectivity and revenues.  All market indications point to a very slow recovery.<\/p> <p>  Throughout this crisis we have endeavoured to maintain a level of service at our airport to allow repatriation flights and essential cargo movements, including facilitating the delivery of vital personal protective equipment, PPE, to provide emergency cover, and to facilitate maintenance, repair and overhaul, MRO, operators on the airfield.  I am proud of the role our employees played throughout the crisis in ensuring the availability of these services.<\/p> <p>  Between the onset of the pandemic and the end of June, passenger numbers have decreased by 96% year on year.  We expect our group revenue to be down by more than 60% this year.<\/p><p> Faced with the fact that our group revenue has fallen by over &euro;1.3 million per week since March, we took decisive action and implemented difficult but necessary short-term measures to preserve the business for the future, allow us to recover from and rebuild after this crisis and, ultimately, protect jobs in the longer term.<\/p><p> Similar to other airports, we have engaged with our employees on a range of measures to reduce payroll costs while we recover from this crisis.  Those measures include a temporary reduction in pay and a voluntary severance scheme.<\/p><p> We launched a Covid customer safety charter at the airport and introduced rigorous new public health measures across our businesses in order to protect the health and safety of staff and instil confidence in everyone coming to our airport and heritage sites.<\/p><p> On 1 July we reopened our reopened our terminal to scheduled services, with the recommencement of 16 routes by Ryanair.  However, in light of Government advice regarding essential travel only, passenger numbers have been extremely low.  We are now operating at well below 20% of normal activity levels for July.  Passenger numbers were down by 88% for the first 21 days of the month.<\/p><p> Due to the heavy reliance of Shannon Heritage on business from the international marketplace - this accounts for over 70% of our visitors - we have only been able to open our key sites for the peak season to cater for the domestic market.  Unfortunately, despite an extensive marketing campaign, visitor numbers and revenues at our sites are significantly down.  The fact is that 30% of our business is never going to make up for the 70% that is not there.  Given the collapse in revenue and the increasing losses being incurred by Shannon Heritage, the group is not in a position to continue to subvent the business into the off-season.  As a result, we have sought Government support to cover the cost of keeping sites open.<\/p><p> Aviation is expected to be the last sector of the economy to recover.  During this time, the economic cost is mounting.  Air connectivity is vital for FDI and indigenous businesses in our region.  Equally, our location as the transatlantic gateway to the Wild Atlantic Way is crucial for the tourism industry right along the west coast.  As a member of the aviation task force, I have highlighted on behalf of Shannon Group the importance of airports to the regions in the context of driving economic recovery and balanced regional development.  The measures contained in the task force's report are vital for recovery, including in the context of rebuilding regional and international connectivity.  A stimulus package urgently needs be put in place in order to encourage the rebuilding of air traffic.  We also need Government support package for essential capital projects at the airport.  We welcome the Government's July stimulus package - particularly the extension of the temporary wage support scheme - and we are reviewing the measures it contains in order to identify how they can support our businesses.<\/p><p> This pandemic has caused massive disruption.  It has changed how we live and work.  Until there is a vaccine, there will be many issues which will have to be managed.  We can get through this but we have to be prepared to do things differently.  We in Shannon Group have taken many short-term difficult decisions to deal with Covid-19 in order to preserve our businesses for the future.  We have done what we can, and now Government action is urgently required.  We must work together.  There is an urgent need for stakeholders to act together in terms of simultaneously managing the direct consequences of the crisis.  We have an opportunity to rebalance Ireland for a more sustainable and resilient future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Considine","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595890800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Considine for her presentation and for staying within the time allocated.

We have eaten into the cash reserves of the airport and we are subventing significant losses in the Shannon heritage business.

Unfortunately, I had the experience of going through 9\/11 in 2001 and the 2008 crisis and if we are in cyclical industries we need to have cash reserves or bank facilities in place to protect us through that.  As such we thankfully have the ability to withstand that, devastating as it will be.  The consequent wipe-out of capital and capacity will be a problem for another day and is why I addressed thinking about that in the future in my opening remarks.  We have the capacity to survive pretty much anything that is thrown at us this year.  That does not mean we have been insulated from very tough decisions.

Undoubtedly, we would not have been able to grow and support our economy if we had not those airport facilities in place through terminal 2.  We would not have been able to expand services, attract the Middle Eastern carriers and accommodate the additional travel that Aer Lingus and many of our airline customers have.

The stark reality is that aviation will not be of the same scale in 2021 as it was in 2019.  We therefore have to reduce the size and scale of our operation.  Our focus has been, not just in the last number of months but in the last number of years, to engage positively with our staff, to trust them with information about difficult decisions and to talk to them about the commercial, financial and other realities that together we have to face.  Something like compulsory redundancies is not a measure that companies, particularly State companies, seek to put in place if it is possible to avoid it.

If there is to be testing of departing passengers, those sorts of conditions will be set by the health authorities.  Those tests may have to be complied with in order to travel, as they currently are for persons travelling to the Middle East, for example.  Right now, there is not an effective or reliable source to put that in place and that is something we are anxious to see a greater possibility of.  However on the airport campus, it simply will not be possible to test thousands of people at a point in time.  Testing has an important part to play.  It is important that we develop this as a technique.  We can help manage risk because the thing that needs to be focused on is that it is about managing risk.  It is about a series of measures that can reduce that risk and can give confidence to the travelling public.

This is an issue I have raised time and again in recent months with various Departments, organisations and the Taoiseach and his predecessor.

In the United Arab Emirates, UAE, for example, a passenger must produce a medical certificate showing a negative result from a Covid-19 test on entry and exit.

Have they discussed any such proposal with the necessary authority, the Government or NPHET?

Over the period 2015 to 2019, we increased traffic at Cork Airport by 30%.  It was one of the fastest-growing airports last year.  In fact, it was the fastest-growing airport in Ireland last year.  Unfortunately, the Covid situation has dealt Cork Airport a really significant blow.<\/p><p>We have, therefore, particularly in our submission, made the call for assistance for Cork Airport.  This call relates to some of the capital projects that are required at the airport in order to ensure that it can continue to operate safely and securely.  Particular investments are required in hold baggage screening, which is a regulatory requirement.  There is a big price tag associated with that.  Cork is the only airport that has not had State support in the provision of this infrastructure.  Cork also requires support over the next while for investment in runway overlay.  There is a very high price tag associated with that as well.  There are opportunities under state aid rules to allow for capital investment to be made, via the regional airports programme, at smaller airports.  We would certainly like to see that for Cork.  There will also be a big programme of work required to regrow the business at Cork Airport.  We have specifically sought assistance with some of the investment that would be required to provide incentives and marketing support in respect of the development of new routes and regrowing that business over the next while.<\/p><p> On testing, there has been a lot of talk about it however it is very challenging to do it on arrival at airports.  There are many challenges with regard to space for in which to hold passengers.  In other words, where to keep them while they are being tested.  There are issues regarding the availability of the reagents required for polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing and also with the availability of suitably-qualified staff to undertake that testing.  As such, there are a lot challenges in the context of testing on arrival.  That is why we focused in our submission on the opportunities that there might be to carry out testing before the passenger leaves his or her home country.  We certainly think those opportunities are worth exploring further.  Thus, the first line of defence will be testing on exit so that passengers who arrive here have already been tested and can show to the airline that they have been tested.  They will have certificates to show they are being tested and that they can also present that to the staff of the border management unit at the airports and ports on arrival to show they have already been tested.  We are seeing that happening now at airports in a number other countries, including Austria.  Authorities in Hawaii and Alaska in the United States are putting in place pre-testing requirements and we are now seeing this for some of the airlines that are operating out of Dublin into Abu Dhabi, for example.  There is absolute merit in looking at that.  It is something we have brought to the attention of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072800002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Miriam Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595890800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank Ms. Ryan.

A total of 88,690 people came into Dublin, 6,751 into Cork, and 3,505 into Shannon.  I do not think these figures correspond with what the market share of those airports would typically be, which has been much analysed.  I think Dublin Airport normally enjoys 86% of market share.

The July stimulus announcement last week included the extension of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, the suspension of commercial rates until the autumn, capital funding for projects and so on.  As there is a whole stimulus package aimed at hospitality and tourism I was hoping that Ms Considine would have some good news on the Shannon Heritage sites front, such as them remaining open beyond the 31 August.  What is the current status there?  I know she has made requests to the TDs for the region and there is collaborative work in that regard but the landscape has changed in the past five or six days.<\/p> <p>  Will Ms Considine also explain whether the group will engage with the Shannon Heritage staff, in a similar way as it has with the airport staff, on the matter of redundancies or wage reductions?  Are any options on the table or is it solely a case of closing down sites until the spring?

However, in our dialogue with the officials in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in particular we have already highlighted to them that even with the scheme continuing we would be still incurring significant losses in the heritage business through the winter, hence the requirement for the subvention of that business through the winter.  We are in dialogue with Department officials on that and are waiting for an outcome.  That business is predominantly reliant on international tourists coming into the country.  We do not have international tourists coming into the country in meaningful numbers this year and we are looking at continuing losses in the peak summer season, even taking into account the domestic market.  As such there will be no business going into the winter.  Banquets, for example, are 94% reliant on international visitors coming to our sites.  We would require additional subvention on top of the temporary wage subsidy scheme and we are in dialogue with Department officials on that.<\/p> <p>  There was no particular capital funding in the July stimulus.

We all accept that international travel has fallen, but we cannot simply say that there is nothing to be done.  There is an opportunity here, especially with the stimulus.  We are asking people to take staycations.  Shannon Heritage workers are deeply concerned.  As Ms Considine knows, many of these people have given years to Shannon Heritage and the sites it operates, namely, Bunratty Castle and King John's Castle in my own city.

To clarify, we have sought subventions for Shannon Heritage to cover the operating losses that will be incurred over the winter and up to next summer.  Unfortunately, we are not confident that international travellers will return next summer in the same numbers as before, so losses are likely to continue.  We are in dialogue with officials in that regard.  As outlined in my submission, despite several intensive marketing initiatives and national coverage for the opening of Bunratty Castle and King John's Castle in Limerick, visitor numbers have not picked up to any great degree.  Visitor numbers and revenue are still down by more than 70% at Bunratty Castle.  They are down by 86% at King John's Castle.  In respect of the latter, it is really disappointing to note that the domestic market has fallen since last year.  It is approximately 40% of what it was in 2019.  As the committee will be aware, more than 70% of our market is international and it is very difficult to make up for that.  In this business, we traditionally make money in summer and lose it in winter.  We lost money as the pandemic began and incurred significant losses as it progressed.

The GPO had 34% Irish visitors and 35% of visitors to Malahide Castle were Irish.  However, 79% of the visitors to Craggaunowen were Irish.

Craggaunowen works from a very low visitor base.  Approximately 15,000 visitors visited the site last year.  The Deputy is correct to note that because of its location its market is predominantly domestic.  It is open from June to mid-September and is very heavily reliant on school tours during the June period.  Obviously, we were not open in June of this year.  Craggaunowen would lose money in any event, but because of our portfolio of sites we were able to support that business prior to the pandemic.  We are now losing money right across the business because of the collapse in our revenues.  Consequently, we made the decision to open our key sites in order to ensure that Bunratty Castle, a site in Clare on 26 acres of land, would be available to the domestic market while the schools were on holiday.  We made the same decision with respect to King John's Castle in Limerick.  Unfortunately, we were not in a position to open all our sites this year.  This business is in a financial crisis and there has been a complete collapse in revenue.  Shannon Heritage's revenue is down by 86% this year.  It is very difficult to keep trading.  Our decisions have been made with the long-term interests of the business to the fore.

The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about the greatest crisis that the global aviation industry has ever experienced.  This crisis is much more severe than those experienced at the time of 9\/11 in 2001 and the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008.  To highlight this I will outline a few statistics from the International Air Transport Association, IATA.  The losses in the global industry this year will be the biggest in aviation history, estimated at over $84 billion in 2020 and $16 billion in 2021.  By comparison, airlines lost $31 billion with the global financial crisis and the oil price spike in 2008 and 2009.  There is no comparison for the dimension of this crisis.  IATA research indicates that fewer passengers are saying that they will travel again in the first months after the pandemic.  In early April, 61% said that they would travel.  By early June, that had fallen to 45%.  Approximately two thirds of people surveyed are seeing less travel in their future, be it for vacations, visiting friends and relatives or business.  Deloitte, in the context of consumer sentiment in Ireland, puts consumer confidence in air travel as low as 19% and industry commentators are predicting that capacity will not revert to 2019 levels until 2022 at the earliest.<\/p> <p>  There is not a clear understanding in Ireland about the scale of the crisis or, indeed, its significance for the economy and its prospects for future recovery.  The task force for aviation recovery published its final report on 10 July and very succinctly captured the importance of the aviation sector in Ireland.  It referenced some key numbers from Oxford Economics which are worth reiterating.  The estimated GDP contribution of air transport to Ireland is &euro;8.9 billion.  A total of 140,000 jobs are supported by the aviation sector in Ireland.  Some &euro;8.7 billion is the estimated GDP contribution of foreign tourists and in the region of 8.8 million people visit Ireland every year by air.<\/p><p> The report of the task force highlights the critical importance of aviation to the economy and states that it was a strategic foundation for Ireland's open, small economy.  International connectivity is a key driver of that economy and in recent years that connectivity to Europe, North America, the Middle East and Asia has significantly increased.  The level of international connectivity that Ireland enjoyed prior to the crisis was looked upon with envy in many other countries and markets.  That connectivity is not about serving local Irish demand to go on holiday overseas.  This only represents part of it.  The connectivity to which I refer connects Ireland with other markets and economies, allows business to be done internationally and allows foreign direct investment into Ireland, which is a critical driver of the economy.  Connectivity is critical for regional development.  Key businesses and services sectors such as technology, software, pharmaceutical, medical, finance, food and beverage depend on that connectivity, and small and medium enterprises across the country depend on the inbound tourists brought to the country by means of aviation.<\/p><p> There is a lack of understanding of Ireland's leadership position from a global aviation perspective.  It is not just about the airlines and airports.  The global leasing market for aircraft had its origins in Ireland and Ireland controls over 60% of that market.  Ireland also punches above its weight in aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul.  The aviation sector is of systemic importance to the economy.  It is, therefore, of strategic national importance that the sector be protected to survive this unprecedented crisis and be in a position to contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.<\/p><p> I urge the committee to review the final report of the task force for aviation recovery.  It contains a number of key recommendations on rebuilding regional and international connectivity.  The report states that the Government should: provide a rebate directly to the airlines in respect of all Dublin Airport charges and navigation charges as paid by the airlines; a stimulus package should be put in place concurrently for each of Cork, Shannon, Ireland West, Kerry and Donegal airports; the current waiver for 80-20 slot use-it or lose-it should be extended to the winter of 2021 season; the Government should adopt the interim recommendations from the tourism task force; and we should ensure that the delivery of planned airport infrastructure programmes is carried out in full and on time.<\/p><p> The report also contains a number of key recommendations on saving jobs and supporting Irish business.  It states that the Government should enable a liquidity initiative for the aviation sector to help companies that make a material contribution to the economy and that it should ensure that a sizeable amount of funding is drawn down for the Irish aviation sector from the Next Generation EU funding of &euro;750 billion.  Unfortunately, those recommendations have not yet been progressed or implemented.<\/p><p> The green list published on 21 July is more restrictive than is the case in any other European country.  Ireland now stands alone in applying the policy.  The rest of Europe has opened for travel.  The criteria used is even more restrictive than that used for passengers from third countries entering the EU.  Ireland has not acted upon the European Commission&rsquo;s request to member states to lift border restrictions within the EU by 15 June.  The green list published this week effectively means that Ireland is closed for business and that will have profoundly negative impacts on the Irish economy and on the aviation and tourism sectors jobs within them.<\/p><p> I started by stating that the Covid-19 pandemic has brought about the greatest crisis that the global aviation industry has ever experienced.  The situation in the Irish sector is even worse than is being experienced by our international peers.  We are in the unfortunate position of, first, having the most restrictive travel policies in Europe and, second, having so far done the least in Europe to support the aviation sector.  These issues will need to be urgently addressed given the strategic importance of aviation to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  We are hopeful that the scale and depth of the crisis will soon be understood in Ireland and that the relevant actions required to address the crisis will be taken.  Aer Lingus will continue to engage with the relevant stakeholders for this purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072800002#FF00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595890800,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Wilson to make his opening statement but to confine it to five minutes in order to allow time for questions and answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072800002#GG00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595890800,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be here to assist the committee in its work.  We have already given a detailed written submission but I will draw the committee's attention to some of the key points.<\/p> <p>  Ryanair, as part of the aviation sector, is uniquely placed.  Our business is risk assessment, passenger confidence and safety.<\/p><p>When we talk about the balance between public health initiatives and returning to a functioning economy, those in the aviation business are well placed for that.  We work in an industry that is probably more regulated than the medical industry.  I would also say that Ryanair, given that it is the largest airline in Europe - and in the world for international passengers - is uniquely placed within the sector because of its daily interactions with the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, and the various governments throughout Europe.  We will be able to give some insight into that.<\/p><p> I echo what the witness from Aer Lingus said.  I do not propose to repeat everything he said except to state that the industry is in crisis, and in this country in particular.  If we look at the number of jobs that are potentially on the line, there are 40,000 jobs directly in aviation, 100,000 spin-off jobs and more than 335,000 jobs in tourism that are potentially affected.  If we look at what has happened in Ireland with the outbreak of this pandemic, the Government handled it well at the start in terms of lockdown, the way it resourced it and its speed of reaction.  However, the way it has been opened up afterwards in terms of how we strike a balance between public health initiatives in stopping the spread of this disease and having a functioning economy has been a disaster, frankly, for aviation.<\/p><p> This is not just about aviation.  As the witness from Aer Lingus said, this is not just about holidays.  We are heading into the shoulder season.  We depend on business traffic.  There will be 50% less traffic, certainly from this airline, and I imagine the figure is similar for Aer Lingus, and we are on the periphery of Europe.  This country needs a functioning aviation sector.  It is the oil in the engine of the economy and if we push it out, we will reap what will come from that in terms of structural damage to this economy and unemployment will closely follow that.<\/p><p> If we consider what happened in Ireland after the initial handling of the pandemic, the green list has been a total disaster.  The idea that we would be looking at connectivity to Gibraltar and Monaco has been held up to ridicule.  In terms of the way the Government has complied with its own guidelines, we need to get a handle on this.  In terms of the recommendations we put in, we should have the EU 27 and the UK back on the green list.  It is about the way we manage this going forward.  We are easily able to handle the risk assessments and the safety concerns.  If we look at what has happened in the rest of Europe, those countries are now open.  They have complied with the recommendations of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  The committee members should watch yesterday's World Health Organization press conference at which Dr. Michael Ryan said that closing borders is not the way to do it.  We have got to get the balance right.  We have got the balance wrong on this so far.<\/p><p> In terms of what will happen, IATA says that we will not recover to 2019 levels in terms of traffic throughout the world until 2023 and 2024.  The amount of traffic in Europe in particular will shrink, and that will not just bounce back.  Airlines will make their decisions but, in terms of what will happen, we will lose this traffic forever and end up going back to where we were previously in this country, with no ease of connectivity.  The recommendation we make today is that we get the UK and the EU 27 countries on the green list and put in place incentives because the rest of Europe is working ahead on this.  They are investing in their economies now.  The rich economies - the Germans, the French and the Dutch - are putting money into their economies.  We are going to get left behind.<\/p><p> I hope I can deal with many of the questions the members wish to ask.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072800002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Wilson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595890800,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Wilson.

That was much appreciated by the public.  I hope they will pass on the committee's thanks and best wishes to the staff involved. <\/p><p> My first question is to Mr. Wilson from Ryanair.  Does he think his airline's campaign of encouraging people to travel to countries on the green list undermines the advice being given by the Government and public health advisers in this jurisdiction about avoiding non-essential travel?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072800002#HH00300","speaker":"1481","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595890800,"counter":262,"content":"<p>As an airline we are complying with all the EU regulations.  Everyone else in Europe is flying.  The balance has been struck between public health and returning to a functioning economy.  A functioning economy means that people will have to travel, and do so for business purposes as well as visiting friends and relatives, putting children in college and holidays.  We are operating in exactly the same way as every other airline in Europe.  The outlier here is Ireland.  Ireland, for some bizarre reason, has ignored what the other EU 26 has done, namely to return to air travel, unrestricted within the EU, since 1 June.  That is all we are doing.  We are carrying on our business in that manner.  It is the muddled response of the Government, with green lists and people on it, and not on it, which is causing the confusion.<\/p> <p>  On public health advice, do not listen to me, but to Dr. Ryan of the World Health Organization, who says it is about how States handle infection at home, that they should stop looking abroad and for other scapegoats.  People are sensible in how they comply when they get to the countries to which they are travelling.  The idea that the Irish Government has excluded Germany is laughable.  The Germans are the gold standard for how they handled the pandemic right from the start.  Dr. Ryan singled them out at a press conference yesterday for what they have done on track and trace, for localised lockdowns and for volumes of testing, yet somehow we in Ireland have some sort of magical formula about which  the Germans and the rest of Europe are unaware.  The rest of Europe is moving.  There are spikes and there will be spikes here too, and we will have to manage that, but shutting down the economy will bring us back, if not to the 1980s to the 1950s when we tried that experiment before by trying to do things on our own.  It will not work.  People need to understand that it is not about holidays, it is about connectivity.  Holidays are an important element of our business but that is now done for the summer, we are heading into the winter.  Traffic, not only in Ireland but from a European perspective, will halve.  This committee should be asking how we will attract the remaining traffic back into Ireland because if we do not we will lose it, and lose it forever.  What will happen is that next year, the 335,000 in the tourist industry will not have work because there will be nobody flying here.  We have to get back to normal and balance the health concerns.  The Government advice is disproportionate and will do structural damage to the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072800002#JJ00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Wilson"},{"type":"speech","time":1595890800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Wilson for his response but I beg to differ.

The airlines are challenging the best medical and public health advice in this country, which they have every right to do, advice that has proved to be fantastic in terms of saving lives.  I think the airlines' approach is wrong.  I would like to support them when they talk about the additional support they need from Government.<\/p><p>If, however, the airlines do not acknowledge the importance of our public health advice and the way we are fighting this disease, they are not being realistic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072800002#MM00700","speaker":"1598","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595890800,"counter":290,"content":"<p>We implemented every single guideline and public health policy urgently and effectively across our airline and across our operation.

Highlighting that point provokes a very healthy debate.  Legislators should consider that debate and balance the needs of the economy and the importance of restoring air travel against the very important needs of public health.  We are not being one-dimensional.  We are providing a very healthy comparison with countries that are managing containment and opening up air travel.  These countries understand the need to balance the economy against the need to maintain public health and to contain the virus.  The position the Deputy has outlined is not one we have taken.

All we are saying is that a balance must be struck.  Other countries have done that.  Dr. Michael Ryan of the World Health Organization said this morning that international travel bans are not a sustainable strategy.  Economies have to open up, people have to work and trade has to resume.  It was not Ryanair that said this but Dr. Ryan of the World Health Organization, WHO.  The WHO believes it is possible to identify and minimise the risk associated with international travel and we support that view.  We are going to have to move.<\/p> <p>  With respect, nobody is playing fast and loose.  Like Aer Lingus and every other airline, we have people working at check-in desks and dealing with the public.  Their health also has to be protected.

I will address my questions specifically to Mr. Doyle from Aer Lingus in the first instance.  I put to him the view of some of his own workers who say that Aer Lingus is on the brink of extinction.  They fear that the company will be wound up to release assets and equity to assist the other companies that form part of IAG.  They are deeply concerned about the future of the jobs.  All the while, they see the airport expanding.  I appreciate that is a long-term project.  These people are deeply concerned about their jobs.  Aside from the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the other income continuance schemes which, as we know, have been available to every single sector, what has the Government done with regard to the aviation sector and those jobs in Aer Lingus specifically?

As per the proposals of the aviation task force, we recommend that the temporary wage subsidy scheme be extended into next summer for aviation and aviation-related sectors.<\/p> <p>  Looking at what other countries have done, in the UK and Spain liquidity has been made available to companies that were investment grade or in a strong position before the crisis.  A number of airlines in the UK have participated in those programmes.  There are no such programmes available in Ireland.  We also believe that, to attract companies to operate in Ireland during the recovery phase, a stimulus is required.

We have seen many private bus operators establish comprehensive services from Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford direct to Dublin Airport.  Prior to Covid, we were seeing a large growth in coach tourism, which has Dublin city as its base.  In recent years, tourists could jump on a tour bus on the quays in Dublin at 7 a.m. and do a whistle-stop tour of the west and be back in Temple Bar that night.

However, if we do not have markets to connect to, those regional airports are probably the ones that will be much weaker than the city airports such as Dublin.<\/p><p>What we should do, in line with the aviation task force, is to have an incentive scheme for airport charges so that we can do something to stimulate the industry, hang on to the traffic we have and, hopefully, grow it when we come out the other side.

We do not necessarily see that the growth of connectivity out of Dublin Airport comes at the expense of the regions, but I do think the regions are more vulnerable coming out of this crisis, as Ryanair stated, without the effect of some stimulus packages.  We remain committed to the region but I also urge the Government to execute the recommendations of the task force.<\/p> <p>  What Dublin is about for Aer Lingus is a hub and what that enables us to do is to begin to expand our north Atlantic presence at the hub and to compete internationally with other hubs for traffic.  That enables two things; the first is that Ireland is very well placed to connect traffic from North America into Europe.  In enabling that connection traffic, we are also able to expand the direct services into and out of the island of Ireland, which gives us benefits in terms of FDI and tourism.  I do not see the development of Dublin as a hub coming at the expense of regional airports.

A significant percentage of those passengers are connecting into Europe.  That traffic tends to be essential travel and repatriation.  We are flying to three destinations in North America at the moment, namely, Boston, Chicago and New York.  What I urge people to understand is the amount of freight or cargo on those flights.  We are transporting thousands of tonnes of exports and imports, much of it pharmaceuticals, into and out of the island of Ireland.  That is probably one of the main drivers of us maintaining the network as it currently stands.<\/p> <p>  What we have called for as a group is for the evaluation with urgency of some testing processes that could enable safe travel to open up Europe and the United States.  If we look at the availability of testing capability in the United States, there should be a solution we would evaluate and pursue.  That is cognisant of the fact that the United States is significantly behind Europe in terms of the progression of the pandemic.  The United States is very important and FDI is fundamental.

Oddly, there is something I very much agree with in them, namely, that, as an island nation, we need an aviation industry and a national airline.  AIG may well let Aer Lingus go bust, but is that not a reminder to us all that the privatisation of that airline was not just a mistake in the first place but a catastrophic one for workers, for the State and for the economy at large?  I am in favour of helping workers in both airlines but we should remind ourselves that the model in the aviation industry is unsustainable in the long term from the point of view of climate and the environment.  We need connectivity and a functioning airline industry.  Our guests submissions include many figures but what they have left out are the figures for the airline community in the year prior to Covid-1.  I refer to several hundreds of millions of euro for Aer Lingus and in the region of &euro;1 billion for Ryanair.  They both make the case for State aid in one form or another.  The State is paying a large part of the companies' wages under the wage subsidy scheme and their workers have a good case for assistance, but both companies have behaved badly towards their workers.  They have undermined them and tried to impose lay-offs, wage cuts and the rearrangement of contracts.<\/p> <p>  I ask the witness from Ryanair to explain why the company is coming in here with its hand out pleading for more support while it is making applications to the High Court for costs of up to &euro;13.5 million in respect of 11 pilots arising from their right to ballot their members for industrial action?  Ten of those pilots are based in Ireland and their ability to represent their colleagues is being restricted.  To me, that looks like intimidation.  Ryanair has sacked pilot representatives across Europe in disproportionate numbers.  The best description we have of the company's negotiations with unions since its so-called recognition of them is torturous.  Self-employed pilots have been used as an industrial weapon against direct employees in terms of the scheduling of full-time rosters for those who are self-employed and leaving direct employees without any flight work.  In the context of its efforts to divide and conquer the workers and take these 11 pilots through the High Court to seek retribution regarding their right to ballot their members, the company has no right to come here with its hand out to the State looking for more money.  If it were to back off in the war on workers, we might be able to support the cases of both Aer Lingus and Ryanair and there might be some way of bargaining support for their demands for more state aid.

Traffic in Europe is facing an apocalypse over the next three or four years and we are going to be left on the sidelines if we do not get moving.  Spain and Portugal have put incentives in place.  Airlines make decisions around those incentives and allocate resources accordingly.  The two Irish airlines, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, are telling the Government that they are not open for business.  We need to get on top of that.  The incentives for which we are looking will benefit the economy.

My questions will be directed more towards the representatives from Aer Lingus if they do not mind.  Cabin crew at Aer Lingus have been raising serious concerns.  Their original fortnightly pay was reduced by 50% on 30 March.  As of July, their level of pay has been reduced even though they are working.  They were misinformed that the company would pay 30% of their salaries and that the Government would give them a top-up of &euro;700 fortnightly.  They assumed that they would be getting more than &euro;350 per week but that is not the case.  Going by their payslips, those crew members are only getting a Covid-19 payment.<\/p> <p>  Some crew members have filled out the UP1 and UP14 social welfare forms to claim reduced work benefits.  They were told by Citizens Information and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection that they are entitled to claim.  However, the human resources department in Aer Lingus is refusing to sign the forms.  The crew members are not allowed to self-declare so if the company refuses to sign, they do not get any added benefits from social welfare in order to claim their stamps.  I have a couple of questions to ask about that and I would like this issue to be specifically addressed.  These staff members are definitely entitled to supports according to Citizens Information and the Department.  The process in question is the famous X and O options on social welfare applications.  If someone is to work five days a week but is only provided with three days' work, he or she is entitled to two days off if the company will mark the appropriate X or O.  I have done it as an employer.  Why will Aer Lingus stamp those forms?  I would appreciate an answer to that simple question.  What is being done to save the jobs of the cabin crew?  What can be done?  Aer Lingus and F&oacute;rsa have informed staff that they are in talks and that 230 crew members will be made redundant in the coming months.  Nobody knows whether it will be based on voluntary redundancy or not.  If not, it will be mostly junior crew who will be made redundant without a redundancy package.  In May, Aer Lingus made redundant anyone who joined the company in 2019.  There was no press coverage of that at all.<\/p> <p>  Members of Aer Lingus staff have told me that they have been flying in America and overnighting in Europe throughout this time and, while managers have been kind and helpful, those members of staff are worried and feel that they have been let down after all their hard work.  It is horrendous that they may potentially lose their jobs.  Those people have little or no money on which to live after their rent has been paid.  They are members of F&oacute;rsa but feel that the union is not doing much to stick up for them.<\/p> <p>  Aer Lingus will begin new working conditions in the coming months which will mean more work for less pay, according to some crew members.

Perhaps I will start about the questions about payroll and the TWSS.  We have operated the TWSS in a way that is entirely consistent with the legislation enacted and have worked closely with the Revenue Commissioners in that regard.  We have had to implement cost-saving measures and I refer the Deputy to the hours of work and pay that have been given by the airline.  We operated approximately 5% of the normal Aer Lingus flying programme between April and June.  Our programme increased a little in July but was still less than 20% of a normal year.  Over that period, we guaranteed 50% of hours and wages to our employees.<\/p><p>In every case, the full value of the subsidy has been passed on to our employees.  Anybody who was entitled to more, on the basis of the commitment that we made, was topped up over and above the subsidy to the pay applicable to the hours they have worked.  In addition, for the days that employees did not work, we paid an amount equivalent to the short-time working payment they would otherwise have received from social welfare.<\/p><p> We have, unfortunately, had to lay off some staff members but we still paid them the full subsidy, thereby maintaining the employment relationship between the airline and those employees.  We have been compliant with the legislation pertaining to the TWSS and have worked hard to make sure that is the case.<\/p><p> I will talk about the guarantees we can give.  At the outset, I told the committee about the scale of the challenge we are facing and how unprecedented it is.  At the moment, we are well behind what other European carriers are doing to reinstate services, recover the operation and have more hours to go around.

When I look up at the sky from my back garden, it is evident that aviation in Shannon is suffering a real downturn.<\/p> <p>  When Aer Lingus announced the temporary laying off of staff, its decision was communicated by video.  That was totally improper given that the news was received with devastation by staff members.  Many of those staff members did not see it coming.  The week before the lay-offs were announced, there had been talk of company restructuring which staff members read about in the media and on a WhatsApp message that was circulating.  Would Mr. Doyle say that, from the outset, he and his colleagues in human resources of Aer Lingus handled all of this well?

In those cases, the airlines know what is going to happen in terms of supports being offered.  The point is that there is going to be a smaller pool of available seats, not only this winter or next summer but for the next three or four years.  Once we get into next summer, assuming we do not have a full second wave and nothing else untoward happens, we are probably the only airline that has the ability to grow.
