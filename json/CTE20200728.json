An early resumption of more normalised international travel is of key importance.  However, we are acutely aware that inappropriate easing of restrictions could undo the tremendous progress to date.  Critically, Covid-19 and international travel will coexist for a considerable time to come.<\/p> <p>  International connectivity is critical for Ireland.  It drives business growth and development and underpins 75% of the tourism economy.  Our airport activities facilitate more than 140,000 jobs and support thousands of Irish businesses.  Our airports fully pay for themselves and are not supported by the taxpayer.  They have delivered a return of &euro;125 million in dividends to the Exchequer over the past five years.  They deliver record route connectivity for the economy, with both Dublin Airport and Cork Airport achieving record traffic volumes in 2019.<\/p> <p>  Financial sustainability is key to delivering critical and strategically important national airport infrastructure.  We have managed our finances accordingly and entered the Covid-19 crisis in a strong financial position, with good liquidity and limited debt.  However, this crisis has quickly eroded this strong starting position.  In line with Government policy, our role has been to keep our airports open to ensure critical personal protective equipment, PPE, and medical supplies were able to reach Ireland at a time when they were most needed.  We are immensely proud of the efforts of our airport staff, who became front-line workers in their own right, facilitating the repatriation of our people and enabling the delivery of much-needed cargo.<\/p> <p>  However, open airports with minimal traffic have led to losses of around &euro;1 million per day.  Passenger numbers in Dublin Airport may fall to 9 million from almost 33 million last year, while Cork Airport passenger numbers may fall below 1 million from almost 2.6 million last year.  Industry predictions foresee a slow and protracted recovery for the aviation sector.  We have had to take action.  In conjunction with staff and unions we have constructively engaged in a large programme of work to rightsize and reshape our organisation.  We have cut costs and are reviewing investment programmes pending greater clarity on the pace of recovery.<\/p> <p>  Dublin Airport faces strong international competition.  Aircraft are mobile assets and can and will be reallocated to where they earn the best return.  Cork Airport faces particular challenges, including maintaining a level playing-field.  The process of identifying a path to reopening the country to international travel has commenced, starting with the publication of the 15-country green list, which we welcome.  However, this list will only have a marginal impact on passenger numbers and is unlikely to add more than 100,000 passengers to the  number currently flying in any month, which is less than would fly in a single normal day.<\/p> <p>  We have adopted the recommendations of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and have implemented a series of health measures to protect both passengers and staff.<\/p><p>We are working closely with the Government to build a more robust process for tracking inbound visitors using passenger locator forms, with the intention of having a call centre in place in August.  There may also be merit in pursuing an evidence-based system for all non-green list countries whereby arriving passengers are required to undertake a Covid-19 test 72 hours or less before travel and submit proof of a negative test prior to travel.<\/p><p> The significant losses we are currently experiencing are not sustainable and put the strategic airport infrastructure of our small and open island economy at risk.  It is important that the State intervenes now to offset this risk.  This should include continuing short-term supports by extending the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, funding grants for pandemic safety measures, waiving rates and setting up an incentive fund for the development of air services.<\/p><p> Second, Cork Airport requires specific support as its revenue base has all but disappeared.  A specific mechanism is required to offset essential operating costs and incentivise route development.  Cork Airport should also be admitted to the existing regional airport programme and offered the associated capital funding.<\/p><p> Third, we need to look beyond the crisis and draw on the lessons of the past.  Despite the need for significant investment, airport charges, our key revenue source, were continually lowered through the aviation regulatory process before Covid-19.  The most recent reduction last year amounted to 22%.  This left our charges well below those of most peer international airports.  This came at a cost to the economy in the form of lower or slower investment and unnecessary financial risk or instability.  The recovery phase should see renewed investment in long-term strategic airport infrastructure to support economic growth, especially post Brexit, and to meet our commitments to the European Green Deal policy framework.  This will require a new and more supportive regulatory pricing framework.<\/p><p> DAA continues to operate in uncharted territory with little sign of recovery at this point.  We are committed to working with all stakeholders to find ways for international travel to coexist with the virus, as it must, in a manner that reduces risk and builds confidence.  Our airports can be engines for economic recovery, as they have been in the past.  We welcome this opportunity to engage with the committee regarding the role our airports can play in assisting in the recovery effort and the support mechanisms we require to bring this about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Gray","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595890800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to outline the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on Shannon Group and the aviation and tourism sectors more generally.  Most importantly, I will refer to the support measures required to assist us as we navigate this crisis.<\/p> <p>  Shannon Group is a commercial State company.  Like DAA, we are not funded by the Exchequer.  Our mandate is to promote aviation and optimise the return on our land and property assets.  We employ more than 600 people across our businesses: Shannon Airport, Shannon Commercial Properties and Shannon Heritage.  Through our International Aviation Services Centre, IASC, we also support the development of a cluster of more than 80 aviation companies based in the Shannon Free Zone.  The Shannon Group is a key driver of economic growth in the mid-west and along the Atlantic seaboard.  Our activities support a significant number jobs in the region.  The connectivity the group provides through Shannon Airport is vital for the business and tourism interests located in our region and enables them to live locally but trade globally.<\/p> <p>  We in Shannon Group started out this year with great optimism, projecting growth for each of our businesses.  We had secured new routes for the airport, were continuing our strong investment strategy through Shannon Commercial Properties, and anticipated growth at our Shannon Heritage visitor sites.  We have been through many crises in the past but never on such a scale.  Two of our three businesses, Shannon Airport and Shannon Heritage, have been devastated by this pandemic.  Like airports all over the world, Shannon Airport witnessed an almost total collapse of airport traffic, connectivity and revenues.  All market indications point to a very slow recovery.<\/p> <p>  Throughout this crisis we have endeavoured to maintain a level of service at our airport to allow repatriation flights and essential cargo movements, including facilitating the delivery of vital personal protective equipment, PPE, to provide emergency cover, and to facilitate maintenance, repair and overhaul, MRO, operators on the airfield.  I am proud of the role our employees played throughout the crisis in ensuring the availability of these services.<\/p> <p>  Between the onset of the pandemic and the end of June, passenger numbers have decreased by 96% year on year.  We expect our group revenue to be down by more than 60% this year.<\/p><p> Faced with the fact that our group revenue has fallen by over &euro;1.3 million per week since March, we took decisive action and implemented difficult but necessary short-term measures to preserve the business for the future, allow us to recover from and rebuild after this crisis and, ultimately, protect jobs in the longer term.<\/p><p> Similar to other airports, we have engaged with our employees on a range of measures to reduce payroll costs while we recover from this crisis.  Those measures include a temporary reduction in pay and a voluntary severance scheme.<\/p><p> We launched a Covid customer safety charter at the airport and introduced rigorous new public health measures across our businesses in order to protect the health and safety of staff and instil confidence in everyone coming to our airport and heritage sites.<\/p><p> On 1 July we reopened our reopened our terminal to scheduled services, with the recommencement of 16 routes by Ryanair.  However, in light of Government advice regarding essential travel only, passenger numbers have been extremely low.  We are now operating at well below 20% of normal activity levels for July.  Passenger numbers were down by 88% for the first 21 days of the month.<\/p><p> Due to the heavy reliance of Shannon Heritage on business from the international marketplace - this accounts for over 70% of our visitors - we have only been able to open our key sites for the peak season to cater for the domestic market.  Unfortunately, despite an extensive marketing campaign, visitor numbers and revenues at our sites are significantly down.  The fact is that 30% of our business is never going to make up for the 70% that is not there.  Given the collapse in revenue and the increasing losses being incurred by Shannon Heritage, the group is not in a position to continue to subvent the business into the off-season.  As a result, we have sought Government support to cover the cost of keeping sites open.<\/p><p> Aviation is expected to be the last sector of the economy to recover.  During this time, the economic cost is mounting.  Air connectivity is vital for FDI and indigenous businesses in our region.  Equally, our location as the transatlantic gateway to the Wild Atlantic Way is crucial for the tourism industry right along the west coast.  As a member of the aviation task force, I have highlighted on behalf of Shannon Group the importance of airports to the regions in the context of driving economic recovery and balanced regional development.  The measures contained in the task force's report are vital for recovery, including in the context of rebuilding regional and international connectivity.  A stimulus package urgently needs be put in place in order to encourage the rebuilding of air traffic.  We also need Government support package for essential capital projects at the airport.  We welcome the Government's July stimulus package - particularly the extension of the temporary wage support scheme - and we are reviewing the measures it contains in order to identify how they can support our businesses.<\/p><p> This pandemic has caused massive disruption.  It has changed how we live and work.  Until there is a vaccine, there will be many issues which will have to be managed.  We can get through this but we have to be prepared to do things differently.  We in Shannon Group have taken many short-term difficult decisions to deal with Covid-19 in order to preserve our businesses for the future.  We have done what we can, and now Government action is urgently required.  We must work together.  There is an urgent need for stakeholders to act together in terms of simultaneously managing the direct consequences of the crisis.  We have an opportunity to rebalance Ireland for a more sustainable and resilient future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Considine","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595890800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Considine for her presentation and for staying within the time allocated.

We have eaten into the cash reserves of the airport and we are subventing significant losses in the Shannon heritage business.

Unfortunately, I had the experience of going through 9\/11 in 2001 and the 2008 crisis and if we are in cyclical industries we need to have cash reserves or bank facilities in place to protect us through that.  As such we thankfully have the ability to withstand that, devastating as it will be.  The consequent wipe-out of capital and capacity will be a problem for another day and is why I addressed thinking about that in the future in my opening remarks.  We have the capacity to survive pretty much anything that is thrown at us this year.  That does not mean we have been insulated from very tough decisions.

By its nature, a downturn occurs every seven to ten years and, therefore, in the life of a project it is not unusual.  This project is the right thing for Ireland and significant progress has been made in the construction of the runway.  If I was sitting here ten years ago, we would have been talking about the construction of terminal 2 and whether that was wise.  Undoubtedly, we would not have been able to grow and support our economy if we had not those airport facilities in place through terminal 2.  We would not have been able to expand services, attract the Middle Eastern carriers and accommodate the additional travel that Aer Lingus and many of our airline customers have.

They have also suffered a reduction in wages, in effect, through the reduction in hours we had to put in place over the last couple of months.  The stark reality is that aviation will not be of the same scale in 2021 as it was in 2019.  We therefore have to reduce the size and scale of our operation.  Our focus has been, not just in the last number of months but in the last number of years, to engage positively with our staff, to trust them with information about difficult decisions and to talk to them about the commercial, financial and other realities that together we have to face.  Something like compulsory redundancies is not a measure that companies, particularly State companies, seek to put in place if it is possible to avoid it.
