The surplus at the year end was &euro;8.9 million.  Of this, &euro;8 million was unspent capital allocations for flood risk management which was carried over to 2020.  The balance of &euro;921,000 was surrendered.<\/p> <p>  The appropriation account is presented under two programme headings: &euro;99.3 million, or 22% of the total expenditure, was spent on the flood risk management programme; and just under &euro;356 million was spent on the estate portfolio management programme.  Under the estates management programme, the OPW provides office and other accommodation to Government Departments and offices, with the costs being a direct charge on the Vote.  This includes rent payments totalling &euro;91 million; expenditure on new works, alterations and additions, costing just under &euro;75 million; and property maintenance and supplies payments totalling just under &euro;65 million.  The account records the value of land and buildings held at the year end at &euro;3.3 billion.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the activity accounted for under Vote 13, the OPW acts on an agency basis on behalf of other Government Departments and agencies.  This mainly relates to the carrying out of major capital works and the leasing of accommodation.  The expenditure associated with this agency activity is reflected in the accounts of the client Departments and agencies.  Total agency expenditure handled by the OPW amounted to &euro;112 million in 2019.  This means that the aggregate value of the expenditure handled by the OPW amounted to &euro;567 million in the year.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account, but drew attention to the disclosure in the statement on internal financial control about procurement that was not compliant with public procurement rules.<\/p> <p>  I also drew attention in the audit opinion to the disclosure in the statement on internal financial control about expenditure by the OPW in 2019 on a maintenance contract.  I had previously reported on the origin and operation of this contract in my report on the accounts of the public services for 2018.  That is the chapter before the committee this afternoon.<\/p> <p>  The OPW has its own in-house direct labour force to carry out maintenance work on high-profile heritage properties, such as Dublin Castle, &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in and Kilkenny Castle.  For more standard properties, the OPW draws on the services of a private contractor firm for maintenance works, as required, under what is referred to as a \"measured term\" contract.  This is a contract that provides for the drawdown of services within a specified period, with individual work orders assessed on the basis of a tendered schedule of payment rates.<\/p><p>Minor construction works were also allowed under the contract, with provision for individual works orders costing up to &euro;500,000 each.  Above that level, separate tendering of works would be required.<\/p><p> Following a publicly-advertised tender competition, the contractor was appointed in October 2014 for three years, with a one-year extension option which was exercised by the OPW. The contract indicates that the OPW envisaged the contract value would be of the order of &euro;3 million a year, or &euro;12 million over the full four-year term.  In fact, the total value of the work carried out over the four years was &euro;39.4 million, an average of just under &euro;10 million a year.  In addition, the Accounting Officer has disclosed that the OPW incurred further expenditure of &euro;7.4 million in 2019 on works commissioned prior to the end of the contract term, bringing the total contract value to &euro;46.8 million.  All these figures exclude VAT.<\/p><p>In the course of our examination we also identified that at least six work orders placed by the OPW that cost in excess of the &euro;500,000 limit.  These ranged in value from &euro;600,000 to &euro;2.4 million.<\/p><p> When the measured-term contract was in its final year, the OPW advertised a tender competition for its replacement.  As required by law, the tender invitation included an estimate of the value of the new contract, which was proposed to be for an initial three years.  This is intended to allow potential bidders to understand the scale of the business proposed.  The value indicated by the OPW in the advertisement was equivalent to &euro;5 million a year, excluding VAT.  Only two expressions of interest were received by the advertised closing date: the existing contractor and one other tenderer.  Following final evaluation, the OPW awarded a new three-year contract to the existing contractor in October 2018.  The new contract allows for spending on any one works order up to &euro;750,000, or up to &euro;1 million for conservation works.  The Accounting Officer has disclosed that the expenditure incurred on work orders under the new contract had totaled &euro;34.7 million by the end of 2019.  Again, this is very significantly in excess of the estimated contract value presented in the tender advertised.  Of this total expenditure to end 2019, &euro;22 million was attributed to works on infrastructure required to prepare for Brexit.<\/p><p> We found that the OPW did not have adequate contract monitoring mechanisms in place, especially in the types of work being undertaken, which included pre-planned preventive maintenance, reactive maintenance, new capital works, and conservation projects. The Accounting Officer agreed to recommendations we made about improving their contract monitoring and estimation of contract values.  Given the elapse of time since the report was published in September 2019, the Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee on progress made in that regard.

I am joined this afternoon by Kathryna Clifford, head of finance, and in the adjoining room by the two OPW commissioners and members of our management board.<br\/><br\/>I hope the advance brief provided to the Committee answered the points specifically requested.  I will present further summary information on the 2019 appropriation account for Vote 13 and comment on matters raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report: Expenditure under a Maintenance Contract.<br\/><br\/>The Office of Public Works is an essential part of how Government and the State delivers on a wide variety of projects for the public good.  We are the State&rsquo;s lead body on flood risk management; we provide office space for more than 40,000 public servants; we maintain and showcase national monuments and important historic buildings such as Kilkenny Castle, Castletown House, and Leinster House, where we are today; we manage public parks and gardens such as the Phoenix Park and the National Botanic Gardens; the State art collection, State events, and Government publications.<br\/><br\/>Our vision is to maintain our built and natural environments in harmony.  Our purpose is to to provide the Government and the public with versatile, innovative and specialist services. Projects and requirements frequently change.  What is constant, however, is the need for the State to have the expertise and capacity to deliver on its plans for our people.  That need is highlighted in the ongoing OPW response to Covid-19, the preparations for Brexit and how we have been advancing infrastructure projects since 2018 under the national development plan.  This is about the readiness of the State now and for the future.<br\/><br\/>The 2019 gross expenditure of the OPW was &euro;455 million.  In addition to the expenditure on Vote 13, the OPW acts as an agent, undertaking work on behalf<br\/><br\/>of other Government Departments and agencies.  Expenditure on this activity in 2019 was a further &euro;112 million.  This appears as a charge on the accounts of the client organisations.<br\/><br\/>Exchequer funding to the OPW supports two core programmes of work - flood risk management and estate management including heritage services.<b><font color=\"#FF0000\">  <\/font><\/b>Almost &euro;100 million was invested in flood risk management in 2019.  The OPW continues to implement a suite of infrastructural and other measures to mitigate the impact of flooding to people, homes, properties and businesses.  More than 300 communities around the country, home to approximately 3 million citizens, will benefit from the current, ten year, investment programme.  This investment is providing tangible social and economic benefits to people, communities and the State.<br\/><br\/>Some &euro;356 million was invested in estate management.  This is one of the largest and certainly the most wide-ranging property portfolios in the State.  It includes some 2,500 properties, managed as a shared service for more than 80 Government bodies in a very complex working environment.  This has become more important for the State in that the OPW will play a key role in the design and delivery of the &ldquo;workplace of the future&rdquo;.  That future will clearly be different in the aftermath of this pandemic and that future will come to pass much sooner than any of us would have anticipated a year ago.<br\/><br\/>In order to carry out its functions, the OPW uses a mix of in-house expertise and outsourced services contracted through a variety of appropriate public procurement channels including the measured-term contract to which the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General refers.  The rationale for procuring works through the measured-term contract is that it represents the most efficient mechanism for the delivery of repair, maintenance and small works across a diverse portfolio of some 600 properties in Dublin.  The demand was underestimated when establishing the size of the contract, with the result that many more individual projects were undertaken than had been originally anticipated.<br\/><br\/>The contract was competitively tendered and the main contractor subsequently sub-contracted many of the labour intensive works to 60 or so small to medium size enterprises.  The OPW consistently supports Government initiatives to promote SME participation in public procurement.  Work was devolved across multiple suppliers within the framework of a pre-tendered contract that provides certainty around standards and individual job costs.  This type of &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo; contract enabled the OPW to provide ongoing, essential and emergency services for public bodies in a cost effective manner whilst safeguarding public assets.<br\/><br\/>Brexit is a prime example of the OPW being called upon to carry out essential works for Government in an emergency.  At the Government's request, the OPW developed facilities in Dublin Airport, Dublin Port, and Rosslare Europort which started as nine projects in 2019 and eventually grew to 28 projects for four Departments, so that the country is prepared for the UK leaving the customs union and Single Market next month.  Although never foreseen for projects of this scale, the measured-term contract allowed for the delivery of this infrastructure, by the relevant deadlines while controlling cost and ensuring value.  <br\/><br\/>I fully acknowledge the issues identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General and have taken on board his recommendations.  The report refers to procurement and contract<br\/><br\/>management issues and I assure the committee that the OPW is committed to being fully compliant in these areas while also ensuring value for money and efficiency for the State in delivering essential services.<br\/><br\/>If I may, I would like to thank my colleagues in the office for their work in delivering services during the Covid-19 pandemic.  I thank the Chairman and the committee members for its time and the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for their work and recommendations.

The OPW leases the office premises in Miesian Plaza on Baggot Street, mainly to accommodate the Departments of Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  That contracted annual rent is approximately &euro;10 million.  Total commitment is &euro;231.7 million over 25 years.  It is reported that there has been an overpayment in the region of &euro;10 million to the landlord.  I know there has been ongoing correspondence between the OPW and the landlord.

It was completed and moved into in 2017.  The project has been a great success but as the Deputy says, there was an issue with the code used for the measurement of the area, which led to a discrepancy in the final rent of &euro;344,000 per annum.  This is still under discussion between the OPW and the landlord, Remley Developments.  This matter was dealt with in a chapter of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in 2017 and was fully discussed in the Committee of Public Accounts in 2018.<\/p> <p>  There has been correspondence since and there is an ongoing discussion.  I met senior members of Remley Developments at the beginning of this year.  There was an amicable meeting.  It is a reputable landlord.  I am optimistic that we will be able to resolve this without resorting to legal action.  We have legal advice on the position.  I had hoped it would be resolved by now but with everything going on, it has not been.  It is a 25 year lease.  There will be rent reviews.  We will do work on the building as tenants and the landlord will work on it.  There will then be close of the lease at the end of 25 years and then reinstatement.  There will be much interaction between the tenant and the landlord.  This will not go away.  I intend to make sure that the public is done right by on this occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1605112200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Obviously &euro;10 million is a lot of money and there is significant concern.

The relevant scheme is a &euro;10 million project that includes a diversion of 1.3 km.  Probably eight Ministers have visited the area at this stage.

The overall scheme has been delayed for a variety of reasons.  I think that everybody involved is seized of the urgency of implementing a solution.  As has already been mentioned, there were significant environmental challenges as we went through the design of the scheme.  There was a karst landscape which had to be looked at in significant detail so that we could make sure that the modelling and design of the solution was workable.  That took a lot of time because, as I said, there were significant environmental challenges.<\/p> <p>  The scheme went to exhibition in 2018.  It was then referred to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is the statutory process when we do schemes under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform does what is known as \"confirm\" the schemes.  That is legal approval and, effectively, the planning process for that type of scheme.  There was a delay in that process because new EU environmental regulations had to be transposed into Irish law so that has slowed down the confirmation process.<\/p> <p>  The scheme was submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who contracted in a series of consultants, as required under the new regulations.  They carried out an environmental assessment on the scheme and then sought further information from the OPW, which we passed back in October of this year.  Subject to the consultants being satisfied with that information and the scheme being confirmed, we hope to start construction in 2021.  While it has been delayed, we are seeing light at the end of the tunnel and will be able to progress the scheme.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned our direct labour force.  We have looked at using that.  It is a scarce but skilled resource that we use on particularly challenging projects.  It does save time.  That is still under consideration in terms of the actual form of construction that we are going to use on this project.<\/p> <p>  On the question of interim solutions, the Deputy may be aware that there is a scheme under which we provide local authorities with funding to do minor works to alleviate pressing issues.  We are very amenable to doing that in this area.  We have also funded Mayo County Council to provide individual property protection to a range of impacted homes.<\/p><p>Flood gates have been installed at approximately 100 houses in that area and they are having a benefit.<\/p><p> We are progressing overall and the confirmation process should be completed shortly.

On the overall schemes, there is much frustration and disappointment about the length of time it takes to carry out surveys, studies, examination of the sites and the work on the contracts and the tenders.  I am talking about the period from when the work starts to seeing the actual physical work commence.  The time from when the preparatory work, to use that term, begins, which includes all of that, to when the physical works commence is a huge frustration for people.  We get circulars saying that such and such a scheme is starting.  Some of this has been articulated by Deputy Colm Burke but it is about the time that elapses between that preparatory work and actually starting the works and spending money.  I understand that environmental impact assessments, EIAs, have to be done and that there are many requirements on the OPW but the chairman might deal with that.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask about some specific schemes.  With regard to the Mountmellick scheme, Mountmellick suffered very badly three years ago as a result of very severe flooding.  Many houses and businesses were impacted.  An excellent engineer in Laois County Council, Paul McLoughlin, is heading up that project but the length of time it takes to get from the starting blocks to the physical works being done seems to be three, three and a half or even four years.

A weir was constructed there.  There were two weirs.  One of them was taken out.  The remaining one is causing problems.  It is increasing the water levels in the river by about 1 m to 1.2 m.  I find it hard to understand the value for money argument because many of the people living in Patrick Street and in Dunne's Terrace, in Mountrath, had to abandon their houses so they would say it does represent value for money.

That is one issue I wish to raise.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is totally different and concerns Glanmire Garda station.  The OPW agreed to purchase the building in 2011 and it was not closed until 2017 and 2018.  Interest was paid, however, for more than six years.  My understanding is that a binding contract was signed by both the vendors and the State, which was the purchaser, yet it went to a full High Court hearing.  The High Court held against the State.  The building was bought and we paid out more than &euro;360,000 between legal costs and interest on a building that only cost &euro;760,000.  In other words, we paid an additional 50% on top of the purchase price because someone decided there was no contract.  I am aware the OPW did not make that decision but why decide not to go ahead with a purchase then six years later go ahead with it and deliver the Garda station?

I will ask Mr. McMahon to comment on that in a moment.<\/p> <p>  I will come to the Deputy's first question which was on the Cork city flood relief scheme and Morrison's Island.  He is perfectly correct that Morrison's Island is the first element of a large scheme.  It is being progressed by Cork City Council with the OPW.  It has received planning and has been approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  To our disappointment, a judicial review has been requested by the Save Cork City group.  We are, therefore, at the mercy of the judicial system as to whether or when that will be heard and how long it will take.  We have just gone through a similar process in County Kildare, which delayed the scheme by two full years.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, who has responsibility for the OPW and flood relief, has asked Save Cork City to consider withdrawing that judicial review in the interests of the wider community.  Business people in Cork have echoed that, as has Cork County Council.  As an official, my interest is to proceed with the work.  I met the Save Cork City group along with the then Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran.<\/p> <p>  I believe it is time to go ahead.  We have addressed Save Cork City openly and responsibly and taken all its concerns seriously and answered them all one by one.  They are passionate people.  I respect all those people who hold passionate views on things but really, it is time to proceed with that.  We will engage wholeheartedly with that and any other group when we come to the next phase.  That is only phase 1.  It is a huge project all the way from Ballincollig down to the sea in Cork.  It will cost &euro;140 million in total.  It is enormous.  It is the biggest flood relief project in the State and to some extent, the most important in terms of the risk of property and to people.  We all saw what happened in 2009.  It was a miracle lives were not lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111100002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1605112200,"counter":286,"content":"<p>And again recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111100002#M00500","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605112200,"counter":287,"content":"<p>And again, recently, what happened to business people.

I propose that the committee be given a briefing on the issue of vaccines.  Two issues arise.  One is the matter of vaccines for Covid.  We will receive part of whatever number of vaccines the European Commission procures but it is important the committee is briefed on how that is going to work and how many doses we expect to get this year, if any, and next year.  I would like a briefing on that.<\/p> <p>  We might put some questions to the HSE today with regard to my second point, which is that there have been some concerns and issues with regard to the flu vaccine.  I do not believe for a second that any doses of any vaccines are missing.  That is not the case.  There is a difference between the number distributed and the number administered.  There is concern as to who is getting these doses and whether the vulnerable are being protected.  We need to get a handle on that.  The problem with these meetings is that members only have ten minutes in which to raise many issues.  We cannot raise everything when either the Minister or the HSE is before us.  It would be worthwhile for the committee to hold a session on the issue of vaccines which would include the Covid vaccines, the flu vaccine and the pneumonia vaccine, of which there appears to be a shortage.<\/p> <p>  The uptake of the flu vaccine this year has been unreal.  It is massive and well above what it was last year.  While there has been a 20% increase in the number of doses, there is still not enough to satisfy the demand.

In the knowledge that we would be delivering services within a Covid-19 environment until after the development of a vaccine or cure, we published a strategic framework for service continuity.  The framework outlines our key objectives, including the resumption of services, the retention of surge capacity and the adoption of new technologies.  Our winter plan builds on this framework and aims to ensure that we are as prepared as possible for the anticipated seasonal pressures, which this year will be more challenging than ever.<\/p> <p>  We have been entrusted with &euro;600 million in order to achieve these objectives which is the biggest allocation ever made for a winter plan.  We are committed to investing this money in the places where it will have maximum impact.<\/p> <p>  Our core objectives can be succinctly summarised.  First, we aim to avoid congestion in our hospitals.  Second, we will resource community services to deliver more care than ever before.  Third, we will ensure that lines of communication between these two pillars of our health system, acute and community, are seamless.  Integration of services has always been problematic in practice.  However, one of the few positive things to emerge from the pandemic is our capacity to operate as a whole system when the circumstances require it.  Additional key priorities include supporting nursing homes, strengthening public health capacity and minimising the impacts of Covid-19 on our cancer services, including screening services.<\/p> <p>  Winter funding will only get us so far.  Our success is also heavily predicated on the public continuing to take the necessary precautions as per public health advice and continuing the downward trend in community transmission of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  A community first approach to the delivery of care will be central to delivering safe, efficient and effective services through winter and beyond.  We are making substantial investment in reorienting our services into the community through: 4.7 million additional home support hours; enhanced home support packages; community specialist teams in 11 centres focused on older persons and chronic disease care; 530 community intermediate care and 631 enhanced community rehabilitation beds; GP access to more than 79,000 diagnostic procedures; enhanced homelessness supports; and making the flu vaccine available to staff and to the public.<\/p> <p>  With regard to our acute capacity, at the end of 2019, we had 10,988 inpatient beds, including 255 critical care beds.<\/p><p>The 2021 Estimates provide funding for the following beds on an ongoing basis: 1,146 incremental beds in acute hospitals; 66 critical care beds; and 135 sub-acute beds.  The arrangement with private hospitals will also allow us to augment our existing approaches to Covid-19 and non-Covid pathways, particularly in the event of a surge in hospitalisations.  Provision is also being made for additional consultants, the extension of renal dialysis satellite stations and home dialysis projects and for the use of new technologies in endoscopy.  The waiting lists have stabilised, albeit at a much higher level.  Extra resources for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, will allow for additional insourced and outsourced activities to tackle waiting lists.  Steady progress is also being made in the resumption of elective activity and the latest data show that we are almost in an equivalent position to the corresponding period in 2019.<\/p><p> I will inform the committee of the financial position.  The HSE received its annual letter of determination 2021 on 4 November and is now engaged in the finalisation of the 2021 national service plan.  In summary terms, the scale of the additional investment in the health service in 2021 is unprecedented when viewed in the context of any previous single year.  Including moneys held back initially by the Department of Health, the national service plan 2021 revenue net expenditure allocation is &euro;3,534 million or 21% above the national service plan 2020 allocation of just over &euro;17 billion.  The 2021 capital allocation is also more than 20% ahead of the 2020 level.  This investment reflects a strengthened trust and confidence in the HSE and how our staff have mobilised and responded to the many challenges of this pandemic to date.  We want to build on this response so far, so it becomes the foundation of a sustained and lasting improvement in our health and social care services of which we can all be proud.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#A01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Thank you.

There are always long-term challenges and some seemingly ever-present ones.  Then there are sudden ones such as Covid-19.  The winter planning is usually based on the previous winter, and the first couple of weeks of January are always the pinch point.  What in particular will be done this year as opposed to other years?<\/p> <p>  There are 33,000 extra procedures promised.  What is the role of private hospitals there?  There was some concern about the previous agreement, but the agreement with private hospitals earlier in the year definitely saved lives.  The most important criterion in respect of healthcare is the number of lives saved.  I welcome the 33,000 procedures that have been identified.  Is it ambitious?  What impact has Covid-19 had on the screening programmes?  Have the greatly reduced numbers of procedures been factored into these figures?  Regarding the opening and operating hours of clinics, such as endoscopy clinics, if they could be increased from nine to 12 or even 15 hours, serious inroads could be made into waiting lists.  Is that factored in here as well?<\/p> <p>  In primary care, there is an allocation which is a new feature of the winter plan.  Mr. Reid referred to community assessment hubs.  Where are these to be located or is that identified?  What are the criteria for deciding these and what will be the role of GPs and the buy-in of GPs in these areas, because there has been concern about primary care centres?  I note the report this morning of concern that there will be shortages in flu vaccines.  GPs say there will not be enough vaccines for high-risk categories of patients.  Perhaps Mr. Reid will clarify the current status of flu vaccine stocks.<\/p> <p>  Finally, with regard to additional capacity, obviously this will be dependent on recruitment.  There are commitments, but are the numbers of nurses available?  Are nurses and staff available to provide that additional capacity?  It is dependent on recruitment and, in some cases, on physical infrastructure.  Unfortunately, the experience in Galway on certain issues, such as the theatres in Merlin Park which had a leaking roof for three years and the unbearable delays in planning permission being lodged for a new emergency department, would question the ability to deliver such projects.  It is frustrating that when a not-fit-for-purpose structure for the emergency department in Galway is identified there are delays in that regard.  I have concerns about that.<\/p> <p>  Again, I thank the team and look forward to the replies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#B00300","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I will try to be brief and will call on some of my colleagues to comment as well.  First, I thank the Senator for his opening comments, which are appreciated by all our teams.<\/p> <p>  Second, in terms of what will be different in the first couple of weeks in January, it is particularly about what will be different as part of the overall approach to the winter plan and the significant extra investment, which Ms O'Connor can comment on briefly.  There is our community investment, community investment teams, integrated teams and multidisciplinary teams working with our acute teams and with our community.  There is a particular focus on home first and keeping people at home, but there is also investment in our hospitals in terms of emergency departments and having key decision makers available to make decisions.  Separately, we have established this year much stronger working processes and pathways with GPs in primary care.  The significant difference is our particular and strong focus on the investment in communities, especially on home first for elderly care.  There are many new integrated processes between the acute system and the community system.  However, I will call on Ms O'Connor shortly to comment on it.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the role of private hospitals, they will play a role.  We have carried out a procurement process for private hospital groups.  It is different from the first phase.  There are two aspects to it.  First, we already have a budget of &euro;25 million, which some of the hospitals are drawing down for both diagnostics and services.  Second, we have concluded a procurement process for a number of private hospitals to engage with us on, and we are finalising those in terms of some mini tenders which will be local, operated between the public hospitals and private hospitals for certain diagnostics and services.  Part of that would include diagnostics access for GPs in the community.  Again, that will be very different.<\/p> <p>  On the screening processes, in July we launched our outline plan for the relaunch of our four key screening services.  That is mapped out and all of those have recommenced.  At various levels they will start to call on people on a priority basis.  I will not go through each of the programmes, but our winter plan has approximately &euro;2.7 million to invest, particularly in the rapid access clinic.  Our clinics have always been open but we are concerned to ensure that people who are symptomatic and need care come through.  There is an extra investment in resources.  There is also an extra investment in infection control processes for our screening services.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Dr. Henry or Mr. Woods to comment on the endoscopy clinics, but some of it is referenced in our winter plan.  There are some new innovations in terms of endoscopy clinics and, indeed, endoscopy capsules that will be spread out to further hospitals as part of an acceleration plan for endoscopy clinics.<\/p> <p>  On community assessment hubs, the plan facilitates a scale up from the current seven to approximately 20.  We will monitor this closely.  It is a process with good buy-in from GPs.  The principle is to assess respiratory illness and try to filter out people who may need to go to a hospital, people who do not and people who can referred to other pathways.  It worked very well for us during the Covid pandemic.  The demand is not very high at present, so we will assess and monitor the best use of those clinics.  However, there is good buy-in from GPs so far.<\/p> <p>  To deal briefly with vaccines, Dr. Henry was talking about this earlier this morning.  We have now distributed almost 1.3 million vaccinations.  We have distributed more as of this week than we did for all of the flu season last year.  It is about 20% up on our total delivery and order.  There is significant demand and we want to make sure it is prioritised.  That was the principle of Dr. Henry's letter earlier this week, that it is prioritised for the groups who are defined as priority.<\/p><p>There is, however, very significant demand for private capacity for flu vaccine injections, and while that is under great pressure too, we are nonetheless significantly up on our volumes compared with last year.  There are no missing vaccines.  There is always a lag of GPs registering with the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, for reimbursement but we want to see where the allocation is and how to prioritise the final distribution.<\/p><p> Recruitment will be a big challenge.  We have recruited a net increase on our workforce this year of more than 5,000 resources, 1,600 of whom are nurses and 150 of whom are consultants.  There are significant recruitment campaigns for each grade, although it will be a very significant challenge because there is a worldwide demand for healthcare workers.  We have started that process and about 600 nurses from an international recruitment campaign are part of the process.  As graduates come through this year, that will provide another 1,200 whole-time equivalents in the system.<\/p><p> With the Chairman's agreement, I might ask Ms O'Connor to make a brief comment, followed by Dr. Henry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":337,"content":"<p>On the winter planning, the Senator is absolutely correct.  We usually see a big surge on the first few days of January once GP clinics reopen fully and people start attending and are referred to hospitals.  The critical issue for us in respect of emergency departments and hospitals in particular relates to the flow that is created.  Many people attending will be people who are either older or with chronic disease, which is why we have focused in our winter plan on the development of specific initiatives to support people to stay at home.  I refer not just to home support, which is a significant investment and especially so in the first quarter, but also to integrated specialist teams for older persons and chronic disease management whom GPs can work with and access.<\/p> <p>  From our perspective, we want to ensure that people who attend an emergency department are turned around in order that as many people as possible can go home and be supported through our intervention teams and outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy, OPAT, programme.  A range of initiatives are focused entirely on reducing the need for people to attend the emergency department or, if they attend, to be treated in the emergency department and discharged.  If such people require admission, the focus is on them being seen as quickly as possible through the hospital system, with good options at the end of their pathway of care from the hospital back out to the community and all those supports.  More than half the funding in the winter plan this year is targeted at community investment, which is to avoid that congestion in January that we experienced in previous years.  We have been building on the learning from previous years as to what has worked and what we will be aiming for in January next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":338,"content":"<p>We have run out of time for this session, so other guests who wish to contribute might wait until later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#C00300","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Our guests will be aware we are under tight time constraints, so I would appreciate if our guests can respond to my questions as succinctly as they can.

Changing the model of care in order that more people are seen in the community by multidisciplinary teams is the way to address this.  That will happen in areas such as cardiology and respiratory medicine, which will help address these lists.  Significant initiatives, arising from the Covid response, are under way to do that.  I should have highlighted earlier that the advent of virtual clinics as part of the Covid response has significantly assisted in addressing what was, as the Deputy rightly noted, a growth in numbers over recent months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#C02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":356,"content":"<p>None of that answers my question because we need capacity.

In 2016, some 1,875 people had been waiting 18 months, whereas the figure is now 7,963.  I have dealt with a number of other cases that I will put to Mr. Woods.  An elderly woman has been waiting to see a pain specialist for more than two years.   The numbers waiting to see a pain specialist have increased sharply.  The number waiting for pain relief this year is 12,289, while 4,000 patients have been waiting more than 18 months to see a pain specialist.<\/p><p>The number of children undergoing procedures for the treatment of scoliosis has dropped by 29% and the number of oncology procedures has also dropped by 29%.  My point, therefore, is that despite all the spin and the rhetoric about all of the additional beds and staff, year-on-year, inpatient and outpatient waiting times are rising.  Children with scoliosis are still awaiting much longer than they were in previous years for treatment; people are waiting on pain relief across all the specialties; and inpatient and outpatient waiting times are on the increase.  There does not seem to be a plan.  Given that those figures are not good, as Mr. Woods said, and they are going in the wrong direction, what action is going to be taken and how can we reduce those waiting times?  We are told that with Sl&aacute;intecare, people should not be waiting any longer than 12 weeks and yet we have hundreds of thousands of patients waiting more than 18 months simply to get into the system and to see a consultant.

Those beds are in addition to 2019 and not 2020.  That is the reality.  Most of them are already there and have been made permanent.

Therefore, of all these beds that are being promised, is Mr. Reid saying that they will only be opened using existing space or will capital funding be made available to hospitals where they need it, whether it is to build rapid build modular units or physical infrastructure?  Despite all the numbers being thrown out in relation beds and staff levels, the waiting times paint a very different picture.

I thank them for their attendance and for their ongoing work in this very important area.  I just want to talk for a few moments about one of those few positives that came out of Covid, and that is the acceleration of some elements of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Earlier in the year, Mr. Reid referred to what was happening as \"Sl&aacute;intecare on speed\".  It is a very welcome development that there is a significant shift of activity away from hospitals to the community, which is what we should be aiming for anyway.<\/p> <p>  I want to make one point and then ask a question.  The point I would make about it is that part and parcel of Sl&aacute;intecare is the restructuring of the HSE combined with regional management and greater levels of accountability.  I understand why the HSE had to park that earlier in the year and all of the focus was on responding to Covid.  That is absolutely understandable.  However, I made this point to the Minister last week and I want to make it to the witnesses today that I would strongly urge them to resume that restructuring reform programme relating to the structure of the HSE, and to do that as early as possible in the new year.<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to all of that work that is going on in shifting activity to the community, which is very welcome work.  My concern is, though, about those areas, in my own constituency, as I wrote to Mr. Reid last week, but also in many other parts of urban and rural Ireland, where there is a poor level of GP provision.  We know from various research that has been done that areas with the greatest level of health need are very often those areas with the poorest provision because of our two-tier system.  Given the shift that is taking place, what work, if any, is being done to ensure that those areas which are very poorly served by general practice, with low numbers of GPs and other primary care staff, have sufficient numbers of GPs?<\/p> <p>  Related to that, obviously, was an earlier commitment to introduce salaried GPs.  It seems that there has been no progress made on that at all.  Related to that as well is the whole question of ensuring the fair allocation of resources.  How does the HSE ensure that that takes place where there is poor provision at the moment?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the budget.  An extra &euro;3.5 billion is provided for the service plan this year.  I do not want the details now but will the CEO send us the schedule of the breakdown of that &euro;3.5 billion in terms of what element is going to Covid and what element is going to increased service provision?<\/p> <p>  My third question relates to the flu vaccine and shortages.  I have been raising this with Mr. Reid since last July.  I was assured at the time that the 1.4 million vaccines order was sufficient to get us up to 90% coverage.  I doubted the figure at the time because it did not make any provision for additional groups or cohorts of people to avail of the vaccine as a health prevention measure.  Why is it that only 1.4 million vaccines were ordered?  Is the HSE now saying to people who are not in the at-risk groups that they cannot have access to the vaccine?  That would be a retrograde step.  Does the CEO accept that insufficient quantities were ordered initially?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#E01500","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I thank the Deputy and her colleagues for their feedback on the health service and our workers.<\/p> <p>  On the acceleration of Sl&aacute;intecare overall, I have just a couple of quick comments.  As tough as Covid has been for the health system, I believe it has given a greater level of confidence to the health system, particularly around the area of integration.  It has given a whole new level of care pathways so that we do actually invest in the community.  Deputy Cullinane was talking earlier on about the capacity in the hospital system, and it is an issue, but we know a major part of that solution is in the community service.  I know Deputy Shortall has been key in leading that whole report.<\/p> <p>  Specifically on the Deputy's point around regional management and prioritisation, that is ultimately a priority in terms of Government policy.  The two elements of Sl&aacute;intecare were regions and, separately, the significant focus on services.  We certainly would be saying for now to continue the significant focus on services, but regions are still part of the Government policy, which we are implementing.<\/p><p> On the provision of GP services generally, that is a concern for me and for the health system.  Areas of social deprivation suffer most in that context.  In some hospitals where we see many people attending accident and emergency departments, that is largely down to areas where there is social deprivation and that do not have access to GPs and or that pathway.  That is a concern for us.  Regarding what would make the situation better, certainly the pipeline of GPs coming through the system has improved.  Dr. Henry might also talk about that element.  We regularly talk to representatives of the ICGP about how we, as a State, can improve the pipeline of GPs coming through training.  It has been the experience, however, even during Covid-19, that areas of social deprivation suffer more in the context of health systems.

There was much emphasis on lifestyle and supporting patients.  Chronic illness is a large spectrum.  Some people have a management plan that is working for them, but there are also more complex cases.  A modified and structured chronic disease management programme has been issued by the HSE.  I would like to unpack that in respect of the winter plan, however.

If we look at chronic disease management as a spectrum without picking any one illness, we will see that it runs from prevention, in the first place, and promotion, to early intervention and what we call secondary prevention, which means that if somebody has an established disease such as diabetes, we treat blood pressure and make earlier interventions before things become really serious, to the end of the spectrum, which involves serious illness, hospitalisation and even intensive care and end-of-life care.  Deputy Shortall will be aware of this information because it is a theme in Sl&aacute;intecare.  For too long, we have invested in the right side of the spectrum, namely, in the intensive side of care, in hospitalisation and in specialist care.  This is unsustainable.  When we look at the profile of chronic disease in Ireland and other western countries, we can see an epidemic of chronic disease, where upwards of 70% or 80% of GP consultations are with people with chronic disease, as well as up to 40% of attendances at accident and emergency departments.<\/p> <p>  What we are trying to do with this programme is to build on what has been essentially pilot work in setting up networks of care across the roughly 96 community care networks in Ireland.  We want to expand them rapidly, beyond what has been a relatively small number to date, so they can provide loops, circuits and episodes of care that do not go through acute hospitals.  We want to intervene and address problems earlier, such as blood pressure, and foot problems in people with diabetes, for example, instead of having a line of defence which is very deep and at hospital level.  This is, therefore, a capacity-building exercise.  It is a slow game, but it is essential to invest in this aspect now so that we do not have to depend continually on hospitals to deal with that right side of the spectrum of chronic disease management, which is the intensive and resource-heavy side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#F02100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I completely agree around the move towards community care and that first side of the spectrum.

The spectrum of interventions range from screening to opportunistic intervention, to medication review to blood pressure measurement, to other actions taken at that left side of the spectrum which allow people with chronic disease to stay healthier, live healthier and have more accurately prescribed and suitable medications, and hopefully never to rely on hospitalisation if they become more ill.

As I understand it, once a person gets on the list for the cataract procedure there is no delay.  The problem is getting on the list for the procedure and the delay in appointments to see patients.  In view of the fact that buses are still going to Northern Ireland for cataract procedures under the treatment abroad fund, even during the lockdown, should priority be given to making appointments for people to be assessed, put on the list and then dealt with?  For instance, a total of 133 people are on the waiting list at South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital, 90 of whom have been waiting three months.

In some parts of the country, we employ home support workers directly, and in other parts, we rely on funded agencies.  Within our winter plan we have a significant dependency on home support.  In terms of the Homes First model, which is referenced within the winter plan, it is critical for us that we maintain and significantly increase the level of home support.  We are aware that over the last six months the home support levels dropped off.  From April to June, we reduced our home support by approximately 22% so we saw a drop-off of approximately 11,500 clients.  Some of that was at the client's own request in terms of having people coming into his or her home and some were reduced in terms of low-priority provision from our perspective.  That number has reduced to 5,000 people so we are now bringing the level of home support back up.  In some parts of the country, we see the challenge some agencies have in terms of securing sufficient workers.  I am aware that a number of those agencies have proactive recruitment campaigns which include full training for the role and we are engaging with them.<\/p> <p>  In terms of that dependency in our winter plan, our local community health organisations, CHOs, have been working with the home support providers to prepare for this significant increase.

The agencies are being challenged in terms of, for example, their insurance policies as they relate to communicable diseases.  There are other challenges for these agencies at the minute which we are trying to work through with them.  They are real challenges.  We are looking at how we recruit home support workers while, critically, enabling the other agencies on which we will rely.  There should be no difference in terms of weekend cover.  If a need is identified for home support, that should be available at all the times it is required.

It has not been an easy job.  I will focus on two areas.  I know a few questions have been asked about the flu vaccine but I will swing back to it if that is all right.  There was a lot of coverage today and I am sure everyone's notifications were going off with news notifications.  Obviously, the HSE has refuted the claims that supplies have gone missing but there is coverage around holding back doses until it is assessed where they are needed.  I am a bit curious about the process by which this will be decided.  It is my understanding that the HSE takes its lead on this issue based on information supplied by GPs.  This is inputted from GP surgeries and that is how the HSE will be informed in this regard.  This is put in in hard copy.  I have heard from a number of GPs who have raised concerns around this process.  It requires many hours of administration because there is no swift online system to do this.  As has been noted, many GPs do not do the paperwork patient by patient as it is very time consuming.  I know one GP who has had to hire extra staff simply to help with the administration associated with rolling out the flu vaccine this year, which I think we can agree is probably a slightly crazy use of resources when we are so tied for resources.  Can the witnesses explain why in 2020 we still require GPs to do this in this way and why a swift online system of registering those who have received the flu vaccine is not yet in place?  When I reflect on the GP who had to take on an extra person, I see that this form was handled four times - administration to the GP, back to the patient and back to administration to submit for payment.  This seems wrong both from infection control and financial perspectives.  If the information from GPs is going to be used to determine where the next round of flu vaccines will be sent, and right now, perhaps GPs have yet to even send their information to the HSE and might be doing it in bulk, using this administration system to decide where to send the last round of doses might not be a good statistics exercise.<\/p> <p>  Could the witnesses comment on concerns that private patients are getting the flu vaccine?  Regardless of whether someone is a private or public patient, if one is vulnerable, one is vulnerable.  What is the HSE doing to mitigate against this?  Is there a contingency plan for buy more quantities of the flu vaccine if areas have been under-supplied due to this onerous system of registering the flu vaccine?  I will ask my second question after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#J00300","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":434,"content":"<p>It has always been the case that GPs had apply for reimbursement after the vaccine had been administered.  Clearly any system that would improve the timeliness and efficiency of this is something we want to promote.  We are constantly talking to the GP community through the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, about how we can support GPs in this important work.<\/p> <p>  As regards holding back, this has been the practice over the past few years.  There has been a greater focus on it this year because of the great uptake of the vaccine, which is very welcome.  I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to reiterate that no vaccine has disappeared.  We are getting mixed reports from some GPs saying that they have enough vaccine for the at-risk groups - for which this vaccine is intended and prioritised - and other GPs, as the Senator correctly noted, saying that they are short.  We want to find out where we can direct the remaining 50,000 to those who need it for priority groups.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator is absolutely right; no distinction is made between public, private or otherwise.  To reiterate the answer I gave to Deputy Shortall, the only criterion relates to at-risk groups in line with what the WHO advises and our assessment as to where this valuable resource should be directed.

The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has said that it has been in discussion with the Department of Health but there does not appear to be any movement on this issue.  I am being contacted by student nurses who are getting more and more distressed about the situation.  As was rightly pointed out, it is not just about student nurses but all healthcare workers in training.  Could someone offer some commentary?  Do the witnesses believe student nurses and other healthcare workers in training should be paid for their time, for example, that on a sliding scale, as is done for other professions in training?  We see that with garda&iacute; and apprenticeships.  Do the witnesses think they should be paid because nobody is giving an answer?  I think they should be paid and the nurses and students in training think they should be paid.  If these student trainees were taken out of the system, would the system be able to function?  If student nurses were taken off the wards today, would the wards be able to function?  If that is the case, is it not right that they should be paid?

It is clinical training.  Students have certain rules and responsibilities that are restricted in line with their experience and level of training.  There are many medical students who work, particularly in the last year or two of their training, and provide critical service.  In terms of whether they should be paid, I do not know.  There are many students, and I presume there are many outside the healthcare sector, who would feel that they play a vital role and indeed they do but the decision in terms of payment is one that, unfortunately, is larger than the HSE because of the implications and ramifications across sectors.

It is more important for us to have secured permanent funding to deliver and develop teams.<\/p><p>From our perspective, the priority is, of course, to be able to provide early access to people in terms of mental health.  We have worked throughout Covid to develop information and supports to people at the lowest level of complexity.  We often focus on our very specialist mental health services for people who attend our specialist teams.  However, we know there has been a gap at primary care level in terms of supporting the mental health needs of the population.  We have developed a psychosocial framework that we hope to launch over the coming week or two in terms of supporting the general population, supporting people who attend services and, critically, supporting our staff.

Those that can be answered can be answered and the others that might have to be held over can be answered by way of written reply.<\/p> <p>  First, of the 2,000 staff currently out on sick leave due to Covid or Covid-related issues, what is the breakdown of those between medical staff, nursing staff and administrative staff?  What is the number of GP appointments outstanding throughout the country?  How many GP vacancies where there at the beginning of the year and how many are now filled or being filled?  I know there are some in Kildare so I would appreciate a response on that.<\/p> <p>  The next question is an important one, namely, how do we handle or prevent the next surge?  That is the critical question we all want to know the answer to.  It is as simple as this.  If another surge comes, the economic impact is going to be much more severe than anything experienced heretofore.  It is repeating the same issue.  The question I am trying to get at is this.  Can we prepare now for that possible eventuality and prevent it by way of taking particular measures or putting a particular emphasis on certain of the restrictions without having to go into a lockdown when we come to the end of the current level 5 restrictions?<\/p> <p>  Our local hospital in Naas has ceased non-essential elective services as of today arising from staff shortages and staff being out on Covid-related leave.  The question is how many staff have been affected by Covid and how many are affected currently, and how many are medical staff, nursing staff or administrative staff.<\/p> <p>  My next question is a continuation of an issue we often discuss at these committee meetings.  Regarding the home care packages that are being prepared and that we are going to be relying upon very much throughout the winter, to what degree is it intended to regulate standards for those providing them in the private sector and the public sector?  To have an equal standard across the board is important, and that applies without prejudice to anybody or anything.<\/p> <p>  My last question relates to the capital programme for Naas General Hospital.  How is the proposed extension coming along?  Is it being moved forward and can we rely on it arriving within a reasonable time to ensure we make progress?

We saw an improvement last year in the pipeline of GPs coming through from training colleges, and that is one thing we want to keep going.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the prevention of the next surge, I will make some brief comments.  Obviously, there has been learning both from what happened in the first phase and what is happening in this phase.  One of the strongest messages is that the public health measures are the strongest first line of defence.  Quite often, we talk about building hospital capacity and ICU capacity, which is important, and we talk about building our testing and tracing capacity, and they are important.  However, our first line of defence is our public health measures and what we, as individuals and a society, take on board.  There are learnings from the first phase, where we exited and the economy opened up in May, June and July, and then we saw a significant increase in August, September and particularly in October.  The one thing that holds true, as we look forward to the next phase, is the public health measures around social distancing, infection prevention and control, how we mix with our families and how many households we mix between.  Those are the part of our measures that will remain very consistent and strong, regardless of what level the economy is at or what level the Government decides we are in.

Mr. Reid was talking in terms of minimising the impact of Covid on the cancer services and screening.  In the final minute or two, he might expand on how that his happening.  The big message people want to hear is reassurance that we are learning from the mistakes that have been made in the past and we will do things differently.  I refer particularly to mistakes that were made early on in this Covid pandemic, to the difficulty to date of a big organisation showing flexibility and changing in midstream and to some of the things that are not working.  People want to hear that the HSE is capable of doing that and that we are learning, as I say, from mistakes in the past.  I, again, thank the witnesses for all their contributions here this morning.  Mr. Reid might sum up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#M01500","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>If I can, I will quickly respond on the cancer screening services.  I was making the extra focus, not the distinction, that we have also in terms of rapid access clinics.  Positively, we have seen our rapid access clinics restored to a much stronger level and part of our winter investment is to support them again.  There is &euro;2.3 million for our rapid access clinics.<\/p> <p>  Separate to that are four major screening programmes.  The Senator was pitching on one of them there, namely the diabetic retina screening.  The others, BreastCheck, BowelCheck and CervicalCheck, have all been restored.  Obviously, some are more challenged than others.  For instance, BreastCheck, because we must put in place many infection prevention and control measures, is not as efficient as it would have been, but we are providing extra resources in order that we get back to the reasonable levels we desire and can sustain.  Obviously, our key message to the public in this regard is that if someone has symptoms, he or she should please come forward.  I would separate that out from the screening programmes, which are, in essence, testing healthy populations to get early signals.<\/p> <p>  Specifically, on the learnings from the first phase, we in the HSE have been very open, and so we should be, to what learnings can we take from each phase.  From me, here are a few brief reflections on the first phase.  Obviously, in the nursing homes and long-term care for older people, we all have to stand back and ask what could have been done differently.  There have been many learnings on that.  One certainly is that as the virus presented itself and affected people who were asymptomatic, once it got in it caused a huge risk across the nursing home setting.  That is one that we built some more protections on in this phase.  Certainly, that had to be a huge learning for all of us.<\/p> <p>  There was a second learning from nursing homes.<\/p><p>Congregated settings are not ideal and not the solution for the future in terms of long-term care, particularly for vulnerable groups and older people.  Ultimately, that is a long process of change but it is not the way we would organise for a pandemic because one is at higher risk.<\/p><p> The third point from my perspective is that as we look into the utilisation of private hospitals, this time we will do it in a very different way.  That is not to say it was wrong.  We all watched what was happening in Bergamo, to which some members referred.  We just had to get capacity into the Irish hospital system.  Thankfully, the way the Irish public responded we did not utilise that to the extent we thought we may need it.  Looking back now, we will do it very differently in this phase, which will be very targeted in terms of procurement and some phases.  We have had learnings and we are very open to more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#M01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reid and his colleagues for their helpful engagement with us this morning.

The projected expenditure for the Department in the original estimate was &euro;21.2 billion.  Just over &euro;11 billion of this was voted expenditure, paid through the Exchequer, to provide in the main for social assistance payments to pensioners, people with disabilities, jobseekers, child benefit and so on.  The remaining &euro;10 billion was to provide for social insurance benefits paid for through the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p> <p>  In the subsequent period and prior to those Estimates being voted on by the D&aacute;il, a number of decisions were made which required significant increases in the Department&rsquo;s expenditure.  The introduction of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the Covid-19 illness payment, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, the increase in the payment for qualified adults, and the extension of the free fuel season required additional expenditure over and above that envisaged when the December Revised Estimates were published.  The Revised Estimates, voted by the D&aacute;il in May, provided for expenditure of in excess of &euro;28 billion in 2020, or an increase of &euro;6.8 billion over and above the Estimates published in December.  The Further Revised Estimates being presented to the committee today include several components.<\/p> <p>  Following the formation of this Government, the Taoiseach announced that certain functions would transfer from what was then the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, now the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Employment rights policy and legislation has now transferred to that Department, as well as legislation on the national minimum wage and the Low Pay Commission.<\/p> <p>  There are also a number of EU and international issues for which the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will now assume lead responsibility.  The details of the employment legislation that transferred from my Department following the Government decision are set out in the Employment Affairs and Employment Law (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2020.  The transfer of functions involved 15 pieces of primary legislation in the suite of labour law.  The transfer of funding associated with these functions amounts to just over &euro;1.6 million.  This transfer takes place on a cost-neutral basis between Departments.  My Department&rsquo;s title is now the Department of Social Protection following the transfer of these functions.<\/p> <p>  The Further Revised Estimate also provide for the apportioning of pre-5 August 2020 PUP expenditure between the Social Insurance Fund and Vote 37.  To ensure that neither the Social Insurance Fund nor the Exchequer are disproportionately carrying the costs, the most appropriate way of apportioning the PUP expenditure during the period from March to August is based on the recipient&rsquo;s underlying entitlement to a jobseeker's payment.<\/p><p>Accordingly, just under 60%, or &euro;1.8 billion, of pre-August PUP expenditure will be charged to the Social Insurance Fund, with a corresponding reduction in expenditure on Vote 37. <\/p><p> The legal basis for this reapportionment is contained in the Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020.  Subsequent to the vote on the Department's Estimates on May, a number of significant decisions were made due to the evolving nature of the pandemic and associated policy responses.  These decisions included the extension of the pandemic unemployment payment and the temporary wage subsidy scheme, as well as the introduction of the new employment wage subsidy scheme.  By extension, this has had an impact on the provision for jobseekers, which has been reduced due to the extension of the schemes related to Covid-19. <\/p><p> The July stimulus package contained new measures related to my Department that were not included in the May Estimate.  These measures included the establishment of a new work placement and experience programme, increased public employment service staff capacity, enhanced recruitment subsidies through JobsPlus, additional provision for the back to work enterprise allowance scheme, the extension of the back to education allowance scheme to recipients of the PUP, and additional places on State employment schemes such as community employment and T&uacute;s.  While the bulk of the additional expenditure will take place next year, 2020 expenditure announced in the July stimulus package is included in the Estimate before the committee.<\/p><p> I was pleased to announced that, despite the challenging times we find ourselves in, the Christmas bonus will again be paid at a rate of 100% this December.  Usually, the bonus is paid only to recipients of long-term social welfare payments who are dependent on their social welfare payment for most, or all, of their income for a prolonged period.  The qualifying period for jobseekers to receive the bonus is usually 15 months.  In recognition, however, of the impact the Covid-19 pandemic has had on employment levels, and the sudden financial impact on individuals, the bonus will be paid this year to jobseekers and people who have been in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment for a period of four months or more.  The cost is broken down into more than &euro;131 million for Vote 37 recipients and almost &euro;258 million for Social Insurance Fund recipients, constituting a total of &euro;389 million for the Christmas bonus.  In total, the Further Revised Estimate presented to the committee seeks additional funding of &euro;3.5 billion across a number of subheads to provide funding for the Department to implement decisions taken since the original Estimate was voted.<\/p><p> Finally, as we speak about the Revised Estimates and reflect on the past year, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the extraordinary work by the staff of the Department during this unprecedented year.  As public representatives, we all engage with staff of the Department at local level through our constituency offices and I know that members will agree with me in acknowledging the monumental effort the staff have put in this year at a time of national crisis to ensure that payments are issued to those who need them.  To date, the Department has issued 12 million payments to more than 800,000 people under the pandemic unemployment payment.  Since the start of October, it has processed more than 200,000 applications.  That by itself is the equivalent of processing a full year's claims load in five weeks.  It is sometimes forgotten that the Department and the staff have managed to do this on top of everything else they have had to do as part of their normal, day-to-day work, whether that is processing pensions, disability or carer's allowance applications, or all the other payments across the board.  It can be easy to take for granted that everything will run smoothly and that payments will be there every week, but a great deal of work goes on behind the scenes to make that happen.  It has been a monumental effort across the board by staff in every county to keep the show on the road this year and I acknowledge those efforts.  <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman.  I look forward to hearing members' questions and to working constructively with the committee in what will continue to be challenging times ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#A00600","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

It is on something I have raised with the party leaders both privately and publicly, the issue of the pandemic unemployment payment as against the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the new wage subsidy scheme.  I believe we should do everything possible to ensure that as many employees as possible remain on those latter schemes and that employers are encouraged and supported in that regard.  We should ensure that employees maintain, insofar as is possible, the same level of income through those supports as they had earned when they were in employment because,  as we hopefully transition out of the Covid-19 restrictions and away from the pandemic unemployment payment, we will see challenges arise in getting people back into the workforce.  Employers may not have a full week's work for their employees.  They may only have one or two days a week.  The temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme are far more effective in transitioning people back into employment than the pandemic unemployment payment.<\/p> <p>  As I have said from the outset, that is where the focus should have been from day one.  Unless we address this now, when the payments are at their current rates, and put a structured transition in place, we are only kicking a grenade down the road which will cause great disruption for the families who rely on this income, for employers and for the economy overall.

There were a good few questions.  I will try to go through them.  I will start with the Chairman's.  I agree that it is better that employers take up what was the temporary wage subsidy scheme, now the employment wage subsidy scheme.  The purpose of these schemes is to maintain the link between employers and their employees.  Nobody thought we would be under restrictions for as long as we have been.  It was initially thought they would last six weeks, which was then extended again and again.  The whole point of the schemes was to ensure the workforce would be ready to be mobilised, that contact would be maintained and that the time might be used for reskilling or upskilling staff.  The aim was to make sure that people were ready to go so that the engine could be turned on and that we could get going again whenever the restrictions were lifted.  I want to see that continue.<\/p> <p>  Companies will inevitably hit difficult patches even in normal times.  That is why we introduced the short-time working payment, which allows one to work a certain number of days with one's employer while receiving benefits for the remaining days.  I want to build on that scheme.  We considered it when I was Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and we worked with my predecessor, Senator Doherty, in that regard.  We were looking at how to operate a system whereby companies who may have to lay off staff temporarily due to Brexit could maintain a connection with those staff.  We had done a good deal of work, which is why we were able to bring in the temporary wage subsidy scheme fairly quickly.  We had some work done on that idea at that time.  I agree with the Chairman that this is something with which we need to deal and that we need to look at how it can be improved.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v talked about courses.  If one is doing a short-term part-time course one can stay on the PUP.  I take his point that we cannot consider courses that may take a year to finish.  The PUP is not a permanent social welfare payment.  When this virus is gone, we hope it will no longer be required.  We will then move away from it.  The reason we wanted people to onto the back-to-education allowance was that they would sometimes take up courses of two or three years.<\/p><p>They would then have no payment if they remain on the PUP because we plan to stop that at the end of March.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#E00300","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":505,"content":"<p>Good luck with that one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#F00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>We will look at it again in January to see what the situation is like.

All the pensions are taxable so someone moving from jobseeker's allowance to a contributory or non-contributory pension will be taxed.  We have an erratic and funny system regarding what payments are taxable.  I accept that if someone is on a basic social welfare payment, even if it was taxable, and had nothing else except a means-tested payment, he or she would not pay tax because it is not liable for USC.  None of it is liable for USC.  A person does get the PAYE allowance on social welfare payments as well as the basic personal allowance so I think it is time to sort that one out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#F00600","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":510,"content":"<p>We want the Minister to respond to all the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#F00700","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I appreciate that tax is a matter for Revenue but to be clear, when the PUP was introduced in March, it was introduced under section 202 of the 2005 Act.

The answer is that the person will get the best of both worlds.  It is the best calculation.  If somebody got a job in May or June and was earning more than he or she earned in January or February, his or her PUP will be related to his or her increased salary.  If a person is not happy, he or she can appeal it.  <\/p> <p>  We had a good few arrears on the original PUP.  We have all received calls to our offices.  Staff have worked extremely hard so we hope those arrears will be paid before Christmas and we will get them all up to date.  Again, the priority was to get the payments out.  We then got landed with the increased restrictions so it meant another workload came in.

In a parliamentary reply of 20 October, the Department stated the 2020 CE budget was &euro;364 million, which would provide for approximately 22,750 places, but at the end of September, there were only 19,315 participants, which leaves 3,400-odd vacancies.  That is serious.  I was told that at the end of August, there were 2,270 vacancies in the T&uacute;s programme.  When those two figures are added together, that is 5,000.  I understand that names are not being put forward to the CE companies that have vacancies and that badly need the workers but cannot get them because the names are not being put forward.  I understand that the reason for that relates to JobPath.  I have never favoured JobPath as an approach.  I am very wary of privatising and monetising data because it is a game of just calling everyone in and getting paid.  If the people who would have got a job then get one, JobPath is paid again.  If there were no JobPath, 99% of the people who get jobs would get them in any event.  I am absolutely convinced of that and I had the experience of employing people when I was the manager of a co-operative.  Most people who lose employment find it again, because the world goes around and they get into employment.<\/p> <p>  I agree with what my colleague said about JobPath.  For three reasons, namely, local services, personal well-being and the national good, we should examine the CE and T&uacute;s schemes and ensure that all the places are taken up.  We should have a hierarchy whereby if a vacancy arises, somebody new coming in should have first preference, but if such a person cannot be found, the people already in place should be kept indefinitely because there is nobody else to take the position, particularly in the case of the T&uacute;s scheme.

The detail of it has yet to be announced.  What are the projected numbers for this year?  I know they are more than 10,000 for next year, but is there an opportunity to ramp it up beyond that figure based on demand?  What specific focus is being put on to engage directly with employers to ensure that those places become available?  This could be a very useful scheme if it is structured properly, but it is imperative that there is an incentive for people to take on this experience without being exploited, and an incentive for employers.  They need to be made aware of this particular scheme.<\/p> <p>  Two other issues have been referenced.  First, on the enterprise support grant for people over the age of 66, we have taken a decision where we want people to work longer in the workforce.

Yet these very people in the workforce who are working beyond their 66th birthday were denied the pandemic unemployment payment and the enterprise support grant to get back to work.  They are, therefore, being doubly discriminated against.  It is going to be very difficult to encourage people to remain in the workforce into the future if this is the approach that is being taken to them during a pandemic like the one we are dealing with.<\/p> <p>  Second, I echo the comments of Deputy Carey.  It would be useful if we could get an update on the community employment supervisors' pensions.  This is a very contentious and long-running issue.  I know from my previous discussions at the Cabinet that it is not a black and white issue, but it does need to be resolved and cannot drag on much longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#J00100","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for the questions, and I will do my best to answer them.  On the enterprise support grant and people over the age of 66, the pandemic unemployment payment is payable to people between the ages of 18 and 66.  This is consistent with other social protection schemes payable to people of working age who have lost their employment.  People aged 66 years and over are provided for through the contributory State pension or the means-tested non-contributory State pension.  Anyone over the age of 66, therefore, is getting a payment, whether it is a contributory or non-contributory State pension.  They are entitled to one of those.  A person in receipt of the contributory State pension can retain his or her entire State pension and employment income.  If a person does not have the required number of contributions to receive the maximum rate of the contributory State pension, he or she may qualify for the non-contributory State pension, depending on the person's circumstances.<\/p> <p>  People aged 66 and over may also be entitled to auxiliary supports such as free travel, fuel allowance, household benefits, packages and the living alone allowance.   There are many other supports, therefore, that they are getting.  They can, if they are over 66, apply for the employment wage subsidy scheme.  They are also entitled, if they have a business premises, to get the restart grant and the restart plus grant, and there are a number of other supports.  In terms of social protection, our payments and supports under the pandemic are cut off at the age of 66.  We have looked at it but we are still coming back with the same answer, that they are getting the other payments.  We are trying to be fair and make sure that everybody gets the support, including those who have lost their jobs and have no other form of income.  They have their pensions and all the add-on benefits that come with the pension to help them meet their costs.<\/p><p> Regarding community employment, CE, and T&uacute;s schemes, Deputies will agree with me when I say that CE workers the length and breadth of the country do a wonderful job in the services they provide in local communities.  We have examined CE schemes.  Only a couple of years ago, we increased the age to which someone could remain on a scheme.  I believe it is 62 years of age now.  There has been an increase in the number of participants in CE schemes and it should increase further from 19,244 at the end of October to 22,700 by 2021.  The number of participants in T&uacute;s schemes should increase from 3,700 at the end of October to 5,500 by quarter 2 of 2021.  The 3,000 additional places envisaged in the July stimulus package are over and above the February 2020 position, with a breakdown of 75% CE and 25% T&uacute;s.  That is the level we are aiming towards.<\/p><p> Regarding back to work initiatives, we have the work placement and experience programme.  It is a very good programme and we plan for 10,000 participants.  We are finishing up its details and hope to announce it shortly.  Many of us know people who were able to avail of a similar programme in the past and who got good jobs out of it.  There are still some issues that we need to address with the programme, but we will announce it shortly.  We will also engage with employers and ensure that the programme benefits the employee and the employer.<\/p><p> The CE supervisor issue is a long-running one.  We have all had representations on it on foot of a Labour Court ruling in 2009.  We have been engaging with supervisors.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, has also been engaging with them.  I believe he has met them.  Discussions are ongoing between my Department and his.  We hope that we will be able to find a resolution to this long-running issue and are working hard on that.<\/p><p> I take the Deputies' concerns about JobPath on board.  The OECD has worked with my Department to measure the effectiveness of JobPath.  The findings, which were published last year, indicated that weekly earnings for JobPath clients were 17% higher and employment outcomes were 26% better compared with similar individuals who were not supported by JobPath.  Given the current level of unemployment and the fact that many people are receiving the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP - unfortunately, some will never return to their old jobs because those jobs will not be there any longer - we cannot let the JobPath contract lapse without replacing that capacity.  JobPath contractors provide approximately 40% of our public employment services' capacity.  There would not be sufficient capacity within the existing structures to support the anticipated increase in numbers requiring access to employment services without there being a JobPath service in 2021.  We have examined this issue and, in light of our situation, we have rolled JobPath out for a further year.  We could not have done otherwise, given that we would not have the necessary capacity without it.  That said, we have put out to tender local employment services in four areas that do not have any currently.  I hope that the local providers will be able to submit an offer to do that work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#J00200","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  Before I turn to members, I wish to discuss the over-66s.  An argument has been made to me.  There is a cohort of people over the age of 66 who have no entitlement to a contributory State pension and who, because they were working, are not entitled to a non-contributory State pension.  They have fallen between the cracks but should have been eligible for the PUP.  It could have been structured in such a way as to ensure that someone did not get a second payment, which is the case under the social protection rules anyway.  This affects a small cohort of people who are being discriminated against.  I will not get into a debate now, given that we will revert to this matter when we discuss the social welfare Bill, but I just wanted to make the point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#L00100","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":526,"content":"<p>The Minister stated that she had considered extending the PUP to over-66s.

I assume that her Department has examined the cost.  Does she have the figures?<\/p> <p>  It took us two years to find out the fees relating to JobPath.  We got them through the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is an enormous cost to the taxpayer.  One need not discuss how people are treated or so on if one just looks at the figures - &euro;3,718 per person who sustains a job for 52 weeks.  People are being referred two, three or four times.  Each time someone is referred, the company automatically gets &euro;311.  There are then four sustainment fees depending on how long the person sustains employment.<\/p> <p>  The local employment service, LES, proposed that it could take up to 100,000 people.  The Minister knows the wrap-around supports that are included with the LES in terms of well-being and mental health, which are important in the current climate.  Those supports are not provided through JobPath.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister examine the amounts that these companies are getting?

Translated into English, it means that the cat purrs for its own good, although it does not work as well in English as it does in Irish.  Will the Minister make the OECD report available to us?  I would be interested in seeing the methodology that the OECD used to work out the magic figure of 17%.  I have a funny feeling that it was working on JobPath's reports, and what would they tell someone other than it pays very well, given that the contractors' livelihoods depending on giving a good answer?  From my experience on the ground, I am sceptical about that figure.  One case is not a generality, but a constituent of mine was on jobseeker's allowance and was doing what was technically a part-time course, namely, a Hibernia course to become a teacher.  My constituent was called up to JobPath, given that the constituent was on the magic list.  This person already knew they were going to qualify that summer, given that they were a native Irish speaker and would not have too much difficulty getting a job as a full-time teacher.  I would love to see the report on the salary level that that person earned <i>&agrave; la<\/i>JobPath.  It was ridiculous that this constituent was forced in, but the company needs the numbers.  It is driven by numbers.  At the other extreme are people who, for one reason or another, will never get jobs.  They go to JobPath and learn typing skills even though they can hardly read or write.<\/p><p>The cost of JobPath needs to be examined.  When it was provided by the State, this service was much less money driven, was much more understanding of people's realities and dealt with individuals as real people.<\/p><p>JobPath is driven by profit because the service is run by a for-profit organisation.  It is in it to make money and it is not in it for anything else.  Whereas I believe when we are dealing with people who are unemployed, particularly those who are long-term unemployed, a much more nuanced approach needs to be taken so that is not driven by profit but by the personal benefit of the people we are trying to look after.  In an extreme case, the person who is going to get the job is a teacher anyway.  We would have said that was grand, to keep studying and not interfere with it.  People who are unlikely to get commercial jobs would be better put into community employment schemes where there may be a graduated step forward.  I do not like this being driven by profit rather than being motivated by the people.  Will this issue be reviewed?<\/p><p> Will we be given the OECD report?  I am absolutely fascinated to see the methodology.  I presume we will be given the report which tells us what the answer is but I want to know the methodology by which the answer was arrived at.  The greatest oxymoron we get in the English language all the time is when reports tell us that based on the following suppositions what the conclusions and facts are.  However, they are not facts if they are based on supposition no matter how much the supposition is a big part or small part of the report's conclusions.  Any scientific approach will tell us that once we start putting in suppositions the conclusions are what we think but they are not hard facts because we have created doubts by putting in suppositions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#L00300","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I want to add my voice to those of Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Kerrane.

It is providing a basic income to people and therein lies the problem because they probably have other income.  We can go through this again and I am happy to hear and look at the suggestions of the committee members.  I know what they are saying and I have seen it myself.<\/p><p>To go back to JobPath, there are 201,000 people on the live register and a further 340,000 people are in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment.  The economic impact of the pandemic has certainly increased the number of people who are likely to require these supports.<\/p><p> I mentioned the OECD report and I am very happy to provide the committee with a copy of it.  It is not a problem.  JobPath has a proven track record of providing sustained employment.  Up to September 2020, more than 280,000 jobseekers had commenced engagement with JobPath and to date more than 64,000 jobseekers have commenced employment during their engagement period with JobPath.  In 2018, the Comptroller and Auditor General undertook a detailed report on the JobPath service and, in particular, he examined how the Department of Social Protection monitored and measured the achievement of the JobPath contract objectives and the associated costs.  It is notable that the Comptroller and Auditor General made no recommendations on how the JobPath service is governed.  He did not see any issue there.<\/p><p> We are facing record unemployment as a result of the pandemic and now is not the time to be cutting support services.  JobPath is just one part of the jigsaw.  We are also expanding the capacity of other contracted employment services, such as the local employment services, job clubs and EmployAbility.  These contracts are also being extended into next year.  This will include the expansion of the footprint of community-based contract services, as I said earlier, with four new geographical areas where a local employment service does not currently exist.  The Government is also expanding the capacity of job search support services provided by the Department of Social Protection's Intreo offices countrywide.  An additional 300 staff will work in the Department in 2021, including expanding the capacity of the Intreo centres to provide employment services and supports with the assignment of an additional 100 job coaches.  Recruitment for these posts has started and it is intended to fill these positions over the coming weeks.<\/p><p> The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is increasing investment in apprenticeship schemes, including the provision of incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, and short-term courses by investing in more than 35,000 new education and training places.  Young jobseekers can now benefit from the JobsPlus scheme after being unemployed for four months instead of 12 months.  We have made changes to the back to education and the back to work allowances.  As part of the July stimulus we have opened access to these schemes to persons who have lost their jobs during the Covid pandemic by waiving the waiting period, which is between three and nine months in more normal circumstances.  Persons who have temporarily lost their jobs during the Covid public health restrictions can also avail of part-time education programmes while continuing to receive the pandemic unemployment payment, and we discussed this earlier.  I also spoke about the additional community employment and T&uacute;s places.<\/p><p> There is a bigger picture here and JobPath is only one part of the jigsaw.  The total cost of the JobPath service to date is &euro;244.7 million.  The total number of people engaged to date is more than 280,000, giving a total cost per client of &euro;873.  Delivering 12 months of employment services engagement for this cost compares favourably with the cost of other public employment service provision and provides value for money.<\/p><p> This will go out to contract.  Other providers now have time.  It has been extended and it will go out to contract in late 2021 or 2022.  Now is the time for all of the other providers to put their case together and prepare for the contract for this.  I looked at this very carefully because I took on board the concerns of committee members, and I have heard various stories, but generally the figures I have received show complaints are low at only 1,267 complaints out of 280,000 participants, which is less than 0.5%.  These are the figures I have been given.  At the time we are in, it would not be wise to withdraw a full service such as this that has a role to play as part of a bigger picture.  It will go out to contract at some stage next year and it will then be up to everybody interested in providing these services, whether community-based or whatever, to put in a bid to tender for this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#M00600","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Is everyone happy with No. 5?

Many people are working from home and doing tremendous work.  A person who works from home has a start time but sometimes no finish time.  Working from home encroaches on family life and it is not particularly healthy.  Now is the time to do that and I will look at what we can do in the Department of Social Protection.

I will definitely be going to visit.<\/p><p> Deputy Carey raised the issue of parent's leave extension.  As the Deputy knows, as part of budget 2021, parent's leave will be increased from two weeks to five weeks per parent in relation to children born since November 2019.  As with many of the budgetary measures, there is a lead-in time for its implementation.  It requires legislative changes but I assure parents that everything is being done to make this support available as soon as possible.  I know Deputies are being contacted by parents who are currently on leave and who want to extend it.  Bear with us, there is legislation to go through.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, will bring the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He is working extremely hard on it and hopes to have it as soon as possible.  Until the legislation is enacted - and I look forward to Deputies' co-operation on that - there is no statutory obligation on employers to grant the extra leave.  Once the legislation is enacted, parents will be able to take the leave at that stage.<\/p><p> On the payment, a number of changes are being put through on the social welfare IT systems.  The Christmas bonus has to go through and there are a number of arrears and different things.  This is very important also.  We have been prioritising the work on the pandemic unemployment payment and getting the payments to workers impacted by level 5.  It is expected that the system changes in respect of parent's benefit will be in place at the end of March 2021.  We will make the payment for the leave that was taken.  Once the legislation goes through, the parents can take the leave and they will get the payment as soon as we get it processed and the IT systems updated.  It will be backdated so parents can take the leave in January.  They may not get the money until a month or two later but they will definitely get the money and it will be backdated.<\/p><p> The period during which this leave can be taken will be extended from 12 to 24 months.  That means parents with children who were born after November 2019 will have until November 2021 to take the leave.<\/p><p> Deputy Kerrane raised the issue of the exceptional needs payments.  It is a demand-led scheme and the money will be provided as it is needed.  It is there to help people who need it and I encourage people who find themselves in difficult situations to use that scheme.  The important thing about this Department is that it is here to help people.  Our number one purpose is to give people that helping hand when they need it.<\/p><p> On the question of 80% of people making debt repayments, I do not have the numbers but I will get them to the Deputy if that is okay.  The high number of appeals is probably related to the fact that there has been such a massive number of payments.  People have probably appealed the decisions and we are going through those and working with them all on a one-to-one basis.  I take on board what the Deputy said about the fuel allowance but I will have to check that out.<\/p><p> I think I have covered everything.  I thank Deputies for their co-operation.  I will be back shortly with the social welfare Bill, when I will talk about budget 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#P00300","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":548,"content":"<p>That concludes the consideration of Vote 37 - social protection.
