The surplus at the year end was &euro;8.9 million.  Of this, &euro;8 million was unspent capital allocations for flood risk management which was carried over to 2020.  The balance of &euro;921,000 was surrendered.<\/p> <p>  The appropriation account is presented under two programme headings: &euro;99.3 million, or 22% of the total expenditure, was spent on the flood risk management programme; and just under &euro;356 million was spent on the estate portfolio management programme.  Under the estates management programme, the OPW provides office and other accommodation to Government Departments and offices, with the costs being a direct charge on the Vote.  This includes rent payments totalling &euro;91 million; expenditure on new works, alterations and additions, costing just under &euro;75 million; and property maintenance and supplies payments totalling just under &euro;65 million.  The account records the value of land and buildings held at the year end at &euro;3.3 billion.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the activity accounted for under Vote 13, the OPW acts on an agency basis on behalf of other Government Departments and agencies.  This mainly relates to the carrying out of major capital works and the leasing of accommodation.  The expenditure associated with this agency activity is reflected in the accounts of the client Departments and agencies.  Total agency expenditure handled by the OPW amounted to &euro;112 million in 2019.  This means that the aggregate value of the expenditure handled by the OPW amounted to &euro;567 million in the year.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account, but drew attention to the disclosure in the statement on internal financial control about procurement that was not compliant with public procurement rules.<\/p> <p>  I also drew attention in the audit opinion to the disclosure in the statement on internal financial control about expenditure by the OPW in 2019 on a maintenance contract.  I had previously reported on the origin and operation of this contract in my report on the accounts of the public services for 2018.  That is the chapter before the committee this afternoon.<\/p> <p>  The OPW has its own in-house direct labour force to carry out maintenance work on high-profile heritage properties, such as Dublin Castle, &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in and Kilkenny Castle.  For more standard properties, the OPW draws on the services of a private contractor firm for maintenance works, as required, under what is referred to as a \"measured term\" contract.  This is a contract that provides for the drawdown of services within a specified period, with individual work orders assessed on the basis of a tendered schedule of payment rates.<\/p><p>Minor construction works were also allowed under the contract, with provision for individual works orders costing up to &euro;500,000 each.  Above that level, separate tendering of works would be required.<\/p><p> Following a publicly-advertised tender competition, the contractor was appointed in October 2014 for three years, with a one-year extension option which was exercised by the OPW. The contract indicates that the OPW envisaged the contract value would be of the order of &euro;3 million a year, or &euro;12 million over the full four-year term.  In fact, the total value of the work carried out over the four years was &euro;39.4 million, an average of just under &euro;10 million a year.  In addition, the Accounting Officer has disclosed that the OPW incurred further expenditure of &euro;7.4 million in 2019 on works commissioned prior to the end of the contract term, bringing the total contract value to &euro;46.8 million.  All these figures exclude VAT.<\/p><p>In the course of our examination we also identified that at least six work orders placed by the OPW that cost in excess of the &euro;500,000 limit.  These ranged in value from &euro;600,000 to &euro;2.4 million.<\/p><p> When the measured-term contract was in its final year, the OPW advertised a tender competition for its replacement.  As required by law, the tender invitation included an estimate of the value of the new contract, which was proposed to be for an initial three years.  This is intended to allow potential bidders to understand the scale of the business proposed.  The value indicated by the OPW in the advertisement was equivalent to &euro;5 million a year, excluding VAT.  Only two expressions of interest were received by the advertised closing date: the existing contractor and one other tenderer.  Following final evaluation, the OPW awarded a new three-year contract to the existing contractor in October 2018.  The new contract allows for spending on any one works order up to &euro;750,000, or up to &euro;1 million for conservation works.  The Accounting Officer has disclosed that the expenditure incurred on work orders under the new contract had totaled &euro;34.7 million by the end of 2019.  Again, this is very significantly in excess of the estimated contract value presented in the tender advertised.  Of this total expenditure to end 2019, &euro;22 million was attributed to works on infrastructure required to prepare for Brexit.<\/p><p> We found that the OPW did not have adequate contract monitoring mechanisms in place, especially in the types of work being undertaken, which included pre-planned preventive maintenance, reactive maintenance, new capital works, and conservation projects. The Accounting Officer agreed to recommendations we made about improving their contract monitoring and estimation of contract values.  Given the elapse of time since the report was published in September 2019, the Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee on progress made in that regard.

I am joined this afternoon by Kathryna Clifford, head of finance, and in the adjoining room by the two OPW commissioners and members of our management board.<br\/><br\/>I hope the advance brief provided to the Committee answered the points specifically requested.  I will present further summary information on the 2019 appropriation account for Vote 13 and comment on matters raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report: Expenditure under a Maintenance Contract.<br\/><br\/>The Office of Public Works is an essential part of how Government and the State delivers on a wide variety of projects for the public good.  We are the State&rsquo;s lead body on flood risk management; we provide office space for more than 40,000 public servants; we maintain and showcase national monuments and important historic buildings such as Kilkenny Castle, Castletown House, and Leinster House, where we are today; we manage public parks and gardens such as the Phoenix Park and the National Botanic Gardens; the State art collection, State events, and Government publications.<br\/><br\/>Our vision is to maintain our built and natural environments in harmony.  Our purpose is to to provide the Government and the public with versatile, innovative and specialist services. Projects and requirements frequently change.  What is constant, however, is the need for the State to have the expertise and capacity to deliver on its plans for our people.  That need is highlighted in the ongoing OPW response to Covid-19, the preparations for Brexit and how we have been advancing infrastructure projects since 2018 under the national development plan.  This is about the readiness of the State now and for the future.<br\/><br\/>The 2019 gross expenditure of the OPW was &euro;455 million.  In addition to the expenditure on Vote 13, the OPW acts as an agent, undertaking work on behalf<br\/><br\/>of other Government Departments and agencies.  Expenditure on this activity in 2019 was a further &euro;112 million.  This appears as a charge on the accounts of the client organisations.<br\/><br\/>Exchequer funding to the OPW supports two core programmes of work - flood risk management and estate management including heritage services.<b><font color=\"#FF0000\">  <\/font><\/b>Almost &euro;100 million was invested in flood risk management in 2019.  The OPW continues to implement a suite of infrastructural and other measures to mitigate the impact of flooding to people, homes, properties and businesses.  More than 300 communities around the country, home to approximately 3 million citizens, will benefit from the current, ten year, investment programme.  This investment is providing tangible social and economic benefits to people, communities and the State.<br\/><br\/>Some &euro;356 million was invested in estate management.  This is one of the largest and certainly the most wide-ranging property portfolios in the State.  It includes some 2,500 properties, managed as a shared service for more than 80 Government bodies in a very complex working environment.  This has become more important for the State in that the OPW will play a key role in the design and delivery of the &ldquo;workplace of the future&rdquo;.  That future will clearly be different in the aftermath of this pandemic and that future will come to pass much sooner than any of us would have anticipated a year ago.<br\/><br\/>In order to carry out its functions, the OPW uses a mix of in-house expertise and outsourced services contracted through a variety of appropriate public procurement channels including the measured-term contract to which the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General refers.  The rationale for procuring works through the measured-term contract is that it represents the most efficient mechanism for the delivery of repair, maintenance and small works across a diverse portfolio of some 600 properties in Dublin.  The demand was underestimated when establishing the size of the contract, with the result that many more individual projects were undertaken than had been originally anticipated.<br\/><br\/>The contract was competitively tendered and the main contractor subsequently sub-contracted many of the labour intensive works to 60 or so small to medium size enterprises.  The OPW consistently supports Government initiatives to promote SME participation in public procurement.  Work was devolved across multiple suppliers within the framework of a pre-tendered contract that provides certainty around standards and individual job costs.  This type of &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo; contract enabled the OPW to provide ongoing, essential and emergency services for public bodies in a cost effective manner whilst safeguarding public assets.<br\/><br\/>Brexit is a prime example of the OPW being called upon to carry out essential works for Government in an emergency.  At the Government's request, the OPW developed facilities in Dublin Airport, Dublin Port, and Rosslare Europort which started as nine projects in 2019 and eventually grew to 28 projects for four Departments, so that the country is prepared for the UK leaving the customs union and Single Market next month.  Although never foreseen for projects of this scale, the measured-term contract allowed for the delivery of this infrastructure, by the relevant deadlines while controlling cost and ensuring value.  <br\/><br\/>I fully acknowledge the issues identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General and have taken on board his recommendations.  The report refers to procurement and contract<br\/><br\/>management issues and I assure the committee that the OPW is committed to being fully compliant in these areas while also ensuring value for money and efficiency for the State in delivering essential services.<br\/><br\/>If I may, I would like to thank my colleagues in the office for their work in delivering services during the Covid-19 pandemic.  I thank the Chairman and the committee members for its time and the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for their work and recommendations.

The OPW leases the office premises in Miesian Plaza on Baggot Street, mainly to accommodate the Departments of Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  That contracted annual rent is approximately &euro;10 million.  Total commitment is &euro;231.7 million over 25 years.  It is reported that there has been an overpayment in the region of &euro;10 million to the landlord.  I know there has been ongoing correspondence between the OPW and the landlord.

It was completed and moved into in 2017.  The project has been a great success but as the Deputy says, there was an issue with the code used for the measurement of the area, which led to a discrepancy in the final rent of &euro;344,000 per annum.  This is still under discussion between the OPW and the landlord, Remley Developments.  This matter was dealt with in a chapter of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in 2017 and was fully discussed in the Committee of Public Accounts in 2018.<\/p> <p>  There has been correspondence since and there is an ongoing discussion.  I met senior members of Remley Developments at the beginning of this year.  There was an amicable meeting.  It is a reputable landlord.  I am optimistic that we will be able to resolve this without resorting to legal action.  We have legal advice on the position.  I had hoped it would be resolved by now but with everything going on, it has not been.  It is a 25 year lease.  There will be rent reviews.  We will do work on the building as tenants and the landlord will work on it.  There will then be close of the lease at the end of 25 years and then reinstatement.  There will be much interaction between the tenant and the landlord.  This will not go away.  I intend to make sure that the public is done right by on this occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1605112200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Obviously &euro;10 million is a lot of money and there is significant concern.

The relevant scheme is a &euro;10 million project that includes a diversion of 1.3 km.  Probably eight Ministers have visited the area at this stage.

The overall scheme has been delayed for a variety of reasons.  I think that everybody involved is seized of the urgency of implementing a solution.  As has already been mentioned, there were significant environmental challenges as we went through the design of the scheme.  There was a karst landscape which had to be looked at in significant detail so that we could make sure that the modelling and design of the solution was workable.  That took a lot of time because, as I said, there were significant environmental challenges.<\/p> <p>  The scheme went to exhibition in 2018.  It was then referred to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is the statutory process when we do schemes under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform does what is known as \"confirm\" the schemes.  That is legal approval and, effectively, the planning process for that type of scheme.  There was a delay in that process because new EU environmental regulations had to be transposed into Irish law so that has slowed down the confirmation process.<\/p> <p>  The scheme was submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who contracted in a series of consultants, as required under the new regulations.  They carried out an environmental assessment on the scheme and then sought further information from the OPW, which we passed back in October of this year.  Subject to the consultants being satisfied with that information and the scheme being confirmed, we hope to start construction in 2021.  While it has been delayed, we are seeing light at the end of the tunnel and will be able to progress the scheme.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned our direct labour force.  We have looked at using that.  It is a scarce but skilled resource that we use on particularly challenging projects.  It does save time.  That is still under consideration in terms of the actual form of construction that we are going to use on this project.<\/p> <p>  On the question of interim solutions, the Deputy may be aware that there is a scheme under which we provide local authorities with funding to do minor works to alleviate pressing issues.  We are very amenable to doing that in this area.  We have also funded Mayo County Council to provide individual property protection to a range of impacted homes.<\/p><p>Flood gates have been installed at approximately 100 houses in that area and they are having a benefit.<\/p><p> We are progressing overall and the confirmation process should be completed shortly.

On the overall schemes, there is much frustration and disappointment about the length of time it takes to carry out surveys, studies, examination of the sites and the work on the contracts and the tenders.  I am talking about the period from when the work starts to seeing the actual physical work commence.  The time from when the preparatory work, to use that term, begins, which includes all of that, to when the physical works commence is a huge frustration for people.  We get circulars saying that such and such a scheme is starting.  Some of this has been articulated by Deputy Colm Burke but it is about the time that elapses between that preparatory work and actually starting the works and spending money.  I understand that environmental impact assessments, EIAs, have to be done and that there are many requirements on the OPW but the chairman might deal with that.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask about some specific schemes.  With regard to the Mountmellick scheme, Mountmellick suffered very badly three years ago as a result of very severe flooding.  Many houses and businesses were impacted.  An excellent engineer in Laois County Council, Paul McLoughlin, is heading up that project but the length of time it takes to get from the starting blocks to the physical works being done seems to be three, three and a half or even four years.

A weir was constructed there.  There were two weirs.  One of them was taken out.  The remaining one is causing problems.  It is increasing the water levels in the river by about 1 m to 1.2 m.  I find it hard to understand the value for money argument because many of the people living in Patrick Street and in Dunne's Terrace, in Mountrath, had to abandon their houses so they would say it does represent value for money.

That is one issue I wish to raise.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is totally different and concerns Glanmire Garda station.  The OPW agreed to purchase the building in 2011 and it was not closed until 2017 and 2018.  Interest was paid, however, for more than six years.  My understanding is that a binding contract was signed by both the vendors and the State, which was the purchaser, yet it went to a full High Court hearing.  The High Court held against the State.  The building was bought and we paid out more than &euro;360,000 between legal costs and interest on a building that only cost &euro;760,000.  In other words, we paid an additional 50% on top of the purchase price because someone decided there was no contract.  I am aware the OPW did not make that decision but why decide not to go ahead with a purchase then six years later go ahead with it and deliver the Garda station?  In the meantime, there was an inadequate facility for a Garda station in Glanmire for a further six years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111100002#M00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605112200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>We provided the information on that Glanmire Garda station some time ago.  I will ask Mr. McMahon to comment on that in a moment.<\/p> <p>  I will come to the Deputy's first question which was on the Cork city flood relief scheme and Morrison's Island.  He is perfectly correct that Morrison's Island is the first element of a large scheme.  It is being progressed by Cork City Council with the OPW.  It has received planning and has been approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  To our disappointment, a judicial review has been requested by the Save Cork City group.  We are, therefore, at the mercy of the judicial system as to whether or when that will be heard and how long it will take.  We have just gone through a similar process in County Kildare, which delayed the scheme by two full years.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, who has responsibility for the OPW and flood relief, has asked Save Cork City to consider withdrawing that judicial review in the interests of the wider community.  Business people in Cork have echoed that, as has Cork County Council.  As an official, my interest is to proceed with the work.  I met the Save Cork City group along with the then Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran.<\/p> <p>  I believe it is time to go ahead.  We have addressed Save Cork City openly and responsibly and taken all its concerns seriously and answered them all one by one.  They are passionate people.  I respect all those people who hold passionate views on things but really, it is time to proceed with that.  We will engage wholeheartedly with that and any other group when we come to the next phase.  That is only phase 1.  It is a huge project all the way from Ballincollig down to the sea in Cork.  It will cost &euro;140 million in total.  It is enormous.  It is the biggest flood relief project in the State and to some extent, the most important in terms of the risk of property and to people.  We all saw what happened in 2009.  It was a miracle lives were not lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111100002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1605112200,"counter":286,"content":"<p>And again recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111100002#M00500","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605112200,"counter":287,"content":"<p>And again, recently, what happened to business people.

On 12 December 2019, the European Council endorsed the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050.  In its resolution of 14 March 2019 on climate change, the European Parliament also endorsed the objective of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  In its resolution of 14 March 2019 on climate change, European Parliament also endorsed the objective of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  I will now deal with the two communications being considered by the committee today.<\/p><p> COM (2020) 80, or the European climate law, seeks to write into law the goal set out in the European green deal - for Europe&rsquo;s economy and society to become climate neutral by 2050 - by cutting emissions and increasing the removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to reach net zero emissions.  It also sets out the framework to achieve EU climate neutrality and aims to enhance efforts on adaptation to climate change.<\/p><p> The proposal for a European climate law regulation forms part of a broader package of ambitious actions announced in the Commission&rsquo;s European green deal communication.  The European green deal launches a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society improving the quality of life of current and future generations with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use.  It also aims to protect, conserve and enhance the EU's natural capital and protect the health and well-being of citizens from climate and environment-related risks and impacts.<\/p><p> The key elements of COM (2020) 80 include setting a pathway to climate neutrality for the Union and providing certainty and confidence for businesses, workers, investors and consumers about the EU&rsquo;s commitment; setting out conditions for a trajectory for the EU to achieve climate neutrality by 2050; providing for regular assessment of progress towards the climate neutrality objective and the level of ambition in the trajectory identified; providing for mechanisms in case of insufficient progress or inconsistencies with the climate neutrality objective - the EU Commission may make recommendations to member states; providing for more ambitious action on climate adaptation, including by strengthening efforts relating to climate proofing, resilience building and prevention and preparedness; providing that the EU Commission should review existing Union policies and legislation in view of their consistency with the climate neutrality objective as well as the trajectory identified to achieve that objective; and providing that the European Commission should assess and make proposals to increase the EU&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions reduction target under any existing policy instruments that have a 2030 perspective so that the reduction target is consistent with the 2050 climate neutrality objective.  It also provides that following presentation of an impact-assessed plan to increase the EU's greenhouse gas emission reduction target for 2030 to at least 50% and towards 55%, the Commission will amend this regulation accordingly and by June 2021, review and propose where to revise, where necessary, all relevant related policy instruments.  It also provides for consequential amendments to Regulation (EU) 2018\/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action.<\/p><p> COM (2020) 563 amends COM (2020) 80, the main elements of which I have just outlined.  The original proposal stated that the Commission would present by September 2020 an impact-assessed plan to increase the EU&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emission reduction target for 2030 from at least 40% to at least 50% and towards 55% compared with 1990 levels.  With a view to achieving climate neutrality in the Union by 2050, the amending proposal is that the EU&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced and removals enhanced so that net greenhouse gas emissions, that is emissions after deduction of removals, are reduced economy-wide and domestically by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.  The impact assessment demonstrates that increasing the EU&rsquo;s emission reduction target for 2030 to at least 55% is both feasible and beneficial.  It shows that an increase of the target implies greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts by all sectors and enhancement of removals, which need to be enabled by various policies.  I should add that a partial general agreement was reached in October at the Environment Council.  I am very happy to expand on any of these or any other elements of the proposals being considered by the committee today and to take whatever questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020111100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carroll for appearing before the committee.

It recognises that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, talks about bringing CO2 emissions to net zero by 2050 and non-CO2 gases in the following years to net zero.  The EU has shown leadership by choosing an approach at EU level that involves bringing all greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050, including non-CO2 gases.  In terms of governance, sanctions and the semester, what is envisaged is that if a member state is off course, the EU can make recommendations to the member state.  If the member state decides not to act on the recommendations made to go back on course, it is then obliged to explain itself in due course.  Regarding sanctions, the new regime must be fully designed between now and into the next one or two years.  Legislative proposals will be on the table by 2021.<\/p><p>There are flexibilities.  There are ways that that member states can purchase compliance.  That is a cost and it is one that is funding mitigation elsewhere in the EU rather than in one's own country and that is where the productive investment is taking place.  Those sort of flexibilities impose a cost on member states if they are not in a position to bring about compliance within their own jurisdiction.<\/p><p>On the emissions trading system, ETS, there are proposals on the table which we will need to analyse.  In particular, there are proposals on the expansion of the ETS which talk about its role in transport and the built environment.  The EU tables a number of propositions, one of which is that the ETS comes into one of those spaces but in parallel one still imposes targets on member states, so that one would still have both an ETS and an effort-type sharing regulation operating in those sectors.<\/p><p> Another proposal is to reduce the size of the non-ETS and have the ETS just operate itself with nothing else as to, potentially, transport and the built environment.<\/p><p> On agriculture, the EU has published its methane strategy but is also looking at bringing LULUCF and agriculture potentially into a single block so one would have the non-CO2greenhouse gases in a block with LULUCF and the creation of sinks.  <\/p><p> Finally, on the just transition, each member state must prepare a just transition territorial plan for approval by the European Commission to access the funding.  It must be prepared in accordance with EU rules, with the involvement of urban and other public authorities, economic and social partners and relevant bodies representing civil society, environmental partners and so forth.  Ireland is in a phase at the moment where we are about to start a technical assistance-funded exercise to scope out the territory for the just transition plan and to do the preparatory work for it so that we can maximise the drawdown of funding in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020111100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carroll.

In responding to Deputy Bruton I outlined some of those.  If we were to assume that the architecture was to remain as it currently is, the next step for the EU is to engage in analysis of member states&rsquo; capacity to deliver.

I want to focus on a couple of areas around that question of targets.  As I understand, because Ireland is a laggard and has not met its previous targets, I do not believe that will give us a free pass.  It might mean that we need to have a higher nationally determined contribution.  Is Mr. Carroll suggesting that this would require us to be reducing by 55% to 60% from 1990 levels in order to be achieving the 55% that the EU is discussing?<\/p><p>It would be useful to clarify that.<\/p><p> I will come back to the question of the level of ambition.  As we know, this direction from the Commission has gone through two of its stages.  It has been through the European Parliament and it is on its way to the European Council.  Mr. Carroll might confirm if that will happen in December.  First of all, has Mr. Carroll a sense of what position Ireland intends to take on some of the key changes that were made in the European Parliament?  For example, while there were proposals that the level of ambition should be raised to 65%, I believe a compromise proposal was agreed by the European Parliament of 60% by 2030.  Similarly, there was a requirement that all future legislative and budgetary proposals had to be consistent with the Union's climate objectives.  There was an amendment passed for the creation of an independent European scientific advisory body on climate change, and similarly, indeed, a greenhouse gas budget in 2021.  It would be useful if Mr. Carroll could give an indication of what position Ireland will take in relation to these amendments to the Commission's proposals from the European Parliament when it goes to the third part of the process in the Council.  That would be important.<\/p><p> It would be helpful if Mr. Carroll could confirm that he believes we are on track for these measures to be in place in 2021.  There was some mention in the communication that it might be delayed because of Covid-19 but I understand it has gone through the European Parliament.  It only has to go through the Council.  If anything, the Covid-19 crisis has underscored the need for action on the science.  Otherwise, it could lead to targets being raised further.  Could Mr. Carroll also comment on the debate on it being net zero versus gross zero, and provide his perspective on it?  We have heard the argument in relation to net zero.  Also, in terms of other reductions, he might comment on whether they should be net or gross.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020111100002#C01100","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins for the questions.  In terms of what Ireland needs to do to hit its targets, the starting point - the previous contributor raised this issue as well - is based on average emissions from 2016 to 2018.  Ireland's starting point will be on its average emissions over that period.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Ireland being behind, we are behind in terms of our 2020 target.  Against a 20% reduction, according to latest forecasts, we are likely to reduce by between 2% and 4% by 2020.  However, if the 2019 climate action plan were fully implemented, in terms of our existing climate target which will be revised upwards and is a 30% reduction, it would have us reach and slightly exceed that target.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what Ireland needs to do, currently the intention is not to have every member state reduce its emissions by at least 55% by 2030 - it is to have the EU as a whole reduce its emissions.  The architecture for how that will be achieved is not designed.  I will not go back through it, but there are proposals on the table regarding the expansion of the emissions trading system, ETS; and regarding putting non-CO2 emissions, particularly agricultural emissions, into a particular pot with land use, land use change and forestry.  It is not yet clear how they will interact with what we currently regard as non-ETS, where we have an effort-sharing regulation and where the legally binding obligation falls on the State.  It would not be our expectation that Ireland would be expected to reduce, in its non-ETS as currently constituted, by 55% by 2030.

We do not want to have to use clever accountancy tricks.  As Professor Kevin Anderson said recently, we can fool ourselves about emissions but we cannot fool physics and we cannot fool nature.

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is Ireland&rsquo;s independent national human rights institution and national equality body.  The commission is also the independent monitoring mechanism designate for Ireland under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  We are supported in that work by a disability advisory committee, chaired by Dr. McDonagh and composed of a diverse group of people with lived experience of disability.<\/p> <p>  From the outset, I want to make clear why it is critical that the State, and the committee members, as legislators, consider disability matters through the lens of human rights and equality, and why it is critical to see disability as universal, in terms of rights that belong to all of us, rather than disability as the exception to be managed.  Put simply, the rights afforded by our Constitution and by the laws made in this House are only universal if every person is able to realise them.  In our engagement with the committee today, we will largely focus on gaps in legislation, policy or programmes to address the UNCRPD, and how Ireland can best implement this ground-breaking international convention.  Committee members will be aware that the commission has made a written submission on the committee's proposed terms of reference and work programme.  My comments here will reflect at some points the recommendations in that submission.<\/p> <p>  A key task for this committee will be monitoring Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of the UNCRPD.  As such, the work of the committee should be guided by the principles which underpin the UNCRPD.  One of the most significant of these principles is the direct participation of people with disabilities.  Until more people with disabilities are represented in public life, this needs to be core to how this committee, and the Oireachtas, undertakes its work.  This participation must also account for the diversity of persons with disabilities, in particular to ensure that the voices of those with intersectional experience of disability, including women, children, older people, Travellers and Roma, LGBT, black and ethnic minority people, are invited, heard and understood.<\/p> <p>  As the commission previously set out in its evidence to the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, the pandemic has served to highlight in sharp relief existing weaknesses in the legislative architecture which should underpin the rights of people with disabilities.  These gaps are multiple and large, and include the non-commencement and delayed reform of enacted legislation, for example, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the Mental Health Act 2001.  These delays are incredibly frustrating for people with disabilities, who have fought hard for this legislative change but who continue to experience daily barriers to the realisation of their basic rights in this prolonged phase of inaction.  Other outstanding legislation, if enacted, would see the State better equipped to protect the rights of people with disabilities in the future, for example, the inspection of places of detention Bill, which would ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, OPCAT, and establish the national preventative mechanism, and the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which would formally establish the commission as the independent monitoring mechanism for the UNCRPD.  In addition, considerable preparation is required for comprehensive implementation of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017 when it comes into force at the end of 2020.  Further significant legislation, such as the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and the Disability Act 2005, predate the UNCRPD.  A review of this legislation is required to consider what reform is needed in order to bring it up to date and into alignment with the UNCRPD.<\/p> <p>  Allied to this is the need to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the State&rsquo;s newly-established consultation and participation network and other participation mechanisms.  As previously mentioned, in the absence of people with disabilities being adequately represented in national and local government, the establishment of a permanent participation mechanism that effectively realises the State&rsquo;s obligations under Article 4(3) of the UNCRPD on an ongoing basis is critical.<\/p> <p>  The pandemic has raised the threat for many people with disabilities of being reinstitutionalised in their own homes.  The rights-based approach enshrined in the UNCRPD is the antithesis of the old medical or charitable models of disability.  Now, more than ever, it is important to maintain that focus and not to drift backwards.  In this context, I want to raise the commission&rsquo;s concerns regarding the diminished access to many services for people with disabilities since the onset of the pandemic.  On my point about rights being universal, this exceptional moment we find ourselves in cannot mean that the rights of people with disabilities to participate in society, and to simply live their lives, are postponed indefinitely.<\/p><p>I described the UN convention as groundbreaking and it really is.  I wish the committee every success in its work towards the full and unqualified implementation of the UN convention, including the optional protocol.  We, as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, stand ready to assist in any way we can.  To make Ireland a disability-friendly country, this is not the only work that is needed.  Those among us who have disabilities experience daily stigma and discrimination, often benign but no less harmful.  These attitudinal issues make it impossible to enjoy full participation in the economic, social, political and cultural life to which all Irish citizens should have access.  The UN convention is a huge step on this journey towards an Ireland where all people, with or without a disability, can flourish equally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2020111100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>The National Disability Authority, NDA, thanks the Chairman and members of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters for the opportunity to make a presentation on the progress being made under the national disability inclusion strategy.  The NDA was established in 2000 to provide independent and evidence-informed advice to the Minister on matters of policy and practice relevant to the lives of persons with disabilities, and was given added functions to operate a centre for excellence in universal design from 2007.  Universal design promotes the design of the built environment, products, services and ICT so they can be accessed, understood and used by everyone, regardless of age, size, ability or disability.<\/p> <p>  Our role means we cover a very wide range of policy areas.  Our work includes research, advice, guidelines, codes of practice and input to standards, and is also informed by the experiences and views of persons with disabilities captured in surveys and consultation exercises.  We will be assigned an additional function in relation to the provision of information and statistics to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, to support that body in its role as the independent monitoring mechanism for the UNCRPD.<\/p> <p>  The NDA has a role in supporting the implementation of the national disability inclusion strategy through the delivery of its own committed actions, as well as the development of annual independent assessments of progress.  Since the strategy began, we have published two such assessments, with the third due in early 2021.  To prepare our assessments, the NDA considers biannual reports prepared by Departments on progress against their commitments under the strategy, but also our broader research and policy work, informed by the lived experience of persons with disabilities and their family members or carers.  The NDA has also developed a suite of indicators to show the overall outcomes associated with implementation of the strategy.  They are measured through robust and reliable data sources, such as CSO datasets or data captured by public bodies.  Our first report against these indicators was published earlier this year.<\/p> <p>  The national disability inclusion strategy is one of the mechanisms to drive progressive realisation of the goals of the UNCRPD.  A key commitment within the first half of the strategy&rsquo;s lifetime was the ratification of the UNCRPD in Ireland.  The NDA recognises that further work is required to facilitate ratification of the optional protocol.  The NDA has also welcomed the publication of key reports during the strategy to guide policy development and have a meaningful impact on the lives of persons with disabilities, including the Make Work Pay report, the report of the task force on personalised budgets, the ongoing implementation of the comprehensive employment strategy, the pilot programme for the school inclusion model and the ongoing implementation and review of the access and inclusion model.<\/p> <p>  The NDA has also identified areas where further progress is required in order to deliver the national disability inclusion strategy and to realise the goals of the UNCRPD.  These include commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, development of protection of liberty legislation, reform of the Mental Health Act 2001, passage of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, commencement of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017 and full commencement of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.<\/p> <p>  The NDA also notes that progress in the implementation of some actions within the national disability inclusion strategy has been slower than anticipated, and advises further focus on these areas, including continued work to implement the Time to Move on from Congregated Settings policy, improvements in the provision of statutory assessments of need, as per Part 2 of the Disability Act, and continued focus on the actions committed under the comprehensive employment strategy.  Last year&rsquo;s mid-term review of the strategy allowed the opportunity to take stock of actions which needed to be revised, and to include new actions in recognition of emerging priorities, informed by consultation with persons with disabilities and their families.<\/p> <p>  There are challenges to the implementation of some of the range of policies and programmes in relation to disability.  In the NDA's work, we play a role in identifying these challenges and working with stakeholders to consider potential solutions, informed by evidence.  Some of the cross-cutting challenges include the absence of dedicated funding to transition to new models of service, challenges in supporting structured cross-departmental working, as many barriers can only be addressed through a whole-of-system approach, and challenges in gathering and accessing harmonised data on disability.<\/p> <p>  As Ireland prepares to deliver its first state party report to the UN monitoring committee, the NDA is working to collect and analyse data on a number of the articles of the UNCRPD that address significant aspects of the lives of persons with disabilities, such as education, employment and independent living.  We also advise that it will be important to consider what ongoing implementation of the UNCRPD looks like, in particular as the current national disability inclusion strategy comes to an end in 2021.  The NDA notes the commitment in the revised national disability inclusion strategy to develop an overall implementation plan for the UNCRPD and separate departmental plans.  It will be critical that Departments and their agencies translate the aims of the strategy into specific and measurable action plans for implementation at local level, in keeping with the Government policy of mainstreaming.<\/p> <p>  We would like to take this opportunity to highlight the extent to which the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the lives of persons with disabilities, including through increased unemployment for those working in sectors vulnerable to restrictions, the closure or reduced capacity of day and respite services, gaps in educational provision for children with disabilities, reduced or delayed access to non-Covid health interventions and increased isolation for persons with disabilities.  We recognise that the pandemic has brought additional challenges and delays to the implementation of some commitments under the national disability inclusion strategy.  However, there has also been opportunities to learn and explore new ways of working that could inform future directions for disability services and supports.<\/p> <p>  The NDA advises the importance of a whole-of-government approach to disability, as encapsulated by the national disability inclusion strategy.  While there may be some gaps in the areas covered by the strategy, and while progress on some actions has been slower than anticipated, it nevertheless serves as a mechanism to co-ordinate cross-government activity, and a means of focusing attention on this key area.  This, in turn, will enable Ireland to continue on its journey of progressive realisation of the goals of the UNCRPD.  We will continue to provide support for implementation through the provision of evidence-informed advice and guidance and would be happy to provide more detail on any area summarised within this statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2020111100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aideen Hartney"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and opening remarks and for all of the work they do all of the time and not just what is represented here today.

One should look at the progress around women in education and employment, gay people and the way the removal of stigma and shame has allowed marginalised people to move forward.  Indeed, I am delighted that Senator Eileen Flynn, a Traveller, has managed to find employment in the Oireachtas.  I say again that, in the current climate, human rights are about recognising the gaps in legislation but also acknowledging that Covid-19 has absolutely, like my colleague from the NDA said, affected our lives.  This is particularly so in rural Ireland and particularly for Travellers and Roma, who are living in deplorable conditions.  The idea of education or employment is far away from our everyday reality.<\/p> <p>  In the current climate around children's educational and therapeutic needs, there is a real fear from parents.  I am an aunt of several young people with disabilities of varying degrees and I have already seen regression in people who need specific educational interventions.  <\/p> <p>  I will provide one more input and this is the reason I am here today.  Covid-19 has meant there is a high propensity or possibility of violence against disabled people.  We have seen it in the context of gender-based violence and I hear from my colleagues, my networks and my friends that this is a serious issue.  We are not just talking about enclosed spaces; we are talking about family homes, institutions, nursing homes and other communal areas.  It is not just physical violence.  It is financial and it is threats of corrosion of rights around food and daily choices.  I hope the committee realises what it is like out there for us.

There is incredible injustice in this country regarding people with disabilities so I thank Dr. McDonagh for her contribution.<\/p> <p>  I have a general question.  On a note which just came from the Seanad, we had the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, speaking on disability day services and her priorities in trying to get them reopened and increasing capacity.  She also noted that by January, she hopes to start the implementation of the optional protocol, so we got some sort of timeline from her.  I think her officials were pulling her back but she said they hope to start the implementation from January, so there was some positive news today.  <\/p> <p>  An issue for me is employment.  From the witnesses' point of view, is there one thing from a policy direction - not even a legislative direction - that we can push here which would have a quick effect on increasing numbers of people with disabilities in employment?  I have ideas but I am not a policy professional.  In transport, is there an immediate policy we could work on in that area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2020111100002#C00400","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McGreehan.  In addressing this, I will be able to address some of the points raised by Senator Seery Kearney as well.  Employment, unfortunately, is one of those areas where a whole-of-system approach is required so it is hard to isolate a single solution.  We are quite fortunate in Ireland in having a comprehensive employment strategy with a suite of actions committed to by Departments and public bodies to address this area.  It begins from early on by raising expectations that persons with disabilities can have employment and enjoy their jobs, right through to the education system and effective career guidance and to managing transitions between education and further education, training and employment.<\/p><p>We advise that all of those areas need attention.  One of the critical areas, however, on which the NDA has advised previously is the importance of employer engagement in the form of giving employers the support, advice and information they need to feel confident they can employ persons with disabilities.  This is about ensuring they understand and can see the business case for employing people with disabilities but also that they are tooled up or have capacity built to provide reasonable accommodations.  We have research and guidance ourselves in this area but we know that IHREC itself will be developing a code of practice for employers and we will have some guidance in this area with some of those practical supports as well.  One other area I will highlight before finishing is the need for a co-ordinated national programme of supported employment for people who might need additional supports in employment, be it a job coach or assistance with the employer liaison piece.  While some service providers are providing these supports locally or on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis, there is certainly no consistency of approach and no national support for same.  A number of Departments have committed to a policy in supported employment and we advise on the importance of moving to implementation as early as possible in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2020111100002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aideen Hartney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":394,"content":"<p>The attitude of the State and how it does business needs to change.

If a person does not live in a safe, comfortable way with supports, then how can he or she access education or employment opportunities?  I would add that in my experience, we cannot continue this paternal attitude to disabled people whereby we preface every policy or statement with \"supported\".

IHREC mentioned a roadmap to that and I am interested in hearing further comment on it.  I tried to press the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, at our meeting last week but unfortunately it is not due to commence until after the first report.  I seek some more practical information on a roadmap because it is very useful and is something that could be brought forward as well.  I am happy that the topics which have been mentioned, especially by Dr. McDonagh, were raised so early in the meeting.  Access for persons with disabilities in County Clare is very difficult because a lot of the county is rural.  Consequently, transport and even access to housing are a major issue there.  Do the witnesses have an input regarding congregated settings?  At present, I know of five young adults who are in nursing homes and should not be.  They do not want to be there and in a way they are confined to their rooms from morning to night because they cannot access the treatments or even activities because of their disabilities.  I wanted to mention that because it is of deep concern within the county and I am trying my best to work with the agencies to see if a solution can be found.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses touched on the attitudinal issues we have in this country.  That is hugely important because information and awareness is great but the question of how we tackle the attitudinal issues we have in this country remains.

Overall, the commission is concerned about the State's record on ratifying and reporting on human rights treaties, not just the CRPD but all of the treaties.  Ireland was the last member state to ratify the UNCRPD and we are one of only six EU states which had yet to ratify the optional protocol at the end of 2019.  The State is routinely late in reporting; for example, the State combined its fifth to ninth reports under the UN International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination when reporting in 2018, a gap of nearly ten years.  Therefore, in seeking a roadmap I would ask for detail, detailed phases, plans and deadlines for implementation.  The problem we have is when these deadlines are pushed out.  For example, the report due in April is now to come out by the end of this year.  It is not just the report that is delayed but the lives of those people whose rights continue to be unrealisable because of this delay.  As such, it is not just the report that is being delayed and it is important that when those roadmaps are set out that this is clearly established and that those people and the Department are held to the roadmap they set out.  As I said, it is very encouraging to hear that but it is very important to hold bodies to account.<\/p> <p>  On the other points the Deputy mentioned on the attitudinal piece, I emphasise again that the committee's experience of monitoring the implementation of the UNCRPD is something members themselves should use as a learning opportunity.  Members should become exemplars in terms of their own attitudes to people with disabilities and to disability itself.  Members will then start to see that they will develop the language, ideas and attitudes to start to change from here outwards.  The committee should, in particular, be looking to implement ways to put into effect Article 4(3) of the UNCRPD, which allows for effective participation, which should then become the norm across the Oireachtas.  There is no reason for this to be the only committee engaging with people with disabilities and fully facilitating them to have their voice heard.  That is one thing I would say is really important and the committee should just get stuck into the convention itself.  I have a dog-eared copy of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, the founding legislation for our body, that I carry with me everywhere I go and I feel committee members should all carry dog-eared copies of the CRPD with them.  They should all really get to know it, get stuck into it and understand it.

There are questions about whether it is adequate and if it needs to be amended and improved.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the mental health issue, there have been real concerns about the lack of proper statutory independent advocacy services, as was promised under action 60 of the national disability inclusion strategy for adults and children with mental health concerns in hospitals.<\/p> <p>  The other key area that I wanted to focus on is article 19, on living independently and being included in the community.  I have strong views on being included in the community.  The witnesses know that I am strongly supportive of the Community Participation (Disability) (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that was before the last Seanad.  On living independently, I know the NDA has monitored the move away from congregated settings, but it seems to have been monitoring moving to smaller units of ten persons or less.  What progress is happening not just in moving from larger to smaller congregated settings, but to actual independent living and supporting that?  In terms of any comments on the Rebuilding Ireland strategy and the action plan for housing, is that properly and fully engaging with the need for more independent living options for those with a disability?  I note that the NDA commented on universal design.  Is it satisfied with the level of engagement on universal design in that strategy?<\/p> <p>  I know that there have been issues with accessibility of public services in the past when services were being procured.  This arose with regard to transport.  Will the witnesses comment on procurement and the importance of public duty, and equality and human rights carrying forward into the area of procurement?<\/p> <p>  Arising from what Dr. McDonagh said about abuse, are there any views about adult safeguarding legislation?

We agree that the Mental Health Act is overdue for reform.  Our understanding is that heads of Bill are currently under review, so hopefully that process will accelerate.  There are a number of actions related to mental health committed to in the national disability inclusion strategy.  To date, the NDA has found that reporting on progress has not been as detailed as might be hoped.  We have suggested that it might be useful to have a thematic meeting of the national disability inclusion strategy steering group chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, so that there can be more detailed interrogation of those actions and progress on them.<\/p> <p>  There are some amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act working their way through the system.<\/p><p>The NDA has developed codes of practice to facilitate the implementation of the legislation and we have transferred those draft codes to the director of the decision support service.  Again, it is about offering practical guidance to all sectors and groups that might be impacted by the legislation.  We understand the codes will be issued for public consultation shortly.  We very much look forward to progress in that regard.<\/p><p> Senator Higgins mentioned the review we are carrying out on the costs and benefits of new models of service in terms of moving away from complicated settings.  Our research is focusing on units of four or less, as per the policy Time to Move on from Congregated Settings.  We are aware and accept that there are settings that are not in line with that policy and that have between five and nine persons but we have examined the transformative effect of a move to the community.  The research will be published by the end of the year.  It is pointing to very positive outcomes for people with disabilities when they are moved out of a congregated setting and supported within the community.  The HSE, which is implementing the policy, agrees with our research finding pointing to a continuum of change.  It is hoped that if people now moving into homes with three or four are supported and capacity is built over time, bearing in mind that many people have been in settings for decades, those people will in a few years reach a point where they could move to living independently in the community in a unit for one person or more, if that is what they choose.<\/p><p> Universal design is an important aspect of public procurement.  It is a concept in respect of which we promote and advise at all times to see it come through.<\/p><p> That was only a whistle-stop tour of some of the areas on which the Senator touched but I would be more than happy to go into the detail or engaged further in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2020111100002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aideen Hartney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I might just touch on the legislative gaps.

We have clearly identified where the legislative gaps are.  What is needed is not a departure but progress on legislation and policy to give effect to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  That is what this committee must oversee.  The ticking clock image is appropriate in that the legislation is on the books and needs to be enacted.<\/p> <p>  Some Members of the Houses may see that some of the legislation we have touched on is quite recent and ask whether we really need to review it.

The public sector equality and human rights duty has a great part to play in bringing about change within the public sector, particularly in respect of the topics we have already touched on, such as access to public services like transport and access to employment.  It is really interesting to see how we can apply it in the area of procurement.  This is being done in the Scottish jurisdiction, whereby the public sector duty has been used for procurement in the public sector to inform a more balanced approach to procurement that does not just take account of value for money but also the human rights and equality record of the provider or contractor.  It can positively reward contractors and businesses with good records that are contracted by the public services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2020111100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>It is lovely to see Senator Higgins.

I am looking for more information about the public attitude survey that the NDA is planning for 2022 and how it will be carried out.  I am conscious that we are postponing the census.  I am hopeful that this survey can go ahead as planned despite Covid.<\/p> <p>  One of the interesting points Ms Gibney made was that this should not be the only committee that has people who have disabilities coming before it as a matter of routine.  I fully agree with that.  Along with some of my colleagues, including Deputy Murnane O'Connor and Senator Seery Kearney, I sit on the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  After what Senator Higgins and Dr. McDonagh have said, I am happy to recommend that we have people with disability before the housing committee to talk to us about accessible housing, housing adaptation and the independent housing needs for people with disability.  The last point has been well explained today.<\/p> <p>  I fully appreciate the points made by Dr. McDonagh around the need for more people with disability to reach the higher ranks in public life.  I am sure the work she is doing is not only breaking down barriers and silos but inspiring people around her and the next generation of people with disability as well.  Dr. McDonagh said she does not believe that she has disability advocates in senior roles, but I want to say that she does.  She has advocates in this room.  Every Deputy and Senator here today is an advocate for people with disabilities.  We are all committed to ending the policy stagnation that Dr. McDonagh spoke so passionately about.<\/p> <p>  In my last job before I became a Deputy I was in charge of the diversity and inclusion strategy for a multinational corporation.  One of the best things I was ever involved in was the creation of internships for people with intellectual disability.

It is important to have lived experience, but the establishment of a committee would allow the Oireachtas to identify well in advance these issues as they arise.  It would allow for proper participation and engagement with people.  I realise that the emergency legislation that was put in place in response to Covid happened in a very quick timeframe, but those kinds of mechanisms being in place would allow the Oireachtas to have that consultation and proofing built in, similar to the equality budgeting that we see in development.

As has been mentioned, there is not one single Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas who has disabilities.  As has been said, all of these problems existed before Covid but this has really highlighted them.  For resources to be going into things that we already know, oftentimes, as a society, we have made the mistake of telling people what is best for them without asking them.  Those resources could be going into things that perhaps may result in them being better spent.  As a committee, I hope we do not follow suit.<\/p> <p>  In every question we come back to the emphasis on and importance of ratifying the optional protocol.

That committee has been going through the CRPD article by article with in-depth exploration of what that looks like.  It is just a question, I would argue, of keeping that pressure on.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the participation piece, again it is in the convention.  Really it is about opening up the doors and being open.

I am doing a great deal of talking but it seems reasonable, given that I have a lived reality.  That said, in order to contribute to the committee's analysis, I ask us all to reflect on the fact that Ireland has an appalling record and relationship with disabled people.  I am thinking of the Ryan report, disabled children and all the issues with the mother and baby homes.  Many women with learning disabilities were shoved into the homes.  Those of us who were not adopted were usually disabled.  In more recent times, there has been the awful experience of women living in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  All those issues have subsided in the minds of politicians and in mainstream Ireland, but for disabled people, those memories and realities go on each day that the optional protocol is delayed.<\/p> <p>  We also need a shift in our language and to acknowledge that ableism is a form of discrimination that we experience.  Ableism has been a tool in how legislation relating to disabled people is written and how we think about disabled people.  We see it in the media and on our national airwaves, so we need a much more dynamic approach with a stronger focus on human rights.  Other than family members, if any, how many disabled people sat beside the members of the committee when they were sitting their leaving certificate or their finals in college?

I found them very engaging, especially that of Dr. McDonagh.

That is so important.  We were talking earlier about inviting guests to our meetings in the coming weeks.  It is important that we hear from disabled persons' organisations.  As somebody said to me during the week, it is really important to have an organisation of disabled people rather than one for disabled people.<\/p> <p>  Many speakers mentioned a change in mindset, which is absolutely needed for all of us.  There are many standards and various items of legislation, but in many cases they are not enacted, regulated or monitored.  The Disability Act has been in place since 2005 and there are various regulations for buildings, but there is no guarantee that buildings are accessible.  The Irish Wheelchair Association carried out a survey that found that 77% of respondents still felt that certain buildings were inaccessible.  Online systems and technology are used more and more frequently, never more so than during Covid, but it does not suit everybody to use an online system.  Someone who has a visual impairment told me they needed to use the phone but people working in public services were not answering the phones because they were working from home and the phones were not being monitored or the calls were not being transferred.  We need continuously to think about including everybody but we do not do that.  It is important and it is what the committee needs to do.<\/p> <p>  Many of the points I had intended to make have been made and I agree with them, but there are a few further questions I wish to ask, one of which relates to education.  I was a teacher before I was elected.  What is the delay in the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act being fully commenced?  I often talk to parents who have known their child has had a learning difficulty from early on in life, or perhaps the teacher in the school has realised, and the child goes to have an assessment but that takes years unless the parent has the money to pay for it.  When the child finally has the assessment, whichever way it happens, he or she goes to access whatever therapy is needed, such as speech and language or occupational therapy, and there is another waiting list.  The parents of these children or young adults say they have to fight for everything throughout their lives, but they should not have to.  People should be entitled to whatever needs they have.  The earlier that interventions can be made in some cases, the better.<\/p> <p>  The other matter that concerns me is the move away from congregated settings.  It was supposed to be the case that by 2016, we would have closed congregated settings, but that was changed to reducing their use by one third by 2021 and to closing them eventually.  According to HIQA, there are still almost 3,000 people in congregated settings and that does not count all the young people in nursing homes.  How long will that process take?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2020111100002#J00400","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":430,"content":"<p>With the agreement of members, we will take questions from Deputy Canney next before taking the final two speakers.

I said last week at our previous meeting that, as a politician, when I meet people I sometimes come across matters that I am not proud of.  That is something I want to change, as does every member of the committee.  We can do it with our guests' input, experiences and in light of the fact that they know what they are talking about because they are living through the experience.  We need to hear all of that.  As Deputy Tully noted in respect of education and children seeking services, getting the assessment right and then trying to meet the consultants and so on, it is a battle from day one.  I have come across children who have been diagnosed as having a condition from birth but still they have to prove they have it every time they apply for something.  They have to do it again and again and it is a grind.  I have a bee in my bonnet about that.<\/p><p>Having listened to our guests' presentations, I will not ask them any questions.  A plethora of legislation needs to be enacted.  Some of it was mentioned in the presentations and spoken about.  As legislators, we have a hell of a job to do.  Under the chairmanship of Deputy Michael Moynihan, we will do what we can.  The Minister and the Minister of State appeared before the committee last week and they too have an attitude of wanting to make a difference.  We are working with them, as opposed to anything else, but we will also keep everybody accountable.  I will not hold up our guests further other than to say we will talk to them all again.  It is important that we do that because it is not a case of them just having their day in the sun before the committee, telling us what is wrong and then going away, where it would fizzle out.

The committee members will be seeing us again, there is no question.<\/p> <p>  I will reply to a couple of points raised by Deputy Tully, particularly those around education.  The Education for Persons with Special Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004 is not fit for purpose.  It is outdated and needs reform based on consultations with people with disabilities and their families.  It needs to look at each individual's potential rather than the educational setting into which they are being put.  That again plays into the mindset shift and looking at these matters differently.<\/p> <p>  I cannot answer the question as to why the legislation has been delayed, except to say that we are as frustrated as is the Deputy at that.  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was due for commencement but died with that particular Oireachtas in 2016 and has not come back onto the legislative programme.  It is up to this committee to get that pressure on all those different items of legislation.<\/p> <p>  Turning to congregated settings, we have used our legal powers over a number of years in relation to people's dignity and other rights in institutional settings, in particular with respect to the rights of wards of court and the distinction between voluntary and involuntary detention.  I mentioned, for example, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, OPCAT, and the legislation to commence that protocol is important because it allows us to be appointed as the national preventative mechanism.  I believe it was Senator Seery Kearney who mentioned the need to look at issues before they arise and identifying them before they become issues.  OPCAT would allow us to look at situations where the people involved do not have the capacity to decide whether they are being held in an institution.  It allows us to monitor their rights and make sure they will not be transgressed in any way.  Those are some of the things I would say around congregated settings.  There are significantly higher death rates for people with disabilities related to the higher rates identified for vulnerable people living in long-term care settings, including nursing homes.  That is a vital issue at which we look.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2020111100002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I thank members for their questions.

We need to act in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2020111100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rosaleen McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for their engagement.

Dr. McDonagh mentioned shame and stigma earlier and she recognises that some people feel those things.  I am really pleased to hear what she has said.

It is wonderful that we have Dr. McDonagh as an advocate for those who do not have the opportunity to advocate for themselves.  I thank her for that because there are not enough advocates.<\/p><p>I was struck when Dr. McDonagh was talking about the ableist view of things.  We often hear about white privilege and it had not really occurred to me that I have a privilege but now, listening to Dr. McDonagh, I understand that I do.  As a part of that privilege comes a responsibility to help those who do not the privilege I enjoy in terms of being an abled person.<\/p><p>I agree with what she said to the effect of &quot;nothing about us without us&quot;.  The voice of people with disabilities has to be front and centre and at the heart of everything that we do.  I was involved in the lobby for the EPSEN Act in 2004 because it came after the Special Olympics World Games in which I was involved in 2003.  We have to fight for the full commencement of that legislation.  I would be interested in Dr. McDonagh's advice as to how we can ensure progress in that regard.<\/p><p>While looking for educational opportunities for those with disabilities, I am conscious that we also need to look at how we can educate others and students in our schools about those with disabilities.  I know a wonderful mum, Ms Amanda Kehoe, who has a young son in a wheelchair.  Not finding any material available, she wrote her own book, <i>The Adventures of TJ and his Wheelable Chair<\/i>.  She contacts schools, goes around to them and gives reading lessons in order that students have the opportunity to learn about another perspective and how important it is that we encourage our young children and students to think about the ability of the person who has a disability.<\/p><p> The recommendations that the commission made for our terms of reference are worthwhile, in particular on direct engagement and the diversity of people with disabilities.  As we know, disability takes many forms.  Life can be particularly difficult for those who do not manifest visual signs of disability.<\/p><p> I also appreciate the recommendations for our work programme.  I would like to ask the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission about the timeline for Ireland's first report on the UNCRPD.  I also want to ask the witnesses about the reporting schedule.  That is important.  We have to take a rights-based approach.  That is enshrined in this and is very different from the model we had.

Cork City Council closed some streets to provide for more on-street dining.  This resulted in the closure of some disabled parking spaces and the opening of new ones.  In the new spaces, cars opened onto the road and did not have access to footpaths.  When we engaged with the city council on the matter, it seemed to be willing to deal with the issue.

We have advised the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage that if it wanted to start incrementally, at least 30% of any new social housing development should be done in that way.

Dr. Hartney has covered the legislative piece.<\/p> <p>  In response to housing, those measures are welcome but it is the same response I would have as to the employment piece earlier.  Such a systemic change needs to happen that I do not think we need to focus on one piece.  Instead, we need to think about accommodation needs.  There are many different issues around housing.  One example is that housing for older adults with intellectual disabilities is simply not facilitated.  People are passed from pillar to post between local authorities and the services they work with.  Ultimately, there seems to be a State mentality that older parents will care for their children with disabilities until those parents die and, if they are lucky, those people will be facilitated by the State after that.  That is shocking and probably affects hundreds and thousands of families in the country.  It is a question of going back to the UNCRPD and looking at it at a more systemic and wholesome level.<\/p> <p>  I will be happy to follow up on Deputy Gould's question on local authorities but I do not have a best-in-class example that comes to mind immediately.  I will follow up on that, however.  I would encourage the committee and people in local authorities to consider using the public sector equality and human rights duty to push for change in local authorities and for accessibility in their local environs.  All local authorities have a duty to consider the human rights and equality considerations of all of their functions, of their service provision and of their employment practices.  That has been on the books since 2014.

It is a pleasure to be able to address the committee, and I am delighted to be sharing the platform with Dr. Day and Professor Barrett to provide an insight into the future of Europe, an important topic on which I have been working since I was awarded the Charlemagne Prize for research in the city of Aachen in November last year.  My remarks will be based on \"Possible Avenues for Further Political Integration in Europe\", a report I was asked to write by the European Parliament constitutional affairs committee and which was published in June.  I commend it to the House for consideration.<\/p> <p>  I will speak around three points: first, that Covid-19 increases the urge for reforming the EU, second, that the Conference on the Future of Europe constitutes a major opportunity for reforming the EU and third, the challenges ahead and the importance of keeping open all avenues to further political integration in the EU.<\/p> <p>  The pandemic has increased the need for EU reform in two ways.  Initially, we witnessed the EU's weaknesses.  In the early phases of Covid-19 the EU and its member states were weak and disorganised in putting together a response to the health crisis.<\/p><p>That pointed out some of the shortcomings of the current EU system of governance.  Subsequently the EU managed to take important steps, particularly following the Commission proposal for a recovery plan.  However, these steps also increased the need for reform because the recovery plan creates an urge for increasing the effectiveness of the EU but also the legitimacy of the EU if we are to go in the direction of substantially increasing the powers of EU institutions in taxing and spending.  In this context, the Conference on the Future of Europe represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to push the project of European integration forward and to renew the EU.<\/p><p> As the committee will be well aware, the idea of establishing a conference on the future of Europe goes back to a proposal by the French President, Emmanuel Macron, in March 2019.  Since then, all EU institutions have supported the initiative.  The Parliament and the Commission in particular have strongly endorsed the plan for the conference and the Council for the European Union has also supported the initiative.  We are waiting for the three institutions to come together and outline their visions for the conference mandate in a joint declaration but it is already possible to emphasise that the conference represents an out-of-the-box initiative with lots of potential.  It is akin to several illustrious precedents, namely the Convention on the Future of Europe exactly 20 years ago, as well as further back in the history of the EU, to the Conference of Messina, for example.  Both of those events were crucial in relaunching integration at moments of crisis and serve as possible templates for the conference itself.<\/p><p> Nevertheless, we must be mindful of the obstacles ahead.  If the conference wants to be ambitious and to achieve its objectives, it will face challenges.  A phrase which is often taboo in conversations on Europe is \"treaty change\".  If the conference wants to really tackle the institutional and substantive shortcomings of the current EU system of governance it will have to deal with treaty change, yet everyone here will be well aware of the difficulties that avenue would raise because of the problem of unanimity.  Amendments to the treaties of the European Union require unanimous consent by the Governments of member states and then they have to be ratified unanimously by all member countries.  Yet, this problem has also been recently addressed, particularly in the context of the euro crisis, by an increasing tendency of member states to use treaties outside the framework of the EU to push integration further.  This practice of separate intergovernmental agreements, which has emerged in the context of the EMU, represents a potential pathway forward.  I am thinking of agreements such as the European fiscal compact, the European Stability Mechanism and the intergovernmental agreement on the single resolution, which have used for the first time in the history of European integration a rule that the treaties themselves would enter into force not after unanimous approval by the signatory states but on the basis of super-qualified majority ratification rules.  That potentially also opens up a pathway for the Conference on the Future of Europe.  That is what I was specifically asked by the European Parliament to consider in my report.  I suggested that the conference could consider drafting a new treaty, which I call a political compact, with new rules on its entry into force which would overcome the problem of unanimity.<\/p><p>As I am speaking to the Oireachtas, let me make one point very clear.  Ireland has had a complicated tradition of ratifying new treaties in the past but today, clearly, I do not think Ireland will be the country that could face problems.  The support for the EU following Brexit has never been so high in the nation, so the question or the challenge of unanimity votes in the ratification of new treaty amendments, in my view, mostly comes from other member states of the EU, particularly countries which, as the committee knows, are backsliding in respect of the rule of law and democracy.  That poses a major threat to the future of Europe because the EU could really be blocked by nations who are sliding towards illiberalism, and I do not think we can afford that.<\/p><p> The idea of a political compact as a possible outcome of the conference on the future of Europe is essentially a way to renew the Union after Brexit and Covid-19.  It is important, as we discuss the underlying importance of renewing and relaunching integration, that we also think of what might be possible avenues to achieve that in the long term.<\/p><p> I will stop my remarks there.  I very much look forward to the conversation with committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Federico Fabbrini","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Fabbrini.

I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the committee today.  It is very important that we find a way to discuss the future of the EU with our citizens and especially to listen to how they would like to see the EU develop in the coming years.  Brexit has shown us all how much we have to gain from our membership of the EU but it has also revealed how little people understand about how it works in practice.  Of course, the EU will need to change and adapt as it tackles future challenges and it is clear it will only be able to do so effectively if it carries the majority of citizens with it.  It is clear to everybody that Brexit has shown us the perils of citizen detachment and disillusion.<br\/><br\/>Having said that, it will not be easy to arrange an EU-wide series of debates and even harder to find the common threads between the different national and regional debates.  As Professor Fabrini said, this will have to be done in a time of pandemic, which has the effect of hampering face-to-face meetings.  However, the fact that most people are now used to working and communicating online may offer a way to reach more people if we can get the model right.  I am currently chairing the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on gender equality, and we have moved it online to be able to continue our work.  I would be happy to share some of that experience this morning, if that might be useful.<br\/><br\/>I have provided a written statement and I would like to summarise some of the points in it, and in particular to respond to some of the questions indicated for discussion today.  First, we have already had some very active citizens dialogues in Ireland.  They provided rich feedback, which is still valid today, so we should build on them.  As many citizens as possible should be encouraged to participate in this coming debate.  One of the advantages of doing the consultation online is that the physical limits on meeting spaces and travelling to meetings no longer apply.  Many webinars now host well over 1,000 attendees in different locations.<br\/><br\/>Turning to what the conference should focus on, in my view, we need to reverse the previous ways of doing this.  Previously, decisions were prepared in long meetings of official representatives and the outcome was then put to the people, who were asked to endorse it.  This time, the EU should try hard to first reach out to its citizens and to listen to them.  Ideally, the output of the conference would be clear guidance to decision makers on what the citizens of the EU see as priorities for future EU action, where they do not want to see the EU involved and an indication of where citizens are open to change or willing to compromise on the <i>status quo<\/i>to get the EU to where they want it to be.<br\/><br\/>To try to deliver useful results, the conference needs both a pan-EU dimension and a way of reflecting national differences.  For the pan-EU part, a list of topics for discussion across all member states could be agreed at EU level, and we know France and Germany have suggested their list.  Then each country could add additional points to reflect its own particular take on the EU.<\/p><p>The exact format of the debate should be left to each member state to decide.  As I have just mentioned, here in Ireland, we have been developing citizens&rsquo; assemblies as a way of testing the views of our citizens, but in other countries they do things differently.  To give a valid reflection across Europe, it will be important to allow room for national customs and practices.<\/p><p> I feel very strongly that the debate should be guided by substance and that processes and procedures should take a back seat.  Treaty change is an instrument to enable the EU to act in certain areas, but as I have said, I think we first need to listen to citizens about what more - or less - integration they want to see in the future.  Then we need to check and see whether the things they say they want can actually be accommodated within the existing treaties, and if not, only then should treaty change be considered.  I say this for two reasons, first, because I think any focus on treaty change from the start would give a bureaucratic impression of the purpose of the Conference on the Future of Europe and would inevitably be seen as yet another project of the Brussels elites.  Moreover, I think it would be very difficult to get treaty change ratified in all 27 member states in any realistic timeframe.  This is because we have changes of government very regularly across the EU and because there is a tendency to see referendums as judgments on the government of the day rather than on the issues that underpin them.<\/p><p> National parliaments could play their role through participating in national and regional discussions and providing information on EU topics, because they are best placed to be able to put EU issues into the national context.  Once the national debate has concluded, national parliaments could again help to explain the views of their fellow citizens to other parliaments, other member states and the EU institutions.<\/p><p> In my view, citizens&rsquo; recommendations could be decided by simple majority voting during the national debates.  Once the recommendations have been gathered, they could be presented in a report to the steering group of the conference.  Governments and national parliaments should have the opportunity in parallel to indicate which of their citizens' recommendations they support and to explain if there are recommendations they do not support.  In the end, the outcome of the process will be decided by the Council and European Parliament, and in some cases through referendum in different member states, but the citizens&rsquo; influence should have a strong bearing on the future direction of policy.<\/p><p> I hope that the planned conference will help to spark a new debate about the EU and bring more citizen buy-in and support for future developments.  If, in the end, the outcome is a set of recommendations that require treaty change, then we know we will have a referendum here.  That in itself should be a strong motive for Ireland to invest in the process and to ensure that our population will be ready to engage fully in whatever next steps the EU will decide to take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Catherine Day","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":462,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I thought I would go through a few basic ideas and some of the questions and follow up on what my fellow speakers have said.<\/p> <p>  As we know, the idea of a Conference on the Future of Europe has been a long time in the brewing.  It was mapped out as a possible path by then Commission President Juncker in March 2017 in his White Paper on the future of Europe and, of course, a lot of water has passed under the bridge since that time, with Brexit, the rule of law crisis in eastern Europe and the coronavirus crisis.  The present phase was kicked off in July 2019 by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in her inaugural address in which, and this may be interesting for the committee to recall, she entrusted responsibility to particular Commissioners - Vice President Suica, Vice President Sefcovic and Vice President Jourov&aacute;.  The fact there are high-ranking Commissioners involved in this might give ideas for future guests to be invited in on this particular topic.<\/p><p>The basic idea of this conference is that it would be an opportunity for a thorough reflection on the direction of the European Union and its institutional set-up.  This body would look at the medium to long-term future of the EU and what reforms should be made to its policies and institutions.  In other words, it would be an opportunity to engage in a more structured debate with the aim of improving the functioning of the European Union not only in terms of institutional dynamics but also its policies.  Things really got going at the end of last year.  In October 2019 we had the European Parliament's Conference of Presidents, which made proposals to the Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs.  The various institutions have come forward with their proposals.<br\/><br\/>As regards where the debate has gotten to, it had been expected that a joint declaration would kick off the event at this stage but we have experienced a lot of delay.  One of the reasons for that is the Covid pandemic.  Apart from Covid, there is also the difficulty of the failure to agree on who should share the conference.  It is also fair to mention that there is a degree of scepticism in some member states about this process.  It has been described as involving varying degrees of enthusiasm so there is that to consider as well. <br\/><br\/>I will turn very quickly to the questions, although Dr. Day has already dealt with some of them.  For example, there is the issue of whether the Conference on the Future of Europe should build on the work of the previous citizens' dialogue on the future of Europe.  The Council has explicitly suggested that this be the case and yet there is some ambivalence about the outcome of that dialogue and some feel that it has not led to anything in particular.  There have been various attempts to involve the citizenry in debate about European matters and they have all had their limits.  There is also a feeling that an <i>ad hoc<\/i>body like this might not be enough in and of itself in to involve the citizenry and that we might need a more permanent mechanism at some stage.  The idea of involving the citizenry is to get a kind of bottom-up dialogue and yet this is coming from above and it is the institutions that are initiating this debate.  We will have to see how well it works.  It is not absolutely clear that it will work but we will see and we will remain optimistic.  The problem of the democratic deficit at European level springs eternal.  It is certainly a very interesting idea.  I am particularly interested also in the idea of six Citizens' Assemblies or agoras which would deliberate throughout the conference process.  It is an interesting and novel idea.  Dr. Day made reference to the fact that she is chairing a Citizens' Assembly herself and a lot of attention will be paid to the Irish experience in that regard, as it is seen as having been very successful.<br\/><br\/>One of the questions was about what format the conference should take and how it should be organised.  The best way of thinking about this is to think of three broad issues.  We need to think of its mandate and whether it should it be broad or narrow, focus more on policies or on institutional proposals and competence issues, or, indeed, on both of those.  Without a mandate for clear proposals it will just replicate existing and rather inconclusive forms of citizen engagement, rather like the citizens' dialogues.  It might run the danger of just being reduced to a communications exercise.  We need to bear in mind that it needs a clear mandate.  It also requires wide participation and deep deliberation.  That is very important.  One good proposal is that its composition should look like the Convention on the Future of Europe and thus involve representatives of national parliaments in its deliberations.  That would be important and would obviously be of relevance to this committee.  Its follow-up should be important as well.  It would be useful if not just the Commission but the institutions generally committed to delivering on legislative proposals that emerge from this conference and also to initiating debate on changing the treaties, based on all the proposals that come out of this conference.<br\/><br\/>The role of national parliaments was referred to by Dr. Day as well.  It is crucial that national parliaments play a role in this regard.<\/p><p>The involvement of national parliaments creates transparency, attracts attention and creates a framework in which MEPs can transmit the outcome of deliberations and results to national capitals, transferring the debate from European to international level.  It allows national perspectives to be tapped into and it is one means whereby a large variety of different views and options can be taken into account.<\/p><p> Deliberative democracy and citizens' dialogue are very important but there is a continuing role for national parliaments.  They can play a big role in the organisation of the conference and participating in the conference.  Here at home, one useful idea I have implicitly referred to would be to invite the Commissioners, Dubravka &Scaron;uica, Vra Jourov&aacute; and Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi.  It would be useful to bring them in and, in that way, bring this debate to national level.  Various types of parliamentary involvement can take place.  One of the most important ones is for the national parliament to become a debating arena on the major issues and that would be an important role.  To a certain extent, the Oireachtas can follow its own lead in regard to Brexit, in which the Seanad invited in various speakers on various issues.  This committee could perform that role.<\/p><p> Another question was how events held as part of the conference can reach the broadest range of citizens.  That is probably the biggest challenge for the citizens' dialogue.  The use of technology is important and keeping everything online and viewable is important.  They have a multilingual online platform.  Covid imposes severe difficulties in terms of participation.  I suggest delaying it until the vaccine could take effect but that is not realistic at this stage.  We need to get moving on this. <\/p><p> As to whether treaty change should form part of the conclusions, if the committee discusses institutional issues, it is pretty much inevitable that we will get treaty change coming on the agenda.  Certain member states, including Ireland, have been reportedly unenthusiastic about the prospect of treaty change because that involves a referendum here, with all the risks that entails, particularly in this age of bots and all kind of shenanigans going on in respect of Internet interference in elections and referendums.  If institutional issues are discussed and wished to be acted upon by the member states, then we are probably looking at referendums in due course.  We need to be careful on this.  It is not like the Convention on the Future of Europe.  It is not intended to lead directly to treaty change.  It is intended to culminate in a report to the European Council and then it has to be decided where things will go from there.  It will not directly lead to treaty change and yet I think it will be the process that will initiate that.<\/p><p> There are many issues and the ultimate outcome of the conference depends on the focus of the issues.  The General Affairs Council has had its own ideas on what issues should be addressed.  Other issues have pushed themselves onto the agenda by the force of events such as health, fiscal policy and, to a certain extent, the spitzenkandidaten system for choosing the Commission president.  Individual state have their own priorities.  There will be a broad division between policy issues and institutional reform.  The impact of the conference will depend on the balance that is reached by those within the conference.<\/p><p> I have probably said enough.  I have gone over a number of issues and I know to some extent overlapping what has been said but we will look forward to the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Gavin Barrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I thank our three speakers.  It has been quite illuminating.  Professor Fabrini highlighted complacency issues as one of the shortcomings of the current EU Government.  The convention was suggested as far back as 2016 as a response to Brexit and the soul-searching that Brexit provoked.<\/p><p>Ms Day touched on it slightly in her presentation.  We are in 2020 and it will soon be 2021.  Covid happened in 2020.  Is there not complacency around the establishment of the convention?  Does it not sum up where we are that it has taken five years to get what was seen as an emergency response to the disconnect that the Brexit debate suggested?  In the witnesses' view, what is the likely timeline for getting this on the road?  Will it be years or, perhaps, the 10th anniversary of the Brexit vote before we get to some sort of conclusion of the process?  <\/p><p> We are all into the digital side of things.  I welcome that.  We have all transformed but there is huge digital exclusion.  Those who do not engage in online meetings or online classes in education are the people who are excluded from the European Commission, the European Parliament and the EU generally and do not see them as delivering for them or as being relevant in their lives.  In going digital, how do we ensure that we do not further exclude people?  <\/p><p> Professor Fabrini pointed to the EU Council and said it has become mightier in the past number of years but he did not say much about the parliament.  Given that these are the two institutions that represent elected leaders and directly elected members, what role will they play in the process?<\/p><p> My final question is for Ms Day.  It is a little outside of this discussion so I would appreciate some leeway from the Chairman.  Ms Day is a former Secretary General of the Commission.  She succeeded David O'Sullivan in that role.  There is a concern about us no longer having Irish people in that stream.  Irish people are not occupying the types of roles previously occupied by Ms Day, Mr. O'Sullivan and other officials.  Perhaps we all got a little bit complacent about that.  What would Ms Day suggest we should do to try to get back into that stream?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#J00200","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentations.  Before I ask my questions, I echo Deputy Calleary's remarks regarding Irish influence within the institutions.  Ms Day set a high bar for others to follow.  I fear that we do not have the numbers there.  I say that as someone who managed only two years in Brussels and then came home and so I am, in part, responsible.<\/p> <p>  I want to focus on a number of issues that were raised initially by Ms Day but also by Professor Barrett.  The first issue is the role of national parliaments.  There is an understandable focus on the important role of citizens' dialogues, with which I am familiar from a previous life.  That is so important.  In previous lengthy discussions about the future of Europe, the formation of treaties and the draft constitution, the focus was very much on Brussels and the institutions of the EU.  One of the gaps, which Professor Barrett elaborated on, is the role of national parliaments.  This role is even more important than that of citizens' dialogues.  We are the legislators, the elected public representatives and the front-facing part of democracy, be it domestic or European.  There must be a role that is far greater than having debates and discussions like this.  There needs to be a formal decision-making process.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Calleary rightly referred to the importance of the parliament and the centralisation of power within the European Council.  What is the role of a body such as the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC?  Where is the formal involvement of member state parliaments, national and regional, in the next stage of the EU?  Taking in context the different approaches to negotiating trade agreements and the fact that mixed agreements have to go to national parliaments, there is a gap in engaging national parliaments.  We know what happened in terms of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and the Wallonian Parliament.  National parliamentarians no longer attend the European assembly.  That has not happened for decades.  The dual mandate has been removed.  Our MEPs play a vital role.  Many of them engaged with this committee last week and we had a good discussion on this issue.  It comes back to subsidiarity, which is a word I do not like to use but it is central to everything that is done in the EU and how we get what is discussed at a European level translated to citizens.<\/p><p>The key aspect of that is one's national parliament, and for other countries more so than Ireland, regional parliaments.  Professor Fabbrini referenced previous models such as Messina and the lessons that can be learned.  Some of them were successful, but all were not.  Previous discussions that led to a treaty change were successful while others were not.  Were the discussions that led to the Nice and Lisbon treaties successful, in that they were rejected initially by the Irish population, the issues were hijacked and it became about fringe issues rather than the central topics?  We do not have a European constitution.  Following years of top-level work on that by people such as John Bruton and the witnesses, it fell at the first hurdle.  How do we ensure that this does not happen?  We accept that this process may lead to treaty change.  We should not fear that in a post-Brexit era but it does not have to be an inevitability.  Maybe we should park that.  If it comes to that, it comes to that and we will deal with it then.  <\/p><p> I believe that the role of national parliaments from the get-go needs to be focused on identifying the common policies and the gaps in the European process that need to be fixed.  If not for the pandemic, would we be talking about health competencies?  What are the common areas?  We had a really illuminating discussion with our MEPs last week and we are doing some work on the migration and refugee crisis.  Is this as big an issue for us in Dublin as it is for colleagues in, say, the Italian Parliament or the Greek Parliament?  We know it is not.  The same applies in regard to issues around the rule of law and the impact of Brexit.  These are far bigger issues for Ireland than for Bulgaria.<\/p><p> We talk about the importance of citizens' dialogues.  What is important is the outcome of that process and how we deal with issues more fairly.  The Union, I would argue, is stronger now than ever before.  It is more important now than ever before.  The response to Covid has been effective but limited.  It has not been limited by effort but by circumstance and ability.  The budget that was agreed yesterday in the European Parliament is sizeable and has the ability to do a lot of good.  We are, however, great at talking about the EU when we need to blame someone or to criticise.  This happens a lot, but it is not necessarily an issue for the witnesses but for the wider public and particularly parliamentarians in national parliaments.  Where is our responsibility as elected representatives to talk about all the good things?  Where in the national media was the European budget reported yesterday?  Why are we not discussing the co-operation between member states about Romanian doctors going to Italy or French patients going to German hospitals?  Why are we not talking about EU stockpiling and the work that is going on in Finland?<\/p><p> The greatest lesson of Brexit is that if one spends 45 years attacking something, it is very hard to convince people in six weeks the merits of remaining in it.  That is not the fault of the Union.  A lot of people like to point to the institutions not communicating Europe.  I have been critical of the Commission in saying that it could sell itself better.  This process needs to focus on the role of national parliamentarians.  People will generally know how their like Deputy, MP or Assembly member is but they might not know who their MEP is.  They probably do not know the identity of the Commissioner for Agriculture.  That is the difficulty in this process.  I would appreciate the views of all three witnesses on how national parliamentarians could, if not take ownership in this regard, have far more than a consultative role in order that they can push this along in a timeline that I would hope would be a lot more ambitious than years, although I share Deputy Calleary's slight cynicism in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#K00200","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I thank both Deputies for their questions and observations and I invite Professor Fabbrini, followed by Dr. Day, to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#L00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I thank both Deputies for their insightful questions.  I will try to address all of the points they raised with three quick answers from my side.  Deputy Calleary raised the issue of the delay in the process and the timeframe in that regard going forward.  The expectation has always been that the German Council Presidency would be in the position to launch the conference.<\/p><p>Many in the European Parliament and the Commission hoped that this would be the case.  As it is now 11 November, I am not 100% sure that it will happen because of the challenges with the pandemic which Professor Barrett mentioned.<\/p><p> I want to bring the outcome of the latest Council of Ministers in the French Government on 4 November to the attention of the committee.  The French Government has already put forward, in French, a communication on the plans for France's Presidency of the EU Council in the first semester of 2022, which is a little over a year from now.  The French Government has been adamant in saying that it will close the Conference on the Future of Europe on its watch.  That injects some optimism that the process will not be dragged on forever and that we will have time to finalise this initiative and make it more concrete.<\/p><p> Regarding the role of the institutions of the European Council and Parliament, I mentioned in my study for the AFCO community that I think the intergovernmental trends at play in the EU system of governance are worrying and have to be tackled.  What we have witnessed over the last decade is a major difficulty for the European Union in addressing its crises, including the euro crisis, the migration crisis and now the rule of law crisis, the environmental crisis, the issue of enlargement and, of course, the pandemic.  Decisions on these issues have to be taken exclusively in intergovernmental fora.  The EU needs intergovernmental fora but the genius of the original EU constitutional architecture was that intergovernmentalism was balanced out with supranational features.  We need to rediscover that equilibrium and that is why institutional questions need to be part of the plan for the Conference on the Future of Europe.<\/p><p> I thank Deputy Richmond for his questions on this third point.  The Conference on the Future of Europe mirrors or reminds us to some extent of prior initiatives like the Messina Conference or the Convention on the Future of Europe 20 years ago.  Deputy Richmond rightly stated that the convention ended up being a failure.  The treaty establishing a constitution for Europe never entered into force and we had to opt for a back-up solution in the Lisbon Treaty.  That is precisely why we should be thinking about technical but important issues like treaty changes or the procedures we need to put in place to make sure the Conference on the Future of Europe does not fail.  The experience 20 years ago with the Convention on the Future of Europe was that we started discussing substantive issues but we did not really tackle how to make sure those constitutional innovations could enter into force.  I agree with what Dr. Day said about focusing on the substance, what the conference is good for and what important reforms we need to introduce because citizens asked for them.  However, and perhaps I am biased because I am an EU lawyer and see myself as a technician in this, it is crucial that we as elite are also mindful of the institutional challenges connected to this process.  We must make sure we design the conference in such a way that we prevent an expected failure, which would almost certainly be the case if we were to run into the process of treaty amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Federico Fabbrini","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I will respond to a few different points.  For as long as I have been involved with EU issues, there has been a quest by the institutions to convince the citizens of what a wonderful thing the EU is.  There have always been different attempts to find a project that will unite people.  However, the modern world is so complex now that there is not any single reason for such things.<\/p><p>The old post-war reasons of coming together so that never again would European countries go to war with each other does not catch the citizen imagination anymore.  In the age of social media and immediate responses to everything, more than ever there is a need to find a way to have a quiet deliberative contact with citizens.  That is why I think Ireland has something to offer in our experience of citizens' dialogue.  My experience of looking at the previous ones and in the one that I am involved in now is that if one gives people objective information and time to think it through and discuss it, more often than not, they come to very sensible conclusions.  We need to keep trying to have that.  <\/p><p> Post-Brexit, for the small EU countries it is more important than ever that they find a way to explain the EU to their citizens.  We are going to find that need here when the UK is no longer there.  Returning to Ireland after so long in Brussels, I am really struck by how much Ireland is in an Anglosphere.  We hardly ever discuss what happens on the Continent either in terms of politics, issues or even how they do things yet everyone is an expert on the United States, Australia or Canada.  Why is that?  It is because we are caught in an English-speaking environment.  This could be a role for the national parliaments of the smaller countries.  We will not be alone in this.  We will all have to make a much bigger effort to understand the thinking, particularly in France and Germany, but also in looking for alliances with other countries.  One must give to get.  We might have to understand why the northern or eastern countries are so much more focused on issues that we do not think are important.  During Brexit we saw a fantastic united effort by our politicians and our diplomats to fan out across Europe and to explain the Good Friday Agreement and Northern Ireland.  In every foreign ministry in every other member state now there are people who really deeply understand it.  Perhaps we cannot make that effort every time but we need to be building up a bedrock of understanding.  The role of the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC, and the national parliaments will be as much about that as it will be about looking at the legislation, particularly since many EU policies are fairly mature now and there will be much less legislation in future.  What must come in its place is much more discussion about how we tackle different issues together.  Small countries do not have the expertise or the resources of the bigger countries but they often find more pragmatic ways of advancing policy objectives than the bigger countries.  A whole new world is opening up there and we will all miss the expertise of the UK.  Somehow we have to find a way to replace it.<\/p><p> My point on the Anglosphere also relates to Deputy Calleary's question of why there are so few younger Irish people joining the institutions.  One thing is that we were all infected a little by the British media and by rubbishing Brussels as very bureaucratic and not a cool, exciting place to be.  My experience is that is very far from the truth.  It is a fascinating career for anyone.  The second problem is that we are very poor at languages and one must have a second language to get a permanent position in any of the other institutions.  We simply have not worked on that.  Even when people put down Irish as a second language, they regularly fail the test because their Irish is not good enough to qualify as a second language.  We need to talk up the importance of careers in the European institutions but we also need to make sure that people understand that there is a language requirement and perhaps facilitate intensive language courses for people who are candidates for competitions.  One needs to build up an intake at the bottom in order that 20 years later those people come through to the senior levels.  There are also other ways, such as national civil servants spending a few years in the different institutions.  We need to deploy all these things because it will be much harder and much more important in future in the wake of the British departure that we have people who understand the Irish situation, not in any sense taking national instructions, but the reason the institutions are keen on a broad degree of representativity is because one cannot make good laws and policies if one does not understand the national circumstances of each member state.<\/p><p>Those two points are very important.<\/p><p> It is important to try to get people to focus on how the wider EU works.  We all inevitably tend to look at it from our own position.  For example, when something bad happens in the world, very often people ask why did the EU not do something.  We need to have that debate with people and we need to discuss whether we would be willing to give up the principle of unanimity in foreign policy.  If we wait for the last member state to agree on a statement or an action, the EU will never be quick to respond.  We have to take it from the example of what is it that is holding the EU back rather than immediately ask what most people will find an extremely tedious question about whether they are willing to give up unanimity in foreign policy issues.  The lesson that I am learning from the citizens' dialogue is that we have to be willing to explain in ordinary language and ordinary terms, give people time to think about these issues, and then ask them to come to a conclusion.<\/p><p> I will make one further comment on Deputy Calleary's question, and that is about the digital exclusion.  We were quite slow to move the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality online because we were worried about many things, including that.  When we surveyed the members, however, we found that very few of them were not willing to go online.  People were very familiar with Zoom, for example, using it for family quizzes, family get-togethers and all the rest of it.  We offered training to those who were not sure that they could manage.  The reliability of broadband is still an issue, but again most people have managed to overcome that in our experience.  For what it is worth, I do not think the issue of digital exclusion should necessarily be a hamper to having the citizens' dialogue online.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Catherine Day","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":476,"content":"<p>The other speakers have covered a lot of the ground I wanted to.  On Deputy Calleary's question about delay, the original idea was that this process would kick off to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the 1950 Schuman Declaration that launched the European Union, as it were, but it has been delayed for a number of reasons I mentioned, particularly Covid-19 but also the difficulty in getting someone to chair it.  Also, some member states are less enthusiastic than others.  Professor Fabbrini mentioned the hope that has been expressed that this would end by the French Presidency in the first half of 2022.  I doubt, to be honest, the capacity of the member states to get it done by that time.  The Franco-German non-paper of November 2019 anticipated the whole process kicking off in January 2020 and that it would end in the French Presidency.  If we are now in November and it has not kicked off yet, we are really looking at the debate ending, at the earliest, towards the end of 2022 and perhaps even into 2023.  Remember, that only involves a report to the European Council.  After that, there must be an actual debate among the member states on treaty change.  It is going to be a little slower than we would like.  That is not all bad because it gives time for deliberation and thinking, but it lacks the element of urgency or speed that it might otherwise have had.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Calleary also mentioned online exclusion, and Dr. Day mentioned the key reasons for that, and I think it is the absence, for linguistic reasons really, of a single and political space at a European level.  To a large extent, that is something that results in the debate at European level not always coming down to national level.  We do not have one single European political space; we have 27 different political spaces.  Yes, online exclusion is a reality.  There is only an elite of us who can take part in these things.  The Internet is there for all of us, but how many of us actually use it?  We should be grateful that it is there, though, and that it lets those who have an interest get in there, but the problem is generating an interest for the others.<\/p><p>I echo what Dr. Day said.  It will be vital in the context of Brexit, a situation in which we can no longer hold on to the coat tails of the British at this stage of the debate in the UK, that we generate our own debate on the very important European issues out there.<\/p><p> Deputy Richmond raised the very important question of the rule of national parliaments.  With all the focus on citizens' dialogue, it is possible to lose sight of the vital and ongoing role of national parliaments.  In a study of the role of national parliaments by Hafner et al., parliaments were divided into five kinds.  There are those that scrutinise, in other words, consider EU issues at length without necessarily influencing policy debates.  There are debating arenas - chambers that strongly mobilise the chamber through debates on European issues.  There are policy shapers like the Danish Parliament that influence government positions through mandates or scrutiny reserves.  There are Commission watchdogs that participate in the political dialogue and the early warning mechanism - dialoguing with the Commission, if you like.  There are scrutiny laggards that do not do an awful lot.  The actual role of a parliament depends on a lot of factors, including the relative power of the parliament in the national system.  If the national parliament is not very powerful in the national system, it is unlikely to exercise a very strong role in European issues.<\/p><p> Another point that must be made about this is that the role a national parliament is going to have must be both selected and seized.  The Irish Parliament, and Senator McDowell had a lot to do with this, seized the agenda to a certain extent when it came to the role of the Seanad in respect of Brexit by bringing people in and getting interested parties and stakeholders, particularly from Northern Ireland, to talk about Brexit.  It is up to the Oireachtas to seize the agenda and it is up to this committee to a certain level to decide what it wants to do with regard to this conference.  It can play a hugely important role in bringing in interested persons and stakeholders, providing a link between the national debate and the European debate and to that extent, filling in the gap that exists between European and national levels.  However, this is not something that will happen by itself.  It needs to be seized by the scruff of the neck by the Oireachtas and this committee.<\/p><p> COSAC has a role but it is a limited one.  Its role is to put parliamentarians in contact with each other and to a certain extent put them in contact with the ongoing European-level debate.  The focus is really on the national parliaments and what they can do.  The Oireachtas can play a key role in this regard and I very much hope that it seizes it with regard to the conference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Gavin Barrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I join with others in expressing my gratitude for the comprehensive presentations from our three experts.  We covered a lot of ground so I will not re-trample it but I want to get back to a very basic question.  There is a difference of opinion - certainly of emphasis - in the presentations we have received relating to what the conference is for.  Is it a bottom-up exercise asking the citizens of Europe how they envisage the EU in the future or is it the case that these are suggestions for change?  From a democratic perspective, we would say that it should the former.  We ask citizens what they want.  At the same time, I cannot envisage a conference on the future of Ireland asking people what they think Ireland should look like and expecting to receive detailed and rational proposals.  One would get everything so it needs to be focused.<\/p> <p>  In his presentation, Professor Fabrini underscored how the inevitability of further integration is the bedrock of future direction.  That is the view of the French President.  We have a lot of work to do to bring people with us on that journey if that is a view to be realised.<\/p><p>There is almost a view among some that whatever people say, this is the right thing so we must drive the agenda.  That view is doomed to fail in my judgment.<\/p><p> Outside the scope of what we talked about, in respect of one issue that will be on our collective agenda, I would be interested if anybody has any views on a European perspective on governance.  Beginning in the US in the aftermath of the most recent set of elections, there is a view of the future of democracy within the US.  It is obviously a union of states that is not governed on the basis of one person, one vote and each vote being equal.  As we can see, it is possible to lose the popular vote in a presidential election and still win the presidency.  Similarly, as was pointed out in newspaper articles this week, there is more and more urban focus in the future so it is reckoned that in the foreseeable future, 70% of US senators will be elected by 30% of the population.  How does that manifest itself in a European context?  Is there tension relating to the European Council where regardless of whether it is Malta or Germany, everybody has an equal vote?  Is governance an issue we need to grapple with in the future?  We saw one of the fundamental issues in the rejection of the most recent changes.  What had to be fixed related to the removal of a commissioner for every member state.  What is the witnesses' take on future governance of the Union and how democracy is to be manifest in this context?<\/p><p> A citizens' assembly, which was proposed by Eamon Gilmore, has been extremely successful in dealing with significant issues here but it was successful because it was focused on a single theme, be it, marriage equality or the eighth amendment.  Obviously, Dr. Day's own agenda is a wider one and I would be interested in hearing her take on whether a broader focus can work in a citizens' assembly of that type.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#P00200","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Day, Professor Fabrini and Professor Barrett.

Some of this has already been dealt with.  There is significant disengagement from politics.  People have spoken about the US and what happened in Great Britain with Brexit.  Politics on both a domestic and Europe-wide basis has not delivered for certain people and sometimes they will go in directions we do not necessarily want them to go.  We talk about how popular the European project is in this State and across the island but if one went back ten years and more regarding the European methodology for dealing with the banking crisis, one would get a different result on the street in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Professor Fabrini talked about weaknesses.  How does he see some of these being rectified?  I know we talk about pandemic recovery.  We now have conversations about the rule of law and health competencies.<\/p><p>People see there are problems with Europe.  The European Union and we ourselves have had to contravene certain rules to allow for major state intervention to get us through this.  There is a fear of further integration, of the possibility that it is a further drive towards privatisation and against the possibility of state intervention.  There is that wider fear of a European army.<\/p><p> Professor Fabbrini spoke about the intergovernmental pathway.  Perhaps I have taken this the wrong way but there is a possibility with all of that that we could end up with a number of tiers of European interaction and relationships.  We might end up not with a two-tier Europe but one with three or four tiers and I am unsure how exactly that would work.<\/p><p> I really like the idea of engaging with people and asking them what they want while at the same time having very specific conversations.  Anybody who has ever had a public meeting that directly related to people's lives knows it can be very difficult to get people interested in stuff that directly relates to them.  The question for us, and this has probably come up over the last while at state parliaments in general, is that there is a notion that this State has relied on Britain to do much of the due diligence.  There is consequently a need for us to build up capacity to ensure we are on top of what is happening with legislation but also with what the moves are within Europe.  If the witnesses can answer those questions in the next 20 minutes, I will be delighted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#Q00600","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":485,"content":"<p>We will perhaps resume the discussion on the book at the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#R00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":486,"content":"<p>To answer Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s question, it is a book on the withdrawal agreement with a preface by Mr. Michel Barnier.  It was published last week and may perhaps be of interest to the committee as it is the first and most comprehensive book looking at the Brexit deal.<\/p> <p>  Joking aside, I am very happy to address the other points that were raised.  I will start with Deputy Haughey's question.  He hit on one of the big difficulties of the conference which has to simultaneously be a bottom-up process involving citizens but also, necessarily, a top-down exercise where the elite - whatever that means - must identify some for priority issues for change.  Whenever one talks about institutional questions, it is, as has been pointed out many times, really hard to involve the citizens and yet good institutions are crucial for good democracies.  This is why it is inevitable that these questions need to be tackled.  The organisation of the conference will have to find a way to reflect that.  The model of the Convention on the Future of Europe in the early 2000s is potentially the solution to follow.  In that case there would be a relatively small group of people gathering and deliberating but with channels of dissemination at the national level, particularly through the involvement of national parliaments which allow for the involvement of citizens on the ground to discuss those issues.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on governance.  It is crucial that the governance system of the European Union be addressed.  We currently have an architecture for decision-making in Europe which is, to a large extent, the result of incremental developments without much grand design behind it, and we see the limits of that.<\/p><p>We have seen it throughout all the crises we have faced.  We are now stuck in a situation where it is very hard for us, as a Union, to move forward on issues like the environment because states can wield a veto on issues like fiscal capacity and the development of a large recovery plan because states have a veto on own resources in the new multi-annual financial framework, MFF.  Of course, the same applies to foreign policy where Europe remains a dwarf.  It has no capacity to cobble together a single position on conflicts at its back door like the one in Nagorno-Kabarakh.<\/p><p> Addressing those governance weaknesses is, therefore, crucial.  It has been emphasised rightly that this will not be easy and might even lead towards a multi-speed European Union.  We already know that multi-speed is a component of the process.  There is the eurozone, among others, of which Ireland is a key part, not least because the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, is now the president of the Eurogroup, has a very clear and strong leading role on the Economic and Monetary Union, EMU, and eurozone governance.  The eurozone is a sub-club within the whole EU-27 and as we move forward, it might become even more separate and even more integrated.  I mentioned earlier a number of different treaties adopted in the past decade to deepen further the governance of the Economic and Monetary Union, the European Fiscal Compact, the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, the Single Resolution Fund.  That all points towards almost a decoupling of the eurozone and the EU-27.  We are not yet at that point and we could have a long discussion on whether it is positive or not but it is a trend, a trend of decoupling and it is something the Conference on the Future of Europe will also have to consider in its work.  That is why, in my report for the Parliament, I suggested a political compact as an add-on to the fiscal compact to make the EU and specifically the EMU more democratic and effective.<\/p><p> Clearly there are multiple challenges ahead but I would also like to really praise the work of the Oireachtas joint committee on this.  To my knowledge, not many national parliaments have actually started a conversation on those topics, so that puts Ireland in a very good position to influence this.  If one considers also the very positive experience of the citizens' assembly tradition in this country, including the latest exercise led by Dr. Day, this could be an area where the country punches above its weight.  Even if Ireland is a relatively small state among the 27, it actually has many resources.<\/p><p> I mentioned earlier that the overall positive attitude of the population towards the EU following Brexit is an asset.  I encourage the committee to continue its work on this.  I remain very optimistic that Ireland could play a very influential role in those discussions, including building bridges across member states on some controversial issues that will inevitably come up in the discussion about the conference.  I, of course, remain available to assist as we move ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Federico Fabbrini","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Fabbrini and thank him for the compliment as well.

It is very good we are having this discussion and the committee will play a very important role, however the debate begins to shape up.  I agree with Deputy Howlin that there is a need for focus and Professor Barrett mentioned the need for a mandate.  Again, to refer to the Citizens' Assembly, we are working on the basis of a resolution from the Oireachtas.  The D&aacute;il and the Seanad already indicated the topics we should focus on.  I agree with Professor Barrett that part of the success of previous citizens' assemblies was that they focused on very controversial but single issues and they were able to give a clear \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer back to the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>I do not want to comment on the one on gender equality because it is ongoing but I am already seeing that the citizens are hungry for the information and surprised at what they do not know or how the facts differ from what they thought.  That element of providing neutral factual information before the debate, then allowing people to debate it and sometimes to change their opinions, is a valuable process.  We can do it in a small country and are building a kind of tradition of doing it.  It is not necessarily exportable to everywhere else but it is a model that has demonstrated its benefits.<\/p><p> I would not discount the determination of the future French Presidency to close this debate but perhaps it is no bad thing if it takes us a few years to have this discussion, for many reasons.  One of those reasons is that we all know that the world is going to be a very different place in the future.  Another is that I do not think that the EU has begun to take the measure of the departure of the UK.  More countries would have been willing to go further in many areas but were stopped in their tracks because of strong and determined arguments against different issues.  One area where I see future development, which I think would echo with the Irish population, is in the whole area of social policy.  That was an absolute taboo for the UK as long as it was a member of the EU.  Perhaps the fact that it is going to take longer will give a better result in the end.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Howlin who I think was saying that there is no inevitability of getting people on board for further integration.  That is a mistake that has always been made in previous treaty changes.  The insiders, frustrated at what they could not do, felt that it would be obvious to the population that integration had to go further.  I do not think we can take that for granted.  I think in large parts of the European Union people feel, \"Thus far and no further\".  A reason for having a debate with citizens is that one has to bring them the arguments as to why we should go further and see if one can get them to support it.  If one cannot, one must accept that now may not be the time.<\/p><p> We have all been looking at the United States in recent days and, in many ways, it is far less integrated than the European Union, but it functions as a single country.  We are 27 countries that have chosen to pool together certain things but we have still kept things in reserve that we have not chosen to pool together.  It cannot be taken for granted that the inevitable direction of travel is going to be towards closer union.  One of the things that ultimately took the Tories out of the Union was their objection to the idea of an ever closer Union.  That is something that we have to debate and perhaps it needs more time.<\/p><p> There is always a fundamental debate in the EU between representation and efficiency.  I am a very impatient person so I am always trying to look for efficient ways to get things done.  I have learned painfully over the years that one has got to be attentive to the need to ensure proper representation through things such as one Commissioner per country.  I have seen the European Council wrestle with issues where one or two small countries are holding out and the vast majority want to get on with something, but there is respect there for the rights of each individual member.  Of course, the smaller member states have to know when to push something that is very important to them and when to go along with what the others want for the sake of keeping the ship together.  It is a fluid thing.  I do not think it can ultimately be written down in black-and-white treaty language.  <\/p><p> We have, in recent years, been missing any kind of tolerance of the fact that the EU cannot do everything.  It is a level of governance above the national and below the international.  By way of more explanation, we must try to get citizens to understand that at least some of the failings of the EU are because some of its members do not want certain things to happen now.  By debating and explaining, we can get a better understanding and people can say that while they would love to do a particular thing, they understand why their neighbours elsewhere in the EU are having difficulties with it at the moment.  That tolerance and respect for others - which I hope is coming back, as indicated by the results of the US presidential election - can also be a part of the debate.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the issue that the Union may become multi-tiered.  As Professor Fabbrini said, that will clearly be a way forward.  If a majority wants to do something and there are a few outliers, it is highly likely that the majority will decide to go ahead.<\/p><p>There is, however, a fundamental difference between the new EU when compared with from where we have come.  I think that as long as the UK was in the outer layer, it was more acceptable and easier for other, smaller countries also to be outside.  Now that the UK is not there and that the core of the UK is always going to be in the first tier, there will be real consequences for countries that choose to stay outside.  Some countries, such as the Baltic countries, struggled hard to join the euro because they absolutely understood that the core of the Union is going to be where the real decisions are made.  That core is going to be the first tier.  A country could choose to be in another tier but it will not then be a player.  The theory of multi-speed Europe will still be there and will, in some cases, be the reality but if a country wants to be at the heart of Europe and influence decisions, it must understand that it has got to be in the first tier.  The departure of the UK is going to change that calculation in different ways.<\/p><p> Leading on from that is the question of replacing our former reliance on the UK.  All the smaller member states are understanding that and none of them can replace on its own the huge competence and technical ability that is being lost.  We are going to have to work more closely together.  That may mean different ways of working and, in Ireland's case, it will mean much better understanding of continental systems, including civil law rather than common law.  All of those delights lie ahead of us in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Catherine Day","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I will quickly go through the questions that were raised.  Deputy Howlin asked a fundamental question about what the conference is for.  Is it for consulting citizens on what they want or involving them in a debate, to a certain extent?  There is a bit of a dilemma there because it is a top-down process that, at the same time, seeks to get a bottom-up participation, if I can put it that way.  A very fine line needs to be tread in that regard.  There is a danger of disillusionment in this conference.  On the one hand, if the views of the citizenry are not taken into account and do not have a real impact, that carries the danger that people might feel that there is no point in participating in a process such as this.  On the other hand, the conference has to achieve something.  It cannot achieve nothing and turn into a dialogue that leads nowhere.  Previous efforts to involve the citizenry in a dialogue, including, to a certain extent, the citizens' dialogue process of a couple of years ago, have shown that if the process does not lead to anything concrete, it can be disillusioning.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Howlin also mentioned the tensions that exist in the United States between state rights and democracy.  We have precisely the same tensions at European level and, to a certain extent, they are even more intense at European level because there is a stronger sense of national identity within Europe.  Those tensions are reflected in America in things such as the role of the Senate and the fact that the President is not directly elected, if you like.  We have our own equivalent of that at European level.  Qualified majority voting is a kind of halfway house at European level between one vote per state, which would suit small states, and population-based voting which suits the larger states.  That is one way in which that tension is reflected.  The fact that membership of the European Parliament operates on the basis of digressive proportionality whereby smaller states have larger representation is another example of it.  The fact that we still have one Commissioner from each member state is another example of the fact that there is an ongoing tension between majority rule at European level and state rights at national level.  That tension will go on and will be a permanent part of membership of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  There is not a permanent or fixed solution.<\/p><p>There is a gradual shift towards the pooling of power and more federal solutions as member states get to trust one another.  There may be an element of this as an outcome of the conference.  That logic will make itself prevail, but it is an ongoing tension and something that is capable of giving rise to great controversy.  Anyone who examines the case law of the German federal constitutional court will see just how controversial this issue is in Europe.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised a number of issues.  Problems with the EU tend to be resolved by a lot of small steps.  There is no single solution to the problem of reconciling European integration with the requirements of democracy, but there are many small steps.  These include the role of the European Parliament and, vitally, the role of national parliaments as well as citizens' dialogues.  The process of citizens' dialogues is becoming part of the solution to the ongoing challenge of reconciling European integration with the needs of democracy.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned state aid.  An accusation levelled at the EU is that it prevents member states from intervening through state aid.  I will issue a reminder in that regard.  State aid tends to be a game for the big boys.  In other words, the larger member states engage in state aid more than smaller member states do.  If state aid was permitted in all states, countries like Ireland would lose out.  This has been reflected in the Covid crisis, during which there was a relaxation of state aid rules.  The country that piled the most into its state aid was Germany.  Lufthansa received a massive amount of state aid, but Ryanair did not.  This point should be borne in mind.<\/p><p> The issue of a European army was raised.  There is no prospect of that immediately.  However, it is true that issues that we are less comfortable with, for example, tax and defence, are gradually being raised at European level.  That is normal.  We need to consider these issues.  Dr. Day has mentioned how, if a country is not in the top tier, it is not in the decision-making arena.  That is something we need to think about.  We must reflect on whether Ireland's opt-out in justice and home affairs matters should be continued.  Why do we have that, what benefit are we gaining from it and are we losing out in terms of decision-making at European level?  Many issues need to be debated properly at national level.  National parliaments, and this committee in particular, have a large role to play in that regard.<\/p><p> Using an accurate phrase, Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; stated that we previously got the UK to do our due diligence for us.  That is no longer possible because the UK is not in the EU to do it for us, including at executive or parliamentary level.  A response to this change is required.  I hope that being here today will help to contribute to that response.  It is great that our approach to deliberative democracy is being taken account of at European level.  It is also great that we can feed into that process even if, as Dr. Day stated, not all of the solutions we have arrived at can be translated to European level directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Gavin Barrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Barrett.

I hope Dr. Day is not frightened by this, but I agree with her approach, in that we should examine issue-based rather than theory-based changes in planning out the future of Europe.  We have to go through a few logical steps.  First, what is not happening that people in Europe want to happen?  Second, does it need to be done at EU level or, as a subset of that, would it be far better done at EU level?  Third, what is stopping it from happening at EU level?  Is the issue treaty based or does it arise from a lack of unanimity?  Logically, the final step is to determine whether the treaties are preventing something that needs to happen from happening.  That is my view of the logical order to be followed if we are to bring citizens on board.<\/p> <p>  Let us take something controversial, namely, migration.  People say that we need to have a common EU response to migration, but can they articulate what that common response will be and are they willing, in the absence of a consensus on the matter, to confer a competence on EU institutions to decide it in a way that might not suit them?  I presume that is the underlying attitude in Budapest, for instance, if we forget about Ireland for a second.  This seems to be an important point that we need to bear in mind.<\/p><p> Professor Barrett referred to the justice and home affairs opt-out and the question of whether we were missing out on something.  Are we missing out on something?  I know of no sense in which Ireland is missing out from not being involved in the Schengen arrangements.  I do not believe we are, but maybe I am wrong.<\/p><p> This brings me to a second point on which I would like a contribution from any or all of our guests.  Post Brexit, Ireland will have a peculiar and unique relationship with the UK because we have a common travel area.  This means that, on migration, customs control and so on, we will have to remain integrated in some respects with the UK.  We cannot pursue a different approach of an open border, free movement and citizens' rights being mutually agreed as if we were Sicily.  We are going to have our own set of issues.  This feeds back into the question of home affairs because we and the British have a fairly similar justice and home affairs arrangement.  In light of Northern Ireland and the South, diverging our systems gratuitously or unnecessarily would pose significant issues.  I hope I do not sound reactionary or too conservative.  I am just saying that we should not cod ourselves.<\/p><p> Is the conference driven by an appetite for integration at a theoretical level or is it driven by an appetite for improving effectiveness at a practical level?  I hope that Dr. Day is not frightened that I agree with her, but her approach is the pragmatic one to bring citizens along with the whole process.  The alternative is to discuss treaty change and amending treaties by qualified majority among member states.  That is a theoretical issue that kicks the hornet's nest in terms of popular reaction.<\/p><p> These are my points, and I would like a reaction to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#V00300","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I will ask brief questions on what other member states are doing.

It is exciting and interesting that it is online because it makes such a difference.  At those kinds of meetings in the past, one would be lucky to get 20 people to attend, and generally, those 20 people had their minds already made up.  It is great that is getting such participation and numbers.<\/p> <p>  How much difficulty do the witnesses find in explaining where the EU can and cannot act and for citizens to understand that, perhaps, the request he or she makes may lead to unforeseen outcomes?  My experience is that most citizens do not differentiate between what happens at EU level and national level.  Since the 2008 crisis, most Irish people think the EU is all-powerful and can do whatever it wants.  It can be difficult to differentiate, therefore, between the power of the EU and the national level.<\/p> <p>  How do the witnesses approach that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#X00500","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":504,"content":"<p>We have approximately nine minutes to feed back.  Perhaps, before I let the witnesses back in I will make an observation following on from what Dr. Day said about how we go forward in terms of the dialogue.  Sometimes, we can get caught up in trying to speak on behalf of our fellow citizens in terms of their understanding of Europe.  Irish citizens are aware of the mechanics of Europe and about Brussels and Strasbourg whether it is with regard to CAP, directives or great opportunities which have arisen through cross-border health directives.  If I need my knee replaced, I can go to Turin.  If I need some surgery, I can go to some hospital in Spain.  There has been enormous progress in terms of interconnectivity.<\/p> <p>  My only point is that sometimes we miss the quick ones.  Citizens throughout Europe will really be interested in the conversation and how to facilitate the conversation.  Dr. Day talked about the opportunities around online engagement.  We are able to engage with all our European counterparts.  In my former position as Minister for Education and Skills, back in April and May we have had conversations with all our colleague Ministers with responsibility for education.  It was interactive and we did not have to travel as it was online.  There is no reason, for example, why we cannot facilitate that conversation for many of our post-primary students who are studying politics in society at leaving certificate level.  It is not necessarily connecting in with Brussels and Strasbourg but why can we not create a mechanism and opportunity for them to have a conversation with their peers in places like Greece, Spain, France and Germany?<\/p> <p>  I believe Senator Keogan made the point as well in terms of local authorities.  The past engagement and the physical one-to-one contact was important.  I know that as a former MEP, Deputy Harkin will have had many people from counties Donegal and Sligo over in Brussels to see how things worked in the mechanics of Europe.<\/p><p>Perhaps now is the time to look at online opportunities and facilitate and continue that conversation to help people connect.  That is my only input.  Other members had a few questions to be answered in the short time period so I will move first to Professor Fabbrini.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#X00600","speaker":"1548","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I have my microphone on correctly now so we should avoid the problems I had earlier.<br\/><br\/>I understand these are my final remarks so let me try to structure them in three points.  In doing so, I will seek to address some of the latest questions I received.<br\/><br\/>The first point is really on the conference itself.  After our conversation this morning, it is clear this project puts itself up for high expectations.  We want to involve the citizens and we cannot let them down.  Once the project starts, there will be huge pressure to make sure it does not fail.  We cannot have citizen participation and ask them what they think about the future of Europe if we do not then follow up on their requests.<br\/><br\/>In specific response to some of the questions, particularly, from Senator McDowell, there are things we cannot do because of the current treaty structures.  In response to Senator Chambers, the conference will have to address difficult questions on which there is no unanimous agreement among the member states, and so on.<br\/><br\/>That takes me to the second point I wish to emphasise in my concluding remarks.  Governance was touched on by a number of Deputies and Senators in their remarks.  This is a technical question.  People do not get passionate if we talk about intergovernmentalism, <i>la m&eacute;thode communautaire<\/i>, <i>der Spitzenkandidaten<\/i>or whatever.  Committee members are representatives of the people and know better than anyone else we need good institutions and good democratic procedures to make sure our constitutional regimes function.<br\/><br\/>The same is true for the EU.  That element, therefore, must be part of the conversation of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  It is not something that, perhaps, will warm the heart of many citizens.  It is, however, something I believe must be tackled, particularly by the elites, who like the committee members are politicians, or representatives of the European citizens in the European Parliament.  I encourage the committee to maintain attention on that point.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude with a note on the role of Ireland which connects with points Senator McDowell made on justice and home affairs and points my fellow speakers, Dr. Day and Professor Barrett, also emphasised.<br\/><br\/>I am evermore convinced Ireland is destined to play a leading role in the European Union after Brexit.  Ireland remains the only English language country in the European Union and has strong ties with the United States.  Only two weeks ago, the Brexit Institute hosted a conference with a leading advisor to Mr. Joe Biden and he basically said the United States will expect Ireland to take up the role the UK usually played in bridging Europe with the United States.<br\/><br\/>In a sense, I see Ireland as being at the heart of Europe in the future and, of course, the remaining opt-outs Ireland has on a number of European policies, including justice and home affairs, potentially represents an obstacle to that.  Europe is moving forward dynamically in those fields.  The committee will be aware that, among other things, the European Union recently launched a new European Public Prosecutor's Office which will play an important role in fighting misuse of EU funds in the context of the next multiannual financial framework, MFF, and with respect to world law.<br\/><br\/>The country will also have to reflect on what its new role will be in the European Union of 27 member states.  I mentioned previously that I believe the fact the Minister for Finance of the country is now the president of the Eurogroup is a strong signal that Ireland is perceived by other countries, and crucially, the eurozone countries - the core of the EU - as a key player.  That must remain on the agenda of the nation moving ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Federico Fabbrini"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Fabbrini.

I am not a bit afraid of what Senator McDowell has said.  In fact, I welcome the way he crystallises this issue and whether the debate is about an appetite for integration or effectiveness.  I, of course, hope that it can be about effectiveness.  For example, for a country like France, whose main concern is the place of Europe in the world, the question is how Europe influences the rest of the world.  How do we then influence our own destiny by organising ourselves differently?  If we could have a focus on effectiveness, even if people articulate it very differently, that would be great.  The risk is when one asks 27 members states what to talk about, in order to get agreement one puts everything on the shopping list.  That risk has to be overcome to get some kind of focus in the debate.<\/p> <p>  Many of our citizens are very far away from Europe and we cannot take for granted that they understand how the EU works.  At the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality we were asked to give an explanation about the role of the Constitution and how it links into legislation because many of our own citizens do not really understand that.  How would they then understand the relationship between the Treaty of Lisbon or even what we have been discussing this morning, which is the role of national parliaments in the wider EU?  There needs to be a strong factual information flow to support the conference, however it gets going.  We need to connect citizens so they can talk to one another.  My experience has been that when one gets people to calmly discuss something on an informed basis and to take the time to do it, it is much easier for them to understand one another's points of view.  Sometimes they agree and sometimes they respect the differences.  We need to find ways, maybe different ones, to connect ourselves with other European citizens. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Catherine Day"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":509,"content":"<p>In response to Senator McDowell, like Dr. Day I take the view that effectiveness is the key point here.  It is not integration for the sake of integration or, indeed, sovereignty for the sake of sovereignty.  It is neither.  It is about what works best.  We need a real commitment to subsidiarity.  Of course if things can be decided at national level they should be but if they need to be done at European level, they should be done at European level as well.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also mentioned migration.  That, remarkably, is a field in which competence has already been adequately agreed.  It was agreed as long ago as Amsterdam in 1999 that the difficulty there is the lack of political agreement.  However, we cannot give up the search for agreement on that because if we do not have a common approach on migration, we will end up with a lowest common denominator approach and slamming the doors in a way that violates human rights and does a disservice to the country of reception itself.  I was struck by the fact that a key role in the vaccine for Covid that was announced the other day was played by the children of Turkish migrants into Germany.  They were the ones who discovered it.  Migration is an enrichment as well as a challenge for member states.  <\/p> <p>  As regards whether we lose out by not participating in issues of justice and home affairs, I think we do in some ways.  We lose out in the substantive issue because we do not get to mould the agenda.  It is true that we can opt in afterwards but if one fails to mould the agenda in some way, one loses out to a certain extent.  There is a certain degree of resentment there as well because there is a cost to integration.  Other states expect that these burdens and costs will be shared equally.  There is a certain cost there as well.  We lose out by not being in the Schengen zone but we had to choose between the common travel area or Schengen so I completely understand the choice that was made there.  I have reservations about extending that to justice and home affairs generally.  I am not sure about that.  It is something we need to think about but I am fully in agreement that effectiveness is what we should be focusing on there.<\/p> <p>  Senator Chambers asked about the issues that are going to be discussed.  Some of them come from the General Affairs Council, like the security of the Union and its citizens, a successful and inclusive economy, the social aspects of the EU, a strong Union at the global level, and an efficient Union.<\/p><p>Some of those issues, such as health and fiscal policy, have been added because of what is happening.  The main division there is between policy issues and institutional issues.  Both of them will be raised and the ones more likely to lead to treaty changes are the institutional issues, which may in due course lead to a referendum in Ireland.  We have to wait and see in that regard.<\/p><p> Deputy Harkin mentioned the issue of a European army.  I have no insight into how the debate on defence will proceed at European level.  I note that we already have a Common Security and Defence Policy that can lead to a common defence but that has to be unanimously agreed.  Ireland can vote against that if it wants and it has a constitutional bar on participating in a common defence if it does not agree to it.  We are perfectly safe as regards neutrality.  At the same time, we need to participate in the debate.  The issue of defence looks quite different on the other end of the European Union, in Poland or Finland, for example.  It is something we at least need to talk about at some stage.  I would not be worried about the treaty rules in that regard.  As I said, the notion of a European army is simply not on the agenda.  I would not be worrying about that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020111100002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Gavin Barrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I thank all three contributors.

I propose that the committee be given a briefing on the issue of vaccines.  Two issues arise.  One is the matter of vaccines for Covid.  We will receive part of whatever number of vaccines the European Commission procures but it is important the committee is briefed on how that is going to work and how many doses we expect to get this year, if any, and next year.  I would like a briefing on that.<\/p> <p>  We might put some questions to the HSE today with regard to my second point, which is that there have been some concerns and issues with regard to the flu vaccine.  I do not believe for a second that any doses of any vaccines are missing.  That is not the case.  There is a difference between the number distributed and the number administered.  There is concern as to who is getting these doses and whether the vulnerable are being protected.  We need to get a handle on that.  The problem with these meetings is that members only have ten minutes in which to raise many issues.  We cannot raise everything when either the Minister or the HSE is before us.  It would be worthwhile for the committee to hold a session on the issue of vaccines which would include the Covid vaccines, the flu vaccine and the pneumonia vaccine, of which there appears to be a shortage.<\/p> <p>  The uptake of the flu vaccine this year has been unreal.  It is massive and well above what it was last year.  While there has been a 20% increase in the number of doses, there is still not enough to satisfy the demand.  For that reason, it would be worthwhile for us to have such a briefing.  I imagine Dr. Colm Henry would be involved, as would the relevant officials involved in the procurement side.

As this is my first time attending before this committee of the Thirty-third D&aacute;il, I would like, on behalf of the HSE, to wish the Chair and the members of the committee well with their important work.  I assure the committee that the HSE will assist it in every way we can.  Colleagues joining me today are Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, chief operations officer; Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer; and Mr. Liam Woods, national director of acute operations.<\/p> <p>  On 27 March 2020, just as we were emerging from last year&rsquo;s winter season, a decision was taken by NPHET to postpone all non-essential surgery, health procedures and other non-essential services on account of Covid-19.  This necessary decision led to a near standstill of scheduled healthcare activity.  Although activity has resumed, there have been enduring consequences for our health services.  In the knowledge that we would be delivering services within a Covid-19 environment until after the development of a vaccine or cure, we published a strategic framework for service continuity.  The framework outlines our key objectives, including the resumption of services, the retention of surge capacity and the adoption of new technologies.  Our winter plan builds on this framework and aims to ensure that we are as prepared as possible for the anticipated seasonal pressures, which this year will be more challenging than ever.<\/p> <p>  We have been entrusted with &euro;600 million in order to achieve these objectives which is the biggest allocation ever made for a winter plan.  We are committed to investing this money in the places where it will have maximum impact.<\/p> <p>  Our core objectives can be succinctly summarised.  First, we aim to avoid congestion in our hospitals.  Second, we will resource community services to deliver more care than ever before.  Third, we will ensure that lines of communication between these two pillars of our health system, acute and community, are seamless.  Integration of services has always been problematic in practice.  However, one of the few positive things to emerge from the pandemic is our capacity to operate as a whole system when the circumstances require it.  Additional key priorities include supporting nursing homes, strengthening public health capacity and minimising the impacts of Covid-19 on our cancer services, including screening services.<\/p> <p>  Winter funding will only get us so far.  Our success is also heavily predicated on the public continuing to take the necessary precautions as per public health advice and continuing the downward trend in community transmission of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  A community first approach to the delivery of care will be central to delivering safe, efficient and effective services through winter and beyond.  We are making substantial investment in reorienting our services into the community through: 4.7 million additional home support hours; enhanced home support packages; community specialist teams in 11 centres focused on older persons and chronic disease care; 530 community intermediate care and 631 enhanced community rehabilitation beds; GP access to more than 79,000 diagnostic procedures; enhanced homelessness supports; and making the flu vaccine available to staff and to the public.<\/p> <p>  With regard to our acute capacity, at the end of 2019, we had 10,988 inpatient beds, including 255 critical care beds.<\/p><p>The 2021 Estimates provide funding for the following beds on an ongoing basis: 1,146 incremental beds in acute hospitals; 66 critical care beds; and 135 sub-acute beds.  The arrangement with private hospitals will also allow us to augment our existing approaches to Covid-19 and non-Covid pathways, particularly in the event of a surge in hospitalisations.  Provision is also being made for additional consultants, the extension of renal dialysis satellite stations and home dialysis projects and for the use of new technologies in endoscopy.  The waiting lists have stabilised, albeit at a much higher level.  Extra resources for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, will allow for additional insourced and outsourced activities to tackle waiting lists.  Steady progress is also being made in the resumption of elective activity and the latest data show that we are almost in an equivalent position to the corresponding period in 2019.<\/p><p> I will inform the committee of the financial position.  The HSE received its annual letter of determination 2021 on 4 November and is now engaged in the finalisation of the 2021 national service plan.  In summary terms, the scale of the additional investment in the health service in 2021 is unprecedented when viewed in the context of any previous single year.  Including moneys held back initially by the Department of Health, the national service plan 2021 revenue net expenditure allocation is &euro;3,534 million or 21% above the national service plan 2020 allocation of just over &euro;17 billion.  The 2021 capital allocation is also more than 20% ahead of the 2020 level.  This investment reflects a strengthened trust and confidence in the HSE and how our staff have mobilised and responded to the many challenges of this pandemic to date.

There are always long-term challenges and some seemingly ever-present ones.  Then there are sudden ones such as Covid-19.  The winter planning is usually based on the previous winter, and the first couple of weeks of January are always the pinch point.  What in particular will be done this year as opposed to other years?<\/p> <p>  There are 33,000 extra procedures promised.  What is the role of private hospitals there?  There was some concern about the previous agreement, but the agreement with private hospitals earlier in the year definitely saved lives.  The most important criterion in respect of healthcare is the number of lives saved.  I welcome the 33,000 procedures that have been identified.  Is it ambitious?  What impact has Covid-19 had on the screening programmes?  Have the greatly reduced numbers of procedures been factored into these figures?  Regarding the opening and operating hours of clinics, such as endoscopy clinics, if they could be increased from nine to 12 or even 15 hours, serious inroads could be made into waiting lists.  Is that factored in here as well?<\/p> <p>  In primary care, there is an allocation which is a new feature of the winter plan.  Mr. Reid referred to community assessment hubs.  Where are these to be located or is that identified?  What are the criteria for deciding these and what will be the role of GPs and the buy-in of GPs in these areas, because there has been concern about primary care centres?  I note the report this morning of concern that there will be shortages in flu vaccines.  GPs say there will not be enough vaccines for high-risk categories of patients.  Perhaps Mr. Reid will clarify the current status of flu vaccine stocks.<\/p> <p>  Finally, with regard to additional capacity, obviously this will be dependent on recruitment.  There are commitments, but are the numbers of nurses available?  Are nurses and staff available to provide that additional capacity?  It is dependent on recruitment and, in some cases, on physical infrastructure.  Unfortunately, the experience in Galway on certain issues, such as the theatres in Merlin Park which had a leaking roof for three years and the unbearable delays in planning permission being lodged for a new emergency department, would question the ability to deliver such projects.  It is frustrating that when a not-fit-for-purpose structure for the emergency department in Galway is identified there are delays in that regard.  I have concerns about that.<\/p> <p>  Again, I thank the team and look forward to the replies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#B00300","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I will try to be brief and will call on some of my colleagues to comment as well.  First, I thank the Senator for his opening comments, which are appreciated by all our teams.<\/p> <p>  Second, in terms of what will be different in the first couple of weeks in January, it is particularly about what will be different as part of the overall approach to the winter plan and the significant extra investment, which Ms O'Connor can comment on briefly.  There is our community investment, community investment teams, integrated teams and multidisciplinary teams working with our acute teams and with our community.  There is a particular focus on home first and keeping people at home, but there is also investment in our hospitals in terms of emergency departments and having key decision makers available to make decisions.  Separately, we have established this year much stronger working processes and pathways with GPs in primary care.  The significant difference is our particular and strong focus on the investment in communities, especially on home first for elderly care.  There are many new integrated processes between the acute system and the community system.  However, I will call on Ms O'Connor shortly to comment on it.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the role of private hospitals, they will play a role.  We have carried out a procurement process for private hospital groups.  It is different from the first phase.  There are two aspects to it.  First, we already have a budget of &euro;25 million, which some of the hospitals are drawing down for both diagnostics and services.  Second, we have concluded a procurement process for a number of private hospitals to engage with us on, and we are finalising those in terms of some mini tenders which will be local, operated between the public hospitals and private hospitals for certain diagnostics and services.  Part of that would include diagnostics access for GPs in the community.  Again, that will be very different.<\/p> <p>  On the screening processes, in July we launched our outline plan for the relaunch of our four key screening services.  That is mapped out and all of those have recommenced.  At various levels they will start to call on people on a priority basis.  I will not go through each of the programmes, but our winter plan has approximately &euro;2.7 million to invest, particularly in the rapid access clinic.  Our clinics have always been open but we are concerned to ensure that people who are symptomatic and need care come through.  There is an extra investment in resources.  There is also an extra investment in infection control processes for our screening services.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Dr. Henry or Mr. Woods to comment on the endoscopy clinics, but some of it is referenced in our winter plan.  There are some new innovations in terms of endoscopy clinics and, indeed, endoscopy capsules that will be spread out to further hospitals as part of an acceleration plan for endoscopy clinics.<\/p> <p>  On community assessment hubs, the plan facilitates a scale up from the current seven to approximately 20.  We will monitor this closely.  It is a process with good buy-in from GPs.  The principle is to assess respiratory illness and try to filter out people who may need to go to a hospital, people who do not and people who can referred to other pathways.  It worked very well for us during the Covid pandemic.  The demand is not very high at present, so we will assess and monitor the best use of those clinics.  However, there is good buy-in from GPs so far.<\/p> <p>  To deal briefly with vaccines, Dr. Henry was talking about this earlier this morning.  We have now distributed almost 1.3 million vaccinations.  We have distributed more as of this week than we did for all of the flu season last year.  It is about 20% up on our total delivery and order.  There is significant demand and we want to make sure it is prioritised.  That was the principle of Dr. Henry's letter earlier this week, that it is prioritised for the groups who are defined as priority.<\/p><p>There is, however, very significant demand for private capacity for flu vaccine injections, and while that is under great pressure too, we are nonetheless significantly up on our volumes compared with last year.  There are no missing vaccines.  There is always a lag of GPs registering with the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, for reimbursement but we want to see where the allocation is and how to prioritise the final distribution.<\/p><p> Recruitment will be a big challenge.  We have recruited a net increase on our workforce this year of more than 5,000 resources, 1,600 of whom are nurses and 150 of whom are consultants.  There are significant recruitment campaigns for each grade, although it will be a very significant challenge because there is a worldwide demand for healthcare workers.  We have started that process and about 600 nurses from an international recruitment campaign are part of the process.  As graduates come through this year, that will provide another 1,200 whole-time equivalents in the system.<\/p><p> With the Chairman's agreement, I might ask Ms O'Connor to make a brief comment, followed by Dr. Henry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":532,"content":"<p>On the winter planning, the Senator is absolutely correct.  We usually see a big surge on the first few days of January once GP clinics reopen fully and people start attending and are referred to hospitals.  The critical issue for us in respect of emergency departments and hospitals in particular relates to the flow that is created.  Many people attending will be people who are either older or with chronic disease, which is why we have focused in our winter plan on the development of specific initiatives to support people to stay at home.  I refer not just to home support, which is a significant investment and especially so in the first quarter, but also to integrated specialist teams for older persons and chronic disease management whom GPs can work with and access.<\/p> <p>  From our perspective, we want to ensure that people who attend an emergency department are turned around in order that as many people as possible can go home and be supported through our intervention teams and outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy, OPAT, programme.  A range of initiatives are focused entirely on reducing the need for people to attend the emergency department or, if they attend, to be treated in the emergency department and discharged.  If such people require admission, the focus is on them being seen as quickly as possible through the hospital system, with good options at the end of their pathway of care from the hospital back out to the community and all those supports.  More than half the funding in the winter plan this year is targeted at community investment, which is to avoid that congestion in January that we experienced in previous years.  We have been building on the learning from previous years as to what has worked and what we will be aiming for in January next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":533,"content":"<p>We have run out of time for this session, so other guests who wish to contribute might wait until later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#C00300","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":534,"content":"<p>Our guests will be aware we are under tight time constraints, so I would appreciate if our guests can respond to my questions as succinctly as they can.

Year on year, therefore, over recent years the numbers have been increasing.  I am asking why.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the inpatient numbers, in 2019, some 67,985 people were waiting for inpatient procedures, whereas the figure is now 75,000.

Changing the model of care in order that more people are seen in the community by multidisciplinary teams is the way to address this.  That will happen in areas such as cardiology and respiratory medicine, which will help address these lists.  Significant initiatives, arising from the Covid response, are under way to do that.  I should have highlighted earlier that the advent of virtual clinics as part of the Covid response has significantly assisted in addressing what was, as the Deputy rightly noted, a growth in numbers over recent months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#C02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>None of that answers my question because we need capacity.

In 2016, some 1,875 people had been waiting 18 months, whereas the figure is now 7,963.  I have dealt with a number of other cases that I will put to Mr. Woods.  An elderly woman has been waiting to see a pain specialist for more than two years.   The numbers waiting to see a pain specialist have increased sharply.  The number waiting for pain relief this year is 12,289, while 4,000 patients have been waiting more than 18 months to see a pain specialist.<\/p><p>The number of children undergoing procedures for the treatment of scoliosis has dropped by 29% and the number of oncology procedures has also dropped by 29%.  My point, therefore, is that despite all the spin and the rhetoric about all of the additional beds and staff, year-on-year, inpatient and outpatient waiting times are rising.  Children with scoliosis are still awaiting much longer than they were in previous years for treatment; people are waiting on pain relief across all the specialties; and inpatient and outpatient waiting times are on the increase.  There does not seem to be a plan.  Given that those figures are not good, as Mr. Woods said, and they are going in the wrong direction, what action is going to be taken and how can we reduce those waiting times?

I thank them for their attendance and for their ongoing work in this very important area.  I just want to talk for a few moments about one of those few positives that came out of Covid, and that is the acceleration of some elements of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Earlier in the year, Mr. Reid referred to what was happening as \"Sl&aacute;intecare on speed\".  It is a very welcome development that there is a significant shift of activity away from hospitals to the community, which is what we should be aiming for anyway.<\/p> <p>  I want to make one point and then ask a question.  The point I would make about it is that part and parcel of Sl&aacute;intecare is the restructuring of the HSE combined with regional management and greater levels of accountability.  I understand why the HSE had to park that earlier in the year and all of the focus was on responding to Covid.  That is absolutely understandable.  However, I made this point to the Minister last week and I want to make it to the witnesses today that I would strongly urge them to resume that restructuring reform programme relating to the structure of the HSE, and to do that as early as possible in the new year.<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to all of that work that is going on in shifting activity to the community, which is very welcome work.  My concern is, though, about those areas, in my own constituency, as I wrote to Mr. Reid last week, but also in many other parts of urban and rural Ireland, where there is a poor level of GP provision.  We know from various research that has been done that areas with the greatest level of health need are very often those areas with the poorest provision because of our two-tier system.  Given the shift that is taking place, what work, if any, is being done to ensure that those areas which are very poorly served by general practice, with low numbers of GPs and other primary care staff, have sufficient numbers of GPs?<\/p> <p>  Related to that, obviously, was an earlier commitment to introduce salaried GPs.  It seems that there has been no progress made on that at all.  Related to that as well is the whole question of ensuring the fair allocation of resources.  How does the HSE ensure that that takes place where there is poor provision at the moment?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the budget.  An extra &euro;3.5 billion is provided for the service plan this year.  I do not want the details now but will the CEO send us the schedule of the breakdown of that &euro;3.5 billion in terms of what element is going to Covid and what element is going to increased service provision?<\/p> <p>  My third question relates to the flu vaccine and shortages.  I have been raising this with Mr. Reid since last July.  I was assured at the time that the 1.4 million vaccines order was sufficient to get us up to 90% coverage.  I doubted the figure at the time because it did not make any provision for additional groups or cohorts of people to avail of the vaccine as a health prevention measure.  Why is it that only 1.4 million vaccines were ordered?  Is the HSE now saying to people who are not in the at-risk groups that they cannot have access to the vaccine?  That would be a retrograde step.  Does the CEO accept that insufficient quantities were ordered initially?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#E01500","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I thank the Deputy and her colleagues for their feedback on the health service and our workers.<\/p> <p>  On the acceleration of Sl&aacute;intecare overall, I have just a couple of quick comments.  As tough as Covid has been for the health system, I believe it has given a greater level of confidence to the health system, particularly around the area of integration.  It has given a whole new level of care pathways so that we do actually invest in the community.  Deputy Cullinane was talking earlier on about the capacity in the hospital system, and it is an issue, but we know a major part of that solution is in the community service.  I know Deputy Shortall has been key in leading that whole report.<\/p> <p>  Specifically on the Deputy's point around regional management and prioritisation, that is ultimately a priority in terms of Government policy.  The two elements of Sl&aacute;intecare were regions and, separately, the significant focus on services.  We certainly would be saying for now to continue the significant focus on services, but regions are still part of the Government policy, which we are implementing.<\/p><p> On the provision of GP services generally, that is a concern for me and for the health system.  Areas of social deprivation suffer most in that context.  In some hospitals where we see many people attending accident and emergency departments, that is largely down to areas where there is social deprivation and that do not have access to GPs and or that pathway.  That is a concern for us.  Regarding what would make the situation better, certainly the pipeline of GPs coming through the system has improved.  Dr. Henry might also talk about that element.  We regularly talk to representatives of the ICGP about how we, as a State, can improve the pipeline of GPs coming through training.  It has been the experience, however, even during Covid-19, that areas of social deprivation suffer more in the context of health systems.

A chronic disease management programme that was in the process of being rolled out before the Covid-19 crisis included things like patient education, preventative care, medication reviews and individual care plans.  There was much emphasis on lifestyle and supporting patients.  Chronic illness is a large spectrum.  Some people have a management plan that is working for them, but there are also more complex cases.  A modified and structured chronic disease management programme has been issued by the HSE.  I would like to unpack that in respect of the winter plan, however.  It is mentioned a little bit, and the key sentence I get from the document is: \"Implement a structured programme for chronic disease management and prevention, with an anticipated 75% uptake\".  Can we unpack that sentence and get more information on how that is working?  Is that happening through the community hubs?  Have we any idea of how effective this programme is?

If we look at chronic disease management as a spectrum without picking any one illness, we will see that it runs from prevention, in the first place, and promotion, to early intervention and what we call secondary prevention, which means that if somebody has an established disease such as diabetes, we treat blood pressure and make earlier interventions before things become really serious, to the end of the spectrum, which involves serious illness, hospitalisation and even intensive care and end-of-life care.  Deputy Shortall will be aware of this information because it is a theme in Sl&aacute;intecare.  For too long, we have invested in the right side of the spectrum, namely, in the intensive side of care, in hospitalisation and in specialist care.  This is unsustainable.  When we look at the profile of chronic disease in Ireland and other western countries, we can see an epidemic of chronic disease, where upwards of 70% or 80% of GP consultations are with people with chronic disease, as well as up to 40% of attendances at accident and emergency departments.<\/p> <p>  What we are trying to do with this programme is to build on what has been essentially pilot work in setting up networks of care across the roughly 96 community care networks in Ireland.  We want to expand them rapidly, beyond what has been a relatively small number to date, so they can provide loops, circuits and episodes of care that do not go through acute hospitals.  We want to intervene and address problems earlier, such as blood pressure, and foot problems in people with diabetes, for example, instead of having a line of defence which is very deep and at hospital level.  This is, therefore, a capacity-building exercise.  It is a slow game, but it is essential to invest in this aspect now so that we do not have to depend continually on hospitals to deal with that right side of the spectrum of chronic disease management, which is the intensive and resource-heavy side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#F02100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I completely agree around the move towards community care and that first side of the spectrum.

The spectrum of interventions range from screening to opportunistic intervention, to medication review to blood pressure measurement, to other actions taken at that left side of the spectrum which allow people with chronic disease to stay healthier, live healthier and have more accurately prescribed and suitable medications, and hopefully never to rely on hospitalisation if they become more ill.

As I understand it, once a person gets on the list for the cataract procedure there is no delay.  The problem is getting on the list for the procedure and the delay in appointments to see patients.  In view of the fact that buses are still going to Northern Ireland for cataract procedures under the treatment abroad fund, even during the lockdown, should priority be given to making appointments for people to be assessed, put on the list and then dealt with?  For instance, a total of 133 people are on the waiting list at South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital, 90 of whom have been waiting three months.

In some parts of the country, we employ home support workers directly, and in other parts, we rely on funded agencies.  Within our winter plan we have a significant dependency on home support.  In terms of the Homes First model, which is referenced within the winter plan, it is critical for us that we maintain and significantly increase the level of home support.  We are aware that over the last six months the home support levels dropped off.  From April to June, we reduced our home support by approximately 22% so we saw a drop-off of approximately 11,500 clients.  Some of that was at the client's own request in terms of having people coming into his or her home and some were reduced in terms of low-priority provision from our perspective.  That number has reduced to 5,000 people so we are now bringing the level of home support back up.  In some parts of the country, we see the challenge some agencies have in terms of securing sufficient workers.  I am aware that a number of those agencies have proactive recruitment campaigns which include full training for the role and we are engaging with them.<\/p> <p>  In terms of that dependency in our winter plan, our local community health organisations, CHOs, have been working with the home support providers to prepare for this significant increase.  We are aware that it is a challenge.  We are also aware that in the climate we are in, people are not always willing to go into those roles for all sorts of reasons.  The agencies are being challenged in terms of, for example, their insurance policies as they relate to communicable diseases.  There are other challenges for these agencies at the minute which we are trying to work through with them.  They are real challenges.  We are looking at how we recruit home support workers while, critically, enabling the other agencies on which we will rely.  There should be no difference in terms of weekend cover.  If a need is identified for home support, that should be available at all the times it is required.  From our perspective, that will certainly form part of our contractual arrangements with the providers.

There was a lot of coverage today and I am sure everyone's notifications were going off with news notifications.  Obviously, the HSE has refuted the claims that supplies have gone missing but there is coverage around holding back doses until it is assessed where they are needed.  I am a bit curious about the process by which this will be decided.  It is my understanding that the HSE takes its lead on this issue based on information supplied by GPs.  This is inputted from GP surgeries and that is how the HSE will be informed in this regard.  This is put in in hard copy.  I have heard from a number of GPs who have raised concerns around this process.  It requires many hours of administration because there is no swift online system to do this.  As has been noted, many GPs do not do the paperwork patient by patient as it is very time consuming.  I know one GP who has had to hire extra staff simply to help with the administration associated with rolling out the flu vaccine this year, which I think we can agree is probably a slightly crazy use of resources when we are so tied for resources.  Can the witnesses explain why in 2020 we still require GPs to do this in this way and why a swift online system of registering those who have received the flu vaccine is not yet in place?  When I reflect on the GP who had to take on an extra person, I see that this form was handled four times - administration to the GP, back to the patient and back to administration to submit for payment.  This seems wrong both from infection control and financial perspectives.  If the information from GPs is going to be used to determine where the next round of flu vaccines will be sent, and right now, perhaps GPs have yet to even send their information to the HSE and might be doing it in bulk, using this administration system to decide where to send the last round of doses might not be a good statistics exercise.<\/p> <p>  Could the witnesses comment on concerns that private patients are getting the flu vaccine?  Regardless of whether someone is a private or public patient, if one is vulnerable, one is vulnerable.  What is the HSE doing to mitigate against this?  Is there a contingency plan for buy more quantities of the flu vaccine if areas have been under-supplied due to this onerous system of registering the flu vaccine?  I will ask my second question after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#J00300","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":629,"content":"<p>It has always been the case that GPs had apply for reimbursement after the vaccine had been administered.

There has been a greater focus on it this year because of the great uptake of the vaccine, which is very welcome.  I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to reiterate that no vaccine has disappeared.  We are getting mixed reports from some GPs saying that they have enough vaccine for the at-risk groups - for which this vaccine is intended and prioritised - and other GPs, as the Senator correctly noted, saying that they are short.

We see that with garda&iacute; and apprenticeships.  Do the witnesses think they should be paid because nobody is giving an answer?  I think they should be paid and the nurses and students in training think they should be paid.  If these student trainees were taken out of the system, would the system be able to function?  If student nurses were taken off the wards today, would the wards be able to function?  If that is the case, is it not right that they should be paid?

It is more important for us to have secured permanent funding to deliver and develop teams.<\/p><p>From our perspective, the priority is, of course, to be able to provide early access to people in terms of mental health.  We have worked throughout Covid to develop information and supports to people at the lowest level of complexity.  We often focus on our very specialist mental health services for people who attend our specialist teams.  However, we know there has been a gap at primary care level in terms of supporting the mental health needs of the population.  We have developed a psychosocial framework that we hope to launch over the coming week or two in terms of supporting the general population, supporting people who attend services and, critically, supporting our staff.

Those that can be answered can be answered and the others that might have to be held over can be answered by way of written reply.<\/p> <p>  First, of the 2,000 staff currently out on sick leave due to Covid or Covid-related issues, what is the breakdown of those between medical staff, nursing staff and administrative staff?  What is the number of GP appointments outstanding throughout the country?  How many GP vacancies where there at the beginning of the year and how many are now filled or being filled?  I know there are some in Kildare so I would appreciate a response on that.<\/p> <p>  The next question is an important one, namely, how do we handle or prevent the next surge?  That is the critical question we all want to know the answer to.  It is as simple as this.  If another surge comes, the economic impact is going to be much more severe than anything experienced heretofore.  It is repeating the same issue.  The question I am trying to get at is this.  Can we prepare now for that possible eventuality and prevent it by way of taking particular measures or putting a particular emphasis on certain of the restrictions without having to go into a lockdown when we come to the end of the current level 5 restrictions?<\/p> <p>  Our local hospital in Naas has ceased non-essential elective services as of today arising from staff shortages and staff being out on Covid-related leave.  The question is how many staff have been affected by Covid and how many are affected currently, and how many are medical staff, nursing staff or administrative staff.<\/p> <p>  My next question is a continuation of an issue we often discuss at these committee meetings.  Regarding the home care packages that are being prepared and that we are going to be relying upon very much throughout the winter, to what degree is it intended to regulate standards for those providing them in the private sector and the public sector?  To have an equal standard across the board is important, and that applies without prejudice to anybody or anything.<\/p> <p>  My last question relates to the capital programme for Naas General Hospital.  How is the proposed extension coming along?  Is it being moved forward and can we rely on it arriving within a reasonable time to ensure we make progress?

We saw an improvement last year in the pipeline of GPs coming through from training colleges, and that is one thing we want to keep going.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the prevention of the next surge, I will make some brief comments.  Obviously, there has been learning both from what happened in the first phase and what is happening in this phase.  One of the strongest messages is that the public health measures are the strongest first line of defence.  Quite often, we talk about building hospital capacity and ICU capacity, which is important, and we talk about building our testing and tracing capacity, and they are important.  However, our first line of defence is our public health measures and what we, as individuals and a society, take on board.  There are learnings from the first phase, where we exited and the economy opened up in May, June and July, and then we saw a significant increase in August, September and particularly in October.  The one thing that holds true, as we look forward to the next phase, is the public health measures around social distancing, infection prevention and control, how we mix with our families and how many households we mix between.  Those are the part of our measures that will remain very consistent and strong, regardless of what level the economy is at or what level the Government decides we are in.  That is the biggest line of defence and the biggest armoury we have against further surges in the community.  Of course, there are learnings in terms of how we protect the vulnerable and nursing homes, and we have seen some of those learnings in this phase.<br\/><br\/>Strictly on Naas hospital, we are dealing with a very significant issue there and, indeed, in another couple of hospitals around the country.

Part of what we try to do here is reassure the public.  We have heard this morning about the flu vaccine.  Mr. Reid was talking in terms of minimising the impact of Covid on the cancer services and screening.  In the final minute or two, he might expand on how that his happening.  The big message people want to hear is reassurance that we are learning from the mistakes that have been made in the past and we will do things differently.  I refer particularly to mistakes that were made early on in this Covid pandemic, to the difficulty to date of a big organisation showing flexibility and changing in midstream and to some of the things that are not working.  People want to hear that the HSE is capable of doing that and that we are learning, as I say, from mistakes in the past.  I, again, thank the witnesses for all their contributions here this morning.  Mr. Reid might sum up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#M01500","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":669,"content":"<p>If I can, I will quickly respond on the cancer screening services.  I was making the extra focus, not the distinction, that we have also in terms of rapid access clinics.  Positively, we have seen our rapid access clinics restored to a much stronger level and part of our winter investment is to support them again.  There is &euro;2.3 million for our rapid access clinics.<\/p> <p>  Separate to that are four major screening programmes.  The Senator was pitching on one of them there, namely the diabetic retina screening.  The others, BreastCheck, BowelCheck and CervicalCheck, have all been restored.  Obviously, some are more challenged than others.  For instance, BreastCheck, because we must put in place many infection prevention and control measures, is not as efficient as it would have been, but we are providing extra resources in order that we get back to the reasonable levels we desire and can sustain.  Obviously, our key message to the public in this regard is that if someone has symptoms, he or she should please come forward.  I would separate that out from the screening programmes, which are, in essence, testing healthy populations to get early signals.<\/p> <p>  Specifically, on the learnings from the first phase, we in the HSE have been very open, and so we should be, to what learnings can we take from each phase.  From me, here are a few brief reflections on the first phase.  Obviously, in the nursing homes and long-term care for older people, we all have to stand back and ask what could have been done differently.  There have been many learnings on that.  One certainly is that as the virus presented itself and affected people who were asymptomatic, once it got in it caused a huge risk across the nursing home setting.  That is one that we built some more protections on in this phase.  Certainly, that had to be a huge learning for all of us.<\/p> <p>  There was a second learning from nursing homes.<\/p><p>Congregated settings are not ideal and not the solution for the future in terms of long-term care, particularly for vulnerable groups and older people.  Ultimately, that is a long process of change but it is not the way we would organise for a pandemic because one is at higher risk.<\/p><p> The third point from my perspective is that as we look into the utilisation of private hospitals, this time we will do it in a very different way.  That is not to say it was wrong.  We all watched what was happening in Bergamo, to which some members referred.  We just had to get capacity into the Irish hospital system.  Thankfully, the way the Irish public responded we did not utilise that to the extent we thought we may need it.  Looking back now, we will do it very differently in this phase, which will be very targeted in terms of procurement and some phases.  We have had learnings and we are very open to more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020111100002#M01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":671,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reid and his colleagues for their helpful engagement with us this morning.

The projected expenditure for the Department in the original estimate was &euro;21.2 billion.  Just over &euro;11 billion of this was voted expenditure, paid through the Exchequer, to provide in the main for social assistance payments to pensioners, people with disabilities, jobseekers, child benefit and so on.  The remaining &euro;10 billion was to provide for social insurance benefits paid for through the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p> <p>  In the subsequent period and prior to those Estimates being voted on by the D&aacute;il, a number of decisions were made which required significant increases in the Department&rsquo;s expenditure.  The introduction of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the Covid-19 illness payment, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, the increase in the payment for qualified adults, and the extension of the free fuel season required additional expenditure over and above that envisaged when the December Revised Estimates were published.  The Revised Estimates, voted by the D&aacute;il in May, provided for expenditure of in excess of &euro;28 billion in 2020, or an increase of &euro;6.8 billion over and above the Estimates published in December.  The Further Revised Estimates being presented to the committee today include several components.<\/p> <p>  Following the formation of this Government, the Taoiseach announced that certain functions would transfer from what was then the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, now the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Employment rights policy and legislation has now transferred to that Department, as well as legislation on the national minimum wage and the Low Pay Commission.<\/p> <p>  There are also a number of EU and international issues for which the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will now assume lead responsibility.  The details of the employment legislation that transferred from my Department following the Government decision are set out in the Employment Affairs and Employment Law (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2020.  The transfer of functions involved 15 pieces of primary legislation in the suite of labour law.  The transfer of funding associated with these functions amounts to just over &euro;1.6 million.  This transfer takes place on a cost-neutral basis between Departments.  My Department&rsquo;s title is now the Department of Social Protection following the transfer of these functions.<\/p> <p>  The Further Revised Estimate also provide for the apportioning of pre-5 August 2020 PUP expenditure between the Social Insurance Fund and Vote 37.  To ensure that neither the Social Insurance Fund nor the Exchequer are disproportionately carrying the costs, the most appropriate way of apportioning the PUP expenditure during the period from March to August is based on the recipient&rsquo;s underlying entitlement to a jobseeker's payment.<\/p><p>Accordingly, just under 60%, or &euro;1.8 billion, of pre-August PUP expenditure will be charged to the Social Insurance Fund, with a corresponding reduction in expenditure on Vote 37. <\/p><p> The legal basis for this reapportionment is contained in the Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020.  Subsequent to the vote on the Department's Estimates on May, a number of significant decisions were made due to the evolving nature of the pandemic and associated policy responses.  These decisions included the extension of the pandemic unemployment payment and the temporary wage subsidy scheme, as well as the introduction of the new employment wage subsidy scheme.  By extension, this has had an impact on the provision for jobseekers, which has been reduced due to the extension of the schemes related to Covid-19. <\/p><p> The July stimulus package contained new measures related to my Department that were not included in the May Estimate.  These measures included the establishment of a new work placement and experience programme, increased public employment service staff capacity, enhanced recruitment subsidies through JobsPlus, additional provision for the back to work enterprise allowance scheme, the extension of the back to education allowance scheme to recipients of the PUP, and additional places on State employment schemes such as community employment and T&uacute;s.  While the bulk of the additional expenditure will take place next year, 2020 expenditure announced in the July stimulus package is included in the Estimate before the committee.<\/p><p> I was pleased to announced that, despite the challenging times we find ourselves in, the Christmas bonus will again be paid at a rate of 100% this December.  Usually, the bonus is paid only to recipients of long-term social welfare payments who are dependent on their social welfare payment for most, or all, of their income for a prolonged period.  The qualifying period for jobseekers to receive the bonus is usually 15 months.  In recognition, however, of the impact the Covid-19 pandemic has had on employment levels, and the sudden financial impact on individuals, the bonus will be paid this year to jobseekers and people who have been in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment for a period of four months or more.  The cost is broken down into more than &euro;131 million for Vote 37 recipients and almost &euro;258 million for Social Insurance Fund recipients, constituting a total of &euro;389 million for the Christmas bonus.  In total, the Further Revised Estimate presented to the committee seeks additional funding of &euro;3.5 billion across a number of subheads to provide funding for the Department to implement decisions taken since the original Estimate was voted.<\/p><p> Finally, as we speak about the Revised Estimates and reflect on the past year, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the extraordinary work by the staff of the Department during this unprecedented year.  As public representatives, we all engage with staff of the Department at local level through our constituency offices and I know that members will agree with me in acknowledging the monumental effort the staff have put in this year at a time of national crisis to ensure that payments are issued to those who need them.  To date, the Department has issued 12 million payments to more than 800,000 people under the pandemic unemployment payment.  Since the start of October, it has processed more than 200,000 applications.  That by itself is the equivalent of processing a full year's claims load in five weeks.  It is sometimes forgotten that the Department and the staff have managed to do this on top of everything else they have had to do as part of their normal, day-to-day work, whether that is processing pensions, disability or carer's allowance applications, or all the other payments across the board.  It can be easy to take for granted that everything will run smoothly and that payments will be there every week, but a great deal of work goes on behind the scenes to make that happen.  It has been a monumental effort across the board by staff in every county to keep the show on the road this year and I acknowledge those efforts.  <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman.  I look forward to hearing members' questions and to working constructively with the committee in what will continue to be challenging times ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#A00600","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":802,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I know that the payment reference period is being extended.  The Department will look at 2019, January and February, and January to September.  That is really welcome.

It is on something I have raised with the party leaders both privately and publicly, the issue of the pandemic unemployment payment as against the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the new wage subsidy scheme.  I believe we should do everything possible to ensure that as many employees as possible remain on those latter schemes and that employers are encouraged and supported in that regard.  We should ensure that employees maintain, insofar as is possible, the same level of income through those supports as they had earned when they were in employment because,  as we hopefully transition out of the Covid-19 restrictions and away from the pandemic unemployment payment, we will see challenges arise in getting people back into the workforce.  Employers may not have a full week's work for their employees.  They may only have one or two days a week.  The temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme are far more effective in transitioning people back into employment than the pandemic unemployment payment.<\/p> <p>  As I have said from the outset, that is where the focus should have been from day one.  Unless we address this now, when the payments are at their current rates, and put a structured transition in place, we are only kicking a grenade down the road which will cause great disruption for the families who rely on this income, for employers and for the economy overall.  I will now let the Minister respond to the various questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#E00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":818,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  There were a good few questions.  I will try to go through them.  I will start with the Chairman's.  I agree that it is better that employers take up what was the temporary wage subsidy scheme, now the employment wage subsidy scheme.  The purpose of these schemes is to maintain the link between employers and their employees.  Nobody thought we would be under restrictions for as long as we have been.  It was initially thought they would last six weeks, which was then extended again and again.  The whole point of the schemes was to ensure the workforce would be ready to be mobilised, that contact would be maintained and that the time might be used for reskilling or upskilling staff.  The aim was to make sure that people were ready to go so that the engine could be turned on and that we could get going again whenever the restrictions were lifted.  I want to see that continue.<\/p> <p>  Companies will inevitably hit difficult patches even in normal times.  That is why we introduced the short-time working payment, which allows one to work a certain number of days with one's employer while receiving benefits for the remaining days.  I want to build on that scheme.  We considered it when I was Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and we worked with my predecessor, Senator Doherty, in that regard.  We were looking at how to operate a system whereby companies who may have to lay off staff temporarily due to Brexit could maintain a connection with those staff.  We had done a good deal of work, which is why we were able to bring in the temporary wage subsidy scheme fairly quickly.  We had some work done on that idea at that time.  I agree with the Chairman that this is something with which we need to deal and that we need to look at how it can be improved.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v talked about courses.  If one is doing a short-term part-time course one can stay on the PUP.  I take his point that we cannot consider courses that may take a year to finish.  The PUP is not a permanent social welfare payment.  When this virus is gone, we hope it will no longer be required.  We will then move away from it.  The reason we wanted people to onto the back-to-education allowance was that they would sometimes take up courses of two or three years.<\/p><p>They would then have no payment if they remain on the PUP because we plan to stop that at the end of March.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#E00300","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":820,"content":"<p>Good luck with that one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#F00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":821,"content":"<p>We will look at it again in January to see what the situation is like.

For example, jobseeker's allowance is not taxable while jobseeker's benefit is.  Child dependant allowance is not while carer's allowance is.  All the pensions are taxable so someone moving from jobseeker's allowance to a contributory or non-contributory pension will be taxed.  We have an erratic and funny system regarding what payments are taxable.  I accept that if someone is on a basic social welfare payment, even if it was taxable, and had nothing else except a means-tested payment, he or she would not pay tax because it is not liable for USC.  None of it is liable for USC.  A person does get the PAYE allowance on social welfare payments as well as the basic personal allowance so I think it is time to sort that one out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#F00600","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":825,"content":"<p>We want the Minister to respond to all the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#F00700","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":826,"content":"<p>I appreciate that tax is a matter for Revenue but to be clear, when the PUP was introduced in March, it was introduced under section 202 of the 2005 Act.

The answer is that the person will get the best of both worlds.  It is the best calculation.

If a person is not happy, he or she can appeal it.  <\/p> <p>  We had a good few arrears on the original PUP.  We have all received calls to our offices.

In a parliamentary reply of 20 October, the Department stated the 2020 CE budget was &euro;364 million, which would provide for approximately 22,750 places, but at the end of September, there were only 19,315 participants, which leaves 3,400-odd vacancies.  That is serious.  I was told that at the end of August, there were 2,270 vacancies in the T&uacute;s programme.  When those two figures are added together, that is 5,000.  I understand that names are not being put forward to the CE companies that have vacancies and that badly need the workers but cannot get them because the names are not being put forward.  I understand that the reason for that relates to JobPath.  I have never favoured JobPath as an approach.  I am very wary of privatising and monetising data because it is a game of just calling everyone in and getting paid.  If the people who would have got a job then get one, JobPath is paid again.  If there were no JobPath, 99% of the people who get jobs would get them in any event.  I am absolutely convinced of that and I had the experience of employing people when I was the manager of a co-operative.  Most people who lose employment find it again, because the world goes around and they get into employment.<\/p> <p>  I agree with what my colleague said about JobPath.  For three reasons, namely, local services, personal well-being and the national good, we should examine the CE and T&uacute;s schemes and ensure that all the places are taken up.  We should have a hierarchy whereby if a vacancy arises, somebody new coming in should have first preference, but if such a person cannot be found, the people already in place should be kept indefinitely because there is nobody else to take the position, particularly in the case of the T&uacute;s scheme.  We should move away from the one-year model for T&uacute;s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#H00300","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":837,"content":"<p>Before the Minister comes back with responses, I echo the comments Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has just made.  I have a couple of specific questions.  The Revised Estimate for the work placement and experience programme is &euro;3.67 million, which seems a very small amount of money.  The detail of it has yet to be announced.  What are the projected numbers for this year?  I know they are more than 10,000 for next year, but is there an opportunity to ramp it up beyond that figure based on demand?  What specific focus is being put on to engage directly with employers to ensure that those places become available?  This could be a very useful scheme if it is structured properly, but it is imperative that there is an incentive for people to take on this experience without being exploited, and an incentive for employers.  They need to be made aware of this particular scheme.<\/p> <p>  Two other issues have been referenced.  First, on the enterprise support grant for people over the age of 66, we have taken a decision where we want people to work longer in the workforce.  I know there has been a postponement put on that at the moment, but that is the view of Government, that we want people to work longer in the workforce.  Yet these very people in the workforce who are working beyond their 66th birthday were denied the pandemic unemployment payment and the enterprise support grant to get back to work.  They are, therefore, being doubly discriminated against.  It is going to be very difficult to encourage people to remain in the workforce into the future if this is the approach that is being taken to them during a pandemic like the one we are dealing with.<\/p> <p>  Second, I echo the comments of Deputy Carey.  It would be useful if we could get an update on the community employment supervisors' pensions.  This is a very contentious and long-running issue.  I know from my previous discussions at the Cabinet that it is not a black and white issue, but it does need to be resolved and cannot drag on much longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#J00100","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":838,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for the questions, and I will do my best to answer them.  On the enterprise support grant and people over the age of 66, the pandemic unemployment payment is payable to people between the ages of 18 and 66.  This is consistent with other social protection schemes payable to people of working age who have lost their employment.  People aged 66 years and over are provided for through the contributory State pension or the means-tested non-contributory State pension.  Anyone over the age of 66, therefore, is getting a payment, whether it is a contributory or non-contributory State pension.  They are entitled to one of those.  A person in receipt of the contributory State pension can retain his or her entire State pension and employment income.  If a person does not have the required number of contributions to receive the maximum rate of the contributory State pension, he or she may qualify for the non-contributory State pension, depending on the person's circumstances.<\/p> <p>  People aged 66 and over may also be entitled to auxiliary supports such as free travel, fuel allowance, household benefits, packages and the living alone allowance.   There are many other supports, therefore, that they are getting.  They can, if they are over 66, apply for the employment wage subsidy scheme.  They are also entitled, if they have a business premises, to get the restart grant and the restart plus grant, and there are a number of other supports.  In terms of social protection, our payments and supports under the pandemic are cut off at the age of 66.  We have looked at it but we are still coming back with the same answer, that they are getting the other payments.  We are trying to be fair and make sure that everybody gets the support, including those who have lost their jobs and have no other form of income.  They have their pensions and all the add-on benefits that come with the pension to help them meet their costs.<\/p><p> Regarding community employment, CE, and T&uacute;s schemes, Deputies will agree with me when I say that CE workers the length and breadth of the country do a wonderful job in the services they provide in local communities.  We have examined CE schemes.  Only a couple of years ago, we increased the age to which someone could remain on a scheme.  I believe it is 62 years of age now.  There has been an increase in the number of participants in CE schemes and it should increase further from 19,244 at the end of October to 22,700 by 2021.  The number of participants in T&uacute;s schemes should increase from 3,700 at the end of October to 5,500 by quarter 2 of 2021.  The 3,000 additional places envisaged in the July stimulus package are over and above the February 2020 position, with a breakdown of 75% CE and 25% T&uacute;s.  That is the level we are aiming towards.<\/p><p> Regarding back to work initiatives, we have the work placement and experience programme.  It is a very good programme and we plan for 10,000 participants.  We are finishing up its details and hope to announce it shortly.  Many of us know people who were able to avail of a similar programme in the past and who got good jobs out of it.  There are still some issues that we need to address with the programme, but we will announce it shortly.  We will also engage with employers and ensure that the programme benefits the employee and the employer.<\/p><p> The CE supervisor issue is a long-running one.  We have all had representations on it on foot of a Labour Court ruling in 2009.  We have been engaging with supervisors.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, has also been engaging with them.  I believe he has met them.  Discussions are ongoing between my Department and his.  We hope that we will be able to find a resolution to this long-running issue and are working hard on that.<\/p><p> I take the Deputies' concerns about JobPath on board.  The OECD has worked with my Department to measure the effectiveness of JobPath.  The findings, which were published last year, indicated that weekly earnings for JobPath clients were 17% higher and employment outcomes were 26% better compared with similar individuals who were not supported by JobPath.  Given the current level of unemployment and the fact that many people are receiving the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP - unfortunately, some will never return to their old jobs because those jobs will not be there any longer - we cannot let the JobPath contract lapse without replacing that capacity.  JobPath contractors provide approximately 40% of our public employment services' capacity.  There would not be sufficient capacity within the existing structures to support the anticipated increase in numbers requiring access to employment services without there being a JobPath service in 2021.  We have examined this issue and, in light of our situation, we have rolled JobPath out for a further year.  We could not have done otherwise, given that we would not have the necessary capacity without it.  That said, we have put out to tender local employment services in four areas that do not have any currently.  I hope that the local providers will be able to submit an offer to do that work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#J00200","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":840,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  Before I turn to members, I wish to discuss the over-66s.  An argument has been made to me.  There is a cohort of people over the age of 66 who have no entitlement to a contributory State pension and who, because they were working, are not entitled to a non-contributory State pension.  They have fallen between the cracks but should have been eligible for the PUP.  It could have been structured in such a way as to ensure that someone did not get a second payment, which is the case under the social protection rules anyway.  This affects a small cohort of people who are being discriminated against.  I will not get into a debate now, given that we will revert to this matter when we discuss the social welfare Bill, but I just wanted to make the point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#L00100","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":841,"content":"<p>The Minister stated that she had considered extending the PUP to over-66s.

I assume that her Department has examined the cost.  Does she have the figures?<\/p> <p>  It took us two years to find out the fees relating to JobPath.  We got them through the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is an enormous cost to the taxpayer.  One need not discuss how people are treated or so on if one just looks at the figures - &euro;3,718 per person who sustains a job for 52 weeks.  People are being referred two, three or four times.  Each time someone is referred, the company automatically gets &euro;311.

I would be interested in seeing the methodology that the OECD used to work out the magic figure of 17%.  I have a funny feeling that it was working on JobPath's reports, and what would they tell someone other than it pays very well, given that the contractors' livelihoods depending on giving a good answer?  From my experience on the ground, I am sceptical about that figure.  One case is not a generality, but a constituent of mine was on jobseeker's allowance and was doing what was technically a part-time course, namely, a Hibernia course to become a teacher.  My constituent was called up to JobPath, given that the constituent was on the magic list.  This person already knew they were going to qualify that summer, given that they were a native Irish speaker and would not have too much difficulty getting a job as a full-time teacher.  I would love to see the report on the salary level that that person earned <i>&agrave; la<\/i>JobPath.  It was ridiculous that this constituent was forced in, but the company needs the numbers.  It is driven by numbers.  At the other extreme are people who, for one reason or another, will never get jobs.  They go to JobPath and learn typing skills even though they can hardly read or write.<\/p><p>The cost of JobPath needs to be examined.  When it was provided by the State, this service was much less money driven, was much more understanding of people's realities and dealt with individuals as real people.<\/p><p>JobPath is driven by profit because the service is run by a for-profit organisation.  It is in it to make money and it is not in it for anything else.  Whereas I believe when we are dealing with people who are unemployed, particularly those who are long-term unemployed, a much more nuanced approach needs to be taken so that is not driven by profit but by the personal benefit of the people we are trying to look after.  In an extreme case, the person who is going to get the job is a teacher anyway.  We would have said that was grand, to keep studying and not interfere with it.  People who are unlikely to get commercial jobs would be better put into community employment schemes where there may be a graduated step forward.  I do not like this being driven by profit rather than being motivated by the people.  Will this issue be reviewed?<\/p><p> Will we be given the OECD report?  I am absolutely fascinated to see the methodology.  I presume we will be given the report which tells us what the answer is but I want to know the methodology by which the answer was arrived at.  The greatest oxymoron we get in the English language all the time is when reports tell us that based on the following suppositions what the conclusions and facts are.  However, they are not facts if they are based on supposition no matter how much the supposition is a big part or small part of the report's conclusions.  Any scientific approach will tell us that once we start putting in suppositions the conclusions are what we think but they are not hard facts because we have created doubts by putting in suppositions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#L00300","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":844,"content":"<p>I want to add my voice to those of Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Kerrane.

I know what they are saying and I have seen it myself.<\/p><p>To go back to JobPath, there are 201,000 people on the live register and a further 340,000 people are in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment.  The economic impact of the pandemic has certainly increased the number of people who are likely to require these supports.<\/p><p> I mentioned the OECD report and I am very happy to provide the committee with a copy of it.  It is not a problem.  JobPath has a proven track record of providing sustained employment.  Up to September 2020, more than 280,000 jobseekers had commenced engagement with JobPath and to date more than 64,000 jobseekers have commenced employment during their engagement period with JobPath.  In 2018, the Comptroller and Auditor General undertook a detailed report on the JobPath service and, in particular, he examined how the Department of Social Protection monitored and measured the achievement of the JobPath contract objectives and the associated costs.  It is notable that the Comptroller and Auditor General made no recommendations on how the JobPath service is governed.  He did not see any issue there.<\/p><p> We are facing record unemployment as a result of the pandemic and now is not the time to be cutting support services.  JobPath is just one part of the jigsaw.  We are also expanding the capacity of other contracted employment services, such as the local employment services, job clubs and EmployAbility.  These contracts are also being extended into next year.  This will include the expansion of the footprint of community-based contract services, as I said earlier, with four new geographical areas where a local employment service does not currently exist.  The Government is also expanding the capacity of job search support services provided by the Department of Social Protection's Intreo offices countrywide.  An additional 300 staff will work in the Department in 2021, including expanding the capacity of the Intreo centres to provide employment services and supports with the assignment of an additional 100 job coaches.  Recruitment for these posts has started and it is intended to fill these positions over the coming weeks.<\/p><p> The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is increasing investment in apprenticeship schemes, including the provision of incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, and short-term courses by investing in more than 35,000 new education and training places.  Young jobseekers can now benefit from the JobsPlus scheme after being unemployed for four months instead of 12 months.  We have made changes to the back to education and the back to work allowances.  As part of the July stimulus we have opened access to these schemes to persons who have lost their jobs during the Covid pandemic by waiving the waiting period, which is between three and nine months in more normal circumstances.  Persons who have temporarily lost their jobs during the Covid public health restrictions can also avail of part-time education programmes while continuing to receive the pandemic unemployment payment, and we discussed this earlier.  I also spoke about the additional community employment and T&uacute;s places.<\/p><p> There is a bigger picture here and JobPath is only one part of the jigsaw.  The total cost of the JobPath service to date is &euro;244.7 million.  The total number of people engaged to date is more than 280,000, giving a total cost per client of &euro;873.  Delivering 12 months of employment services engagement for this cost compares favourably with the cost of other public employment service provision and provides value for money.<\/p><p> This will go out to contract.  Other providers now have time.  It has been extended and it will go out to contract in late 2021 or 2022.  Now is the time for all of the other providers to put their case together and prepare for the contract for this.  I looked at this very carefully because I took on board the concerns of committee members, and I have heard various stories, but generally the figures I have received show complaints are low at only 1,267 complaints out of 280,000 participants, which is less than 0.5%.  These are the figures I have been given.  At the time we are in, it would not be wise to withdraw a full service such as this that has a role to play as part of a bigger picture.  It will go out to contract at some stage next year and it will then be up to everybody interested in providing these services, whether community-based or whatever, to put in a bid to tender for this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2020111100002#M00600","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":850,"content":"<p>Is everyone happy with No. 5?

I wish I could say that we had the same tolerance, understanding and pliability with some other agencies, particularly those who deal with a certain card that people with health issues need to get.  It is a very good service but there is an issue.<\/p> <p>  I presume that a lot of the Minister's staff are following the instruction to work from home.  In this context, has the Minister looked at remodelling her Department?  At the moment the pensions unit is in Sligo, the child benefit unit is somewhere else, the unit dealing with carers is located in Longford and so on.  Has she considered allowing people to work in different places?  Somebody may work in part of the pensions unit or whatever but want to work in Longford as it is more convenient for them.  I ask her to allow more people to work near where they live so that they partially work in an office of her Department and partially work at home or whatever the case may be in this new hybrid world we are all going to get into.  I urge that staff would not necessarily have to work where the headquarters of a particular section of her Department is located.  It would be interesting if the Minister would comment on this matter.  Her Department has offices in Buncrana, Sligo, Longford, Carrick-on-Shannon as well as more local offices located throughout the country.  There are a large number of social welfare offices located throughout the country outside of Dublin.  Now is the time to change and allow people to work, where possible, near to where they live or would choose to live if they had the opportunity.  I mean that they would be able to go into an office three days or whatever number of days a week for meetings, socialisation and all the rest and then work from home the rest of the time.

There is a job of work to be done in terms of how the payment works.  Some officers will give it but some will not, so we could consider providing them with better guidelines.<\/p> <p>  In the Estimates there is a reference to control measures where 80% of people in receipt of a weekly social welfare payment make debt repayments.

I am developing a new regional development plan and, as far as I am concerned, this issue will be at its centre because it is the right thing to do.  People are working from home and some people would gladly go into a co-working space in a local town or village rather than stay at home all day because they would have good connectivity, the right environment and the social interaction they need.  Many people are working from home and doing tremendous work.  A person who works from home has a start time but sometimes no finish time.  Working from home encroaches on family life and it is not particularly healthy.  Now is the time to do that and I will look at what we can do in the Department of Social Protection.  Overall, in the Department of Rural and Community Development, now is the right time, so we need to grasp the opportunity and run with it.  Remote working was a concept a year ago but now the need for it has become a reality, so we must consider ways to make it part of our everyday lives.  We must accommodate people, so they can live in their own communities, and not have to commute or spend days away from their home or area.  I am happy to work with the committee on these proposals.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Social Protection has many offices.  I had intended to visit them but, unfortunately, with the Covid restrictions I have been unable to do so.  I think the first office I was going to was in Roscommon because that is where all the records on births, deaths and marriages are kept.<\/p><p>I have a particular interest in that from my time in culture and the arts but we will get there.  I will definitely be going to visit.<\/p><p> Deputy Carey raised the issue of parent's leave extension.  As the Deputy knows, as part of budget 2021, parent's leave will be increased from two weeks to five weeks per parent in relation to children born since November 2019.  As with many of the budgetary measures, there is a lead-in time for its implementation.  It requires legislative changes but I assure parents that everything is being done to make this support available as soon as possible.  I know Deputies are being contacted by parents who are currently on leave and who want to extend it.  Bear with us, there is legislation to go through.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, will bring the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He is working extremely hard on it and hopes to have it as soon as possible.  Until the legislation is enacted - and I look forward to Deputies' co-operation on that - there is no statutory obligation on employers to grant the extra leave.  Once the legislation is enacted, parents will be able to take the leave at that stage.<\/p><p> On the payment, a number of changes are being put through on the social welfare IT systems.  The Christmas bonus has to go through and there are a number of arrears and different things.  This is very important also.  We have been prioritising the work on the pandemic unemployment payment and getting the payments to workers impacted by level 5.  It is expected that the system changes in respect of parent's benefit will be in place at the end of March 2021.  We will make the payment for the leave that was taken.  Once the legislation goes through, the parents can take the leave and they will get the payment as soon as we get it processed and the IT systems updated.  It will be backdated so parents can take the leave in January.  They may not get the money until a month or two later but they will definitely get the money and it will be backdated.<\/p><p> The period during which this leave can be taken will be extended from 12 to 24 months.  That means parents with children who were born after November 2019 will have until November 2021 to take the leave.<\/p><p> Deputy Kerrane raised the issue of the exceptional needs payments.  It is a demand-led scheme and the money will be provided as it is needed.  It is there to help people who need it and I encourage people who find themselves in difficult situations to use that scheme.  The important thing about this Department is that it is here to help people.  Our number one purpose is to give people that helping hand when they need it.<\/p><p> On the question of 80% of people making debt repayments, I do not have the numbers but I will get them to the Deputy if that is okay.  The high number of appeals is probably related to the fact that there has been such a massive number of payments.  People have probably appealed the decisions and we are going through those and working with them all on a one-to-one basis.  I take on board what the Deputy said about the fuel allowance but I will have to check that out.<\/p><p> I think I have covered everything.  I thank Deputies for their co-operation.

This is important as not doing so causes serious problems for the broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.  I remind members to please maintain social distance at all times during and following our meeting.  Members are requested to use the wipes and hand sanitiser provided to clean the shared seats and desks to supplement the regular sanitisation in the breaks between meetings.  There is always the temptation to stay talking to our guests after our meeting but there are other committee meetings happening after ours.  I therefore encourage members to retire to the lobby if they wish to have a discussion with guests afterwards, which they are more than welcome to do.  Rather than hanging around in here however, I ask that we vacate the room and leave it free for the sanitisation that needs to happen.<\/p> <p>  I welcome to the meeting Mr. Adrian Lynch, director of audience, channels and marketing at RT&Eacute;; Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley, Irish secretary of the National Union of Journalists; and Mr. John Purcell, CEO of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland.  Mr. Lynch, Mr. Dooley and Mr. Purcell are here to discuss the future of Irish broadcasting and the impact of Covid-19 on the sector.  I am sure our guests have already noted that their opening statements should not be longer than three minutes each and these will be followed by questions from members of the committee.

This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they might say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to identifying a person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with such direction.  I have no doubt that will not happen but it is important to point that out.<\/p> <p>  I invite Mr. Lynch to make his opening statement and remind him that it should not be longer than three minutes, if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#A00400","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":871,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to attend today.  I am pleased to meet with it to discuss the critical issues facing public media in Ireland.  Covid-19 has had a huge impact on the media sector generally, not least on public media.  At the start of this pandemic, our focus was simply on staying on air or remaining in print.  We have gone far beyond this initial ambition to deliver for the people of Ireland, day-in, day-out.  Despite the logistical, financial and human challenges of the early stages of the pandemic, Ireland&rsquo;s media, both local and national, has played a critical and leading role in keeping people informed, engaged, and safe.  Naturally, I want to highlight the very particular contribution made by RT&Eacute; during this time.  Along with public service media all over Europe, RT&Eacute; has informed and empowered the public in Ireland.  In the most recent Behaviour and Attitudes research, 90% of audiences indicated that they turned to RT&Eacute; for Covid-19 coverage, while a further 76% said that they would trust RT&Eacute; above all else.  This is confidence and trust has been earned over many years and in many ways.  Whether it be in moments of celebration or in times of crisis, it is RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s privilege and unique responsibility to be the place to which people turn and which brings the nation together.<\/p> <p>  Once again RT&Eacute; demonstrated its clear public purpose during this crisis.  As an essential service, bringing the nation together, RT&Eacute; maintained full schedules across all services, augmenting where appropriate with additional live broadcasts and brand-new programmes.  Certain productions had to be suspended or stepped down due to public health restrictions.  However, new and exciting programming such as \"Home School Hub\", \"Ireland on Call\" and \"RT&Eacute; Investigates: Inside Ireland's Covid Battle\" were commissioned in their place, often within exceptionally tight deadlines.  This level of resilience and this level of output under such challenging circumstances was not easy.  Thanks to the flexibility of staff as well as our partners in the independent radio and television sector, the service to the people of Ireland was not only upheld but excelled.<\/p> <p>  Alongside comprehensive and in-depth news coverage, RT&Eacute; has been a source of companionship, diversion and connection for millions.  People have leaned on our new daily religious services and on a wealth of pop-up cultural events supported by RT&Eacute;.  People have turned to Irish stories in all their forms, from documentaries, to drama and comedy, to investigative journalism.  The nation has joined together in helping us bring light to darker days, with events such as \"RT&Eacute; Shine a Light\" and \"RT&Eacute; Does Comic Relief\".  New Irish drama like the hugely acclaimed \"Normal People\" got the nation talking and connecting more than ever.  With connection comes community: we have rallied around Irish businesses, Irish artists, producers, front-line workers and the vulnerable.  RT&Eacute; and the people of Ireland have together raised more than &euro;12 million this year for charity.<\/p> <p>  For family and friends who could not travel back to Ireland, RT&Eacute; has played a unique and important role.<\/p><p>These achievements came against the backdrop of extreme financial uncertainty.  RT&Eacute; is funded through a combination of public funding and commercial income.  An immediate result of Covid-19 was a sharp drop in licence fee income and a decline in advertising revenue.  Commercial income in quarter 4 has stabilised to some degree, as has income from the television licence, but the outlook for 2021 is uncertain.  Certain types of expenditure, such as commitments to major sporting events, have only been deferred and this adds to the financial pressures of the year ahead.  The toll of Brexit on the national economy and commercial performance in 2021 is unknowable.  The combination of a broken television licence system and a precarious commercial environment exposes undeniable vulnerabilities for the national public service media.<\/p><p> The newly formed Future of Media Commission began its formal programme of work last week, with the intention that it complete its deliberations and formal assessment within the next nine months.  We welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to chart a pathway for public service broadcasting and independent media into the future.  This pathway is much-needed.  Covid-19 has underscored the importance of public service media to the functioning of a country, of a democracy, to the nurturing of cultural vitality, unity and community.  We would urge all members of the committee to engage with the work of the commission and to consider its recommendations with urgency, clarity and shared purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":873,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lynch.

On 20 March last, we called for a forum on the crisis then facing the media industry across all sectors and platforms.  While initiatives were taken in respect of tourism, hospitality and the arts, no immediate, substantial measures were taken to assist the media, apart from the welcome initiative in respect of independent commercial radio.  While employment in the print, broadcasting and digital sector is not comparable to tourism, the implications for democracy of a diminished media sector should be of concern to this committee.  Listening to the contribution of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, last week, I regret to say there was precious little clarity on how it is proposed to, for example, address the financial situation in RT&Eacute;.  We are gravely concerned for the future of public service broadcasting in Ireland.  There was no real recognition of the tsunami which is engulfing the newspaper sector, in particular the regional press.  The focus on independent production within broadcasting ignores the existence of freelance workers, writers, photographers and videographers in other sectors.  <\/p> <p>  We welcome that the Future of Media Commission has commenced its work but without immediate action there will be no future for many media workers in Ireland.  This is a point I know will be echoed by Mr. John Purcell.  It is worth noting that on 26 September 2014, the NUJ called for the establishment of a Government commission on the future of the media in a submission to a Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, seminar - Ensuring Plurality in the Digital Age.  This is not a new idea.  The union's recovery plan forms the basis for our approach to the current crisis and I have circulated, for ease of reference, a copy with this statement.  Among the short-term measures proposed by the NUJ are: a windfall tax of 6% on the tech giants, using the UK digital services tax model, towards funding a news recovery plan; assistance for freelance media workers who have sustained income losses but are outside the scope of wage subsidy schemes; no public money to firms making compulsory redundancies, cutting pay, giving executive bonuses or blocking trade union organisation; companies receiving public funds to be prohibited for five years from engaging in mergers and acquisition activity or leveraged buyouts that result in job losses or pay reductions; strategic investment in Government advertising and the establishment of an innovative fund to promote public service journalism at local and national level, developing the model used in the Simon Cumbers media fund established by Irish Aid; free vouchers for online or print subscriptions for all 18 and 19 year olds; and tax credits for households with subscriptions for over 70 year olds, in line with the free TV licence scheme. <\/p> <p>  I am happy to answer any questions the committee may have on the impact of the pandemic on the media industry, but I thought it useful at this stage to set out a strategic approach to the crisis and to appeal for a more imaginative approach to that crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":875,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dooley.

Radio listenership across our stations and RT&Eacute; in Ireland is a unique media success story.  Each day, a massive 3.9 million people listen to local, regional, city and national stations.  Some 68.6% of prime time radio listening by these people is spent listening to the member stations of Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI.<\/p> <p>  During Covid, prior to Covid and regardless of what happens post-Covid, our stations hope to provide an important public broadcasting service, inclusive of news, sports, discussion and a forum for debate, information and programme content that is relevant to the people who listen to us and reflects their lives.  Ours is a sector that has suffered huge disruption and decreases in revenue, threatening our services long before Covid.  We welcome the establishment of the Future of Media Commission and we look forward to working with Professor MacCraith and his colleagues.  However, we believe the entire process after the commission produces it report, from hearings to implementation of legislation, will, by its nature, be very protracted.  It is obvious that changes as a result of the deliberations will not be implemented until at least the second half of 2022 or, perhaps, into 2023.  We cannot wait that long.  We are preoccupied with surviving the current crisis.  We, and the entire media sector, need action now to enable the survival of our services and the services of other media through the protracted Covid crisis, which has intensified the already severe threats we face.  <\/p> <p>  Our sector is grateful for the special measures brought in to help us weather the initial Covid trauma.  This consisted of a fund of &euro;2.5 million distributed to stations that committed to specific public service programmes up to a period lasting to the end of the summer.  The broadcasting levy was also suspended for the first six months of this year.  Government investment in advertising on our stations was also hugely welcome.  We all thought, somewhat optimistically I think with hindsight, that a close to normal situation would have returned by the commercially crucial fourth quarter of the year.  Instead, we are spending November, the most commercially important month for all stations, in level 5 lockdown and the support measures lapsed months ago.  The broadcasting levy has been reintroduced since last July and the money allocated for Covid programming is now spent.  The &euro;2 million in the July stimulus package for sound and vision, which was mentioned by the Minister at this committee last week, does not apply to our stations.  We urgently need another fund to support public service output.  We also urgently need to have the broadcasting levy waived until such time as the necessary legislation to abolish it, which we have been promised as far back as 2016, can be implemented. <\/p> <p>  We are delighted to have the opportunity to meet the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, this coming Monday.  We look forward to that meeting.  We welcome the Minister's acknowledgement at this committee of the importance of the services we provide.  We were heartened by her pledge to work with us to ensure that we survive this current crisis and continue our important work.  I cannot emphasise enough the current situation for media operators, be they radio, television or newspapers, is very urgent.

In order for us to compete, the first thing is that we need to be the key destination for original Irish content.  The second thing is getting the technology right.  We have done a significant amount of work this year on improving the user experience.  In terms of the RT&Eacute; player, the growth we have seen this year is approximately 74% in terms of streams that are consumed.  It comes back to the financial challenges referred to in all three opening statements.  When it comes to investment in technology, particularly in a country the size of Ireland with associated issues in terms of scalability and everything like that - it is different for Netflix - one needs a significant capital spend.  If there are structural issues around financing, that can impede the ability to develop products that people will expect as basic hygiene.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of prominence, we are in the process of working with TG4 on a paper around prominence.  Prominence is key in discoverability.  Those present who have teenagers or younger children know they are consuming video in a totally different way.  There are many various gateways such as pay television, be it Sky, Virgin Media and so on.  It is really important for public service broadcasting to have anchor positions, be it within the electronic programme guide, EPG or, indeed, as we move towards Internet protocol, IP, in terms of an app.  We do not want other companies disaggregating our content.  We want our content to be findable.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the consumption of RT&Eacute; news and current affairs content during the pandemic, the 9 o'clock news regularly has 900,000 viewers, but there has been massive consumption on the RT&Eacute; player as well.  Those in the 15-34 age cohort have shown significant consumption of and engagement with public media, which we think is really important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":881,"content":"<p>Mr. Lynch mentioned the growth in online viewing figures.

Obviously, that throws up a challenge from a commercial view, as the Deputy pointed out, because we must try to offset any declines in linear with what we can gain from the online player's commercial revenue.  That said, in this market, premium Irish video on demand, VOD, has a very high value, partly because it specifically brings in many 15 to 34 year olds.

These companies have availed of pandemic unemployment payments and other subsidy schemes arising from the Covid pandemic while running the titles with a skeleton staff.  These titles have given valuable service to communities and communities are linked to them.  The Chair has titles in her own county and every county has them.  These titles are a household item and one would not have the weekly news if one did not have them.  I pay tribute to the wonderful journalists who have been cast aside and trampled on.

That paper has been taken over the same company that took over two titles in Tipperary, as well as newspapers in Limerick, Kildare and Offaly.  That is a consequence of the political failure to deal with the concentration of ownership.  That is a reality.  The other political failure is the failure to grant the right to trade union recognition and collective representation because the company that has taken over those titles and merged a number of titles, through merger by default, through common pages and all the rest of it.  That has happened because there has been no right to trade union representation.  There are consequences for media diversity.  One needs plurality.  One needs a number of titles in the same region to ensure that courts and news are covered.  One needs that kind of vibrant reporting because one needs to read differences of opinion and differences in focus.  Regional papers in this country are in a particularly precarious position.<br\/><br\/>Recently, the Government announced its nationwide resilience campaign.  What is significant in the criteria for that national media advertising campaign is that one sector is missing, namely, newspapers.

They need it because, like the local radio stations, they remain relevant.

To put those funds into perspective, a typical local radio station that is experiencing a 20% drop in its revenue at present would see a decrease of between &euro;350,000 and &euro;500,000 on a per annum basis.

That was really great.<\/p> <p>  Senator Warfield touched on the subject of online platforms and stuff so possibly I do not need to go into it again.  I noted that he said that 2.5 million people watched \"Normal People\" on the RT&Eacute; player service.  I would say that a similar number complained that they could not get the RT&Eacute; player to work, albeit perhaps not 2.5 million.  A negative reputation is a serious problem.  If the player has a reputation of not working, one will not be able to drive the traffic to it.  That must be recognised because the player has really great content.

It is great to have someone from the National Union of Journalists present.  Perhaps someone can offer a commentary on the need for State support to be given to freelance journalists.

Unfortunately, the scheme is confined to broadcast journalism so a whole series of journalists have been left out. <\/p> <p>  From a Labour Party perspective and workers' rights perspective, I am concerned about workers' rights in the sector.  I am firm in my belief that if the State is to give special assistance, then there should be corresponding assurances about employment rights, wages and payment.  In particular, there is the recognition of the rights of workers to be represented by trade unions.  The commercial radio sector is generally low paid and union recognition sometimes has been fraught.  Some stations do recognise union recognition but it is something of a problem across the sector.  Today, I heard there have been pay cuts at a number of radio stations.  How will we balance State aid and supports with workers' rights, if they are the ones having pay cuts and losing out?  I know I have left only a tiny amount of time for the witnesses to answer. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#D01200","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":904,"content":"<p>I agree with the Senator that many of those cuts have been imposed without negotiation, which is inappropriate.

Many other freelancers were excluded and the only way that they could look for aid was to go for jobseeker's allowance.  If they qualified for that, then they could not work at all.

I will start with Mr. Purcell.  I do not have any questions.  I just want to lend my support and to reiterate the importance of local radio stations.  In Cork, we are really lucky to have C103, 96FM and RedFM.  Taking a show like \"Cork Today\" as an example, which is broadcast on C103, the service and information it has provided in the pandemic has demonstrated its importance more than anything else.  Prior to that we had the likes of Storm Ophelia where we were all pretty much locked behind closed doors as well or the beast from the east weather event.<\/p><p>The support and information that station gave to the public, as well as the comfort that it was, was significant.  I echo the witnesses' calls.  They have made a couple of simple requests regarding the reintroduction of the waiver of the levy and the expansion of the sound and vision scheme, something that I would certainly support and urge the Minister to listen to the witnesses about.<\/p><p> On the issue of regional newspapers, which I might address to Mr. Dooley since he mentioned it in his address, again they provide a really important service.  In regions such as west Cork, some local newspapers are read by some people from back to front and front to back again.  They depend on the distribution of those newspapers in the local shop and that option is not there under lockdown.  One can imagine that the revenue for these newspapers is falling.  The advertising revenue is falling because businesses are struggling or relying on supports.  One challenge that I am sure they are facing, because the normal place to distribute the paper would be in the shop where people would pick it up and buy it, is that they are trying to move to providing online services.  It is very difficult, however, for these regional papers to compete with the other online offerings.  Are there any ideas or creative ways to address that?<\/p><p> I will follow up on my question to Mr. Lynch.  I am disappointed that Ms Dee Forbes is not here.  She is a fellow west Cork person, from Drimoleague where my father is from.  I hope she gets better soon.  I commend RT&Eacute; on the service that it has provided in general, and especially over the past months during the pandemic.  I assume the figures for bulletins providing public health updates are through the roof.  I would compare a public service broadcaster such as RT&Eacute; to public transport.  We need to invest in it.  It does not necessarily always have to be about profit-making and huge revenue.  Obviously revenue has to be maintained, but the State has to protect the public service broadcaster, while keeping the balance of independence.<\/p><p> Mr. Lynch mentioned in his statement that the licence fee process is broken.  Will he elaborate on what alternatives there might be?  The BBC is talking about changing its model and moving to something closer to the Swedish model.  It is obviously having significant issues competing with the huge streaming services such as Netflix and is trying to find ways around it.  I understand that even the BBC is having difficulty and it is a huge corporation.  What do we do to combat that?  Most speakers have mentioned \"Normal People\" and its success.  Is that what we need to do?  We have creativity, skill and talent.  Do we need to invest in our own productions that we can export and earn income from?  We can do just as well as the BBC on natural history, for example.  Should we do more of that?<\/p><p> We have about a minute left.  The first question is about the regional papers possibly going online and the second-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#E03200","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":938,"content":"<p>I presume that at some stage, the committee will hear from the newspaper owners.

There is no point in talking about how wonderful they are if the Government does not actually resource them.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's final point, since I also represent broadcasters, I would advise the committee against one thing.

IP is the basis of the entire broadcasting industry, certainly from a revenue point of view in terms of a return.  It is essential.  Coming back to the licence fee, if we manage to fix it, it means that we can invest in other broadcasters and in the independent sector, which is a key partner for us.  We know we have the talent here from the story-telling point of view to tell our story to the world.  It is trying to recognise also that when that is done, such as something like \"Normal People\", there is a reason that thousands of people are now trying to get into Trinity College.  People will want to come and visit here.  It has a cultural impact.  We need to see beyond the small numbers.  We really value culture here and we have a fantastic culture.  That is a great story that we can tell the world.  That is key and I concur with the Deputy's point.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the collection part, that will be for the commission to determine.  There are many examples across Europe.  When the Deputy was talking earlier, he was almost describing public service media as a utility to democracy.

I have a couple of observations and questions for Mr. Lynch.  He quite rightly told us earlier that one of the key elements of public service broadcasting is to nurture our cultural vitality.  If any country can stand proud with in terms of its cultural vitality and cultural output, it is Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I was previously Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora.  If one looks at the success of Joe Biden reciting the Heaney piece on the news recently, which is up to 10.5 million views at this point, there is a ready, willing and perhaps voracious audience for the kind of content that Ireland is renowned for.  When one looks at streaming services and on-demand television, what kind of work is happening within RT&Eacute; right now to connect with the more than 70 million Irish worldwide?  Maybe there is not any, but should there be?  It is a ready and willing audience to enjoy that cultural richness that we have to offer.  I know there are issues relating to IP and so on.  TG4 seems to have overcome them to a certain extent.  Is there a way of communicating better with our 70 million people worldwide and leveraging that to increase income?  I agree with Mr. Lynch that we have an extraordinary story to tell to the world and we have that incredible Irish community around the world who are more than willing not alone to be recipients of that story but to pass that story on to others as well.  That video from a couple of nights ago is just one example of that.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Dooley for his contribution also.  Early on in the establishment of the Future of Media Commission, I identified a lacuna in the membership of the board in terms of representation from journalists themselves - working journalists and journalists on the front line - and I am delighted to see that Siobhan Holliman has now been appointed to the commission.  Her insights from working in local radio, local journalism and local print media will be very valuable in determining how the Future of Media Commission explores the challenges faced by that sector and works collectively to address them in the future.<\/p> <p>  I could not agree more with Mr. Purcell.  If one looks at the recent joint national listenership research, JNLR, figures, listenership for local radio is growing exponentially.  What his organisation's members have done, reflecting my own experience with Galway Bay FM, has been incredibly important in building powerful social solidarity during the pandemic.  From the moment Galway Bay FM starts to broadcast at 6.30 a.m., there is a sense of togetherness, community and looking out for those who perhaps live alone across our communities, particularly in rural Galway, who know that they are being listened to and their fears are being addressed.  It happens day in, day out.  It is a normal part of the endeavours of that station.  That is my only experience but I am sure it is replicated across the whole of local radio.  We need to make sure that that can continue, not just to survive but to thrive in the future and to continue to have the opportunity to continue building that social solidarity and to showcase the wonderful richness of our local culture.  Sometimes they do not have that opportunity to get national exposure and local radio has a crucial role to play there.<\/p> <p>  I wholeheartedly support Mr. Purcell's ongoing calls for the lifting of the broadcasting levy and for some additional funding supports to be provided so that when we get to the end of this, and we will get to the end of this, broadcasters are as well positioned as they were at the beginning of this to continue to provide that service to local communities.

In the past few months, the people of Ireland have really appreciated the media.  As a politician, I am almost afraid to open the newspapers in the morning or to listen to a radio station in terms of all the bad news but in recent months the information the citizens got on a daily basis from the national television and radio stations, the national newspapers but particularly the local newspaper and radio stations was excellent.  I come from County Louth.  We have a radio station called LMFM and money could not buy the service it provides on a daily basis, especially to older people.  It has done a fantastic jobs in the past number of months.<\/p> <p>  I always say, \"Stay local\".  By that I mean stay in Ireland.  I would call myself a channel hopper.  If I picked up the remote my wife and the children would go mad because I keep switching stations but, in fairness, I have got to know the Irish stations in the past nine months and whether it is news, sports, drama or documentaries they have done a fantastic job and really put their shoulder to the wheel.  I am a sportsperson and I believe they have done a great job in terms of the coverage of sport in the national and local media.  It is something I took for granted but I will no longer take it for granted.<\/p> <p>  This is an opportunity for everybody, especially in terms of publicising.  Local stations and local newspapers are struggling but, please God, if we all put our shoulders to the wheel and stay local we can provide an opportunity in terms of some great programmes.  I was a fan of \"Normal People\".  The 12 episodes were fantastic.  They way it was put out, two episodes a night, made it even better but I would get annoyed when I read the credits at the end of each episode, which said that \"Normal People\" was an Irish drama, which is great, produced by Element Pictures for BBC 3.  That really annoyed me.  It was a story about Ireland and I would have loved to see the whole production done in Ireland.  The same applies to \"Mrs. Brown's Boys\".  The credits state that it is a BBC 1 presentation.  That gets to me.  Why were two of the most popular programmes getting all the credits from the UK?  I do not give credit often but I am giving credit to Mr. Purcell, Mr. Lynch and Mr. Dooley because what they have done in the past nine months is fantastic.

The Deputy has made a very good point.  It comes back to funding, to an extent.  In Element Pictures we got an international, independent production company which is working at the highest level.  Much of drama is co-produced so a number of parties put money into it.  They developed that particular project with BBC and, again, it is because our finances have been so suppressed in the past five to six years that the level of drama we have been doing has been way off what we want to be doing.  We are changing that now but it means leveraging every euro we have from a licence fee point of view and putting that together with a partner abroad to tell an Irish story.  There is the funding mechanics part, and the Deputy will find that most drama is co-produced.  There are a number of parties involved including distributors, co-producers and other broadcasters.  The most important part is that we are in a situation financially where we can nurture talent in Ireland and then bring that story to the world.  As the public service broadcaster, we should be at the engine of that.  There is a price on that because it needs to be funded but the reward is significant for all the reasons the Deputy outlined.

We are governed by legislation.  We are regulated, monitored and so on yet the other online giants, as Deputy Shane Cassells said earlier, create a toxic environment and do not face half the restrictions.  We need action urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Purcell"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":948,"content":"<p>I thank the three contributors.  I echo many of the comments made.  At a local level, the contributions of South East Radio, the People group of newspapers and the <i>Gorey Guardian<\/i>, in my area, have been excellent.  At this time in particular, it shows the value of trusted news sources, to which I will come back.<\/p><p>I also compliment RT&Eacute;.  Deputy Cannon mentioned the lovely montage by Jackie Fox, which got plenty of deserved coverage, and the piece with Joe Biden reading the Heaney poem.  I would welcome RT&Eacute;'s continued support of the arts.  Mr. Lynch mentioned the Wexford Opera Festival but I refer to the All-Ireland Drama Festival.  There is a clear commitment to communities in that regard.<\/p><p>The point Mr. Purcell made about regulation and so on was interesting.  If I wanted to take out a political advertisement, and we have been talking here about regulation of online political advertising, I cannot do it on RT&Eacute; or on local radio.  It is regulated to the nth degree yet there is no problem with me or anybody else taking out many advertisements on Facebook or actors from outside the State pumping in with regard to that.<\/p><p>The outdated electoral commission legislation, which I am aware we will be dealing with, needs to be addressed.  I might not be able to afford to take out advertisements on RT&Eacute; but I would certainly look at doing that on South East Radio.<br\/><br\/>I ask the three witnesses to respond to this point.  We are operating in a very different media environment.  Mr. Dooley will accept that it is no longer a battle between two local newspapers and, similarly, for RT&Eacute;.  We need to look to what is happening internationally.  We might give out at times about our media here but they are trusted news sources and are balanced.  We do not get the type of polarisation we have seen in the United States.  I am looking at what is happening in media and some of the challenges in this regard.  In terms of trusted media sources here, particularly in the print industry but in other areas also, increasingly the content is behind paywalls; we have to pay for it.  If one wants to get <i>The New York Times<\/i>in the US it is behind a paywall, yet Breitbart and many others are all freely available.  It is about how we ensure that we can continue to get people to pay for trusted content.  I am conscious of Mr. Dooley's point on the windfall tax and so on.  He would be aware of what happened in France, Spain and Australia when efforts were made to deal with that.  I believe the social media giants needs to be tackled at a global level.<br\/><br\/>My second point is on digital literacy and the role the media have to play in helping people to interpret what are trusted news sources.  It should not just be about Twitter saying that something is not good.  There is a role for the media in that.  There is also a role for it in terms of explaining what we do as politicians but also about the value of trusted news and how it is checked.  The problem, and Senator Cassells referred to it earlier, is that when we download content on our phones there is no checking or examination of that.  <br\/><br\/>My next point, and the three witnesses might respond to it, is how we can ensure that we have trusted media sources.  We need to tell those Irish stories like &quot;Normal People&quot; and local news stories but the environment we are operating in now is very different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#G00700","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":950,"content":"<p>Who will answer that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#H00200","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":951,"content":"<p>The three witnesses might respond on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#H00300","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":952,"content":"<p>Within a minute or as close to that as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#H00400","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":953,"content":"<p>It is a serious issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#H00500","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":954,"content":"<p>My message from this committee would be to hope that despair and history rhyme and that it actually gets the message on this.

We have to say there is a limit to what the State will be able to provide.

We need to follow up on the Government public health advertising and messaging.  That appears to be an extraordinary omission on the part of the State for a sector that is crucial and has so much penetration.<\/p><p> The timing here is very important.  This week, in particular, I have been dismayed by the large amount of misinformation online and the massive amount of fake news.  If there is one thing the outgoing President of the United States left us with, it is the term \"fake news\".  However, there is so much of it in the public domain, it is shocking.  Democracy requires investment to protect reliable, verified sources and the people represented by the witnesses do that.  It is incumbent on all of us to work to that end.<\/p><p> Mr. Lynch is very welcome.  There has been much talk about \"Normal People\", but the return of \"The Den\" has been a great tonic for the country.  To see Zig and Zag, Dustin and Ray D'Arcy together on television is fantastic and gives a lift to many.  There was one child watching it with tears in his eyes last Sunday night after Kerry was knocked out of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship by Cork.  It certainly made him feel better.  That was just me.  My two children were watching it as well in our house.  It is fascinating to hear that many of the people who are watching it are now in their 50s and 60s.  They were parents of young children when \"The Den\" was first broadcast on television, which is an interesting observation.  That is a good departure and is very positive at this time for people.<\/p><p> However, I am mindful of the great content that exists in the archive.  I realise that \"The Den\" is a fresh attempt and is very successful, which is not always the case when people try to revive a programme.  This has been a success from the start, as far as I can see.  Take the example of \"Bachelors Walk\" from 2002.  The second series is on at present and people love it.  \"Pure Mule\" was shown during the first lockdown, along with other programmes such as \"Love\/Hate\".  There is a rich archive in RT&Eacute; and further delving into it would be much appreciated by the public, as well, of course, as investment in new content.  That is something that could be done.  RT&Eacute; has a very good archive online but bringing it more mainstream is important, particularly for a demographic that is not online very much.<\/p><p> It is critical that we invest again in the national broadcaster.  I have some concerns about the overall remit of the national broadcaster, where the private sector has filled what was originally set out as being the only show in town.  I am thinking of the remit of RT&Eacute;'s 2FM and the competition that exists now.  I wonder if there is room for rationalisation in that regard.  However, there is still a huge space there and RT&Eacute; deserves further funding.<\/p><p> The committee will continue to work in the interests of public service broadcasting and verifiable and reliable news, because that is one of the key threats to the State at present.  It is happening throughout the world, but it is very evident in Ireland and especially in the last couple of weeks.  It is incredibly worrying.  I thank the witnesses for the work they are doing.  The committee will continue our work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#H02100","speaker":"1581","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":971,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.

Only last week there was a huge water outage in half of County Longford and people heard about it on the local radio station.  Otherwise, they would not have known.  That is just a small matter, but I support any investment that goes to maintaining local radio.  Shannonside is my local radio station and it is an invaluable asset.

First, I thank the three witnesses for their presentations.  I will begin with you, Mr. Dooley.  You made your point loud and clear to the committee that talk is cheap and that investment is required.  Nobody in this room does not appreciate the organisations and journalists you represent.  My local newspapers are <i>The Anglo-Celt <\/i>and <i>Northern Standard<\/i>, and I believe Michael Fisher is heavily involved with your organisation.  Many houses are very much dependent on those media outlets for information, more so than on the<i>Irish Independent<\/i>or the national newspapers.  The pandemic has given all of us a new appreciation of media and the traditional media outlets.<\/p><p>The American presidential election has put a new emphasis on, and given impetus to, what has been fake news.  I appreciate the campaign RT&Eacute; has been running on real journalism and how journalism matters.  That message is coming through loud and clear.  The public has become more aware of that and is more reliant on the reliable, credible sources of information.<\/p><p>Mr. Purcell, with regard to Northern Sound Radio and Shannonside, a vacuum was created as a result of the restrictions due to the pandemic, with people not being able to visit each other and being lonely in their homes.  Northern Sound Radio and similar stations across the country certainly filled that vacuum.  They created support and comfort.  Undoubtedly, there is a newfound appreciation for the local radio stations.  There was a generational gap, perhaps, in terms of the younger generation, and that generation has become more familiar with their local radio stations and their local newspapers.<\/p><p>I know that Northern Sound and <i>The Anglo-Celt<\/i>have brought their information online and that has helped to reach the younger generation.  The pandemic has brought our appreciation of those media to the fore.<br\/><br\/>I have a specific question for Mr. Dooley about An Post and the delivery of newspapers.  As some of my colleagues have alluded to, perhaps some ordinary newspaper outlets have been closed, or whatever, during the restrictions.  Have we any figures that show the impact or otherwise of the restrictions on the delivery of newspapers by An Post?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#J01200","speaker":"1557","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":983,"content":"<p>I am not able to answer that question.  I know that it has been a positive experience in some areas.  NewsBrands and Local Ireland, the two representative bodies, could supply that information.  Some companies have been quite imaginative.  I know of one newspaper group that arranged to have its newspaper delivered through Meals on Wheels during the first wave of lockdown in order to ensure its readers got the paper.  That was imaginative.  I do not have any more information on that.<br\/><br\/>The newspapers that the Chairman has talked about were owned by the O'Hanlons and the Smiths.  There is a great tradition of family ownership in regional newspapers which meant that there was what I would call public-interest journalism.  We talk about public-interest, or public-service, broadcasting but there is such a thing as public-service journalism.  Public-interest or public-service journalism that local newspapers and radio do is sometimes overlooked.  Our language around that is important.  Reports on local deaths and local arts festivals are as much of public interest as &quot;Prime Time&quot;.  We need to get that message out there.  Not everything has to be stuffy.  Not everything within the covers of a newspaper is public-interest journalism but democracy suffers when local authority meetings or courts are not covered.<br\/><br\/>Lest I sound too positive about newspaper owners, there is a history of many of the larger companies not investing in journalism and the <i>quid pro quo<\/i>for any kind of state aid has to be a real commitment to investing in journalism.  There must be some process to include commitments to investment in journalism for any international or UK companies that decide to sweep up and buy Irish papers.  Quite frankly, the laws around competition, the second phase of acquisition under the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, are simply not adequate.  We are not getting it.

That dynamic has changed massively in the past 20 years.  More than 20 years ago, one could go around and identify the families who owned most of the newspapers in Ireland and had done so for decades, going back to the start of the 1900s.  Everyone was high on sugar during the good times and bought up newspapers because they saw them as vehicles to sell property supplements which turned out to be bigger than the regional newspapers themselves.  That was when we ran into trouble.  There was a slash and burn of newsrooms throughout this country, going back to 2007, 2008 and 2009.  Have we been able to quantify how many regional journalists lost their jobs?  I am guessing that has not been confirmed.  I am still in contact with people around the country and those newsrooms have not been replenished.<\/p><p>I want to stress the <i>quid pro quo <\/i>issue.  We had newspaper owners here last year.  I met them, as did every Deputy and Senator.  Mr. Lynch and Mr. Purcell have both made the point about the Government stepping up to the plate here and looking out for the interests of regional newspapers because we cannot allow local media to die because local democracy would die with it.  Equally, I would make the point that if the Government steps up to the mark, there has to be an investment in newsrooms by radio station and newspaper owners.<i><\/i>There cannot be a reduction in VAT that is only used to clear debt or that goes into the coffers of media companies that are no longer family owned but are owned by corporations, with no investment going to newsrooms.  I am glad that Mr. Dooley made that point because I would also make it.  If the Ministers intervene in that space, there has to be a commitment to newsrooms.<\/p><p>We have heard today from those who represent the workers in local media.  The ownership of media is another element to this debate.  Deputy Griffin touched on that point as it relates to a major player in the broadcasting space.  The commercial agenda of owners has equally to be discussed in this room.<\/p><p>At the end of the day, they are businesses.  Let us call a spade a spade.  These people here today are to represent the journalists.  People who own the entities are trying to make money and the best of luck to them because if they do not make money, they do not survive.  We must then look at investment in the newsrooms.  For decades, there was very good investment and there was a passion for making sure newsrooms were properly resourced.  Nobody will buy the local paper if it is full of fluff and does not have the substantial element people want from it but the editors cannot do that unless they are resourced by their owners.  I am sure the same applies to newsrooms in local radio as well - where they can send a reporter to an event after hours or sports event at the weekend.  The owners of these radio stations and newspapers need to be a part of this discussion.  At the end of this, I do not want to pat these people on the head and say, \"Thanks very much for your time, goodbye\".  I want us to report back as a committee and ask in what substantial way will there be a significant change.  These people cannot wait until next September.  In what substantial way, can we help the funding of newsrooms?  What will this country get back?  Where is the significant gain for the ordinary person buying that product or tuning in at the end of the day?  That is the real issue.  If we do not address that here, it will have been a waste of a conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#K02800","speaker":"1641","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>To make it clear, I represent the owners of the radio stations.  I am part-owner of the radio station where I work.  We are not looking for handouts.  The sound and vision scheme and the scheme for Covid constitute a model of how it can be done.  We submit a list of programme proposals and say that this is the programming we will provide so we will be able to cover council meetings, etc., this is the time it will take and this is the budget we allocating to it.  We submit that budget, that budget is approved and we then submit a cost report at the end so it is verified.  If public money is to be given to support public interest journalism on independent radio, we accept there needs to be transparency and this has been there through the sound and vision special Covid scheme and sound and vision scheme in general so we do not have an issue with that.<\/p> <p>  There is a lot of appreciation of the role of the media across all its spheres.  How do we continue?  I am meeting the Minister next Monday.  I do not want to come back in a year and a half and say things are the same.  As Mr. Dooley noted, there is an urgency to this and we need to make sure this is not just a flash in the pan where we come in here, say where we are at and just go off and disappear.  This needs to be the start of a process.  We look forward to engaging with the Minister.  We are thankful for the opportunity here today but I think this needs to be part of a process.  I hope this answers the Senator's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Purcell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>On that question, I would not even attempt a figure relating to the titles spoken about by the Senator.  There is a reality.  One of the major failures is that successive Ministers have not used the power under the amended competition Act under which there is a two-tier approach.  First, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission asks whether a business case is required.  One then goes to the Minister, who checks a list that includes editorial standards, resources and amendments.  We saw this during the previous committee in the context of the attempted acquisition of Celtic Media Group by Independent News and Media.  What was interesting is that the Minister of the day did use that power, it came to the previous committee, the committee interrogated it and that deal eventually did not happen.  In the case of Iconic Newspapers acquiring <i>The Tullamore Tribune<\/i>and <i>The Midland Tribune<\/i>, the Minister of the day did not exercise that right so the committee did not have the power to ask what Iconic Newspapers planned to do with the future of two long-standing newspapers in Offaly and whether there was going to be synergy between counties Laois and Offaly with counties Kildare, Tipperary and Limerick then thrown in.  That discussion did not take place.  The situation now is that a person can walk into Roscrea and buy two competing titles with the same story, the same headline and the same byline.  How can you do that and expect the sector to thrive?  The reality is that media diversity matters.  Tipperary and Offaly, and I say so as an Offaly man, are two different continents with different local authority areas and different sporting interests.  I used the example of <i>The Tullamore Tribune <\/i>and <i>The Midland Tribune <\/i>because it is the one I know best.  The Senator spoke about Longford.  The reality is that a member of the House of Lords came in and was allowed to buy up <i>The Longford News<\/i>and <i>The Roscommon Champion<\/i>, of which I was editor.  They are both gone.  The same individual acquired a newspaper in Athlone.  It is now gone.  Part of that is because nobody was listening.  I said that we called for a commission many years ago.  Regarding ownership, one of the reasons for this is because politicians are very reluctant to take on people who buy ink by the gallon.  That has traditionally been the response.  Politicians are nervous of newspaper owners.  That has always been an issue.  It was a lack of political will and we are now paying the price.  It is not too late.  We can look at funding models and look for assistance but if we do not do it soon, it will be too late and we will all regret it.<br\/><br\/>I have a vested interest.  I am unashamedly here because I represent journalists but I also know as a former regional newspaper editor that the local newspaper and local radio station are the heartbeat of the community.  I also represent workers in RT&Eacute; and it is great to come to a meeting of this committee and not have a whingeing session because RT&Eacute; is a very easy target.  God knows, I criticise Mr. Lynch and his colleagues frequently in negotiations but on this, we are on the one page.  If we were ever to reform the licence fee, now is the time to do it because there is a public understanding that nothing comes from nothing.  If we have a future pandemic and we do not fund public service broadcasting properly, we should not assume that the same service will be there because it cannot be.  RT&Eacute; has delivered a quality service despite the funding model.  I do not believe this can continue.  There is a real issue here about the public service remit.  In the same way as is the case with local radio stations, it is only so long that one can stretch an elastic band.  It does eventually break.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020111100002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>With that, we will bring our deliberations to a conclusion.

Donegal Airport is now recognised as a key element of the region's infrastructure for business and tourism development, and especially for essential needs such as health and education.  An independent economic impact study in 2019, by Fitzpatrick Associates, established that Donegal Airport's contribution to the regional economy, in terms of direct, indirect and induced economic impact, is &euro;46.6 million.  The airport also indirectly supports employment in the north-west region, amounting to 393 full-time jobs.<\/p> <p>  The future of Donegal Airport depends on the continuation of the essential public service obligation, PSO, service that links the county to the capital by a 45-minute flight compared with a road journey of between four and five hours, depending on the part of the country in which one lives.  Donegal Airport certainly meets the criteria for a PSO service and that must be extended beyond the end of the current contract in 2022.<\/p> <p>  In terms of State funding, the development of the regional airports programme, RAP, by the Department of Transport under EU regulations has given regional airports the necessary support to enable them to plan and implement the required capital projects for safe, secure and regulatory compliant airport operations under capex and the public policy remit-capital or PPR-C programmes.<\/p> <p>  The operation of the public policy remit-operations or PPR-O programme contributes to the costs associated with the provision of essential services with no economic return such as air traffic control, emergency and security services.  These funds enable the provision of public services by private airport operators.<\/p> <p>  Although much work was undertaken with input from all stakeholders, the current regional airports programme has not yet been agreed.  The airports await confirmation of the longer-term RAP approval in order to plan ahead.<\/p><p>In saying that, we welcome the Minister's announcement yesterday that the funding for regional airports has been increased for 2021 given the current climate.<\/p><p> With regard to the introduction of the EU traffic light system and Covid testing at airports, Donegal Airport welcomes the Minister's decision to progress the implementation of the EU traffic light system to reboot international travel.  We look forward to further detail on how this will be implemented.<\/p><p> We believe that pre-departure Covid testing may be the most effective way to allow unrestricted travel between countries and to restore consumer confidence in air travel.  We would be happy to work with the authorities in facilitating such testing and stand ready to progress whatever measures are required to be implemented.  A robust monitoring of the testing regime would have to form part of the overall process.

We fully appreciate the committee's limited time schedule, which is defined by risks associated with Covid-19 and, as such, we will keep this statement brief.  It is important and appreciated that the regional airports have a voice that is heard with regard to any decision-making or discussion on policy development in government and in opposition, and also to represent our colleagues in tourism and many other fields of commerce that are equally reliant on air travel.  It is correct to state clearly in this forum that so many people in rural Ireland are dependent on reliable air transport and have also endured the unfortunate consequences of Covid-19 on their businesses and livelihoods.  In Kerry, like all of the regional airports and members, we are eager to secure a real and absolute recovery in the coming months and years.<\/p> <p>  In the near future it would be very helpful to get a positive announcement regarding the regional airports programme, RAP, which would support us in re-establishing our path to growth and sustainability in the future.  We all understand that this journey has been given a significant blow that has set us back perhaps several years.  However, we still believe that with the support of the programme and sustained State funding we can continue to contribute so much more to our rural economies and the greater national purse than we receive.<\/p> <p>  We very much welcome last evening's announcement by the Government.  We thank the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, and our friends and colleagues in government, Deputy Brendan Griffin and the Minister for Education, Deputy Norma Foley, for their support through what has been a nightmare for us all here in Kerry, and in all the regions.<\/p> <p>  This year promised so much for Kerry Airport, as we celebrated 50 years of providing air transport in the county and region.  Several upgrades to our passenger facilities, along with the announcement of our new route to Manchester, promised so much, including a passenger increase of 10% on the 370,000 passengers handled in 2019.  Rebranding and new marketing plans, along with the success of the Wild Atlantic Way tourism initiative, promised another successful year not only for us but also our colleagues in Ireland West and Donegal airports.  Unfortunately, the situation now is way beyond what could have been envisaged less than one year ago.  The impact of Covid-19 will see passenger numbers fall by approximately 90% compared with those of 2019 across all the airports.  The symptoms of that critical decline are felt in so many ways and across so many industries, including tourism, which accounts for 25% of all employment in the county.<\/p> <p>  We have accepted that sacrifices in travel are necessary to protect the greater good.  However, it is a battle every day to find a balance between the commercial instinct to drive up passenger numbers by whatever means and the need to protect our vulnerable population, front-line staff and finite healthcare facilities.  That is especially the case now as we must again endure the pressures of the winter's inevitable inpatient bed crisis in the middle of a second surge of SARS-CoV-2.<\/p> <p>  The announcement of the adoption of the European traffic light system is very welcome and is seen by us in Kerry as a safe and manageable method to begin to reopen and recover overseas air travel.  Decisions by several European countries and our neighbours in England to follow our lead and introduce level 5 or similar restrictions will see a drop to below 50 positive cases per 100,000 of population and positivity rates that are lower than 4%, which will open up many corridors of free and safer travel in the very near future.<\/p> <p>  Like the rest of the world, we pray that recent announcements in vaccine development will at some stage next year begin the real healing that is so desperately sought by us all.  Kerry Airport is investigating the option of ensuring access for passengers to PCR Covid testing through a local private healthcare facility at a cost that would be considered reasonable.  We respect the science that suggests other methods of testing outside of PCR, including loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP, and rapid antigen, do not at present provide the amount of efficacy that is required.  We believe that off-site PCR testing one to two days prior to travel represents the best way forward for restrictions relating to orange, red or grey territories.<\/p> <p>  We again thank the committee for this opportunity to share our position and experiences of the effects of Covid-19.  We would be very happy to answer any questions or develop further any points that were made in this statement.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoiste ar&iacute;s.

I will provide a very short summary, as the other airports have done.  I will also give a brief background on Ireland West Airport.  I know many members are familiar with the airport and I will give it some context in the aviation landscape of the island.  I will in addition give an update on the current situation and I will also outline how we see the situation going forward.<\/p> <p>  Ireland West Airport opened in May 1986 and was managed originally by the Connaught Airport Development Company, which was effectively a private company with 36 shareholders led by Monsignor Horan at the time.  The State invested approximately &pound;10 million in the airport and the monsignor and his team raised approximately &pound;5 million to complete the airport.  In 1991 the Government withdrew its nominees to the board of the original airport and a public trust was established by deed of trust in the same year.  It was constituted as the Horan Airport Trust, so we are a community trust.  The trust was signed at the time by then Minister for Transport, the late S&eacute;amus Brennan, a Galway man, with the objectives of developing the airport on a commercial basis for the people of the west and north west, expanding air services to international markets and supporting employment, tourism and business growth in the region.<\/p> <p>  Any dividends or profits that the airport makes must be reinvested in the airport and the trustees and board of directors of the airport provide their services on a fully voluntary basis.  Therefore, there are no private shareholders and the rights attached to the trust shares are to invest in, encourage and facilitate investment in the future of the airport to fulfil the objectives of the airport.  I wanted to set that out because at times some degree of clarification is needed in terms of the ownership structure of the airport.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to advise that in 2017, as a further vote of confidence in the airport, seven local authorities across the region invested in the airport and took a 17.5% shareholding with the objective of further driving economic development and with a key focus on inbound tourism, business and economic development, leading to strong growth in inbound visitors and the designation of the airport last year as a strategic development zone, the only airport in Ireland with that zoning.  We are unique in many ways compared to other airports, in particular due to our ownership structure and the equity shareholding taken by the seven local authorities.<\/p><p>It has given us a unique regional investment in partnership in the facility between the people of the region and the Government.  It has also been a very positive endorsement by local government in the airport and it has helped us to drive forward in the past three to four years in positive collaboration and co-operation, in particular in trying to harness the very large diaspora from the west and the north west, which the airport caters for internationally.<\/p><p> As I outlined, the airport was designated last year as a strategic development zone and was also recognised as one of the four main airports in the country with a commitment from Government, in the Project Ireland 2040 plan and the national development plan, for increased investment and prioritising the airport as a critical driver of economic and tourism development for the west and the north west.<\/p><p> The airport serves one quarter of the country's landmass from a regional development perspective with jet runway capabilities and with a population catchment of 1.2 million across the west, the north west and the midlands.  We have the third largest runway in the country, of which we are very proud.  It was put in place 35 years ago by visionaries who drove the development of the airport and we have the capability to handle all types of aircraft.  In 2013, we were pleased to welcome wide-bodied 767s for the G8 Summit, Air Force Two, with Vice President Joe Biden in 2016 and, most recently, we welcomed Pope Francis in 2018 as part of his visit to Ireland.<\/p><p> We have experienced significant passenger growth since 2010 and last year was our record year with more than 800,000 passengers.  As a non-State owned airport, we operate under a fully commercial remit.  While we do receive funding, as the other regional airports do, under the regional airports programme, until this year we have managed to self-finance more than 90% of our operating costs from commercial and aeronautical revenues that we receive from passengers using the airport.<\/p><p> We are a key gateway, as the other airports are, in delivering 12 million visitors to the region so far since we opened.  With an estimated annual tourism spend of more than &euro;200 million we are contributing &euro;112 million of gross value added, GVA, to the local economy and we support 3,000 jobs locally.<\/p><p> Coming to 2020, like the other airports we were looking forward to a very successful year.  We were driving hard to achieve 1 million passengers and looking at a very strong performance in route network.  However, on 5 March, unfortunately, one of our main airline partners, Flybe, which services Birmingham, Edinburgh and Manchester, went into insolvency as a result of Covid-19.  That was the first blow and it was a loss of more than 100,000 passengers.  When Covid-19 hit at the end of March, the airport was forced to close its doors for the first time in 35 years and lay off all its staff for a three-month period.  That was as a direct result of our remaining airline partners, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, withdrawing their services.  We resumed flights, as the other airports did, from 1 July with Ryanair and Lauda operating at 50% of their frequency.  However, as we all know at this stage, it was a false dawn for air travel.  Passenger load factors were extremely low at below 30% and passenger numbers have collapsed by more than 90% since then as a result of the pandemic and the severe stringent travel restrictions that had to be imposed.<\/p><p> In late October, Ryanair confirmed an 80% reduction in our winter schedule and, as of last week, a complete suspension of flights into the airport for the coming four-week period, as has happened in the other airports.  As a result, we restructured the business over the summer period and, unfortunately, we have had to reduce our workforce by up to 70%.  To date, we have had 43 redundancies and 100 staff placed on temporary lay-offs.  The remaining staff are keeping the airport operational on a three-day week.  It has been an extremely difficult period for the airport, as for all the other airports, in trying to manage what has been six different periods of restructuring.<\/p><p> We appreciate and acknowledge the support received from the Government through the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, TWSS and the rates relief received from the local authorities.  Despite that, however, we are sustaining very significant losses as we have no commercial revenues or passenger flow through the airport.  We are looking at losses of close to &euro;4 million and a reduction in our turnover by &euro;11 million, which is catastrophic from a business perspective.  It goes without saying that the region is deeply concerned in the medium term that vital air services would be lost to regional Ireland, which could be lost for a very long time given the current market conditions and travel restrictions in place.  Industry experts are forecasting that it could be 2024 before there is a recovery to air travel.<\/p><p> In terms of what we are looking at and what we have been in discussion with the Government on, the media reports on which would provide more details, yesterday's announcement, to a degree, supersedes a number of our requests.  I was a member of the aviation recovery task force, the Government-appointed task force, in June and July, which produced the report outlining key recommendations.  That task force report was very clear on the specific requests.  From our perspective, we were calling on the Government to provide additional support to help us bridge the gap in the significant losses.  In a normal year the current regional airports programme is very sufficient in supporting us as an airport to achieve a break-even situation.  However, as a result of the dramatic collapse in traffic, we were seeking additional funding support for this year, which was an exceptional year, to a level that would cover the airport's net loss position of close to &euro;4 million, given that unlike in previous years, the capability of non-core airport activities, that is, commercial, car parking, retail, catering and car hire, would typically provide income to the airport that we could cover the shortfall.  We were seeking the implementation of the aviation recovery task force report and incentivisation to restore critical air travel into the region.  I recognise that the measures taken yesterday in the support package for the aviation sector that were announced will start to address that for the initial three-month period from January to March next year, with the charges rebate scheme being proposed for airlines.<\/p><p> On the adaption of the European Commission's traffic light system, we are pleased to see that moving forward.  We are seeking that the Government would continue to work with the airports and ourselves in mapping out a common system of pre-departure testing at all Irish airports in advance of the Christmas travel period.  Like all the regional airports, in the month of December we usually have more than 50,000 people who would use the airport.  Most of those usually travel from nine destinations we serve in the UK market.  Many of those are looking to book and are wondering if they can return home for Christmas.  We are pleased with the clarifications that are starting to flow from the Government in terms of travel from green, orange and red listed countries.<\/p><p> In terms of testing, like the other airports we are evaluating private operators to provide on-site testing here.  We will expect to have that in place when we restart operations in mid-December.<\/p><p> On the travel side, from a west of Ireland perspective, we are much more dependent on the UK market.  I refer to a mechanism whereby the Government could prioritise the opening up of an air corridor with the UK, with limited or zero travel restrictions for the regions with similar disease levels, as regional airports rely to a much larger degree than, say, Dublin on this market.  This would also be critical in supporting the survival of thousands of jobs in the small and medium businesses and the tourism and hospitality sectors through this pandemic and the imminent challenges we face as we go forward with Brexit.  Would it be feasible for the Government to look at that as a separate sub-committee to see how we could open a corridor from regions of the UK to regional Ireland?  I ask because there have been times in the past two to three months - do not take this the wrong way - when the view was that it would have been safer to travel to, say, the London market than across the country to Dublin, purely from a pandemic perspective, but that people travelling from regional London were - and are - being requested to quarantine for two weeks.  That is just to highlight the point that our dependency on the UK market is well over three quarters of our business and if that market could be opened up and expedited, it would be of great benefit.<\/p><p> I thank the members for their time and I look forward to taking their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020111100002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Gilmore","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gilmore.

I also thank the Chairman for the invitation he extended to the regional airports.  They are central to balanced regional development and should be a core element of Government policy in the aviation sector.  As a Deputy representing the people of the Mayo constituency, I know that Ireland West Airport Knock is a place of which we are very proud.  It is different from many other airports.  It has seven local authority stakeholders and operates in trust for the people of Connacht as an independent operator.  People in the west hold Knock Airport in the highest regard.  It is seen as the beating heart of the Wild Atlantic Way.  I congratulate the board of the airport on its continued work.  We have seen record passenger numbers over recent years, including well over 800,000 last year.  I hope we will hit the 1 million passenger mark in the future.<\/p> <p>  Recent months have shown how important it is to rebuild lost air connectivity.  Knock Airport is in the same situation as the other regional airports.  It will be vital in rebuilding our economy post Covid.  It is important that the recommendations of the aviation task force recognise the importance of our regional airports in delivering balanced regional development.  Ireland West Airport Knock has a significant economic impact on the north-west region.  Ernst &amp;amp; Young produced a report in 2019 which suggested that tourism spending by passengers of the airport equated to &euro;217 million while the airport supports more than 3,000 jobs.  It is, therefore, crucially important.  <\/p> <p>  While we have seen yesterday's announcement of &euro;6 million in funding towards the airports' operational costs and the additional airport charge rebate scheme, it is crucially important that the Minister clarify why this process requires the approval of the European Commission.  At this time, the Department and the State should be writing cheques to support our regional airports.  We see that &euro;32 million was allocated to the State-owned airports without any EU approval.  The Department needs to put a derogation in place to provide funding during the period of Covid restrictions.  If there is a possible state aid issue, let us address it through the normal channels at a later date, but we need to ensure this funding trickles down to the regional airports, the coalface at which it is needed, and we need to avoid any potential roadblocks that may present themselves.<\/p> <p>  I have three questions for the CEO of Ireland West Airport Knock on the airport's strategic marketing plan in the short to medium term.

Given that state aid rules do not seem to apply to the state-owned airports, why do they apply to regional airports?  Do the witnesses have any information in that regard?<\/p> <p>  Has there been much engagement with the regional airports in respect of how the traffic light system is going to work?  I ask Mr. Gilmore about that in particular, although I know Donegal Airport also has a particular dependence on the UK market.  Mr. Gilmore's point about region-to-region transport is important.  Regional air corridors may be a matter to include in the final report.  When does Mr. Gilmore see these coming into effect or operation?  When will he be able to inform passengers as to what they will be able to do over the forthcoming Christmas period.<\/p> <p>  On the regional airport programme, aviation will be very difficult and very different post Covid.  Do the witnesses believe the regional airport programme as it currently stands is fit for purpose in a post-Covid environment?  Do we need to inject more flexibility into it and make it a bit more responsive to the current changeable situation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020111100002#F00400","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":1039,"content":"<p>These questions really apply to all the airports so we might start with Mr. &Oacute; C&uacute;l&aacute;in from Donegal Airport before moving on to Mr. Mulhern from Kerry Airport and then Mr. Gilmore.

It requires a day or two, and up to three, to get a result from most private providers of that type of testing.  We believe that PCR testing should be done off-site, rather than at the airports, by those intending to travel.

On the point the Deputy highlighted, the &euro;10 million of funding provided in budget 2021 and the additional &euro;22 million provided to the State airports at Shannon and Cork do not appear to be subject to Commission approval.

We note that in the case, in particular, of the red zone, a person does not have to self-isolate if he or she gets a negative PCR test five days after arriving into Ireland, which is a positive development.  For passengers who are thinking of travelling, we will be updating our website with the most recent Government information, which is where we are take our direction from.<\/p><p> On the current regional airports programme, in the context of all the challenges that the aviation sector is facing, there is discussion of a new national aviation policy being revised from the previous policy in 2015 and encompassing the landscape now and the future we all face.  Is the current programme fit for purpose?  I think it has been, and it has been an excellent programme for the past five years.  Going forward, there are areas where it can be enhanced and worked on to adapt to the new environment we are all facing.<\/p><p> In particular on the restoration of air access, the number of air carriers is reducing and it is getting much more difficult to find carriers that will effectively take the risk of flying into regional airports, because it is a much higher risk for airlines than flying into capital cities around Europe.  The area of subvention to air carriers to put on new services to the regions is a whole area that needs further discussion and exploration because we are finding it extremely difficult to find new carriers in ordinary times.

My questions are more specific to Kerry Airport but they may be of general interest.  I am old enough to remember when Farranfore airstrip was a little playground for amateur aviators.  Who would have thought it would become the success story it is today and how important a part of the great infrastructure of Kerry and Munster it would become?  I note that prior to Covid, in the past year, it was showing an increase in passenger numbers of 1.2% so the systems were all heading in the right direction.  The Government's injection of capital into all three airports, especially the smaller regional airports, shows the confidence it has in their capacity to survive and to continue to develop, hopefully, when this terrible crisis is over.<\/p> <p>  My questions are general to all three airports.  Sooner or later, hopefully, Covid will be over.  Apart from depending on Government grants to restore normality, do the airports have contingency post-Covid plans in place to hit the ground running, restore flights, increase capacity and maybe create further jobs?<\/p> <p>  Kerry Airport should be commended for sourcing new routes such as Frankfurt, Alicante and Faro.  Will it be possible to continue on that line in future?  Are we too reliant on one or two airlines? Do they have a type of monopoly on the airport?  Is that a problem?  Is there any way that additional airlines could be persuaded?  I noted with interest Mr. Gilmore's observation that it is a higher risk for airlines to fly into smaller airports than those in London and so on.  I take that on board.  Hopefully there might be something there.<\/p> <p>  I have a point which is very specific to Kerry Airport.  I commend its directors.  It is a private company but the board of directors is very embracing of business, tourism and local authority interests.  I am glad that a local authority elected member is on the board.  The space is a sign of the difficulty which success brings.  Does Mr. Mulhern have any plans to increase the airport concourse?  It can be very crowded at busy times with departures and arrivals all up on top of each other.  Are there plans to develop it and extend?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020111100002#H01200","speaker":"1694"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":1073,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  I will take each in its own right.  We have a large marketing plan and a plan for route development which we had in place and ready to push before the Covid-19 outbreak.  We were in discussions with some of the smaller airlines to develop connections between our own regions and particularly regions of the UK and also into France and Italy.  Covid-19 has put all that on hold.  The discussions are still there in the background.  Not unlike Mr. Gilmore in Ireland West, we want to see how we can connect our region to smaller regions across the UK, particularly in England and Scotland.  We have very strong conversations that looked fruitful on how we could mutually support the establishment of connections with smaller aircraft of less than 100 passengers that would support us for survival into the future with better connections to smaller population centres around the UK.<\/p> <p>  Not unlike the other airports, the vast majority of our passengers are with Ryanair.  Its suspension of all routes in the regional airports has caused significant harm to our operations and profitability.  Like other airports, our income is based on passenger numbers.  Our franchises with car hire companies, restaurants and caf&eacute;s, etc. are all dependent on a high turnover of passengers.  We have no income from those while we have few if any passengers.  We are keen to spread our reliance beyond just one airline.  Looking north, Mr. Gilmore and his airport were very successful at that but suffered great harm which we fully understand when Flybe failed recently.<\/p><p>Still, to rely on one airline is difficult for us and we certainly are looking to spread to other airlines if that is possible.  However, the smaller airlines are fearful of taking risks and so I agree with Mr. Gilmore that we would be grateful for any support to encourage those smaller airlines to develop routes from regions in the UK and further afield into the regions of Ireland.<\/p><p> Our own airport supports well over a thousand jobs in the county and brings in tens of millions of euro in income from our passengers in tourism and in business.  We are very pleased that the airport has begun to encourage remote working for businesses that are wishing to set up in rural Ireland, whilst keeping a connection for the occasions when they need to travel to Dublin and onwards for their own business.  We really need that to continue and to recover.<\/p><p> We had a plan that we had presented to the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Ross, not long ago, of which our colleague and friend Deputy Griffin is aware, which involved a &euro;7 million expansion of the airport to allow us to be able to cater for larger aircraft and volumes of passengers.  The Senator is right that the airport is small and the accommodation there allows for only 200 to 300 passengers at a time, when there are times when we would like to manage multiples of that.  We have a plan, and it is with the Department and the Minister.  I recently spoke about it to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and she could see that it was an important step forward for us if we are to be able to grow sustainably into the future.  I therefore agree with the Senator.  Once we get through this period of turmoil, we still plan to continue with that blue sky development plan into the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020111100002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Mulhern","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":1075,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach.

Everyone knows that Kerry Airport provides important business links, but also it is an important social link for immigrant communities, particularly in the greater London area, Birmingham, Manchester and Coventry.  I would like to congratulate Mr. Mulhern on the work that he has done in the airport recently in respect of the rebranding, the retail section and the bar, and the investment that has been put into the new hold baggage X-ray system.  Hopefully it will allow journeys through Kerry Airport to be better journeys.  I also congratulate him on keeping the employees there for so long, that nobody was laid off up to recently and that 57 direct jobs and hundreds of others in the community have been supported.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  In the annual report, it is stated that in the second quarter, passenger numbers were down from 102,808.  What has the comparison been in the third quarter?  On the issue of the new funding that was announced yesterday, how long is that funding going to sustain the airport?  I know that the airport received a &euro;1.9 million capital grant in 2019.  How long will this funding keep the airport going?  Has the airport had any talks with the HSE or the private provider?  As regards the public service obligation, PSO, routes project, is the airport happy enough with how it is going?  The Dublin link allows many of the big-spending American tourists into the county.  I ask Mr. Mulhern to provide the committee with an update on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020111100002#J00200","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The support of the Deputy and that of his party for the airport is very much appreciated.  He has spoken to me on a number of occasions, has visited us and supported us through this difficult time, which is appreciated.<\/p> <p>  We are in very difficult times and we do welcome the funding and supports that were announced yesterday for the regional airports, not just ourselves, but also to our friends in Donegal and Ireland West.  It is difficult to estimate yet how the funding will sustain us, because we are not sure how Ryanair will make decisions on connections with returning routes from suspension over the winter.  What we know so far is that potentially there will only be four flights per week with Ryanair: two to Stansted Airport and two to Luton Airport.  Those alone will not sustain us through the winter.  As the Deputy said, we fought bravely to keep all of our employees at work, despite reducing salaries by around 15%.  We were lucky enough to have an entire fleet of aircraft from one of the airlines parked at the airport, which brought in a significant amount of income and kept most of our employees at work, without the need to use the employment wage support scheme.  However, the cancellation and suspension of all Ryanair flights, without that income that we had from aircraft parking, has put us in a position where we have no choice but to lay off approximately 50% of our staff for a number of weeks.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the PSO route project, it is essential to our survival.  It ran throughout the lockdown and it made it possible for many people in Kerry to make journeys to Dublin that were essential, including people I know myself who were undergoing cancer treatment in Dublin.  We were very grateful for that.<\/p> <p>  As regards figures for the third quarter, numbers of passengers picked up significantly in comparison to the second quarter, but they were nothing like they would normally be in that period.  We were handling around 1,200 to 1,400 passengers per week in quarter three, when we would normally handle many multiples of that.  Presently, our passenger numbers are down around 90% year-on-year.  That gives the committee an idea of the impact of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  We also have significant traffic between the airport and the United States.  We have great connections with some of the large golf courses and tourist centres in the south-west, and it drives a large proportion of our commercial activity.  Of course, all of that was lost to Covid.  We hope that the vaccine and the new travel corridors will bring back that traffic in 2021.  It is a major part of our income and it is a major employer for many parts of Kerry, so it must return.  We hope that corridor to the United States will reopen, especially with the good news of the election of President-elect Biden who is a friend of Ireland and the west of Ireland, and we hope that news will help bring about a recovery in our connections to the United States.  Those American tourists are very important to us.  On average, they spend multiple amounts in comparison to some other tourists in the local economies and sustain employment and livelihoods for so many.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for his questions and his support.  Like the other airports, we would welcome any supports from Government to help us achieve smaller airline connections to regions, particularly into 2021, when they will be more important than ever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020111100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Mulhern"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  I welcome the witnesses to the committee.  I was closely monitoring proceedings from my office for social distancing purposes, but I am glad to be here now in the room.  First, I thank all the witnesses for the contribution that they make to Irish tourism.  From my time in the Department I became very familiar with the work that all the witnesses do in their respective airports.<\/p><p>The importance of the airports to their regions cannot be overstated.  I thank the witnesses for the jobs that they provide directly and for the thousands of jobs that they facilitate through providing those vital access points to their regions.<\/p><p> I concur with previous speakers in welcoming the funding announced yesterday.  It is vital that the funding goes to the front line as quickly as possible.  I hope, like any of the other Government schemes that have been announced since the start of Covid, that it will be user-friendly, accessible and gets to the people who need it as quickly as possible.  I hope that it will sustain us through this period until we get to a point where we can return to some form of normality.  At the start of 2020, it was promising to be a good year, but, unfortunately, we all know what happened.  The challenge is to get back to that position.<\/p><p> It will be crucial for regional airports when the clock starts again to have co-operative marketing funding to give airports the opportunity to provide sustainable routes.  The larger airports are the safer option, as was said.  We often hear criticism of Government that all the routes are going in and out of Dublin.  The Government and airports can only do so much.  If airlines demand to go to one specific airport, there is little that others can do.  The regional co-operative marketing fund that was in place was helpful.  The combined work of Tourism Ireland, the airports and the airlines provided great progress.  We all need to work harder on that to ensure that there is extra funding to help airports when things get back to normal.<\/p><p> I welcome Mr. John Mulhern and Mr. Basil Sheerin from Kerry Airport and thank them for the work that they do, not just for County Kerry but for the south-west region.  Kerry Airport is one of the outstanding Kerry stories, up there with Kerry football and such.  It is a great story with many chapters left.  This is unfortunately a dark chapter but we will come through it.  I thank the witnesses for the work they are doing.  I know there were exciting things planned for 2020.  The new Manchester route was going to be a really exciting northern UK route but unfortunately that did not happen.  I think I speak for all the Oireachtas Members from the county when I say the witnesses have our full support and their work is important to everyone in Kerry.  We will all continue to work with the witnesses on the behalf of the people of Kerry.<\/p><p> Regarding the Kerry-Dublin public service obligation, what do the witnesses see as being a realistic timeline for when we can get back to decent occupancy on that route?  Looking at connecting the regions, do they feel it would be a viable proposition and have they done research to support the proposition?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020111100002#J00400","speaker":"1581","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his support.  We are looking closely at the public service obligation numbers.  The numbers travelling between Dublin and Kerry are low.  They recovered in quarter 3 when everybody was encouraged to staycation.  Many people travelled between Dublin and Kerry for holidays and numbers improved significantly.  They have fallen off a little now since we moved to level 5.  However, we believe that once level 5 is successful, and we are certain it will be, that those numbers will recover.  It will be in late quarter 1 or quarter 2 of 2021 before we see significant growth in the public service obligation numbers to the levels that we enjoyed before Covid.<\/p> <p>  I have had some interest from an airline in connecting the regions.  The reasoning is similar to that of the new transport system in Dublin where a system of buses connects the city on the outside, with some on spokes of the wheel to bring traffic in.  That airline was looking at how it could connect Kerry to Donegal while shuttling through Shannon and Ireland West Airport Knock to build a new structure to connect the west coast of Ireland by air, especially in the summer season to encourage holidaymakers to travel up and down the west coast of Ireland.  Those who are keen to go towards something like that will look for support as a new option for a public service obligation that would support Kerry, Shannon, Ireland West and Donegal with new planes and smaller planes moving through the regions.  If it was something that anyone in government felt was a possibility, even for a summer or two as we recover over the next three or four years, I am certain that the other regional airports would get on board to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020111100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Mulhern"},{"type":"speech","time":1605052800,"counter":1080,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mulhern.

It is one of the big issues that has arisen for me in recent months.  Even this morning, I received a text message saying that we cannot let anything happen to our airport.  There is a strong sense of ownership by the people of Mayo.  The Chairman will be aware that seven local authorities in the west came together to put almost &euro;8 million into the airport.  I was a member of Mayo County Council when this happened.  It was an unprecedented deal.  It shows how much importance the region attaches to this airport, with 100 people employed directly, 3,000 indirect jobs and the impact it has on the hospitality and tourism sectors.  It is our connection to the world.  Monsignor Horan was told at the outset that he was completely mad to envisage an airport in the foggy, boggy hills of Mayo.  He managed to pull it off, in no small part because the people of Mayo supported him.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Gilmore met the Taoiseach recently to discuss this issue.  I am sure that, along with Donegal and Kerry, he is very welcoming of the additional funding of &euro;28 million that was announced.  Regarding the airport's current situation, while I am biased, it is probably the most efficiently run airport in the country.  I know from travelling through the airport on many occasions that everybody does more than one job.  That is how efficiently the airport is run.  I know aggressive cost-cutting measures have been employed, with the support of staff, to make sure that the airport can survive and it is doing its part.  Local people have no problem with paying the development fee of &euro;10 when they depart the airport.  They are quite happy to support the airport by paying that fee to make sure that the airport can stay there.  On top of the money that was received yesterday and previous supports, does Mr. Gilmore think the airport is okay for the coming months, or what additional supports does he think might be required in the next six to 12 months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020111100002#K00600","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605052800,"counter":1084,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her positive comments on the airport, which are appreciated.

We are hopeful and getting more confident as the weeks progress and we get through this pandemic.  With the support of the Government, regional stakeholders, local authority partners and chambers, we are confident that we can get back to a better position.<\/p><p>It is a question of timing and of how quickly the markets open.  There has been much discussion about that.  Like the other airports, we are in discussion with a number of airlines.  Aer Lingus and Ryanair are our two main partners.  Unfortunately, we lost Flybe through insolvency, but we are confident we can replace its services and, hopefully, continue to grow and push towards 1 million passengers in the not too distant future.<\/p><p> From a financial perspective, the announcement yesterday will serve to protect our cash and balance sheet positions.

The PCR test that has been proposed, especially concerning people travelling from orange and red countries, should not make travel prohibitive.  Mr. Mulhern stated that the cost in Kerry would be approximately &euro;80 per person, but Mr. Gilmore stated that the quote Knock had received was for &euro;149.50 per person.  There appears to be a disparity, so work needs to be done in that regard.  All of the airports and the Department of Transport must work together to find a mechanism through which we can get the cost of the test down to a rate that is affordable for people.  I call on the Government to examine this issue.  We cannot have a situation where travelling home for Christmas is prohibitive for people who are on low incomes.
