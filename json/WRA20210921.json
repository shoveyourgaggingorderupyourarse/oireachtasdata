In relation to borrowing, I am aware of the ESRI analysis but, equally, I am aware of other pieces of analysis - including most recently from the <i>Irish Fiscal Advisory Council<\/i>- that highlight the risks associated with more-and-more borrowing.  <\/p><p>In formulating policy, therefore, Government must take all of the advice on board, including that of the civil service.  Government also takes into account the fiscal context in its decision-making.  This fiscal context is one in which our budget deficit last year was close to &euro;19 billion &ndash; the equivalent of 9 per cent of modified national income, with a broadly similar figure anticipated for this year.  Our public debt is approaching a quarter of a trillion euros, one of the highest in the developed world.  Figures of this magnitude cannot simply be ignored.<\/p><p>But even allowing for this fiscal context, the Government has made substantial commitments to improving housing supply. The recently launched <i>Housing for All <\/i>strategy commits to increase housing supply and affordability by targeting the delivery of, on average, 33,000 new homes every year to 2030. This includes the provision of over 10,000 social homes per year and an average of 6,000 affordable homes to purchase or rent. <\/p><p>From a fiscal perspective, this strategy is supported by significant investment of over &euro;4 billion in State funding every year to 2030 - this is the highest level of funding ever for house building.<\/p><p>So, from an overall perspective, Government is achieving the right balance in its approach: gradually reducing borrowing for day-to-day expenditure, while expanding capital spending, including in housing, to address supply bottlenecks.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100062#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":21,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100062#WRB01000"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[44868\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100062#WRB01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of corporate taxation receipts to date in 2021.","asker":"1597","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":23,"content":"<p>The Exchequer has benefited from better-than-expected corporation tax receipts this year.

In Ireland, the annual rate of HICP inflation rose to 3 per cent in August &ndash; the highest rate since 2008; similar trends have been observed across other advanced economies.<\/p><p>The increase in inflation since the beginning of this year is largely explained by temporary factors, which are expected to fade over time, including &lsquo;base effects&rsquo; associated with the normalisation of oil prices following their collapse last spring. More fundamentally, the easing of restrictions led to a rapid rebound in consumer spending, in particular spending on goods, in the second quarter. As the economy continues to re-open, demand will pivot towards contact-intensive service sectors.  <\/p><p>Supply by contrast has recovered more slowly than the recovery in demand with, for instance, labour shortages in some service sectors putting upward pressure on prices. Indeed, signs of &lsquo;opening up&rsquo; inflation are already evident, with strong increases in prices in the transport and hospitality sectors recorded in the July and August inflation data from the <i>Central Statistics Office<\/i>. Shipping bottlenecks and shortages of inputs (e.g. semi-conductors, timber) have also raised production costs, putting further upward pressure on prices. Higher trade costs as a result of Brexit may also have contributed to the recent rise in inflation.<\/p><p>The emergence of inflationary pressures has prompted a debate regarding the likely persistence of these price dynamics.  Persistently higher inflation could trigger monetary policy changes by the ECB, with implications for the cost of Government borrowing. <\/p><p>In summary, the most likely scenario is that the current pick-up in inflation - in Ireland and elsewhere - is temporary, and will moderate as one-off factors fade and as demand stabilises and supply pressures ease.  That said, the possibility of a more sustained and persistent rise in inflation cannot be ruled out.  This is another reason why budgetary policy must evolve in line with the improving epidemiological situation; Government adopted a counter-cyclical approach to budgetary policy during the downturn and we will do so in the recovery phase also. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100062#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treasury Management Agency","counter":27,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100062#WRB01600"},{"type":"question","counter":28,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[44870\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100062#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will report on the amount of interest paid on the national debt; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1522","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":29,"content":"<p>The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has informed me, that the net Exchequer cash interest paid in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s National Debt in 2020 was just over &euro;4.5bn. <\/p><p>This was a reduction of over &euro;0.5bn, or more than 10% on the 2019 figure and some 40% below the 2014 peak. <\/p><p>In the first eight months of 2021, National Debt interest totalled just over &euro;3.2bn, more than &euro;0.5bn or close to 14% below the corresponding period last year. <\/p><p>National Debt interest for the full year 2021 was estimated at just over &euro;3.7 billion in the April <i>Stability Programme Update (SPU), <\/i>the lowest it has been since 2010.

The whole-of-Government approach being taken through the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform<\/i>therefore sets out 66 actions which aim to improve both the cost and availability of this key financial service, particularly for businesses. As the Deputy may be aware, the Cabinet Committee Insurance Reform Sub-Group earlier this month published the first six-monthly Implementation Report of the <i>Action Plan<\/i>. This shows that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 34 of the 66 actions now completed. The Sub-Group&rsquo;s focus now is on implementing the outstanding actions on time.<\/p><p>One of the key achievements in the first half of this year under the <i>Action Plan<\/i>was the implementation of the <i>Personal Injuries Guidelines<\/i>, which represents a key achievement of this insurance reform agenda, and was realised several months ahead of schedule. These significantly reduce award levels for many categories of common injuries, particularly those of soft tissue.  Of note is that a number of common injuries will now move to the jurisdiction of the District rather than the Circuit Court, thus reducing associated legal fees. The Guidelines also provide guidance in relation to injuries previously not included in the Book of Quantum and will be used by both the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) and the judiciary. Therefore, they should help to bring more certainty to claimants and insurers, and as such reinforce the benefits of using the PIAB to settle claims. This in turn should further reduce the costs of claims, particularly legal fees. I have previously set out my view that these costs, rather than the profit component, tend to represent a bigger factor in the cost of insurance premiums. As such, it is important that they are lowered.  <\/p><p>As Minister for Finance, my expectation is that insurers will now commence reflecting savings from reduced award levels to customers, in line with past commitments, and both I and Minister of State Fleming are holding them to account on this.  In that regard, Minister of State Fleming met with the CEOs of the main insurers operating in Ireland to set out the Government&rsquo;s expectation in this regard. These engagements were positive, with insurers indicating that they will begin lowering premiums in response to the Guidelines. The Minister of State will meet with CEOs again later this year to review their ongoing response to this and other key reforms.<\/p><p>Another significant achievement of the reform agenda is the establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market within the Department of Finance. The role of the Office, which is chaired by Minister of State Fleming, is twofold: to assist in reducing insurance costs and to increase the availability of cover, by promoting competition in the Irish insurance market. The Office has held a number of meetings with several key stakeholders, including insurance providers, representative bodies and other civic society groups, to understand gaps in the Irish insurance market. Its aim is to expand the risk appetite of existing insurers and explore opportunities for new market entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance, including specialised cover such as professional indemnity insurance.<\/p><p>Accordingly, the Department is also working closely with IDA Ireland to bring new entrants into the Irish insurance market and to improve its overall competitiveness. Officials from both are developing a customised proposition for potential market entrants and are identifying target providers who offer insurance in areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; in the Irish market.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that work remains ongoing across Government to deliver further elements of the Action Plan, including measures to reform the PIAB, reduce fraud, and make changes to the duty of care in order to strengthen waivers and notices. It is my hope that the implementation of these key actions in particular should have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100063#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2022","counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100063#WRC01000"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[44883\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100063#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider in the context of Budget 2022 introducing a refundable tax credit equivalent to 8.5% of annual rent at a cap &euro;1,500 for tenants in private rental accommodation in the context of a rental crisis that is damaging living standards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":66,"content":"<p>The previous tax relief in respect of rent paid was abolished in Budget 2011 and it is no longer available to those that commenced renting for the first time from 8 December 2010.

The view of the independent Commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation.

The effect of this concessional treatment allows individuals resident in the State and working for a non-resident employer carry out their employment duties in the State and continue to pay tax in another jurisdiction.  <\/p><p>I am aware that there have been calls to place this concessional treatment on a statutory footing so that individuals who are resident in the State, but work outside the State for a non-resident employer, can continue to avail of the relief if they exercise their duties of employment in the State. <\/p><p>During the debates on Finance Bill 2020, I undertook that this matter would be examined as part of the work of the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) for 2021. The resultant paper was discussed by the TSG as part of its deliberations on 8 September last.  The examination encompassed very detailed consideration of all relevant matters including the equity of treatment between Irish residents who pay tax in the State, the competitive position of Irish employers and the established principles of international tax.

My Department is currently updating its forecasts - these will underpin <i>Budget 2022<\/i>- and our assessment is that the economy is recovering strongly as the various public health restrictions are gradually relaxed.  This broad assessement of the economic backdrop is largely consistent with the views of the Council and Bank.<\/p><p>That said, I am conscious that conditions in the labour market are lagging somewhat - as is normally the case in most advanced economies - and that is why Government is keeping many of the fiscal supports in place for the next few months.  <\/p><p>In terms of the implications for budgetary policy, a number of key issues are outlined both by the Council and Bank. Firstly is the need to address structural fiscal challenges, while second is the issue of high public debt. <\/p><p>In relation to the former, the <i>Summer Economic Statement <\/i>set out a medium-term budgetary strategy that seeks to address this. Government is putting budgetary policy within a medium-term framework, a development that has been welcomed by the Fiscal Council.  This is being operationalised by way of an expenditure rule, through which public expenditure will be tied to the estimated trend growth rate of the economy.  Such an approach enhances fiscal sustainability while allowing investment in key government priorities, particularly capital investment. <\/p><p>I note, in particular, the Fiscal Council&rsquo;s view that the expenditure plans are at the limit of what is prudent.  I agree with this assessment, and that is why the Government introduced expenditure ceilings that will apply irrespective of revenue performance. <\/p><p>The second key point is that of public debt, and I share the assessment that this needs to be stabilised and then put on a downward path.

That broad approach is what has informed recent action in this area including the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 which, in turn, led to the work of the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group and the separate work of the Pensions Commission. Indeed, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare has also been charged with considering the output from the Pensions Commission regarding sustainability and eligibility issues in respect of State Pension arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the tax treatment of supplementary pensions, Ireland operates an Exempt, Exempt, Tax (EET) system, like the majority of OECD countries. This means that contributions to pensions are exempted from income tax (subject to age-related percentage and income limitations), pension fund gains are exempted from income tax but income from pension drawdown is taxed. <\/p>  <p>  The Inter-Departmental Pension Reform and Taxation Group (IDPRTG) recently reviewed the cost of funded supplementary pensions to the Exchequer. In its report published in November 2020, it noted that in common with most developed countries, fiscal support for private pension saving exists in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  It observed that in providing incentives, States are motivated by the policy objective of increasing aggregate savings or encouraging citizens to provide for their retirement, by deferring a sufficient amount of income and consumption today to provide for their later years. This is based on an assumption that individuals require an incentive to lock-up savings until they retire given that alternative saving vehicles allow on-going access. <\/p>  <p>  It also noted that the tax treatment of pensions represents one of the largest Exchequer tax expenditures. However, in common with other countries operating an EET system, the exact cost of this is difficult to quantify due to the general nature of tax expenditures and also specific pension-related challenges, such as limited data availability on some features of the pension regime in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100064#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[44884\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100064#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will refrain from further increases in the carbon tax in the context of Budget 2022 in view of significant energy price increases and its impact on the cost and standard of living on Irish households; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":97,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100064#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development","counter":98,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100064#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":99,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[44853\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100064#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the percentage of the research and development activity subsidised by the State through the research and development tax credit that is conducted outside of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":100,"content":"<p>The research and development (R&amp;D) tax credit allows a company to claim a 25% tax credit in respect of expenditure incurred on qualifying R&amp;D activities.

Similarly the European Central Bank (ECB) conduct an annual stress test, the results of which provide important input to other reviews such as the Supervisory Review and Evaluation (SREP) process.<\/p><p>On 30 July 2021, The EBA published the outcome for banks that participated in the 2021 EBA EU-wide stress test. Further, and for the first time, the ECB has also published high-level information on the outcome of the parallel Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) stress test of banks directly supervised by the ECB but which were not included in EBA EU wide stress test. The results for the Irish banks included in these assessments are available on the Central Bank's website.<\/p><p>The stress test is not a pass or fail exercise and no threshold is set to define the failure or success of banks for the purpose of the exercise. Instead, the findings of the stress test will inform the 2021 SREP for banks.<\/p><p>The EBA stress tests uses theoretical adverse economic scenarios to test the resilience of banks. Overall, the impact of the stress test is more severe than the results from the 2018 exercise, reflecting a more severe scenario used by the EBA. This severe scenario modelled the effect of a severe shock on these banks, to take into account the impact of the pandemic.  Nevertheless, even though uncertainties currently remain high, the benefits of resilience built up in the Irish banking sector in recent years is evident, with banks having sufficient capital to absorb the impact of the severe scenario.<\/p><p>Interest rates on new lending (mortgages, non-financial corporations and consumer) in Ireland are higher than in most other EU countries.<\/p><p>However, the trends show that interest rates in Ireland have been falling in recent years, providing benefit to consumers. Interest rates on new mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.73% in July 2021.  The weighted average interest rate on new fixed rate mortgage agreements stood at 2.62 per cent in July, down from a series high of 4.11 per cent in December 2014. <\/p><p>We have also seen reductions in interest rates on loans to SMEs from 5.19% to 3.89% over the period Quarter 1 2015 to Quarter 1 2021, as well as reductions in interest rates on consumer loans (for example, from 8.3% to 6.7% on Annual Percentage Rate (APRC) consumer loans from January 2015 to July 2021).<\/p><p>There are a number of explanations that likely explain the higher level of interest rates in Ireland relative to other countries. In particular Irish retail banks&rsquo; mortgage modelled Risk Weighted Assets are higher than the EU average. This results primarily from the relatively high historic credit risk experience in Ireland, the longer workout process on defaulted loans and uncertainty in relation to collateral realisation and the relatively elevated levels of Non-Performing Loans and restructured loans in Irish banks. These higher capital requirements increase the cost of lending for banks, but now leave them in a more resilient position, reducing the risk of systemic stress events. The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of a resilient banking sector that can withstand adverse shocks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100064#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Properties","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100064#WRD01600"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[44801\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100064#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the role his Department has undertaken with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to develop a vacant properties tax.","asker":"1453","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>The recently announced strategy, &lsquo;Housing For All&rsquo; states that my Department will collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a Vacant Property Tax.

Furthermore, I also note the CCPC&rsquo;s ongoing concerns regarding the culture within the Irish insurance industry.  <\/p><p>The outcome of the CCPC&rsquo;s investigation underlines the importance of insurance in general and the impact of its cost and availability on consumers, businesses and community groups.  The Government remains committed to reform of the sector, through the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform<\/i>. The first six-monthly Implementation Report of the Action Plan, published in July 2021 indicates that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 34 of the 66 actions now complete. <\/p><p>The upcoming Competition (Amendment) Bill is a priority this year for Government, as part of our overall Action Plan commitments to reform the insurance sector. This new law, to be published this autumn, will significantly strengthen the CCPC&rsquo;s powers, giving them the ability to administer significant fines for breaches of competition law. <\/p><p>Separately, one of the central achievements in the first half of this year under the Action Plan was the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines, which was realised several months ahead of schedule. These significantly reduce award levels for many categories of common injuries, particularly those of soft tissue.  <\/p><p>The Guidelines should help to bring more certainty to claimants and insurers, and as such reinforce the benefits of using the PIAB to settle claims. This in turn should further reduce the costs of claims. It is my expectation is that insurers should now be reflecting savings from reduced award levels to customers, in line with past commitments, in the form of reduced premiums across their product lines. <\/p><p>Minister for State Fleming has had number of positive engagements with the CEOs of the main insurers operating here on the matter, and they have indicated that they will respond positively to the Guidelines. He will meet with them again later this year to review their ongoing actions. <\/p><p>Another significant achievement of the reform agenda is the establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market within the Department of Finance. The Office has held a number of meetings with several key stakeholders, including insurance providers, representative bodies and other civic society groups, to understand gaps in the Irish insurance market. Its aim is to help expand the risk appetite of existing insurers and explore opportunities for new market entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. The Office will meet the CCPC to discuss their recent investigation.<\/p><p>I would also add that work remains ongoing across Government Departments to deliver further key aspects of the Action Plan over the coming months. Furthermore, Minister of State Fleming intends to shortly bring forward legislation to help increase transparency and provide enhanced protections for consumers. <\/p><p>In conclusion, securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my firm belief that implementation of the Action Plan will have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100064#WRD02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inflation Rate","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100064#WRD03000"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[44796\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100064#WRD03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the existence of even moderate inflation can affect Ireland&rsquo;s economy in the future; the extent to which the causes of same continue to be identified with a view to addressing the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>While Covid-19 had a deflationary impact both in Ireland and internationally last year, inflation has picked up since the beginning of this year. The annual rate of HICP inflation rose to 3 per cent in August &ndash; the highest rate since 2008. Similar trends have been observed across advanced economies, with inflation rates of 5.3, 3.2 and 3 per cent recorded in the US, UK and euro area in August.  <\/p>  <p>  However, the increase in inflation since the beginning of this year is largely explained by temporary factors, which are expected to fade over time, including the reversal of the temporary VAT cut and &lsquo;base effects&rsquo; associated with the normalisation of oil prices following their collapse last spring. More fundamentally, on the demand side the easing of restrictions led to a rapid rebound in consumer spending, in particular spending on goods, in the second quarter. As the economy continues to re-open, demand will pivot towards contact-intensive service sectors.  <\/p>  <p>  Supply by contrast has recovered more slowly, with labour shortages in service sectors putting upward pressure on prices. Indeed, signs of &lsquo;opening up&rsquo; inflation are already evident, with strong increases in prices in the transport and hospitality sectors recorded in July and August. Shipping bottlenecks and shortages of inputs (e.g. semi-conductors, timber) have also raised production costs, putting further upward pressure on prices. Higher trade costs as a result of Brexit may also have contributed to the recent rise in inflation.<\/p>  <p>  The emergence of inflationary pressures has prompted a debate regarding the likely persistence of these price dynamics as consistently higher inflation could trigger monetary policy changes by the ECB, with implications for the cost of Government borrowing. Looking beyond the short-term, however, it seems likely that these temporary factors will fade as demand stabilises and supply pressures ease. Consistent with this view, the ECB last week reiterated that the current inflationary pressures are largely temporary and inflation in the euro area is still expected to remain below 2 per cent over the medium term. Nevertheless, my Department will continue to closely monitor and analyse inflationary developments and will publish updated inflation and economic forecasts alongside the Budget in the autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100064#WRD03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":123,"content":"<p>Question No. 59 answered with Question No. 18.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100064#WRD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[44835\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100064#WRD03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the analysis his Department has carried out into the potential for the reduction of VAT rates for the music and entertainment sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":126,"content":"<p>In Budget 2021, I introduced a temporary reduced rate of VAT, 9%, to apply to tourism and hospitality related services from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021, which I have further extended to 31 August 2022.<\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the provision I introduced in 2020 does already apply the temporary 9% VAT rate to admission fees for cinemas, theatres and musical performances.

From the outset, I must state that it is not appropriate for the Minister for Finance to comment on the tax affairs of individual businesses.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue uses a range of resources to identify instances of tax avoidance, which would include tax avoidance arising from the arrangements described in the Agreement between the Competent Authorities of Ireland and Malta.<\/p><p>Those arrangements involved an exploitation of a mismatch of Irish and Maltese rules in relation to company residence and domicile, which could have led to income falling out of charge in Ireland and in Malta, resulting in double <i>non-taxation<\/i>of the income concerned. I cannot comment on the arrangements of any specific taxpayer. However, arrangements as described in the Christian Aid report are not arrangements that involve a mismatch of residence and domicile rules that would lead to double non-taxation, through amounts falling out of charge in both Ireland in Malta.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Ireland-Malta Competent Authority Agreement was to deter the arrangements described in the Agreement. The Christian Aid report appears to confirm that the Agreement was effective in achieving that purpose&mdash; and I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have not identified information that would suggest otherwise. As regards those arrangements or any other aggressive tax planning, I have repeatedly stated that I will not hesitate to propose legislation to address tax avoidance, where it may not be possible to address arrangements within the existing code. The Revenue Commissioners liaise with my Department on that basis, in relation to potential loopholes they identify.<\/p><p>The Revenue Commissioners cannot comment directly or indirectly on the arrangements of a specific taxpayer. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners &ndash; as a general statement and without their reference to, or implication in respect of, any specific case &ndash; that they do not provide confirmations or opinions to taxpayers on matters in respect of which they suspect there may be a tax avoidance purpose.<\/p><p>Revenue is strongly committed to identifying and challenging tax avoidance, including schemes that would seek to rely on Ireland&rsquo;s Double Taxation Agreements. Revenue has reviewed Ireland&rsquo;s Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) network in relation to the possibility of arrangements, similar to those addressed by the Ireland-Malta Competent Authority Agreement, being implemented using a different DTA. Specifically, Revenue has considered Ireland&rsquo;s DTA with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which has been cited in that regard. <\/p><p>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the absence of a generally-applicable corporate tax in the UAE, the UAE DTA contains provisions designed to prevent companies from qualifying as residents of the UAE for the purposes of the DTA. While Revenue will remain vigilant for indications of avoidance, they consider that DTA has been designed to prevent such possible use and that the risk of implementation of arrangements, similar to those addressed in the Competent Authority Agreement with Malta, is low in relation to the UAE DTA and other DTAs designed for restricted application. <\/p><p>For my part, I have repeatedly demonstrated that I am committed to taking action to ensure the Irish tax code is in line with new and emerging international tax standards as agreed globally.The January 2021 Update to Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap highlights the actions that have already been taken and will continue to be taken in this process of corporation tax reform.<\/p><p>In this vein, it is important to remember that in recent Finance Acts, the Oireachtas has;<\/p><p>- substantially progressed transposition of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives through the introduction of Controlled Foreign Company rules, and anti-hybrid rules;<\/p><p>- introduced defensive measures against listed jurisdictions through enhanced Controlled Foreign Company Rules;<\/p><p>- updated transfer pricing rules;<\/p><p>- introduced legislation for OECD BEPS measures on mandatory disclosure rules; and<\/p><p>- substantially widened the scope of the Exit Tax regime &mdash; with the result that, on the migration of a company from Ireland to another country of residence, the increase in the value of assets to the date of the company&rsquo;s departure will be chargeable to Irish tax.<\/p><p>It should also be recognised that Ireland has a longstanding General Anti-Avoidance Rule, which goes beyond the standard required in the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives.<\/p><p>Further, in the upcoming Finance Bill, it is intended that we will complete the transposition of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives, with the introduction of interest limitation rules and anti-reverse hybrid rules. It is intended that these rules will take effect from 1 January 2022.<\/p><p>This reform is not complete: As set out in the update to the Corporation Tax Roadmap, over the coming years there are commitments to introduce a series of measures to further reform our corporate tax code, including through the introduction of measures to apply to outbound payments, further action against listed jurisdictions, as well as publishing a tax treaty policy statement with a particular focus on developing countries.<\/p><p>The need to carry out a further Spillover analysis is outweighed by the need to deliver on important ongoing policy priorities, including publishing a tax treaty policy statement with a particular focus on developing countries and taking due account of the international tax discussions, detailed in the January 2021 Update to Ireland's Corporation Tax Roadmap .

The TWSS was also intended to facilitate the retention of the employer\/employee relationship thereby supporting the early recommencement of normal business when conditions allowed.

The standard mechanism to tax Department of Social Protection (DSP) payments is by reducing the recipient&rsquo;s tax credits and rate bands and collect the liability through the PAYE system. However, like the TWSS, the PUP was not taxed in &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; in 2020 and was instead calculated at the end of the year and may also be paid, interest free, over four years from 1 January 2022 by reducing employees&rsquo; tax credits.<\/p><p>Revenue published statistics in January 2021 on the preliminary end of year tax position for all PAYE taxpayers for 2020, which can be found on Revenue's website at the following link - <\/p><p>The statistics show that across the entire PAYE case base of over 2.3 million taxpayer units, including those in receipt of TWSS and\/or PUP subsidy payments, over 80% had a preliminary end of year tax position that was either balanced, overpaid, or underpaid by less than &euro;200. <\/p><p>The statistics also show that, for PAYE taxpayers that were in receipt of the TWSS only during 2020, 29% (79,800) were either due a refund or had no additional tax liability, while 71% (198,400) had an additional tax liability. <\/p><p>For PAYE taxpayers in receipt of the PUP only during 2020, 67% (203,900) were either due a refund or had no additional tax liability, while 33% (99,700) had an additional tax liability. <\/p><p>For PAYE taxpayers that received both TWSS and PUP in 2020, 42% (86,900) were either due a refund or had no additional tax liability, while 58% (112,500) had an additional tax liability. <\/p><p>Overall, for PAYE taxpayers that were in receipt of one or more of the supports (TWSS\/PUP) during 2020, about 47% were either due a refund or had no additional tax liability, 23% had an additional tax liability of less than &euro;500, 15% had an additional tax liability of between &euro;500 and &euro;1,000 and 15% had an additional tax liability greater than &euro;1000.<\/p><p>Any liabilities owed could be reduced or eliminated by offsetting additional tax credits due, for example qualifying health expenses. These additional credits could be claimed by employees when completing their 2020 income tax return. As already advised, where a liability still exists after all additional tax credits are offset, the amount due can be collected, interest free, over four years from 1 January 2022, by reducing tax credits. For example, an underpayment of &euro;200 will be collected over the four years at a rate of &euro;1 per week.  <\/p><p>Finally, I am aware that Revenue will facilitate the payment of TWSS related tax liabilities by employers who wish to do so on behalf of their employees. This includes the non-application of Benefit in Kind rules to payments made before the end of September 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100065#WRE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Data","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100065#WRE02300"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[44798\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100065#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his assessment of the current state of the public finances.","asker":"1591","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":151,"content":"<p>The Government's counter-cyclical approach to budgetary policy has - rightly - helped to absorb most of the impact of the pandemic.

In this regard, the publication of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Final Report and Public Consultation on Differential Pricing in the Motor and Home Insurance Market in July this year &ndash; two months ahead of schedule &ndash; was a major development in this area and marks the completion of a further deliverable of the Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that the Central Bank&rsquo;s Interim Report on this matter in December last year showed that consumers who do not shop around and switch regularly can be subject to a &lsquo;loyalty penalty&rsquo;.  However, the report also indicated that differential pricing can also benefit new customers or those that engage with their provider, or switch provider regularly. The Government has consistently said that it is important that we also protect the ability of consumers to get a good deal.  <\/p>  <p>  The Bank&rsquo;s Final Report this summer showed that the majority of motor and home insurance firms apply some form of differential pricing and that some of the pricing practices identified could result in unfair outcomes for some consumers. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Central Bank is proposing to use its own powers to ban a practice known as &lsquo;price walking&rsquo; in the motor and home insurance markets for personal customers. &lsquo;Price walking&rsquo; is where customers are charged higher premiums relative to the expected costs they incur the longer they remain with an insurance provider.  In addition to a price walking ban, the Central Bank is also proposing to require insurers to review their pricing policies annually and introduce new consumer consent and disclosure requirements around automatic renewals of all personal non-life insurance products.  The Central Bank currently intends on having the new rules in relation to price walking in place on 1 July 2022 and I would strongly encourage all stakeholders to respond to the Central Bank&rsquo;s public consultation on this matter, which runs until 22 October.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I think it is important to note that these proposals are evidence-based and tailored to the specific circumstances in the Irish market.  The Government supports them and stands ready to assist the Central Bank in any way it can to enable it to implement its proposals, if required.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100065#WRE04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":171,"content":"<p>Question No. 74 answered with Question No. 32.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100065#WRE04600"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[45412\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100065#WRE04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the reduced VAT rate for the hospitality and tourism sector including hairdressers from 13.5% to 9% will be extended to include beauticians; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>The VAT rates applying in Ireland are subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.

The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and\/or labour shortages in the State, required to develop and support enterprise for the benefit of our economy.  However, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.<\/p>  <p>  The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit and these lists are subject to twice-yearly evidenced based review. <\/p>  <p>  Since March 2020, my Department has implemented Covid-19 contingency arrangements moving employment permit operations seamlessly to a totally remote working environment.  Feedback received from enterprise across the board has been universally positive.  In fact, Ireland was one of the few countries that has managed to keep their employment permit system fully operational throughout the crisis. <\/p>  <p>  From the outset of the crisis, in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to, and to assist with, the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all medical employment permits are expedited with immediate effect. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has seen a significant increase in applications for employment permits this year.  To the end of August, some 14,624 applications were received, representing a 35% increase over the same period in 2020 (10,772) and a 19% increase on 2019 (12,276).  Some 9,526 employment permits were issued over this period.  <\/p>  <p>  Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also because of the HSE cyber-attack.  As a result, employment permit applications associated with the July Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other nonstandard methods.  This resulted in a significant additional administrative burden in dealing with these applications, requiring staff to be temporarily reassigned to assist in the process and had a direct impact on wider processing times for other permit applications. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out that when set against other international employment permit regimes, Ireland continues to compare extremely favourably, even at current processing times.  <\/p>  <p>  However, my Department is very conscious of the recent lengthening of timeframes for processing Employment Permit applications and is taking a range of measures to reduce the current backlog as quickly as possible.  It advises employers to take current timelines into account as part of their recruitment plans.<\/p>  <p>  My Department updates the employment permit processing timelines on its website on a weekly basis and regularly issues updates on relevant employment permit matters to Trusted Partners such as the recent update on employment permit processing timelines. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding Ireland's attractiveness for foreign direct Investment, Ireland continues to remain a highly attractive destination for companies seeking to invest, with 142 investments won up to the end of Q2 2021.  These investments provide employment potential of over 12,500 jobs.  It is also encouraging to see that during the first half of 2021 investment continued with 62 new name investments.  All this reflects foreign direct investment employment creation plans approaching the record levels of 2019. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100066#WRF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ticket Touting","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100066#WRF00600"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[44671\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100066#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if a venue (details supplied) has applied to be a designated venue or if it has applied to have any of its events designated under the Sale of Tickets (Cultural, Entertainment, Recreational and Sporting Events) Act 2021.","asker":"1488","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":182,"content":"<p>To date, the specified venue has not applied to be designated as a venue or to have events, which take place in its venue, designated under the Sale of Tickets (Cultural, Entertainment, Recreational and Sporting Events) Act 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  Venue operators and event organisers can apply for designation under the Sale of Tickets (Cultural, Entertainment, Recreational and Sporting Events) Act 2021 (Designation of Venues and Events) Regulations 2021, SI No. 399 of 2021.

This framework will introduce an obligation on electricity suppliers to offer remuneration to their customers, by way of a Clean Export Guarantee payment, for excess renewable electricity exported to the grid by eligible micro- and small-scale generators. The CRU consultation will last four weeks, with a decision expected to be published in November.<\/p>  <p>  The legal basis for the enabling framework is dependent on the transposition of the relevant articles of RED II and Directive (EU) 2019\/944 on common rules for the internal market for electricity (IMED), which establish the renewables self-consumer model of electricity generation.

An additional 40 temporary driver testers have been authorised along with 36 approved for retention or rehire in 2020. These testers have been recruited and trained and commenced testing in July.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, sanction was granted at the end of June to add a further 40 testers to the cohort. <\/p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority have pointed out that many driver testers who can carry out a CPC practical driving test would be designated as trainers and spare testers. Therefore, where there is any training of new recruits, this pulls from the available resources for HGV tests. <\/p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority is looking to increase the number of tests from 6 to 7 per tester per day from the end of September as well as extending operating hours and expanding facilities at existing centres or opening new centres where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Assuming a successful return to 7 tests per tester per day, the capacity of the system will be 4,881 tests per week.  The RSA measure test slots as car test slots and will be assigning 7 car test slots a day to a total of 4,881 in the near future.  However, truck tests take longer, so while there will be an equivalent of 4,881 car tests available, this does not mean that 4,881 actual tests will happen.  There will be some truck tests plus some car and motorbike tests but the total being done will be under 4,881 due to the longer time required for truck tests. <\/p>  <p>  There is a slower take up of invitations from customers seeking a test in this category. Many applicants on the waiting list have already received an invite and chosen not to use it.

Increasing the uptake of electric vehicles in the SPSV sector also has a strong leadership and demonstration effect on the public, introducing more people to low\/zero emission mobility options. <\/p>  <p>  &euro;15m was committed this year towards the extension of the Electric Small Public Service Vehicle Grant Scheme to include the introduction of a fund towards the scrappage of older vehicles in 2021 which reflects the Government's commitment to supporting SPSV drivers this year. I am delighted to say that approximately 1,200 applications have been received by the NTA and the funds have been fully committed to assisting this important industry transition. To date, over &euro;5m has been paid to SPSV drivers in 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  To promote the decarbonisation of the  heavy-duty sector, including buses and coaches, my Department launched a new Alternatively-Fuelled Heavy-Duty Vehicle Purchase Grant Scheme in March this year. The Scheme, which is administered by TII, is intended to help bridge some of the difference in purchase price between conventional heavy-duty vehicles and those powered by alternatively-fuelled power-trains. &euro;2m was allocated to this scheme when it launched and given the excellent response to the initiative, my Department allocated an additional &euro;1m in funds to assist the heavy-duty vehicle sector in its transition to zero-mobility. This funding has now been fully committed and the first payment has been drawn down. <\/p>  <p>   The grant schemes are kept under continuous review to ensure that they are as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort while also being mindful of budget capacity.<\/p>  <p>  The increase of the grants to incentivise the purchase of PSVs will be a matter for Government to consider as part of the Budget preparations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100069#WRJ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":393,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100069#WRJ00700"},{"type":"question","counter":394,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[44964\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100069#WRJ00800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if a response will issue in writing to an organisation (details supplied) in respect of its letter to him dated 26 August 2021.","asker":"1489","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":395,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[44965\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100069#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will address all seven points raised by an organisation (details supplied) in its letter to him dated 26 August 2021.","asker":"1489","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":396,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 156 together.<\/p><p>I can confirm the correspondence dated 26 August 2021 referred to by the Deputy has been received by my office.

There, I met with Croatia&rsquo;s Prime Minister, Andrej Plenkovic, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Zdravko Maric, to discuss the economic recovery from Covid and Croatia&rsquo;s preparations for joining the euro. While there, I also gave a joint press conference with the Prime Minister and Minister.<\/p>  <p>  This visit was taken in my capacity as President of the Eurogroup. I was travelling to Slovenia for the Eurogroup and informal ECOFIN meetings, and there was an opportunity to engage in an additional bilateral with Croatia, as a neighbouring country. <\/p>  <p>  Exchanging views with my Eurogroup colleagues and the European institutions is an essential dimension of the Presidency, whether that is done virtually, or face-to-face when possible, such as this visit. <\/p>  <p>  This was the first visit of my Presidency to a non-euro Area member state and I think it is fitting that it should be to Croatia, which is making good progress in its preparations to join the Euro. The Eurogroup is responsible for the close coordination of economic policies among the Euro area member states. Although Croatia is not a member of Eurogroup, it is a participant in the Exchange Rate Mechanism or &ldquo;ERM II&rdquo;, which is the so-called &ldquo;waiting room&rdquo; for joining the euro. Because of this, Croatia participates in some Eurogroup meetings where ERM II is discussed.<\/p>  <p>  Before joining ERM II, Croatia had taken certain prior and post-entry policy commitments to facilitate smooth participation in ERM II. These commitments are about paving the way towards euro adoption, once the convergence criteria are met. At our Eurogroup meeting in June of this year, we heard that the implementation of Croatia&rsquo;s post-entry commitments is on track. <\/p>  <p>  During my meetings in Croatia, I had productive discussions and particularly in relation to Croatia&rsquo;s progress towards accession of our shared euro currency. In fact, in Slovenia the following day, I signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Croatian authorities and the European Commission, to allow the Croatian authorities to undertake the necessary technical preparations to be ready to produce euro coins.  <\/p>  <p>  I should clarify that the signing of this Memorandum of Understanding does not pre-empt in any way a final decision on the introduction of the euro.<\/p>  <p>  The process of euro introduction is set out in EU law. In order to adopt the euro Member States have to achieve a high degree of sustainable economic convergence with respect to the fulfilment of criteria related to price stability, public finances, long-term interest rates and exchange rates. Compatibility of the national legislation, including central bank statutes, with the relevant provisions of the Treaty is also necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The assessment of convergence is monitored regularly on the basis of the reports by the Commission and the ECB, which are foreseen next year. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, all necessary health precautions were taken, and I followed public health guidelines during this trip.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100069#WRJ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Customs and Excise","counter":422,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100069#WRJ03700"},{"type":"question","counter":423,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[44429\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100069#WRJ03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to repeated difficulties being reported in cases in which goods purchased by Irish consumers from vendors outside the EU are being returned to senders by An Post in instances in which the correct customs information is being provided by sellers on packages and that responsibility for the returns are being passed between An Post and the Customs Service; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that consumers and overseas sellers are reporting that the scale of such returns is unprecedented internationally and appears to be only a matter for goods shipped through An Post and not through other freight companies; if there has been any communications between his Department and An Post and the Customs Service regarding the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1551","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":424,"content":"<p>Revenue, as Ireland&rsquo;s Tax and Customs administration, is responsible for controlling the importation and exportation of goods in accordance with the Union Customs Code and relevant national legislation and this includes goods being imported through the postal system.

In most cases, a lender is legally required under section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 to make sure that a mortgage applicant has mortgage protection insurance in place before granting a mortgage loan.  This is an important statutory provision which is designed to protect the borrower's dependants and their home should the borrower die before the mortgage has been repaid.  However, the Act also recognises that in certain cases such protection is not necessary or would be inappropriate and it provides for a number of limited exemptions to this statutory obligation such as where the borrower belongs to a class of persons which would not be acceptable to a life insurer, or would only be acceptable to an insurer at a premium significantly higher than that payable by borrowers generally.  In such circumstances, there is no statutory requirement on a mortgage lender to arrange for mortgage protection insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it may also be the case that, in circumstances where there is no specific statutory obligation on a mortgage lender to arrange for mortgage protection insurance in association with a housing loan, an individual mortgage lender may, as a matter of its own commercial policy, still require a mortgage borrower to put in place such an insurance policy as a condition for obtaining mortgage credit.  That would be a commercial decision as opposed to a statutory requirement for an individual mortgage lender and it is not possible for me to instruct lenders on their commercial lending policies or their commercial decisions on any individual mortgage application, including the insurance and other security they require either in respect of the borrower or the secured property in relation to a mortgage loan.  While I cannot involve myself in the commercial decisions lenders may make in respect of mortgage applications, earlier this year I wrote to Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) for their views and any information they can provide in relation to this particular issue. BPFI indicated in its reply that on an annual basis around 2% of primary home mortgages were provided without the requirement for mortgage protection insurance (utilising one of the exemptions as provided for in section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act) and that on an annual basis only 0.05% of mortgage applications were refused due to the fact that the applicant did not put in place an acceptable policy of mortgage insurance.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that if a person is not satisfied with the way a regulated mortgage provider has dealt with them in relation to an application for a mortgage, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, including the requirement for the regulated entity to act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of its customers, the consumer can also complain directly to the regulated entity and, if they are not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100069#WRJ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":428,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100069#WRJ04300"},{"type":"question","counter":429,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[44454\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100069#WRJ04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost in 2021 and 2022 of reducing the rate of interest on deferred local property tax from 4% to nil.","asker":"1628","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":430,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that there are 42,580 residential properties with deferred Local Property tax (LPT) liabilities for 2021.

The Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021, signed into law on 19 July, provides for the extension of EWSS to 31 December 2021, ensuring that the scheme continues to provide ongoing and necessary employment support for eligible businesses as the economy returns to a full re-opening.<\/p>  <p>  For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%.<\/p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the configuration of the EWSS in Q4 2021 regarding its various aspects will be addressed shortly.   Also, no formal decisions have been taken by Government in relation to future of the scheme beyond the end of Q4, 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 provides that for employers to be eligible for the EWSS, they must be able to demonstrate that their business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders for the calendar year 2021 compared to the calendar year 2019 and that this disruption to normal business is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the concern around a closing date for applications of 15th August, I wish to clarify that no such end-date exists or is provided for in the legislation.  However, I should point out that there is a requirement that immediately at the end of each month, from the introduction of the scheme in August 2020 onwards, each employer availing of the scheme must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances and if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer meets the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, then the employer must immediately cease claiming wage subsidy payments.<\/p>  <p>  To assist employers in conducting a monthly review of its continuing eligibility for the scheme, Revenue is providing an EWSS Eligibility Review Form through its Revenue Online Service (ROS). From 21 July 2021, completing and submitting an EWSS Eligibility Review Form to Revenue will be necessary to avail of EWSS supports, with details of an employer&rsquo;s monthly eligibility review check to be submitted by the 15th of the following month. For example, the eligibility review undertaken on the last day of September will need to be completed and submitted to Revenue by 15 October.<\/p>  <p>  Timely submission of the form will provide assurance to both employers and Revenue that subsequent EWSS claims are appropriate and in line with the terms of the scheme. This, together with Revenue&rsquo;s EWSS ongoing real-time compliance program, will reduce the possibility of employers, inadvertently or incorrectly, claiming EWSS amounts to which they are not entitled and having to subsequently repay those amounts to Revenue. <\/p>  <p>  Failure to complete and submit the EWSS Eligibility Review Form that confirms the requisite reduction and related declaration will result in suspension of payment of EWSS claims. Where a business who has not completed and submitted the Form within the required timeframe subsequently does so, and is eligible for the scheme, suspended payments will be released and paid.<\/p>  <p>  Given the scale of resources being disbursed from Exchequer funds under the EWSS, I consider that the eligibility review is the minimum level of due diligence required of employers and Revenue has sought to make the process as user-friendly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, employers must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance for the duration of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100070#WRK00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":459,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[44663\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100070#WRK00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if wage supports will be extended for the childcare sector to allow them to operate the pod system and prevent closures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":460,"content":"<p>Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides for the operation of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees.

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. <\/p><p>Nonetheless, this Government recognises the concerns felt by many groups, including in the childcare sector, regarding the cost and availability of insurance, and has therefore prioritised insurance reform through the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform<\/i>. As the Deputy may be aware, the Government recently published the first Implementation Report, which shows that work is progressing well to implement the Plan, with 34 of the 66 actions contained therein now completed. <\/p><p>One of the key achievements in the first half of this year was the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines, which was realised several months ahead of schedule. These will bring more certainty to claimants and insurers, and as such will reinforce the benefits of using PIAB to settle claims. This, in turn, will reduce the costs of claims. <\/p><p>It is my expectation that insurers will pass on these savings to customers in the shape of reduced premiums across their product lines. Minister for State Fleming has had number of positive engagements with the CEOs of the main insurers operating here on the matter, and they have indicated that they will respond positively to the Guidelines. He will meet with them again later this year to continue to press their commitments in this regard.<\/p><p>Another significant achievement has been the creation of the <i>Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market<\/i>within the Department of Finance, which is chaired by Minister of State Fleming. The Office has held meetings with a wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, representative bodies, civil society groups and state regulators on issues surrounding competition. Its aim is to help expand the risk appetite of existing insurers and explore opportunities for new market entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Department is also working closely with the IDA to encourage new entrants into the insurance market so as to improve its overall competitiveness.

The purpose of the regional uplift is to support the development of new, local pools of talent in areas outside the current main production hubs, to support the geographic spread of the audio-visual sector.<\/p>  <p>  When originally introduced, the regional uplift was to be phased out on a tiered basis, with 5% available in years 1 and 2 (2019 &amp;amp; 2020), 3% available in year 3 (2021), 2% available in year 4 (2022), and 0% available from year 5 on.

Importers requesting the issue of a &lsquo;statement on origin&rsquo; by an exporter must satisfy themselves that the exporter will be able to provide supporting documents if requested by UK customs. Alternatively, a claim for a preferential tariff rate may be made on the basis of supporting documents, or records provided by the exporter or manufacturer which are in the importer&rsquo;s possession.

Alternative product-specific rules of origin apply for electrified and hybrid vehicles with both internal combustion engine and electric motor as motors for propulsion. For these cars, until 31 December 2023, the value of non-originating material used in the production of the car must not exceed 60% of the ex-works price of the car, and from 1 January 2024 until 31 December 2026, the value of non-originating material used in the production of the car must not exceed 55% of the ex-works price of the car.<\/p>  <p>  The proofs required for preferential origin in the TCA are the same as the proofs required in other trade agreements that the EU has entered into, and generally come from the exporter, via the car supplier or manufacturer.

The annual rate of HICP inflation rose to 3 per cent in August &ndash; the highest rate since 2008. Similar trends have been observed across advanced economies, with inflation rates of 5.3, 3.2 and 3 per cent recorded in the US, UK and euro area in August.  <\/p>  <p>  However, the increase in inflation since the beginning of this year is largely explained by temporary factors, which are expected to fade over time, including &lsquo;base effects&rsquo; associated with the normalisation of oil prices following their collapse last spring. More fundamentally, on the demand side the easing of restrictions led to a rapid rebound in consumer spending, in particular spending on goods, in the second quarter. As the economy continues to re-open, demand will pivot towards contact-intensive service sectors.  <\/p>  <p>  Supply by contrast has recovered more slowly, with labour shortages in service sectors putting upward pressure on prices. Indeed, signs of &lsquo;opening up&rsquo; inflation are already evident, with strong increases in prices in the transport and hospitality sectors recorded in July and August. Shipping bottlenecks and shortages of inputs (e.g. semi-conductors, timber) have also raised production costs, putting further upward pressure on prices. Higher trade costs as a result of Brexit may also have contributed to the recent rise in inflation.<\/p>  <p>  The emergence of inflationary pressures has prompted a debate regarding the likely persistence of these price dynamics as consistently higher inflation could trigger monetary policy changes by the ECB, with implications for the cost of Government borrowing. Looking beyond the short-term, however, it seems likely that these temporary factors will fade as demand stabilises and supply pressures ease. Consistent with this view, the ECB recently reiterated that the current inflationary pressures are largely temporary and inflation in the euro area is still expected to remain below 2 per cent over the medium term. Nevertheless, my Department will continue to closely monitor and analyse inflationary developments and will publish updated inflation and economic forecasts alongside the Budget in the autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100070#WRK07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":527,"content":"<p>Question No. 209 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Data","counter":528,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100070#WRK07300"},{"type":"question","counter":529,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[45156\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100070#WRK07400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied that the economic fundamentals continue to be met notwithstanding possible taxation changes or inflation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":530,"content":"<p>Prior to the pandemic Irish economic fundamentals were strong, with robust growth, a labour market close to full employment, and surpluses in the underlying current account and the public finances. The outbreak of the pandemic turned the economy on its head in the space of a few weeks however, with the introduction of Covid-19 restrictions resulting in a sharp contraction in economic activity last year. However, in keeping with the pattern seen in other countries, the economy rebounded as restrictions were eased. <\/p>  <p>  As restrictions were lifted in the second quarter the domestic economy recovered strongly. Modified domestic demand, a proxy for the domestic economy, grew by almost 8&frac12; per cent and surpassed the level immediately preceding the pandemic for the first time since the start of the crisis. This rebound in the economy was supported by consumer spending which increased by 12&frac12; per cent in the second quarter, and the construction sector which grew by 23 per cent as restrictions were eased.<\/p>  <p>  Although the fundamentals of the domestic economy remain strong there are challenges ahead involving possible international taxation changes and the risk of more persistent inflation. Government is currently planning for an expected impact on receipts from forthcoming changes to the international tax regime, with my Department estimating a loss of &euro;2 billion in corporation tax revenue by 2025. As I have stated on many occasions, this underlines the importance of not building permanent expenditure commitments on volatile windfall revenue.

In our capacity as an EU member, Ireland is also part of a much larger, strong and coherent voice for nature and biodiversity on the global stage. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's priority has long been the CBD - its Conference of the Parties (COP) and its subsidiary meetings SBSTTA and SBI, which deal with scientific and implementation matters of the CBD respectively.

To report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.<\/p><p>In regard to the working group&rsquo;s deliberations, the group will seek to engage with a range of interested parties, including homeowners, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals and industry stakeholders, among others to examine the issue of defects in housing and report to me on the matter.

Exempt buildings principally include domestic premises, farm buildings, buildings used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, as well as buildings used exclusively for charitable purposes and other than for private profit.  The Valuation Office implemented the new provisions of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, which came into effect on 8 June 2015, in connection with Community Childcare facilities. The Act amended Schedule 4, paragraph 22 of the Valuation Act 2001, and provided a new exemption from commercial rates.

I call for an end to violence, the immediate and unconditional release of all those detained, including the President and State Counsellor, and the restoration of a legitimate, civilian Government. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of the coup, there is a political and humanitarian crisis in Myanmar. The country is suffering from conflict, severe economic recession, large-scale displacement, collapsing public and health services and a significant surge in COVID-19 cases. This crisis affects not just Myanmar, but threatens the stability of the region. Ireland supports an urgent, international effort to address pressing humanitarian issues within Myanmar.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to provide humanitarian assistance for the most vulnerable communities in Myanmar and I have called on the Myanmar military to allow unhindered access to all regions for humanitarian workers.

Delivery of humanitarian aid must be free from political interference and not be linked to political, ethnic or other identity, used as leverage in negotiations, nor used to claim political legitimacy.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to provide significant resources to humanitarian partners in Myanmar, with approximately &euro;2.5 million approved for 2021 to date.

Ireland continues to engage with discussions at the UN Security Council which has expressed deep concerns regarding developments in Myanmar, strongly condemned the use of violence by the military, and called for the release of all those detained. While this united position is welcome, Ireland would also like to see the Security Council agree more tangible actions to ensure peace and democracy in Myanmar.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports the adoption of the sanctions against the perpetrators of the coup and the economic entities that sustain them. In this regard, I endorsed the strong and comprehensive approach set out in the Council Conclusions adopted by the EU Foreign Affairs Council on February 22 and the adoption of sanctions on 22 March, 19 April and 21 June. We are currently working with the EU to consider further actions which will work to restore the democratic path in Myanmar and not negatively affect developmental gains or exacerbate the humanitarian situation.<\/p>  <p>  The crisis remains on the agenda of the Security Council and Ireland will continue to actively engage for a peaceful solution to the crisis and for the delivery of humanitarian support. Through the UN and our Embassy network, we are encouraging all those who have influence on the military leadership to use it to find a political resolution to this crisis and protect the human rights of the people of Myanmar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100074#WRO06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Protection","counter":835,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100075#WRP00200"},{"type":"question","counter":836,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[44493\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100075#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will facilitate an increase in the number of Afghan refugees offered international protection here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":837,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[44567\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100075#WRP00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of refugees Ireland will take in from Afghanistan; the timeline for their arrival; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":838,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 317 and 318 together.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to reiterate my deep concern at recent developments in Afghanistan to which Ireland has been responding in a number of ways.  <\/p>  <p>  At international level, Ireland is working to address a range of issues particularly through our role as President of the UN Security Council.

This Programme comes under the remit of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.

Some of the issues referenced in the President's speech will require further elaboration and may require specific proposals from the European Commission. Ireland will engage constructively in relation to any such proposals. <\/p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) gives the EU the capacity to undertake peacekeeping and conflict prevention missions and to strengthen international security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter. Ireland has been and continues to be a consistent supporter and full participant in its development. Participation in the CSDP does not prejudice the security and defence policy of any Member State, including Ireland, or their obligations.<\/p>  <p>  In order to facilitate cooperation between the defence forces of EU Member States when deployed on overseas peacekeeping or crisis management missions, a desire for improved interoperability has frequently been expressed. By developing common standards with regard to training and equipment, many issues which would otherwise be encountered during these types of deployment can be minimised or eliminated.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of EU-NATO co-operation, we have consistently said that we welcome greater co-operation where that co-operation contributes to international peace and security and where it is focused on avoiding duplication of structures, systems and interoperability standards as this ensures better coherence and effectiveness on the ground in peace support and crisis management operations.  <\/p>  <p>  Work on the development of the text of a new EU-NATO Joint Declaration is ongoing at an institutional level between the EU and NATO. As such this Declaration will be agreed between the leaders of the two institutions rather than individual EU Member States \/ NATO Allies.<\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, Ireland will continue our existing cooperation with NATO through the Partnership for Peace. The primary aim of Ireland&rsquo;s PfP participation is to enhance the Defence Forces&rsquo; interoperability with other professional military forces for the purpose of engaging in UN authorised peacekeeping and peace support operations led by the UN, EU or NATO.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the President's proposed Summit on European Defence next year, I expect that the Commission and the French Presidency of the Council will provide further details of the meeting early next year.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, on the issue of a European Defence Union, I await specific proposals and further elaboration of the President's remarks, including in relation to the creation of a \"Joint Situational Awareness Centre\", suggested as a means of improving intelligence cooperation within and between Member States.<\/p>  <p>  However, I would recall that, within the EU, it is accepted that defence and security is a national competence and that any decisions, including any deepening of EU cooperation, require unanimity. Any new proposals in this regard will have to be in accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality, as reflected in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100075#WRP05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":896,"content":"<p>Question No. 341 answered with Question No. 340.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":897,"content":"<p>Question No. 342 answered with Question No. 340.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":899,"content":"<p>Question No. 343 answered with Question No. 340.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Communications","counter":900,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100076#WRQ00225"},{"type":"question","counter":901,"qnumday":344,"qnumall":"[45032\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100076#WRQ00250","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he has deleted text messages or email correspondence related to Government or official communications at any point since January 2020 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":902,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces","counter":903,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100076#WRQ00300"},{"type":"question","counter":904,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[45127\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100076#WRQ00400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if serving and retired women members of the Defence Forces who were victims of workplace sexual harassment, assault, discrimination and bullying have been actively consulted by his officials when drafting the terms of reference for the independent review of these matters; and if his officials have not consulted with the women, if he will now ensure they are consulted.","asker":"1466","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":905,"content":"<p>I<i><\/i>listened with concern to the women who recounted their experiences on the Women of Honour programme on RTE Radio on the 11 September 2021.

The majority of children with special needs attend mainstream education with additional supports<\/p>  <p>  This policy is supported by significant investment by this Government.  The Department of Education will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or just under 25% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.<\/p>  <p>  Only where it has been assessed that the child is unable to be supported in mainstream education, are special class placements or special school placements recommended and provided for.

It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.  NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  <\/p>  <p>  It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. <\/p>  <p>  Through ongoing consultation at local level, the NCSE is also aware of those parents whose children are seeking placement for the 2021\/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement.

The schemes objectives are to promote (i) a reduction in child poverty, (ii) positive child development outcomes, (iii) labour market activation and (iv) improved quality.  <\/p>  <p>  The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of those families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children. <\/p>  <p>  By making this fundamental shift away from the legacy schemes where subsidies are grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families, the NCS aims to improve children&rsquo;s outcomes, improve labour market participation and reduce child poverty. It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof and assist people in exiting the poverty trap.<\/p>  <p>  Within this framework, an income-related subsidy is payable for children up to 15 years of age. The subsidy level is determined by the family&rsquo;s income and the child's age. The number of hours subsidised is determined by the parent's employment or education arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  Underpinned by this approach is strong evidence that shows how growing up in poverty negatively impacts on child outcomes.  Taking up work or engaging in training, even a very low number of hours, is key to enabling families to break that cycle and that is what the NCS is designed to support. <\/p>  <p>  The NCS does not provide grants to providers in respect of their general operation.  Rather, it subsidises parents in respect of the cost of early learning and childcare, subject to confirmation that these services are being provided and used.<\/p>  <p>  It is understood that some providers may experience a drop in income where a child has a parent at home who is not in work or study, and where in term time, the child will not be eligible for subsidies. <\/p>  <p>  This is because the scheme is also built to ensure that families are supported to access a minimum level of early learning and childcare provision to support positive child outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the evidence also shows that these benefits are, in most cases, realised with part-time participation.<\/p>  <p>   On this basis, 20 hours are available all year round for children who have not started school, and in non-term time for school age children, regardless of whether the parents or guardians are in work or study. <\/p>  <p>  They may also see increases in other areas where the NCS is supporting new families to take up places through subsidies of up to &euro;229.50 per child per week. This should increase demand particularly as we move out of the current Covid-19 emergency measures and childcare usage reverts to a more normal level.<\/p>  <p>  I absolutely understand that there will be children in exceptional circumstances for whom this is not enough.<\/p>  <p>  For these children, families can avail of up to 45 hours free early learning childcare, with no work or study rule through sponsorship arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  Sponsorship referrals can be made by a number of designated bodies. Already over 2,000 children have accessed these supports.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is keenly aware of the importance of maintaining sustainable, progressive services and in this context work is progressing on a new funding model for the early learning and childcare sector. <\/p>  <p>  This work is being led by an Expert Group, due to report later this year, who are tasked with designing mechanisms to deliver additional funding to ensure greater levels of affordability, accessibility, quality and inclusion. <\/p>  <p>  The work to design the new funding model will also include recommendations for the introduction of a model that will provide specific and additional supports to services with high proportions of children who experience disadvantage.  <\/p>  <p>  In the interim, my Department has made supports available to services who are experiencing financial difficulty, including those who have had challenges in transitioning to the new scheme. <\/p>  <p>  My Department oversees a Case Management process through City\/County Childcare Committees (CCCs). CCCs and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to early learning and care (ELC) and school-age childcare (SAC) services experiencing difficulties. <\/p>  <p>  Pobal co-ordinate the overall case management process with the CCC administering on-the-ground case management assistance.

However, there is a COVID-19 Impact Support funding strand available in 2021, which is for both Community and Private services.

I continue to be available to hear the issues and consider responses informed by the ongoing reviews.<\/p>  <p>   With regard to the issue of afterschool interventions in DEIS areas (differentiating from School Aged Childcare funded through subsidies by my Department), all schools in DEIS receive a DEIS Grant. This year the Department of Education allocated in excess of &euro;16m in DEIS Grant funding to 884 schools in the programme. The DEIS Grant should be utilised to attain the targets set in the school&rsquo;s DEIS Action Plan across the DEIS themes. In this regard, financial resources should be targeted at the individual pupils who are considered most at risk and at addressing educational disadvantage through a focused response. <\/p>  <p>  Some of the DEIS Grant may be used to meet ancillary costs such as heating, lighting and other miscellaneous charges arising from activities such as homework clubs. These costs should be linked to the DEIS themes., eg, the cost of heating and lighting for breakfast\/homework clubs operated in order to promote school attendance. However, when considering expenditure of funds from the DEIS grant, schools should look to other agencies and supports to identify if there are any existing schemes or support programmes available and avoid duplication. For example, can the homework club be delivered\/supported by the local School Completion Programme or other local community resources.<\/p>  <p>   The School Completion Programme (SCP) provides programmes and interventions to 689 Primary and post-primary schools, the majority if which are DEIS. SCP projects may provide a range of afterschool supports, which can include homework\/afterschool clubs, to children targeted for inclusion in the SCP programme across the 122 SCP projects nationally. The extent of the provision varies across the SCP projects nationally ranging from one to two days per week up to four or five days per week. The provision cannot be considered childcare and in general afterschool activities operate for 1 to 1.5 hours including homework, a snack and some fun activities. In many rural settings due to transport requirements there may be no afterschool provision and activity like this is undertaken at lunchtime. Some SCP projects may target the resource to more individualised afterschool provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100079#WRT01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":1134,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100079#WRT01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1135,"qnumday":421,"qnumall":"[44645\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100079#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the schemes in place as part of the job-share initiative or community schemes for persons with a disability or mental health issues; if there is no replacement, if he plans to introduce a scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1136,"content":"<p>My Department leads on the co-ordination of the Government's national disability policy.

The Scheme aims to improve outcomes for children, reduce poverty, facilitate labour activation, and tangibly reduce the cost of ELC and SAC for tens of thousands of families.<\/p><p>The Scheme comprises two types of subsidies:<\/p><p>- A universal subsidy is payable for children between the ages of 24 weeks and 36 months (or until the child qualifies for the ECCE programme if later) who are availing of childcare services from an approved childcare service provider.

The White Paper sets out a new Government policy to establish a new International Protection Support Service which I envision will be fully operational by December 2024. This new system will have human rights at its core and will help to ensure that all applicants are treated with dignity and respect. In the wider context of ending Direct Provision by this date, I have committed to ending the use of emergency accommodation for International Protection applicants by the end of 2021.<\/p>  <p>  IPAS has been working to this end since early 2020 and has already closed 19 such centres.

Complaints are made initially to the centre manager with a view to informal resolution. If the resident concerned is not satisfied with the outcome of their complaint, they may make a complaint to IPAS who will investigate the matter and take action as appropriate. In the event that a resident remains dissatisfied with how their complaint is dealt with, they have full access to the services of the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children.?<\/p>  <p>  To provide further support to all residents, a confidential Freephone telephone support service exists. The Freephone helpline is operated by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS). A complaint made to the JRS may be resolved without any IPAS intervention through mediation between the JRS team, the resident and whatever service their complaint relates to.  Should a resident desire,  a complaint made through this service may also be passed, in confidence, back to IPAS for investigation and resolution. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the existing complaints mechanisms available to residents, two new specialist teams were established in IPAS earlier this year to provide a greater focus on the individual needs of residents.  <\/p>  <p>  A new dedicated IPAS Customer Services Team is working to strengthen the existing resident complaints system and take a more proactive approach to dealing with residents' issues, actively engaging with residents through regular resident feedback clinics.

The degree of support provided through AIM depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school service. <\/p>  <p>  AIM has seven levels of progressive support, moving from universal supports (levels 1-3) to targeted supports (levels 4-7), based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting they are attending. <\/p>  <p>  Universal supports (Levels 1-3):<\/p>  <p>  - Level 1, which aims to embed an inclusive culture in services, includes the national inclusion policy and guidelines for ECCE, the funding of the Leadership for Inclusion (LINC) training programme, the establishment of Inclusion Co-Ordinator (INCO) roles in ECCE settings, and a small increase in capitation of &euro;2 per registered ECCE child for services with qualified Inclusion Co-ordinators.<\/p>  <p>  - Level 2 involves provision of information for parents and providers on AIM, through the AIM.gov.ie website, and information provided by County\/City Childcare Committees.<\/p>  <p>  - Level 3 recognises the requirement to continue to develop a qualified workforce that can confidently meet the needs of all children participating in the ECCE Programme. Supports include funding of training courses such as Hanen, L&aacute;mh and Sensory Processing E-Learning (SPEL).<\/p>  <p>  Targeted supports (Levels 4-7):<\/p>  <p>  - Level 4 addresses the needs of early learning and care practitioners to have timely access to advice and support from experts in early learning and care (and disability in particular) to assist them meet each child&rsquo;s needs.<\/p>  <p>  - Level 5 recognises that some children require specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and\/or that some early learning and care settings may require minor structural alterations to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme. Supports include grants for equipment and some minor capital building works.<\/p>  <p>  - Level 6 provides access to therapeutic supports where they are critical to enable a child be enrolled, and fully participate, in the ECCE programme.<\/p>  <p>  - Level 7: Additional assistance in the pre-school room involves additional capitation for service providers where an application process has demonstrated that supports at Level 1-6  have not, or will not, by themselves, meet the child&rsquo;s needs.

Tusla, through its Early Years Inspectorate, is the independent statutory regulator of early years services in Ireland, with the responsibility for regulating and inspecting these registered services to ensure compliance with the requirements of the legislation. The purpose of inspection is to ensure the health, safety and welfare of children, and the promotion of their development, as well as to ensure compliance with the relevant statutory requirements by registered service providers operating early years services.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been in contact with colleagues in Tusla, who have provided the following information in relation to their inspection programme:<\/p>  <p>  Early years service inspections take place under an inspection programme carried out by the Early Years Inspectorate, with each service receiving at least one inspection in a three-year registration cycle. Many services, however, are inspected more frequently, with services prioritised based on the size and type of service, the age-profile of the children attending, and the history of regulatory compliance. The frequency of inspections is increased where the Inspectorate may have concerns regarding a specific service, necessitating greater oversight, such as a persistent and consistent history of regulatory non-compliance. The Inspectorate may also carry out immediate or multiple inspections of services as necessary on receipt of feedback or concerns, or where a service has been escalated for regulatory enforcement action. Likewise, where the Inspectorate is satisfied that a service has strong internal control mechanisms and can evidence compliance with regulation, then the inspection frequency may be reduced.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this programme, the Inspectorate also carries out a separate programme of Fit for Purpose Inspections. Fit for Purpose Inspections take place prior to opening the service as part of the assessment of applications to register a new early years service, or where an existing registered provider applies to make a change to their current registration status, such as a change of service provision, a change in the number of children catered for, or change of address.

As in any statutory scheme, a core principle of the scheme is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment for applicants as part of the means assessment process. All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. <\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. <\/p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit\/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. <\/p>  <p>  However, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. <\/p>  <p>  Such a change in circumstances would clearly include no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment. Students will no longer receive the PUP from early September, in line with normal circumstances where students do not qualify for unemployment payments while at college.<\/p>  <p>  An applicant can request a review by contacting the SUSI Support Desk at 0761 087 874 or emailing support@susi.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The change of circumstances provision is a well-established procedure and it can also operate at scale.  For example, over 10,000 applicants declared a change of circumstance in the 2020\/21 academic year and some 40% of these applications related to COVID-19. I am confident that the application of this provision will continue to allow the scheme to be flexible and responsive to people's circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Any student who believes his\/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100079#WRT07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Fees","counter":1197,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100080#WRU00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1198,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[44428\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100080#WRU00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason for the high increase in college fees in the past 12 months (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1199,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, fee levels vary across the institutions, disciplines and mode of delivery. Publically funded Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs, including the management of academic affairs. They retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures. The level of registration fees and tuition fees to be charged are therefore a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria.<\/p>  <p>  In considering fees, it is important to note that the State currently provides very substantial financial support to undergraduate students in higher education towards the cost of their studies. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative (FFI), the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate higher education students. All students eligible for the scheme receive state support whereby the Exchequer pays the cost of tuition fees exclusive of the student contribution.  Any proposal to increase EU undergraduate tuition fees rates of eligible courses and charged to eligible students would have a budgetary impact on the exchequer and such an increase would require prior agreement between the sector, HEA, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. In this regard no such request for an increase was submitted, considered or approved for 2020\/2021 and the last agreed increase was in 2008\/2009.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020\/21 the Exchequer currently contributed over &euro;357m to meeting the tuition fee costs of 146,000 eligible undergraduate students in higher education. In addition, over 65,000 students have all or part of the &euro;3,000 student contribution paid on their behalf under the Student Grant Scheme at a cost of over &euro;190m. This substantial funding support has played a very important role in enabling access to and growth in higher education in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the difficulties facing students and in July I secured Government approval for &euro;105 million for the third level sector to safely reopen in September 2021. The package will include financial support for further and higher education to return on-site safely and in line with public health advice, and additional student supports for students in further and higher education.<\/p>  <p>  &euro;21 million of this funding will be allocated to provide specific extra supports for students including an extra &euro;3m for student mental health, an extra &euro;10m for the Student Assistance Fund which provides financial supports to students experiencing financial difficulties while in college, and &euro;8m for the Mitigating Educational Disadvantage Fund which supports and engages disadvantaged learners. <\/p>  <p>  In general there is a real requirement in these exceptional times to have a responsive approach to student needs wherever possible and it is important to acknowledge that HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways. I would encourage all students to engage with their institution to discuss any issues in relation to their course, including fees.<\/p>  <p>  The main support available to assist students with the cost of attending higher education is the Student Grant Scheme. Students can check eligibility and apply for grant supports on www.susi.ie. The Programme for Government contains commitments to, among other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. On foot of these commitments I gave approval to commence a review of the Student Grant Scheme. My Department is overseeing the implementation of the review. It is anticipated that the review will be completed later this year and will inform future priorities regarding the development of student grant policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100080#WRU00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":1200,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100080#WRU00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1201,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[44435\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100080#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the measures that will be put in place to ensure students will not be disadvantaged in 2022 by grade inflation (details supplied) in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1202,"qnumday":460,"qnumall":"[44989\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100080#WRU00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will take steps to further increase the number of places on courses in third-level institutions for 2022; his views on whether the leaving certificate grade inflation that occurred in 2021 will have a knock-on impact on the points required for courses in 2022 putting the 2022 leaving certificate examination students at a disadvantage vis-&agrave;-vis students from 2021 competing for places on those courses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1203,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 445 and 460 together.<\/p>  <p>Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are autonomous and manage their own academic affairs including admissions procedures.

To ensure impartiality, the automatic CAO points systems have been created in a way that does not allow for different treatment to be applied to different sub-groups. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the particular circumstances faced by students this year, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science worked with the HEA and the Higher Education Institutions to identify where additional places could be provided in the higher education system. As a result of this, together with the additional places created under the Human Capital Initiative, 4,650 places have been created across a wide range of courses which ensured that more students than ever before could be offered a place in a third level course.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless there were fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year. As this year saw a stronger than usual set of grades, and a record number of applications, there was more volatility this year than there would be in a typical year.<\/p>  <p>  I know how difficult a time it has been for students and parents, and we appreciate how disappointing it can be not to receive an offer for your course of choice, but we would like to stress the range of options available both in further education and training and apprenticeships, but also in pathways in higher education. For those whose route into higher education may not be what they originally planned, there are many pathways available in the further and higher education system. For primary teaching, those who are not successful in gaining place on an undergraduate Bachelor of Education may apply for a Professional Master of Education (PME) course on completion of a level 8 undergraduate degree. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100080#WRU02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Fees","counter":1217,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100080#WRU02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1218,"qnumday":449,"qnumall":"[44549\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100080#WRU02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way that a student can prove estrangement from their family if they are over 18 years of age and where they do have reports on file with either An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or Tusla; and if he can request that SUSI accept independent household bills as proof of estrangement in such cases.","asker":"1596","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1219,"content":"<p>The objective of the statutory based student grant scheme is to provide additional assistance where parental income is below a certain threshold or, in the case of independent mature students, where the level of income of the student and his or her spouse warrants additional assistance by way of a grant.<\/p>  <p>  For student grants purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances either as students dependent on parents or a legal guardian, or as independent mature students.<\/p>  <p>  A student may be assessed as an independent mature student if he or she has attained the age of 23 on the 1st of January of the year of first entry to an approved course or of re-entry following a break in studies of at least three years and is not ordinarily resident with his\/her parents from the previous October.

They comprise of a standard seven phase programme of alternating on-the-job and off-the-job phases.  The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in Training Centres, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities. Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to progress through their course. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the general activity surrounding a return to on-site learning across the further and higher education sector a number of specific actions were put in place to support craft apprentices to progress in their training in a timely manner:- <\/p>  <p>  - Craft apprentice off-the-job training was prioritised for a return to on-site learning across further and higher education institutions as COVID restrictions allowed.  <\/p>  <p>  - Delivery of off-the-job phases continued over the summer, subject to public health advice and with restricted numbers. This approach assisted institutions and providers in preparing and organising the safe return of larger numbers in the autumn.  <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;20m in capital funding has been provided to increase training capacity in the system with SOLAS and HEA allocating this to ETBs and HEIs. This will facilitate an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places, assisting significantly with the immediate backlog issues but also more broadly increase training capacity in the apprenticeship system as the sector caters for higher demand. <\/p>  <p>  - An additional &euro;12 million was allocated for 2021 to support additional classes and teaching capacity to ameliorate COVID-19 measures at higher education level (Phases 4 and 6). <\/p>  <p>  - A three-step plan to tackle the backlog in craft apprenticeship off-the-job training over the coming period by SOLAS and further and higher education providers is in delivery. Step 1 of the plan includes an increase in the number of training workshops available across further and higher education from September 2021 onwards. Steps 2 and 3 involve tailored emergency approaches to accelerate the throughput of apprentices at Phases 2 and 6 for a designated period of time.<\/p>  <p>  - Phase 2 apprentice commence off-the-job training throughout the year. SOLAS are engaging with the ETBs to maximise and expand provision to clear the waiting lists for phase 2 training.<\/p>  <p>  - Phase 4 and 6 intakes are currently scheduled three time per year &ndash; September, January and April.  Additional capacity coming on stream at phase 4 and 6 from September has resulted with in the region of 2,500 phase 4 and 6 apprentices scheduled to commence off-the-job training in September, up from 2,100 per intake immediately pre-COVID. <\/p>  <p>  - In the event that Phase 4 and 6 are prevented from returning at full capacity, a number of alternatives remain available to ensure that craft apprentices are not precluded from qualifying in a timely manner, including the potential for competency assessments to allow apprentices to qualify.  Any such measure would need to safeguard the integrity of the Craft Certificate qualification.<\/p>  <p>  The SOLAS apprenticeship scheduling management system aims to call apprentices for their off-the-job training on a longest waiting basis on the day of scheduling.

Section 40 of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 provides that where offences involving physical or sexual violence are committed in the context of a marriage, civil partnership or an intimate and committed relationship, that fact shall be an aggravating factor at sentencing. This sentencing provision applies to any offence that involves violence or the threat of violence to a person. <\/p><p>While presumptive mandatory minimum sentences are provided for in respect of certain offences, the Law Reform Commission (2013) and the Strategic Review of Penal Policy (2014) studied their use and recommended against their continued use.

The mandatory minimum sentence applied in cases in which the convicted person was before the court for a second firearms offence, or had previously been convicted of another similar firearms offence. <\/p><p>The Supreme Court held that the provision impermissibly encroached on the judiciary&rsquo;s role to administer justice in individual cases under Article 34.1 of the Constitution, and breached the constitutional principle of the separation of powers.  The Court noted that the penalty discriminated between different categories of persons (those who may not have committed an offence previously and those that have done so) and therefore was an interference by the legislature with the administration of justice, a function reserved to the Judiciary.  <\/p><p>As such, my Department is proposing to repeal provisions which provide for mandatory minimum sentences for second or subsequent offences from legislation on firearms \/ explosives, misuse of drugs, receiving stolen goods, illicit distillation \/ liquor licensing, false imprisonment, threats of harm, organised crime and blackmail \/ extortion. <\/p><p>While the distinction here - that all of these provisions relate to mandatory minimum sentences for second or subsequent offences, as opposed to mandatory minimum sentences in general - is a real and important one, in the Ellis case, the Supreme Court made a general point that sentencing always involves a consideration of the following factors by the Judiciary:<\/p> <blockquote> \t- the gravity of the offence,<br \/><br \/>- circumstances in which it was committed,<br \/><br \/>- the personal situation of the accused, and<br \/><br \/>- mitigating factors.   <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100081#WRV02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1292,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100081#WRV02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1293,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[44447\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100081#WRV02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of discussions that have taken place within her Department notwithstanding the creation of the community safety innovation fund on whether monies seized under the statutory remit of the Criminal Assets Bureau will be redirected to local frontline community services in areas most affected by criminality; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1294,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, Minister McGrath and Minister McEntee have agreed, in principle, to establish the new Community Safety Innovation Fund.

The Court also has the power, in certain cases, to hear evidence from the victim of an offence before a decision on bail is taken.

An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal aid themselves.  The 1962 Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid. <\/p><p>The provision of criminal legal aid in circumstances where a person is unable to fund their own criminal defence has been established as a Constitutional right in Irish law. There is no limit to the number of times that a person can be granted legal aid under the Scheme.  Whether or not an applicant has received legal aid previously and \/ or has previous convictions is not considered in determining eligibility for legal aid.<\/p><p>It is not possible to provide the data on the cost of legal aid by county as the system is largely paper based and figures are not kept in such a manner that this data can be retrieved.

Combatting it is, and will continue to be, a priority for this Government. Over the past year we have introduced significant measures to combat trafficking, to create a more victim-centred approach to identifying and supporting victims, and to raise awareness and provide training.<\/p><p>While it was very disappointing that the US State Department did not acknowledge the significant progress made by Ireland over the past 12 months as sufficient to upgrade our ranking in the latest &lsquo;Trafficking in Persons&rsquo; Report, I am confident that the work we are doing should be reflected in the next TiPs report and that Ireland&rsquo;s ranking should be upgraded accordingly.<\/p><p>I note that a number of key areas identified in the latest TiPs Report reflect the ongoing work that is, in some cases, already well-advanced, including:<\/p> <blockquote> \t- The recent approval by Government to revise the National Referral Mechanism to make it easier for victims of trafficking to come forward, be identified and access advice, accommodation and support;<br \/><br \/>- The drafting of a new National Action Plan on Human Trafficking<br \/><br \/>- The development of training, through NGOs, targeting front line staff in industries such as hospitality, airline and shipping who may come into contact with trafficked persons;<br \/><br \/>- The work being undertaken to provide dedicated accommodation for female victims of sexual exploitation;<br \/><br \/>- The improvements being made to the Criminal Justice System to support victims through the implementation of <i>Supporting a Victim's Journey<\/i>;<br \/><br \/>- The running of a new awareness raising campaign in partnership with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to build on the success of previous campaigns:<br \/><br \/>- An increase in funding for supporting victims of crime generally and increased funding dedicated specifically to supporting victims of trafficking. <\/blockquote>  <p>In addition to highlighting the ongoing work underway to combat human trafficking  and support those who are victims of it, I think it is also important to highlight the significance of the recent convictions for human trafficking handed down by the Courts and to acknowledge the dedication of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in investigating and tackling this hideous crime.<\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has committed significant resources to the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking in Ireland.

All the other terms and conditions of the immigration permission remain the same.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, where a person held an in date immigration permission on 20 March 2020, that was reckonable for the purpose of making an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation, and has relied on the eight emergency extensions of permissions to remain in the State, and there are no reasons why that permission should not be renewed, then the period of extension from the 20 March 2020 to 15 January 2022 will be considered reckonable and meeting the criteria when submitting an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100081#WRV05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":1322,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100081#WRV05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1323,"qnumday":489,"qnumall":"[44654\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100081#WRV05500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she is advancing proposals to offer leave to remain to persons who have spent more than two years in direct provision as part of efforts to reduce the current backlog of applications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1324,"qnumday":490,"qnumall":"[44656\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100081#WRV05600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of applications made for international protection in Ireland in each of the years 2001 to 2020 and to date in 2021; the number of negative decisions for each of those years in which all avenues of appeal were exhausted in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1325,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 489 and 490 together.<\/p><p>The statistics requested by the Deputy are set out in the attached tables.<\/p><p>Since the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 on 31 December 2016, a single application procedure applies where all aspects of a person's application (refugee status, subsidiary protection status and permission to remain) are examined and determined in one process. Prior to this, the three strands were examined sequentially and this could lead to long delays in obtaining a final decision.<\/p><p>My Department is committed to implementing the key recommendations in the Expert Advisory Group Report to reduce processing times of both first instance decisions and appeals to 6 months respectively, as outlined in the White Paper to End Direct Provision and Establish a New International Protection Support Service. <\/p><p>The White Paper proposes that the new system should be phased in and operational by 2024 and that the intervening period should provide an opportunity to progress improvements in the overall processing times for international protection. <\/p><p>Work is under way in my Department towards identifying mechanisms which will assist with this. For example, additional ICT resources have been secured for this year, and detailed practical work, including the end-to-end review of relevant international protection processes by a multi-disciplinary team from within my Department, has now been completed. <\/p><p>My Department's main focus now is to get its processing system functioning as effectively and efficiently as possible, while adhering to all measures in place to combat the spread of COVID-19.<\/p><p>A number of initiatives have already been introduced, including the relocation of the Ministerial Decisions Unit to the International Protection Office (IPO) premises to improve work processes; the designation of the International Protection Appeals Tribunal as a body authorised to hold remote hearings; and the holding of virtual interviews with some applicants living outside of Dublin by the IPO, which resumed on 10 May. <\/p><p>The IPO has also put in place a range of measures to improve efficiencies across a number of work streams, such as improved processes, implementation of non-cooperation measures, and initiatives to speed up the return of completed questionnaires from applicants. A new, shorter and more user-friendly questionnaire is being used since 28 June and the IPO has also agreed a new prioritisation schedule with UNHCR that is effective from 14 June. <\/p><p>My Department will, by October 2022 at the latest, commence a review of progress made in reducing and improving processing times and based on the outcome of that review, decide by the end of 2022, whether additional measures are required in order to ensure that the new system can come into operation without the overhang of any significant number of legacy cases.<\/p><p>As requested by the Deputy the table below sets out the total number of applications for asylum \/ international protection between the years 2001 to date.  <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Year of Application <\/b><\/th>       <th><b>No. of Applications for Asylum 2001 - 2016 <\/b><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2001 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>10,325 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2002 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>11,364 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2003 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>7,900 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2004 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>4,766 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2005 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>4,323 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2006 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>4,314 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2007 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>3,985 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2008 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>3,866 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2009 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>2,689 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2010 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1,939 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2011 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1,290 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2012 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>956 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2013 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>946 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2014 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>1,448 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2015 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>3,276 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2016 <\/div><\/td>       <td><div>2,244 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <div><\/div> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Year of Application <\/b><\/th>       <th><b>No. of Applications for International Protection 2017- 2021* (end August &ndash; Provisional) <\/b><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 <\/td>       <td><div>2,920 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 <\/td>       <td><div>3,674 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td><div>4,781 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td><div>1,566 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021* <\/td>       <td><div>1,148 <\/div><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>The tables below set out the number of negative decisions for each of those years in which all avenues of appeal were exhausted.

All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  I am deeply conscious of how important the granting of naturalisation is to those who apply for it and my Department has continued to accept and process citizenship applications throughout the pandemic and at all levels of public health restrictions.  However, processing rates have been negatively impacted by the necessary health and safety related restrictions imposed and it has not been possible to hold in-person citizenship ceremonies since March 2020. <\/p>  <p>  This has further exacerbated significant delays which arose from a High Court case in 2019, which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal.  Unfortunately that resulted in the loss of over six months&rsquo; processing time, before the appeal resolved the issue.<\/p>  <p>  This accumulated delay in 2019 combined with the impact of the pandemic since March 2020 means that, regrettably, there are just over 22,210 applications currently on hand. These applications are at various stages of processing, ranging from those just received to those where a decision has been made and are \"ceremony ready\". <\/p>  <p>  To deal with applicants that were in the final stages of processing, on 18 January 2021, my Department opened a temporary system to enable applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty.  Since then, my Department has delivered on its commitment to communicate with 6,500 applicants by the end of June, inviting them to complete the final steps required prior to the granting of a certificate of naturalisation. <\/p>  <p>  As of 15 September 2021, 6,167 certificates of naturalisation have been issued so far this year. A further 1,000 people have paid the statutory fee and will receive their certificates in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  Since the beginning of this week, the staff of the Citizenship Division of my Department have returned to the office on a new attendance pattern that will see a gain of approximately 500 production hours per week due to increased footfall on-site. To further address the volume of applications on hand, additional staff are being assigned to the citizenship team; and a number of digitisation measures have been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. <\/p>  <p>  The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Based on this, my objective is to achieve an improved decision making timeframe of 6-9 months for a majority of applications during 2022. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100081#WRV06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1338,"content":"<p>Question No. 494 answered with Question No. 493.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":1339,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100082#WRW00300"},{"type":"question","counter":1340,"qnumday":495,"qnumall":"[44979\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100082#WRW00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the development of the third national strategy; if it is on track to be completed by the end of 2021; the details of the process for the draft strategy planned to go out to public consultation in September 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1341,"content":"<p>Tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in all its forms is a priority for me and for Government.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is leading the development across Government of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which will place a priority on prevention and reduction and will include a National Preventative Strategy. This new Strategy is being co-designed in partnership with the sector. It will be the most ambitious strategy to date and will radically improve services and supports for victims. The strategy is on track to be developed by my Department in consultation with all relevant Departments and stakeholders with a view to it coming to Government for approval before the end of 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice has partnered with Safe Ireland and the National Women&rsquo;s Council (NWCI) to provide expert support in developing the new strategy.

On 31 August, the Government agreed that during the period between 6 September and 22 October, certification of immunity should be used to access some organised indoor and outdoor events and mass gatherings.<\/p><p>These measures have been implemented on an interim basis and subject to necessary criteria being met, the full reopening of events and activities will take place from 22 October, with certification of immunity as a prerequisite for access to, or engagement in, any activities or events no longer required (with the exception of international travel). However, it is important to note that the public health advice will continue to be that those who have not been fully vaccinated should avoid or exercise very high levels of caution in high-risk environments.<\/p><p>The Deputies may wish to be aware that on 15 July, NIAC made a recommendation, which was endorsed by the Chief Medical Officer and accepted by the Minister for Health that while the preference was for homologous vaccination regimens (using the same vaccine as part of a two dose regime) that selective use of heterologous vaccination schedules (two different vaccines used as part of two dose regime) should be permitted where a second vaccine dose of a homologous regimen is contraindicated, irrespective of whether the first dose was an mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine.

The National Sports Policy (NSP) was published by our colleagues in DTCAGSM (then DTTAS), in 2018. The two policies are being implemented in co-ordination, with Healthy Ireland represented on the Sports Leadership Group and DTCAGSM co-chairing the NPAP Implementation Group. <\/p>  <p>  NPAP implementation is overseen by a cross-sectoral Implementation Group co-chaired by the Departments of Health and Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. The Departments of Education, Children, Equality, Disability, Integration &amp;amp; Youth, Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage, and Rural &amp;amp; Community Development are also represented, along with Sport Ireland, the HSE, the Federation of Irish Sport, the Local Government Management Agency and the academic sector.  The Sports Leadership Group, chaired by Minister of State for Sport and the Gaeltacht, Jack Chambers T.D., also has cross-sectoral and multi-disciplinary representation.<\/p>  <p>  The NPAP contains 60 actions intended to promote increased physical activity levels across the population, divided into 8 Action Areas. Implementation of the current Physical Activity Plan is being reviewed this year with a view to charting the future direction of the Plan. <\/p>  <p>  The evidence base regarding the protective effect of physical activity on health will be taken into consideration in drafting a renewed version of the Plan.  Physical inactivity is the fourth leading cause of premature death globally.  Previous research, quoted in the National Sports Policy, estimates that inactivity may contribute to 12,000 excess deaths in Ireland alone. In Ireland, non-communicable diseases &ndash; cancer, CVD, COPD and diabetes, account for 76% of all deaths.<\/p>  <p>  If physical inactivity were absent in the Irish population it is estimated that the occurrence of new chronic heart disease cases would reduce by 8.8%, new diabetes cases by 10.9%, new breast cancer cases by 15.2% and new colon cancer cases by 15.7% and the overall life expectancy of the population would increase by 0.87 years. Moreover, regular exercise is also effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.<\/p>  <p>  More recent research, conducted in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, shows that being sufficiently physically active has significant protective effects against severe impacts from infectious disease also. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of upper respiratory tract infections and results in a 31% decreased risk of community acquired infectious diseases; moreover, there is a 37% decreased risk of infectious disease mortality between active and inactive individuals.  Regular physical activity can be shown to increase post-vaccination antibody levels, particularly in older adults, and to reduce markers of inflammation.<\/p>  <p>  Recent advice from HIQA to NPHET, following an examination of 46 cohort studies, advises that interventions focussed on maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, exercising often, being Vitamin D sufficient and moderating alcohol consumption would have beneficial effects on general health and may reduce the risk of adverse effects from Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  Efforts to support higher population activity levels are ongoing; the NPAP aims to raise the numbers meeting our National Physical Activity Guidelines (NPAG) by 1% per annum, while the NSP has a target of 60% of the population meeting the Guidelines by 2027. The Healthy Ireland Survey, 2019, found that the proportion meeting the NPAG had risen to 46% from 44% in 2015; the Irish Sports Monitor reported that this proportion rose to an all time high of 51% during Q1-2, 2020, during the initial period of Covid-19 restrictions, before falling back slightly again. <\/p>  <p>In planning to increase physical activity and sport participation levels, it will be necessary to include long-term health condition management and additional supports for people living with disabilities, chronic conditions and\/or increasing frailty and disadvantage.  In tandem with an increased prevalence of chronic conditions, physical activity levels typically decline with age and those from socio-economically vulnerable communities have lower levels of physical activity and sports participation rates compared to more affluent communities.<\/p>  <p>  The National Physical Activity Plan is currently undergoing a review process; the need for additional supports for people living with disabilities, chronic conditions, frailty and\/or disadvantage will be considered in the context of this review and of policy renewal.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above response, as the specific query relates to a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100082#WRW06675","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":1410,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100082#WRW06700"},{"type":"question","counter":1411,"qnumday":519,"qnumall":"[44464\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100082#WRW06800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current waiting times for an appointment for paediatric occupational therapy appointments in counties Roscommon and Galway; the number of children currently awaiting a first appointment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1412,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100082#WRW06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":1413,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100082#WRW07000"},{"type":"question","counter":1414,"qnumday":520,"qnumall":"[44467\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100082#WRW07100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the hospitals that enter into agreements to rent or lease parking space to outside companies; the revenue raised in each location; the duration of the arrangement in each location; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1415,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100082#WRW07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Care","counter":1417,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100083#WRX00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1418,"qnumday":521,"qnumall":"[44468\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100083#WRX00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when day centres will be permitted to reopen for older persons who are fully vaccinated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1419,"content":"<p>It is a key priority for the Government to allow more people to engage in services that allow them to remain independent and live in their own homes with dignity and independence for as long as possible. <\/p>  <p>  Day centres are fundamental to the health and well-being of our older population and play a key role in enabling older people to live independently in their own communities and the reopening of these centres are a priority for me.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.

This guidance came into effect on 19 July. The public health advice is to restore visiting to near normal in terms of frequency of visits in those settings with a high level of vaccination of residents as quickly as possible, while also recognising the need to remain cautious as we continue to deal with the evolving risks associated with COVID-19.<\/p><p>The new guidance provides that:<\/p><p>-  Providers should put in place the necessary measures to progress to more normalised visiting and visiting frequency as quickly as possible in line with public health guidance with no more than two visitors at any one time.<\/p><p>-  Routine visiting will no longer need to be scheduled in advance.<\/p><p>-  There is no requirement to have a list of nominated visitors.<\/p><p>-  The duration of the visit should not be limited.<\/p><p>-  Fewer restrictions will apply to residents going on outings or visits outside of the nursing home.<\/p><p>Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. In a broad sense, visits to nursing homes are governed by legislation under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013; regulation 11 provides that the nursing home should facilitate visiting and not restrict visiting except in circumstances such as the resident requesting same, or potential risk posed from visiting &ndash; this aligns with the risk assessments referred to in the visiting guidance.  The regulations also require that the nursing home has suitable facilities in place and available for residents to receive visits. It is the legal responsibility of each provider to assess the risks and mitigation measures associated with their service and how best to manage visits having regards to the specific circumstances that arise in relation to their service. The HPSC has developed public health guidance, mentioned above, to assist and support providers in this regard.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the current positive epidemiological outlook and the continued reopening of society, risks continue to remain and emergent risks such as variants of concern present ongoing challenges and the need for vigilance. Visiting arrangements should continue to take account of general public health advice and the necessary infection prevention and control measures, to reduce the risk of introduction and spread of COVID-19 and protect those living in our communities. This is particularly important in the context of the increasing prevalence of the more transmissible Delta variant. This variant poses a significant risk, in particular to those who are not yet fully protected though vaccination.<\/p><p>Visitors are reminded of their responsibilities with regard to self-checks for COVID-19 in advance of visits, infection and prevention control and social interaction with all individuals, while in the nursing home.<\/p><p>I have communicated with the nursing home sector to emphasise the need for service providers to follow the guidance and have requested the issue of visits continues to be monitored by HIQA.<\/p><p>The guidance will be kept under continuing review as new evidence and data emerges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100086#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Waste","counter":1660,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100086#WRAA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1661,"qnumday":602,"qnumall":"[44773\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100086#WRAA00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of food that is wasted and or thrown out by hospitals in each of the years 2016 to 2020 and to date in 2021, in tabular form.","asker":"1520","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1662,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100086#WRAA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1663,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100086#WRAA01025"},{"type":"question","counter":1664,"qnumday":603,"qnumall":"[44774\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100086#WRAA01050","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if dieticians and or nutritionists are involved in the menus for food provided to patients;

We made a strong commitment to Promoting Women&rsquo;s Health in the Programme for Government and are fully committed to the development and improvement of Women&rsquo;s Health services and to working with women and girls to improve their health across the whole life cycle.<\/p><p>Underscoring the government&rsquo;s commitment to Women&rsquo;s Health has been the establishment of a Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce in September 2019 to improve both health outcomes and experiences of healthcare for women and girls. The members of the Taskforce meet regularly, with its fourteenth meeting held this week on September 15th.<\/p><p>The Taskforce is an important element of the Department's response to the Scally Review Recommendation 2 which stated that the Minister should give consideration to<i>&quot;how women&rsquo;s health issues can be given more consistent, expert and committed attention within the health system and the Department of Health.&quot;<\/i><\/p><p>The Taskforce is chaired by the Director of the European Institute for Women&rsquo;s Health (EIWH), Peggy Maguire, with more than 30 members from all grades and divisions within the Department of Health working in partnership with members from stakeholder organisations as follows: <\/p><p>-  senior members of the HSE including the National Women and Infants&rsquo; Health Programme<\/p><p>-  National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland<\/p><p>-  Irish College of General Practitioners<\/p><p>-  Institute of Public Health<\/p><p>-  Dept. Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth<\/p><p>Full membership can be found in the attached document.<\/p><p>The Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce continues to work with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland and the European Institute of Women&rsquo;s Health to prioritise different issues each year with the aim of improving women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare. Critical to this work is the process of listening to women - the Taskforce has so far listened to, engaged with and worked with more than 1,000 women and hundreds of organisations representing women and girls across the country.<\/p><p>Based on this information, the Taskforce has developed proposals to improve supports for gynaecological health, mental health, physical activity, and menopause all of which are rolling out this year and next year.<\/p><p>Budget 2021 has provided a dedicated &euro;5million Women&rsquo;s Health Fund to implement a programme of actions arising from the work of the Taskforce.  The first three proposals to be supported under the Women's Health Fund are:<\/p><p><b>Two community-based Ambulatory Gynaecology Services in Tallaght and Limerick\/Nenagh, with an associated cost of &euro;1.415million<\/b><\/p><p>The provision of two community-based Ambulatory Gynaecology Services governed by two acute hospitals (Tallaght University Hospital, and University Maternity Hospital Limerick, though located in Nenagh General Hospital) under the banner of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This project, with an associated cost of &euro;1.415m, will see the establishment of one-stop &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; gynaecology clinics in the community in which women can be seen and assessed, following referral by their GP to the hospital&rsquo;s general gynaecology services. This service will address a clear and identified need, as gynaecology services are acknowledged and recognised as being a service area that continues to be under significant and growing pressure. These one-stop-see-and-treat clinics will play a significant role to improve access to gynaecology, reducing waiting times and improving clinical outcomes for women.<\/p><p><b>Expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital, with an associated cost of &euro;641k.<\/b><\/p><p>The second area to be funded is the expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital (TUH), with an associated cost of &euro;641k, will deliver a specialist endometriosis centre for the management and treatment of all forms of endometriosis, with particular focus on advanced and complex cases for which there is no ready access in Ireland. Endometriosis is estimated to affect 1 in 10 women and represents one of the top four categories of symptoms that comprise approximately 80% of gynaecology referrals. The provision of a secure, supported, expanded and specialist service in Tallaght University Hospital will help to improve both clinical outcomes and overall care experience for women suffering from this debilitating condition.<\/p><p><b>Establishment of dedicated specialist menopause clinics across Ireland, with an associated cost of &euro;157,000<\/b><\/p><p>The third area to be funded are dedicated specialist menopause clinics, which will form a core part of a new approach to menopause care for women in Ireland and will be supported by enhanced community and primary care supports as well as the publication of targeted and trusted sources of information for women experiencing menopause. <\/p><p>The first phase of change will include the development of a dedicated specialist clinic, in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street this year. The clinic will be multidisciplinary supported by GPs with a certified special interest in the area of menopause and clinical nurse\/midwife specialists. In addition to seeing women who meet the clinical criteria for referral to the service, the clinical team will also provide advice and guidance to GPs in the community to support the effective management of menopausal symptoms for women closer to home within primary care. <\/p><p><b>Radical Listening<\/b><\/p><p>In addition, a Radical Listening exercise was conducted to hear the voices of women on their health, to understand their perspectives on health and wellbeing, how those perspectives were shaped, and to understand the forces that shape health outcomes for women. A report of the &lsquo;radical listening&rsquo; exercise was published this week on Tuesday September 14th. <\/p><p>Led by independent researchers, over 270 women participated in these discussions from all over Ireland, sharing their experiences of, and wishes for, the Irish health system. The research was carried out in three stages, beginning in mid-2020 and finishing in June 2021, involving social and media listening; hearing women&rsquo;s stories and experiences, and national workshops with women. <\/p><p>The report is the result of a priority project for the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce and provides invaluable insight into women&rsquo;s experiences of healthcare in Ireland. Women highlight some really positive experiences but also important issues that they want to see improved in particular around information, respect, and access. <\/p><p>Engagement is ongoing with Dept. of Health and HSE stakeholders to finalise further activities to be implemented under the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund in 2021. A number of proposals are in different stages of finalisation and approval, which will be announced shortly and which will consolidate and drive impact for women in the coming months. <\/p><p>A 2022 plan for women&rsquo;s health is in development, informed by the available evidence and engagement with women across the country, key stakeholders, clinicians, and advocates for women&rsquo;s health through the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. It is intended the plan will be brought to Government and published later this year.<\/p><p>Appendix 1 - Name of Members: <table>    <tr>       <th>Name<\/th>       <th>Organisation <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Peggy Maguire <br \/><br \/>(Chair) <\/td>       <td>European Institute of Women&rsquo;s Health - Director <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td colspan=\"2\">External Members <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Orla O&rsquo;Connor <\/td>       <td>National Women's Council of Ireland - Director <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Alana Ryan <\/td>       <td>National Women's Council of Ireland - Women's Health Coordinator <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Anne O&rsquo;Connor <\/td>       <td>Health Service Executive - Chief Operations Officer and Deputy Director General <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Stephanie O&rsquo;Keefe <\/td>       <td>Health Service Executive - National Director, Strategic Planning and Transformation <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carol Baxter <\/td>       <td>Department of Justice &amp;amp;

Safeguarding adults at risk of abuse and harm by others in the context of their interactions with the health sector is a key objective of the Department of Health, every statutory body under its aegis, and every health and social care service that interacts with such adults. <\/p>  <p>  In the health sector, a framework of standards, policies and procedures for safeguarding adults who may be at risk of abuse, harm and exploitation within the sector is in place, and further measures are being developed to strengthen this framework. The framework includes:<\/p>  <p>  -  joint national adult safeguarding standards developed by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and the Mental Health Commission, approved by the Minister for Health and launched in 2019;<\/p>  <p>  -  the significant inspection and other regulatory powers of HIQA and the Mental Health Commission in relation to the quality and safety of healthcare and social care provision generally (under the Health Act 2007 and the Mental Health Acts);<\/p>  <p>  -  the HSE&rsquo;s national operational adult safeguarding policy Safeguarding Vulnerable People at Risk of Abuse &ndash; Policy and Procedures (2014), which is in place primarily in all HSE and HSE-funded social care settings.<\/p>  <p>  A range of structures and processes are established by the HSE to support and further develop its national operational adult safeguarding policy, including:<\/p>  <p>  -  a HSE National Safeguarding Office leading policy development and oversight;<\/p>  <p>  -  specialist Safeguarding and Protection Teams in each of the 9 HSE Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) areas;<\/p>  <p>  -  over 1,700 designated safeguarding officers nominated by service providers and provided with additional training; and, <\/p>  <p>  -  clear guidelines set out in the existing policy for HSE and HSE-funded staff to follow in cases of suspected abuse or neglect of adults at risk;<\/p>  <p>  -  an adult safeguarding policy and procedures training programme, and a requirement that staff must attend training. The training is also accessible to non-HSE and HSE-funded services;<\/p>  <p>  -  a &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; approach to abuse, meaning that abuse must be reported by staff in all instances; and<\/p>  <p>  -  implementation planning for a revision by the HSE of its operational adult safeguarding policy which is expected to extend the policy outside of the social care pillar and to all HSE and HSE-funded services.<\/p>  <p>  I have met with and corresponded with Care Champions on their issues of concern.  I have also met with HIQA and I have been assured that it has robust mechanisms in place to address safeguarding matters.  Specifically in relation to the nursing home sector, under existing law nursing home providers have an obligation to take all reasonable measures to protect residents from abuse. The person-in-charge of the nursing home has a legal obligation to investigate any incident or allegation of abuse. The nursing home is obliged to maintain a record of any incident in which a resident suffers abuse or harm, and the records must include the nature, date and time of the incident, whether medical treatment was required, the name of the persons who were respectively in charge of the designated centre and supervising the resident, and the names and contact details of any witnesses, the results of any investigation and the actions taken. There is also a statutory requirement that the nursing home notify the Chief Inspector of any allegation (suspected or confirmed) of abuse of any resident within 3 days. <\/p>  <p>  The Chief Inspector, in discharging her duties determines, through examination of all information available to her, including site inspections, notifications received and records, whether a nursing home meets the regulatory requirements in order to achieve and maintain its registration status. Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes.<\/p>  <p>  Significant regulatory reform is ongoing in conjunction with HIQA, in line with the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel&rsquo;s recommendations and lessons from the pandemic. Earlier this year, Government agreed the progression of interim enhancements to the current regulatory framework for nursing homes this year, with a view to commencing a wider, root and branch review of nursing homes regulation in 2022. Subject to Government approval, the interim enhancements to the legislative framework are expected to include enhanced powers and oversight for the Chief Inspector and enhanced reporting of key data by nursing homes providers.<\/p>  <p>  To strengthen the health sector&rsquo;s wider adult safeguarding framework, the Department is currently developing a national policy on adult safeguarding in the health and social care sector. This national sectoral policy will be in place in all private, voluntary and public health and social care settings and services and will be underpinned by any legislation that may be required. To date, the Department, assisted by a high-level Steering Group, has completed key stakeholder consultation and primary evidence development phases of this major and complex policy project. In developing the policy, the Department is considering the merit of a number of issues including appropriate access to non-public health settings.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department is now preparing for a formal public consultation exercise, to be launched later this year, and a costing study, with a view to submitting a draft policy to Government for approval and, thereafter, preparing any legislation required to underpin the approved policy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100087#WRBB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":1773,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100087#WRBB04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1774,"qnumday":641,"qnumall":"[45106\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100087#WRBB04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a medical card application can be completed online;

I am in regular and intensive consultation with all stakeholders, and it is my immediate priority to resolve the issues which have led to this backlog and to issue licences in the volume needed for this important sector to continue to contribute to our rural economy. <\/p>  <p>  The delays that have arisen were caused by changes to the licencing system which means that a significant number of cases now need ecological input to comply with environmental requirements. To find solutions towards resolving these issues, as well as focusing on woodland creation, Project Woodland was initiated early in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  It comprises four working groups, each with an independent chair and with members drawn from forestry and eNGO stakeholders on the Forestry Policy Group. The Project Board, chaired by Secretary General of my Department, published its first Interim Report in July and the  Project Manager has published the Project Charter which details project management oversight.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Project Woodland,  we are about the select a preferred bidder with legal and environmental expertise to carry out an in-depth review of the forestry licensing system. It will review the existing statutory framework for the licencing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework. <\/p>  <p>  The business systems analysis currently being undertaken by an independent systems analyst will interact with and run parallel with the regulatory review, so that best possible system improvements are delivered.<\/p>  <p>In June this year, the Department issued 415 forestry licences. This output  was interrupted in July and August by the introduction of a new requirement for public participation under SI 293\/2021, signed on 25th   June  by the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage and  which applies to all similar planning issues. However in the last three weeks licences exceeded expected levels with a total of 392 licences issued. This means that September will be the highest month this year for new licences. In those three weeks  a total of 342 felling licences issued, of which 171 were private for over 1million m3 of timber. We anticipate that we will maintain expected levels of output to the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsbility for the sector, we recognise that the delivery of afforestation licences needs to improve.  We are now  putting  in place a dedicated team of 10 ecologists who will deal  solely with these licences for the forseeable future.  This will increase output over the coming weeks.  Productivity will depend on the quality of the information provided (e.g. NISs, ecology reports, pre-screening reports and habitat maps) provided. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my commitment to supporting the forest sector and to building on the recent progress, so that a continual improvement in delivery is achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100089#WRDD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":1903,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100089#WRDD01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1904,"qnumday":691,"qnumall":"[44906\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100089#WRDD01700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the locations of all offices and buildings either owned or used by his Department or by public bodies and agencies that operate under his remit which are usually open to the public to access services.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1905,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to offices and buildings in the Department which are usually open to the public to access services is set out below.<\/p><p>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to the twelve State Bodies under the aegis of my Department is an operational matter for the State Bodies themselves, and I have referred the question to them for direct reply.<\/p><p>Agriculture House, Kildare Street, Dublin 2<\/p><p>Government Offices, Old Abbeyleix Road, Portlaoise<\/p><p>Farnham Street, Cavan<\/p><p>National Seafood Centre, Clonakilty, Co Cork<\/p><p>Hibernian House, South Mall, Cork<\/p><p>Meeting House Street, Raphoe, Co Donegal<\/p><p>Mellows Agriculture College, Athenry, Co Galway<\/p><p>Government Offices, Tralee, Co Kerry<\/p><p>Poplar House, Naas, Co Kildare<\/p><p>Derryhallagh, Drumshanbo, Co Leitrim<\/p><p>Houston Hall, Raheen Industrial Estate, Limerick<\/p><p>Michael Davitt House, Castlebar, Co Mayo<\/p><p>Government Offices, Athlumney, Navan, Co Meath<\/p><p>Government Offices, Clonminch, Tullamore, Co Offaly<\/p><p>Property Registration Building, Golf Links Road, Roscommon<\/p><p>Government Offices, Davis Street, Tipperary<\/p><p>Government Offices, The Glen, Waterford<\/p><p>Johnstown Castle, Wexford<\/p><p>Templeshannon, Enniscorthy, Wexford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100089#WRDD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Industry","counter":1906,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100089#WRDD01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1907,"qnumday":692,"qnumall":"[44967\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092100089#WRDD02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide an update regarding Food Vision 2030; if it has been formally adopted as policy; if it is a policy that a planning authority must have regard to under section 34(2)(ia) and or (iv) of the Planning and Development Act 2000; if it automatically supersedes and replaces Food Wise 2025; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1908,"content":"<p>The new stakeholder strategy for the Irish agri-food sector, Food Vision 2030, was launched by An Taoiseach Miche&aacute;l Martin TD, Ministerial colleagues and myself on 3rd August. <\/p><p>Government approved its publication and agreed to express support for the broad policy thrust of the Strategy and, in particular, the vision that Ireland will become a world leader in sustainable food systems.
