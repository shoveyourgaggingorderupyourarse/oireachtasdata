The Minister of State is welcome to the House.  As we emerge into a post-Covid-19 world, a traffic reinstatement support scheme for our airports is important, as is aviation recovery.  Route development, reinstatement and retention is what I am referring to and, in particular, the need for financial supports to be given to our airports and to be used to attract new business.<\/p> <p>I make no apology for being an advocate for not only Cork Airport, but all our airports.  Prior to Covid, Cork was the second fastest growing airport in the country.  It was growing faster than Dublin Airport, as the passenger data will show.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State is from the west of and knows that connectivity is important.  It is important for the external aviation sector.  It is pivotal to our tourism industry and to balanced regional development.  Our national broadband plan is being unfurled, which highlights the importance of connectivity to our regions.  <\/p> <p>As travel and transport return to normal, it is important that the Government sets out its stall to implement measures to restore confidence in air travel to encourage people to come into Ireland.  Central to that is that we show we are open for business and that potential visitors can visit Ireland with confidence.  Linked to that, we should, in the forthcoming budget and on an ongoing basis, offer financial assistance in the form of a rebate of airport charges.  I acknowledge that airport relief in continuing at local level.  We also need route incentivisation schemes and regional airport supports.  In fairness, the industry will recognise the supports that the Government has given.  All of us in this House and the Lower House should acknowledge that the Government has been quick to support our aviation sector through a multiplicity of schemes.  I very much welcome that.  The aviation sector supports what the Minister of State has been doing.  It is important that the capital expenditure and operating expenses supports for the regional airports in Cork and Shannon continue.<\/p> <p>The reinstatement support scheme for next year is important.  Aer Lingus has yet to announce its winter schedule, which runs from October to April.  Aer Lingus is our country's primary carrier.  In the context of the plan for the future, it is important that we give certainty.  <\/p> <p>I also raise the issue of Emerald Airlines.  The Minister of State has been involved in discussions with the company.  It is important for that company to get off to a good start.  I say that in the context of Cork Airport, from where Emerald Airlines has a regional franchise to parts of the provincial UK.  I wish the company well.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to give them supports and put in place that financial truncated support to ensure reinstatement of routes and route retention, as we saw last week with Ryanair and Cork Airport and as we saw with Shannon Airport.

We are all well aware that the aviation sector plays a critical role in our economy, as Senator Buttimer said, as a direct employer, an indirect employer and a driving force for tourism and business, including foreign direct investment.  Government policies have consistently recognised and supported this contribution.  Our national aviation strategy over the years has sought to enhance Ireland's connectivity by ensuring safe, secure and competitive access that is responsive to the needs of business, tourism and consumers.<\/p> <p>Ministers have engaged extensively with all aviation stakeholders, including the aviation recovery task force, the National Civil Aviation Development Forum and the aviation sub-group of the Labour Economic Employment Forum.  It is clear from this engagement that the single most important factor for Irish aviation was the earliest and widest possible reopening of international travel, subject to public health considerations.  The Government has agreed a range of measures and has allowed the resumption of non-essential international travel since 19 July.  Central to this was the substantial work undertaken to introduce the enhanced passenger locator form and the EU digital Covid certificate.  Under these arrangements we have seen a very welcome recovery in passenger numbers, up nearly 300% since 19 July at our State airports by mid-September.<\/p> <p>While passenger numbers at the airports are still only running at between 50% and 70% of pre-pandemic levels, we are seeing positive trends.  In that regard, I very much welcome the news that Ryanair will reopen its Cork Airport base from December, the return of Aer Lingus to Shannon Airport on the Heathrow route and restoration of its Knock airport service to London in December.  The announcement of the relaxation of the US travel rules for European travellers from November is also welcome and we can look forward to an increase in transatlantic traffic over the coming months.  The announced return of both American Airlines and United Airlines to Shannon Airport is a positive development, particularly as transatlantic connectivity is key to any commercial activities in the mid-west region, including tourism and the hospitality sector.<\/p> <p>An integral part of our current aviation policy is international connectivity which is fundamentally about access to markets and regions and it plays a key role in creating economic value.  The importance the Government places on regional accessibility, development and connectivity is evident in the supports provided to our regional airports, through the Exchequer funded regional airports programme which also supports our public service obligation, PSO, service between Donegal and Dublin.<\/p> <p>It is important to acknowledge what Government has done in regard to supports.  There has been a comprehensive suite of measures to support businesses, including the aviation sector, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme and the waiving of commercial rates, which are the cornerstone of the Government&rsquo;s unprecedented intervention to assist business.  It is estimated that our airports and airlines have received more than &euro;300 million under these support measures in addition to the aviation specific support package of &euro;80 million, which was announced last November.  This package represented a fourfold increase in the level of support normally provided to our airports under the regional airports programme, in addition to the &euro;21 million made available to our regional airports under the programme for 2021, and for the first time Cork and Shannon Airports also received funding.<\/p> <p>Having taken into account the recommendations of the task force for aviation recovery and in light of the impact of Covid-19 on Cork and Shannon Airports, the regional state airports programme for 2021 provided capital and operational supports of &euro;32 million for these airports.<\/p> <p>As Members will be aware, the European Commission approved under EU state aid rules a &euro;26 million Covid-19 supplementary supports scheme to compensate airport operators for the damage caused by Covid-19.<\/p> <p>Of this funding, the State airports were provided with &euro;20 million, with the remaining &euro;6 million allocated to the smaller regional airports of Ireland West Airport Knock and Donegal and Kerry Airports.  I can advise the House that my Department is currently assessing the possible need and considering options for further targeted supports for aviation with a view to aiding the restoration of lost air connectivity and competitiveness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#C00300","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response, and in particular, the last line of her response in which she stated that her Department is open and assessing options for further supports.  At the launch in Cork of the Ryanair base and new flights, Mr. Eddie Wilson remarked that Dublin Airport could see a fall in Ryanair passenger numbers by 35% next summer, as the DAA traffic recovery scheme does not have the required funding from Government to incentivise air traffic recovery.<\/p> <p>The important point is that we must all work towards air traffic recovery.  I wish to compliment those in the DAA under Mr. Dalton Philips, the CEO of Cork Airport, Mr. Niall McCarthy, and all who work in our aviation sector.  I also wish to compliment the Minister of State.  This is an important piece of work that Government must continue to support.  I appreciate the work that is being done, and has been done, by Government, the interventions made and the financial support provided.  However, it is now critical.  The Cathaoirleach is a fan of the USA.  As we open up transatlantic travel, it is important that Ryanair, which has done its bit in Europe, is matched by Aer Lingus in transatlantic flights.  I hope that we can see transatlantic flights departing from Cork.  We have seen the paradigm shift with transatlantic flights departing from Cork with Norwegian Air.  We must also ensure that Shannon gets its fair share.  It is important for our island nation that our air traffic gets back to normal and to pre-Covid levels and that we support it.

We acknowledge that aviation is a global industry.  It has weathered a crisis and demonstrated great resilience.  It is important to state that much of the recovery in the passenger numbers has been driven by our successful vaccination programme and those of our European neighbours.  At this stage, approximately 90% of our incoming passengers completing the electronic passenger locator form are fully vaccinated.  Ireland's reputation as a safe destination is also enhanced by our impressive vaccination figures and our position at the top of the Bloomberg Covid resilience ranking.<\/p> <p>In relation to our national aviation policy, we started work on that but it was paused in 2020 as a result of Covid-19 so that we could deal with the crisis in aviation.  I wish to inform Senators that work on a revised national aviation policy will begin again in the coming months.  A key part of that policy will be the development of a comprehensive public consultation process, as well as close engagement with the aviation industry through the structures of the national civil aviation development forum.  The programme for Government acknowledges the value of aviation in supporting economic development, international connectivity and tourism via our airports, while also acknowledging our commitment to support EU and international action to reduce aviation emissions.  It is a priority for Government to continue to build on the recovery in the aviation sector.  I do not want pre-empt or indeed, pre-announce, budgetary measures that may provide additional supports for the sector for 2022, but I can assure the House of the Government's continued support for the aviation sector and our airports as we recover from this unprecedented crisis in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#D00200","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","time":1633440600,"counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#D00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The next Commencement matter concerns the very important issue of the BreastCheck cancer screening programme.

This mark of solidarity, wearing pink, is meant to say that we remember these people's loved ones and that we want to raise awareness of this disease so that perhaps someone will be encouraged to get checked and, rather than having to remember loved ones, we will have them with us.  We just might save a life.  I thank Councillor Teresa Costello, with whom I am working on this.  She is a breast cancer survivor and has an incredible wealth of knowledge and a clear determination to raise awareness of breast health.<\/p><p>As the Cathaoirleach has said, my Commencement matter today is to ask the Minister for Health for an update on BreastCheck and to support an increased awareness campaign to support breast health.  Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignant tumour in Irish women.  There were 2,883 such diagnoses in 2014 and this increased to 3,700 diagnoses in 2021.  This represents one third of all the major malignancies diagnosed in women.  Although survival rates for breast cancer are currently very high, with 82% of those diagnosed surviving for more than five years, it is still the second most common cause of death in women, after lung cancer.  On average, 724 deaths per year were attributed to breast cancer in the period from 2015 to 2017.  This number has significantly declined, by about 2% per year, since 1994.<\/p><p>It is devastating that we lose 724 people to breast cancer every year but it is also estimated that 60% of those diagnosed with breast cancer every year are outside the national screening programme, BreastCheck.  I am an advocate for increased screening but this is a decision for the national screening advisory committee.  As part of my campaign, I will be submitting a proposal recommending that the Department of Health lower the age at which screening begins to 40.  The Department can act now to empower women and men to check themselves and to be breast aware.  We know that early detection saves lives.  A full population-wide awareness programme will change outcomes.  I ask that the Department fund an increased awareness campaign including national advertisements on television and social media reminding people to check for changes in their breasts.  It is also very important to show people how to check for changes in their breasts.  I also ask that each hospital group take a supportive and proactive role in this campaign and that the Department and the HSE work with GPs to facilitate increased education to support the referral of patients to specialist breast clinics.  Being breast aware, knowing the changes that could signify cancer in men and women, teaching people to check themselves and empowering people will save lives.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#D00400","speaker":"1671","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach very much for embracing the pink today.  It is great to see it on him and on all our colleagues here.  I also thank Senator McGreehan for giving me the opportunity to update the House on this important matter.  I understand how important it is.<\/p> <p>This Government is fully committed to supporting our population screening programmes which are a valuable part of our health service.  As the Senator will know, BreastCheck, along with other cancer screening programmes, was temporarily paused last year due to the impact of Covid-19.  The capacity in BreastCheck was also impacted by the cyberattack on the HSE.  It should also be noted that, even when screening was paused, the programme continued to operate follow-up clinics and the national screening service is working to maximise the screening invitation rate within the current environment.  The programme has done a significant amount of work to support the safe resumption of breast screening.  The focus of the resumption includes the management of capacity across the whole of the screening pathway, which includes follow-up assessment and treatments.  I am happy to report that routine screening appointments are now returning to normal with approximately 59,000 women screened between January and July of this year. This exceeded the target of 49,000 and more than 10,000 participants were screened in August 2021. <\/p> <p>Due to the impact of Covid-19 and the pause in screening in 2020 and again earlier this year, BreastCheck appointments are delayed by up to one year.  It will take approximately three years to get through this current screening round, which normally takes about two years.  However, this is still within international norms as countries such as England only screen every three years.  Women who have been waiting the longest will be invited first.  The national screening service is now working hard to return to breast screening every two years in a safe manner.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->BreastCheck provides lots of information for the public on its website <i>breastcheck.ie<\/i>.  This includes educational materials to encourage women to be aware of general breast health and, crucially, the common symptoms they should seek medical advice for.  It runs social and digital media campaigns and provides valuable information on their website, including regular updates relating to Covid-19.<br\/><br\/>As Senators might be aware, and as Senator McGreehan said, October is breast cancer awareness month.  The national screening service and the HSE have planned an extensive media campaign to highlight key details about screening during Covid-19, breast cancer prevention and symptom awareness.  Some &euro;10 million additional funding was provided to the HSE for cancer screening in 2021.  These important new developments will help increase capacity and enable screening of individuals who had to defer their appointments because of Covid-19.  This includes two new mobile screening units for BreastCheck planned for Donegal and Dublin.<br\/><br\/>In line with commitments in the programme for Government, BreastCheck is currently implementing an age-extension project that will see all women aged between 50 and 69 being invited for routine breast screening.  As with all our national screening programmes, BreastCheck delivers its services in line with international criteria for population-based screening programmes that are kept under constant review.  Again, I take this opportunity to emphasise that screening is for healthy people who do not have symptoms.  People who are between screening appointments, or who are waiting for rescheduled appointments, are asked to be aware of symptoms.  If they have concerns or worries, they should contact their GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#E00200","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>It is positive news that, as the Minister of State mentioned, the three-year extension of BreastCheck appointments will be back to normal within the year.

A parent who has a child with complex needs will probably have that same view.  We come to it with a perception and the expectation that once the child commences education, he or she will be there throughout his or her education years, be fully catered for, that nothing that arises will be a surprise to anyone and that there will be professional and trained resource staff there to handle it.  In the Joint Committee on Disability Matters last week we heard there is sometimes a preference among parents to have their child in a special school even though mainstreaming, a lack of othering and all of that is also important.<\/p><p>It is a shock to everyone to hear children with complex needs can be expelled from a special school.  While I will not home in on any case, this is not something we would expect to happen.  Expulsion, in the general understanding, comes with a stigma for the child that he or she has exhibited some allegedly deviant behaviour such that the school authorities cannot countenance having the child in the school anymore.  It is a seriously reputationally damaging allegation to make against a child who is starting out in life, has little life experience and may be liable to make mistakes and stray into the wrong company, giving rise to the matters for which he or she is expelled.  That is the stereotype we have in our heads about an expelled child but that cannot be applied to a child with special needs, who, by his or her very nature, may exhibit behaviour that is difficult or challenging as an expression of frustration, an emotion or a method of communication which professionally trained staff are trained and equipped to deal with.<\/p><p>Parents of a child with special needs who has been expelled from a special school find themselves having to find alternative schooling.  Meanwhile, the child is cared for by a parent who may not be trained, has other responsibilities and has no respite care.  It is not hard to see why it is draining and those parents may feel a sense of abandonment.<\/p><p>I acknowledge all that has been done by the Minister of State's Department and by that of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  The response from the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has been really good when I have brought these cases to her.  However, we need reassurances, given that these cases come up not infrequently, regarding the provision of education for children with acute needs, in light of the context of expulsions from special schools, where the behaviour that led to the expulsion is a manifestation of those complex needs.  Are the resources sufficient?  Is there sufficient planning?  Is there enough training in the special school setting?  If there are deficits, what plan do we have to campaign and combat that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#F00400","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I offer apologies from the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  Enabling students with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government.<\/p> <p>The policy of the Department of Education is that students with special needs should be included, where possible and appropriate, in mainstream placements with additional supports provided.  Where students require more specialised interventions, a continuum of education provision extends to include access to special school or special class places.  This continuum is consistent with the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act.  There are extensive supports in place in terms of additional teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, to support students across the continuum of provision.<\/p> <p>The level of investment in special education, at almost &euro;2 billion, is at an all-time high.  As a result, the numbers of special education teachers, SNAs, special classes and special school places are at unprecedented levels.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->An additional 269 additional special classes opened this school year, bringing the total number of special classes nationally to 2,118.  The new classes provide 1,600 additional places, spread throughout the country.<\/p><p>Some 124 special schools provide specialist education for approximately 8,000 students annually.  The Department has also established two new special schools in Cork and Dublin which are now open for the 2021-2022 school year, which I know will be welcomed by everyone.  These schools provide specialist educational services for students who have the most severe or complex levels of disabilities or special educational needs.<\/p><p>The Senator may also be aware that the Minister, Deputy Foley and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan recently launched guidelines on the use of reduced school days.  These guidelines aim to ensure the use of reduced school days is limited solely to those circumstances where it is absolutely necessary.  They have been developed following consultation with the relevant education partners and give direction to school authorities on the process to be followed where the use of reduced school days is under consideration for a pupil.<\/p><p>I should also state that section 29 of the Education Act 1998 allows for appeals against the decision of a board of management of a school to suspend or exclude a student permanently, which speaks to the point made by the Senator.  This is a necessary provision to safeguard the rights of all children in a school.<\/p><p>In accordance with section 24(4) of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, \"A student shall not be expelled from a school before the passing of 20 school days following the receipt of a notification under this section by an educational welfare officer.\"  This section of the Act provides for the educational welfare officer to convene a meeting with the school and the parents and any other persons, as agreed, to attend to make reasonable efforts to ensure provision is made for the continued education of the student to whom the notification relates.  <\/p><p>Where a student is expelled, section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal where a board of management, or a person acting on behalf of the board of management, normally the school principal, expels a student.  To make an appeal, a parent, guardian or the pupil, if over 18 years, must complete the section 29 appeal form for expulsion or suspension.  The Department does not hold the details on the number of children expelled from school and only has details on the number of appeals taken under section 29 in respect of expulsions.  Since November 2020, there have been 32 appeals received in respect of expulsions from schools.<\/p><p>Through the work of the educational welfare officers and the special educational needs organisers, support is available for both the school and the parents at a local level.

We all acknowledge that they have faced great adversity over the last 18 months and many of them are fighting for the survival of their businesses at present.  I must acknowledge that government subsidies have been forthcoming and have stopped the financial bleeding for many businesses, and the business owners I speak to are very complimentary about the suite of financial supports that has been made available.  However, the Government must now reposition its focus and support businesses to get back to financial independence.<\/p> <p>I wish to highlight the significant staffing shortages being experienced by many businesses as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and why it is imperative that visas are issued in a far swifter manner for workers to step into the breach, particularly those who have skills in the hospitality sector and in food production.  I refer to one food production company that contacted me.  The company needs 100 skilled workers at the very minimum.  It cannot source them in Ireland and has tried to source them throughout Europe.  It needs 100 people.  It is turning away business at present and is finding it extremely difficult to meet the orders it has accepted.  It submitted visa applications and has been told that it is three to four months behind.  The Department is currently only dealing with applications that were made in late June and early July.  This is detrimental to the company.  Another business I wish to mention is a four-star hotel, a fine hotel at the heart of my constituency.  Again, it has been advertising for chefs and for others who are experienced in hospitality, but the quality and volume of staff required are simply not available.<\/p> <p>It is not an isolated issue, as I am hearing this from many businesses.  They were lucky to employ skilled and capable employees who happen not to be Irish citizens and who had been residing in Ireland solely for the employment opportunities it has to offer.  However, when the pandemic started many of them chose to return to their home countries.  Now there is a dearth of people who are able to take up specific employment positions.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State's Department have ultimate responsibility for ensuring that we have a robust workforce that is fit for purpose.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State must do more to support businesses to stand on their own two feet.  If businesses cannot access the skilled labour they need to run their businesses effectively, they will never be able to return to the level of their pre-Covid operations.  They are also very concerned about the staff who are working in their businesses at present and who are taking on extra shifts and so forth, because they want to ensure that everybody is working in a good employment situation.<\/p> <p>Visas are a particular issue, with many potential workers struggling to gain access to the employment market.  The Department must fulfil its brief and there must be a very strategic intervention.  Obviously, the Department must have additional staff to accelerate the permit process.  This is a major issue not just for the people I represent in Kildare but throughout the country.  I hope the Minister of State will take on board the message I am strongly giving to him and intervene in an appropriate way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#J00200","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Loughlin for raising this issue, which is something we have discussed quite a lot in recent weeks, mainly in this House.  It has been raised with me quite regularly by the business community and the representative bodies we engage with in the various sectors.  We have spent a great deal of time over the last couple of months engaging with various sectors and businesses that have highlighted this shortage of staff as a major issue and which are finding it very difficult to access the skilled staff they need, and in some cases the unskilled staff they need, in many sectors.  The Senator highlighted two today, hospitality and food production.  That matches up with the data coming through to us as well.<\/p> <p>We have engaged with the various sectors.  Part of the difficulty is that this year there have been more than 17,000 applications for permits since the start of the year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Over 11,000 applications have been granted so we are clear that we are moving through a lot of applications.  A backlog has developed in recent months, mainly due to the demand for medical permits, which had to be prioritised.  The process involving medical permits became a lot more difficult after the HSE cyberattack so we have had to process a lot of them manually and some were applied for manually as well.  We have increased staff resources and made changes in our Department to try to cater for the demand for permits and make decisions on applications a lot more speedily.  We are not in charge of the visas; we just have responsibility for the work permits.  The Department understands how important these work permits are for many sectors and we will try to engage with them on that.<\/p><p>A review is under way which is looking at the various sectors that might need changes to the permit system.  We have had 29 submissions to that review, including from the sectors the Senator has referenced, such as food production and hospitality, and many others.  We are working through those submissions and hopefully we can make any changes that are needed in the month of October.  That usually happens in November but we are going to try to do it in October of this year if possible to try to cater for that.<\/p><p>The Senator is right that some sectors have gone to great lengths to source staff in Ireland and in Europe and I have met some of the representatives of those sectors.  We grant permits outside of the EU and we would ask any sector or company that is making applications for permits or looking for changes to the permit lists to make every effort they can to source labour locally if they can and to engage with Pathways to Work and our Intreo offices, which provide great supports to take people off the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and social welfare.  Both businesses and people are supported as they go back to work so I ask businesses to engage with that service.  In the short and long term, businesses need to engage with our education system, including the higher education sector and the further education and training sector, to develop these skills locally if it all possible, rather than having to go down the route of work permits.  It is difficult to explain that there are 100,000 people on the PUP and another 100,000 plus on social welfare and yet thousands of these jobs are also available.  It is hard to address the need for work permits in certain sectors that do not have a need for high-skilled labour in that context.  We will try to accommodate it as best we possibly can.<\/p><p>The Senator mentioned the food sector and although I was not in the Department at the time, in 2018 it made changes to the scheme to try to cater for that.  A pilot quota-based scheme was introduced which issued 2,500 general employment permits for the meat processing industry, 500 permits for horticulture and 150 permits for the dairy sector.  That quota has been used up so the ask is that it would be increased, as well as making other changes to the list.  We are doing all that work at present and hopefully we will be able to provide an update before the end of October.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#J00300","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

We have to recognise the reality of what is there.  Maybe we can have a separate debate on Pathways to Work on another day.<\/p> <p>We need to have the quota system opened again and the Minister of State has indicated that this could be done.  On the 3,000 permits that have not yet been processed and that the Minister of State mentioned, that is where the crisis and the crux of the matter is.  The Department must do whatever it can and I acknowledge that there is a difference between the work permits and the visa applications but the Minister of State was sent to deal with this matter and one goes hand in hand with the other.  We must think about what these businesses have gone through over the last 18 months, particularly the hospitality industry, which cannot get chefs for love nor money.

The Senator will appreciate that meant there would be some delays.  We tried to address that through overtime and staffing.  On top of that, we had to deal with medical permit applications, which are generally submitted in May, June and July.  Many of those permits had to be processed manually, which caused great difficulty.  <\/p><p>However, our teams have been responding both in dealing with the permits in the system and in reviewing the lists under which people are allowed to apply for permits.  The hospitality sector and many other sectors, including the transport sector which is a significant one, are included on the lists.  We will deal with those in the coming weeks.  I will continue to engage with all those companies and sectors.  We have to address the skills shortage in many other ways in the long term, rather than simply a reliance on the employment permits system.  I am committed to doing that.  The various Departments will join forces to address that, if this can be done, in the long term.  The employment permits system is often a way to solve the problem in the short term as well as bringing in some new talent to the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#K00300","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1633440600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.22 p.m. and resumed at 3.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1633440600,"counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#N00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion regarding the report of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action under Seanad Standing Order 116 on legislative proposals of the EU Fit for 55 package - COM (2021) 551, 554, 555, 557, 558 and 568, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business, without debate; No. 2, the Child and Family Agency (Amendment) Bill 2021 - Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 5 p.m. and to adjourn no later than 6 p.m. if not previously concluded; No. 2<i>a<\/i>on the Supplementary Order Paper, motion regarding the report of the Committee of Selection, to be taken at 6.15 p.m., without debate; No. 3, statements on Belarus, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 2<i>a <\/i>and to conclude after 90 minutes, if not previously concluded, with the time allocated to the Minister's opening speech not to exceed ten minutes, those of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes, and the Minister to be given no less than ten minutes to reply to the debate; and No. 4, the Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020 - Committee Stage, to be taken at 8 p.m. or 15 minutes after the conclusion of No. 3, whichever is the later, and to adjourn at 9 p.m. if not previously concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#N00200","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I compliment the Cathaoirleach on his pink tie.

These were two women living in different communities in different countries who died in similar circumstances, one at the hands of a stranger who should have been a pillar of the community and protected and supported her, and one at the hands of a former boyfriend.  Such crimes horrify and shock us all.  We have to do what we can to empower women to be able to walk safely through the streets and to look for help when they need it.  It is important to acknowledge the really good organisations such as Women's Aid, Rape Crisis Network Ireland and Safe Ireland and ensure that every county has a refuge such as Teach Tearmainn in County Kildare, which does such wonderful work.

It is very welcome and there are many people who use it and it is vital for those communities, so I welcome the announcement.<\/p> <p>There is a serious issue relating to work permits for many sectors that need them.  The application process has changed in recent years and become more difficult.  It has been quite successful, with approximately 14,000 of 17,000 applicants this year being successful and there has been an increase of approximately 41,000.  However, some sectors, particularly hospitality and agriculture, are just not getting workers as quickly as needed.  Some of the reasons for refusal are very frustrating.  A constituent of mine applied for a work permit for an employee.  He ran an advertisement for 28 days but when he submitted it he had to amend it slightly as there was a misspelling of the person's name.  He edited it and showed proof that he had done so but his application was refused because the name was misspelled at the start.  If there is an error in an application, there should be a process for informing the person of that error before a decision is made.  These people are waiting three, four or possibly six months but the application is then refused and they have to start the process all over again.

I have some understanding of the devastation of losing a mother at a very young age.  Senator McGreehan has spoken about encouraging a change so women of a younger age or who are healthy get checked.  My mother died at 49, which is very young, and we would not wish that on anyone.  It is very important we as a group highlight this effort.  It is very welcome to see so many people wearing the colour pink.  If we can do anything to promote it and encourage people to get checked, especially when healthy, it would be very much appreciated.

As the House will be aware, parents in Ireland have a right to be informed of issues relating to their children and to be consulted on educational matters.  Both the Constitution and the Education Act 1998 are clear on the requirement for parents to be kept advised of all relevant issues.  However, I have been reliably informed this is not happening in a serious way, as there are cases of schools making logistical decisions relating to children under their care without the knowledge or consent of the child&rsquo;s parents.<\/p> <p>This occurs when a child or children in a school tell their teacher they no longer self-identify with their biological sex and wish to be referred to by a new name and pronouns and to be treated, for all intents and purposes, as if they were a student who is a member of the opposite sex.  As far as I am aware, there is no set national procedure for handling these instances.  There are many resources and guidelines, none of which is independently drafted but instead are gifted by advocacy groups such as BeLonGTo and TENI, and individual schools seem to be left to their own devices when handling this matter.<\/p> <p>Some schools will involve the parents and have a meeting so that everyone can make themselves heard and the parents' wishes can be respected.  Other schools do not feel the need for this and take it upon themselves to socially transition the student from one gender to the other, sometimes without even informing the child's parents, possibly for fear they may disagree with and object to this approach.  The most serious issue, however, relates to the logistical consequences of actively pursuing this social transition, including access to toilets and changing rooms of the opposite sex, participation in sex-specific social, personal and health education classes, and in the case of school trips, accommodation in the sleeping area of the opposite sex, and all the while not telling the parents of other children affected that this will be happening.<\/p> <p>A recent webinar held by The Countess, a new group advocating for women and children, brought this information to parents and members of the school community, and they were inundated with questions as parents voiced their serious concerns with this state of affairs.  We must ensure the highest standard of care possible for all children, including the children themselves who may be experiencing confusion around their identity.  After all, anywhere from 63% to 94% of children who experience gender dysphoria will no longer experience such feelings by their late teens.  Those children are not well served by social transition, which is a powerful psychological intervention, placing them on a pathway to puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  I recently discovered that if a girl is given testosterone for a mere three months, she will experience irreversible facial and chest hair growth for life, which is a tall price to pay for a decision made in one's teens.<\/p> <p>It is time to have the Minister for Education before us in the House to explain her plan for tackling this most serious matter, which will become more commonplace in our schools and all our sports clubs in the country if left unaddressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#P00300","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>T&aacute; s&eacute; go deas an Cathaoirleach a fheice&aacute;il i mb&aacute;ndearg inniu.<\/p><p>I want to highlight the issue raised in local media in Clare, in <i>The Clare Echo.<\/i>Rent price increases in Clare are currently among the highest in the country.  Clare has seen the second highest increase in rent prices in the entire Republic.  According to the Residential Tenancies Board, there has been a 16.1% increase since this time last year.  Each quarter, there has been an increase of 5.1%.  This is a major issue.  I am aware that a great housing initiative was launched recently but it takes a long time to build houses.  In the interim, there are many things we can do.  In Dublin, as early as December 2016, we heard talk about rent pressure zones and restrictions on Airbnb.  Under the rules introduced in July 2019, a 90-day cap was imposed on the renting of full houses through Airbnb in rent pressure zones.  We have not seen that ruled out anywhere else.  It is time that we considered this measure implemented in areas such as Clare and Leitrim, which has seen the highest increase in rents in the country.  Who does not want to live in Clare and Leitrim, two great counties?  The prices are becoming ridiculous and really unaffordable.  Where I live in north Clare, around Ennistymon and Lahinch, you can find perhaps one place online to rent, whereas 80 whole houses may be rentable through Airbnb.  It is a serious issue.  If rectified, it could help us to deal with the housing crisis in the short term while we work towards building all the new houses we hope to build.  The local authorities will need to be resourced if we are to do this.  Issues arise in this regard even in Dublin, where rent pressure zones and regulations concerning Airbnb have been introduced.  The regulations are not fully implemented because of a lack of resources in the councils.  Therefore, we need rent pressure zones rolled out nationwide and we need the local authorities to be properly resourced to deal with them.  People are living in vans and are unable to work.  We cannot get staff in places in north Clare because there is nowhere to live, yet there are many houses available through Airbnb that could be homes.<\/p><p>&Oacute; thaobh an mh&iacute; at&aacute; ann do mhn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann agus &oacute; thaobh muid f&eacute;in a chosaint, caithfimid seice&aacute;il.  We have to be breast-aware.  We have to check our breasts and do so regularly.  It is not just an issue for middle-aged women; as Senator Ahearn said, it is also an issue for younger women.  We need to talk about this and raise awareness.  That is the whole idea of this month.  I am not wearing a lot of pink today but I am pink on the inside and have become very breast aware.  I was not until recently.  Given my age, I probably should have been checking about ten years ago.  I have been lucky so far but breast cancer has touched everybody.  Everybody has lost somebody to breast cancer in this country.  Many women have been resilient and have managed to fight back, but awareness is always the first step, and prevention is always better than cure.  I welcome the support from the men on the committee, who have worn pink.  I thank Senator McGreehan, who raised the issue.  Half the population of the nation is female.  We all need to support women in being breast aware this month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#Q00100","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh fhoilsi&uacute; na tuairisce faoi institi&uacute;id&iacute; &oacute; Thuaidh.  I want to begin today by welcoming the publication today of the report Mother and Baby Institutions, Magdalene Laundries and Workhouses in Northern Ireland.  The work was carried out by Ms Deirdre Mahon, Dr. Maeve O'Rourke and Professor Phil Scraton for the North's Executive.  We are aware that the impact of the institutions is still felt in many instances across all of our country.  We know that, very often, women and girls from the North were sent to institutions in the South, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  As I am sure colleagues do, I look forward to reading and absorbing the findings of that report and understanding how we might assist colleagues and, most important, survivors and their families in the North in ensuring they have access to the full truth, justice and support moving forward.<\/p><p>The Leader will recall that I called last week for a series of statements on the roll-out of the protocol.

David Frost, who negotiated the protocol on behalf of the Tory Government, described growing all-Ireland trade as a problem to be solved.  As we know, understand and appreciate fully, the protocol was put in place to mitigate Brexit and its negative and unwanted impacts on Ireland, north and south.  At a time of empty shelves and unmitigated chaos in Britain, we are seeing the protocol insulating Ireland from those problems.  I wanted to take the opportunity to make those points again today.<\/p><p>Without getting into an unnecessary ding-dong or going down in the dirt, I remember being at an event in Waterfront Hall in Belfast and listening to a talk by the late Tony Benn.  He said that you should never wrestle the chimney sweep because you will both end up dirty.  I am not advocating for that.  I am advocating for an opportunity for us to cut through some of the noise to ensure that the Irish Government is articulating on any platform it can the real, factual benefits of the protocol and what it is doing for people on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#Q00200","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McGreehan for bringing us all together to wear pink today and to make people aware of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  We remember my own mother, who died seven years ago having unfortunately succumbed to cancer, initially breast cancer.  It is great to remember but, as other Members have said today, it is important that as many women and, indeed, men as possible come forward to get tested.  I again thank Senator McGreehan.<\/p> <p>I agree with my Kildare colleague that St. Brigid's Day is a great day for a national public holiday.  We are all very proud of St. Brigid and what she encompasses for everybody in County Kildare.  She encompassed a lot for this entire country.  I totally agree that the next national holiday should be on 1 February to celebrate a great Kildare woman and Irishwoman.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise a housing issue with the Leader.  As is the case for many of my colleagues in their areas, housing continues to be an issue for me where I live in south Kildare.  I am getting many calls from desperate families who simply cannot get any accommodation in the overcrowded or non-existent rental market.  Those people are, in desperation, turning to local authorities for any form of assistance for themselves and their families.  One of the biggest frustrations they have, however, relates to vacant properties in the estates in which they are currently living and where their leases are finishing up.  They are also being told by families and friends of other vacant properties in other estates throughout the area.  At this stage, I am aware of a growing list of over 20 vacant properties in the area where I live.  It would seem to me that each town and village in south Kildare has a large number of vacant homes, some of which have been lying empty for up to five years.  I have contacted my local authority about this growing list and I continue to get a growing number of different answers, including that the authority does not have the personnel to carry out those surveys, funding issues and that some of these properties are not in its ownership.  The real answer, of course, is that we are in the biggest housing crisis we have ever faced and none of the previous answers, or any other answer, can be accepted as to why these houses are not occupied in the quickest possible time by desperate families who are running out of time.<\/p> <p>The Government must ensure that our local authorities can hire the personnel required to carry out inspections and agree a programme of works as needed and, as importantly, hold onto these people.  Short-term contracts for these personnel are simply not good enough.  Funding is needed to turn these vacant homes back into family homes as quickly as possible.  It is not good enough that regular maintenance budgets have now stopped in some local authorities because the funding must be sought from these maintenance budgets to carry out the voids project.  It is simply not good enough.  We must find out who owns these other properties that lie vacant for so long.  My own local authority indicates that the compulsory purchase order process is too restrictive, takes far too long and is simply ineffective.  I know there was a debate on Housing for All last week but this is an important issue and it needs to be debated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#R00200","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I formally give notice to this House that Senator Flynn and I have entered a pairing arrangement for the next six months.

I commend the Minister, Deputy McEntee, on the leadership she showed a couple of months ago when said she was going to take six months' maternity leave.  That was a powerful message and that type of leadership changes culture.  Four and a half years ago when I was a Member of this House and I gave birth to my son, such arrangements were not in place, it was not spoken about and you were almost afraid to ask about it.  It is important we talk about it, that women are seen to be supporting other women in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il, and that they take that time with their newborn babies and with their families.<\/p><p>I would like to take the opportunity to highlight the lack of maternity leave for our local authority members.  Local authority members have absolutely no arrangements, formal or otherwise, and that is a very big barrier.  It has been recognised by many studies and members themselves as a barrier to entry and retention of the female members.  We all know the important role councillors play and the difference they make in their local communities.  We also know the vast majority of women who make it into the D&aacute;il and the Seanad came through their local authority.  If women are not being elected to and staying on local authorities and getting their experience, we will not see female Ministers, we will not see a woman in the Taoiseach's office.  I commend Councillor Mary Hoade, the former president of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG , who before she left office presented a very important document called Pathways to Maternity Leave.  I call on the Government to act on that, implement measures, and support adequate maternity arrangements for female local authority members, because without it our democracy is being impacted.<\/p><p>I also commend Senator O'Loughlin on her suggestion for St. Brigid's Day being formally recognised.

It has been a wonderful series made by ITV in west Cork.  You could walk down the street in Skibbereen and see Oscar-winning actresses walking up to you or you would have the pleasure of meeting the &quot;Derry Girls&quot; actress.  It was a phenomenal sight to see for west Cork.<\/p><p>That has been the story of our summer in many ways, to be a location for such a prime film that one hopes will be very successful.  There is an opportunity for every county to participate in this.  We have so much to offer, whether it is the Cathaoirleach's county of Kerry and all the way up the west coast, we have beautiful scenery and locations.  The knock-on benefit for our economy is actually millions of euro.  Millions of euro have been spent in west Cork in recent weeks by this film company.  We have the opportunity to roll that out throughout the entire country, so we need to have a dedicated policy to work to make sure we can get these production companies into Ireland because the knock-on effect for rural settings in particular is huge.

The report points out that in 2013, the Department of Transport paid &euro;4.3 million to CHC Helicopter, the current operator, to ensure that its five helicopters were equipped with night-vision capability.  I am still trying to understand why the State funded a private company's conversion of its helicopters, but we will leave that for now.  The report goes on to state that another &euro;527,000 was paid in 2015, for 24 sets of night-vision goggles which, I understand, would remain the property of the Irish Coast Guard.  Finally, the report advises that an initial payment of &euro;1.7 million was made in 2018 in respect of training the crews of this private contractor in the use of the technology.  This training only commenced in November 2019 and is expected to be completed sometime this year.  Senators will note that the process started in 2013.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General points out that as of June 2021, only one of the search and rescue, SAR, bases has been approved by the Irish Aviation Authority to use night-vision technology.  Service from that base has commenced, but it will be some time before all of the bases are able to operate in the same way.  It is indeed poor value for money for this country.<\/p><p>Why does this disaster exercise me?  In 2009, the Department of Transport and the Irish Coast Guard established the Future Helicopter Study Group, which reported on what would be required for the next SAR contract.  In that report, they recommended night-vision technology, yet the contract went ahead without the inclusion of the requirement of night-vision technology.  The real concern here is the total lack of oversight.  I believe that it was only after the crash of Rescue 116 that any steps were taken to deal with the corporate governance issues at CHC Helicopter.  <\/p><p>In 2017, after the crash of Rescue 116, the Department of Transport and the Irish Coast Guard sought a company to carry out the corporate governance and oversight that they were not capable of doing.  The company chosen was a company called Aerossurance.  It is a one-man company, which was only formed in 2014.  In 2015, it published its first accounts.  However, the accounts were not audited because the company was so small that it was not required.  In 2017, when the company was awarded the contract to advise Ireland's Department of Transport and the Irish Coast Guard, the net assets of the company were &euro;13,000 and &euro;9,000 in cash in the bank.  After the crash of Rescue 116, one would surely expect that a major consultancy firm would have been brought in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#S00400","speaker":"1645","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I know the Senator is aware of the new Standing Orders that have been adopted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#T00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I am a bit deaf, so you will have to speak up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#T00300","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I wish to make the Senator aware of the Standing Orders that we introduced around the issue around defamation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#T00400","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Everything I am putting out here is in the public domain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#T00500","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I just want the Senator to be mindful of mentioning people who are not here to defend themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#T00600","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I hate to say it, but I did not hear one word of what you said.

I refer to the issue of antisocial behaviour.  I define antisocial behaviour as behaviour that is unfriendly in any way.  It can be anything from being rude online to gratuitous random attacks of physical violence.  These have been documented in the media but unfortunately far too many people are experiencing them in real life.  They are being experienced in our public spaces, on public transportation, in public parks, on our streets and outside of people's homes.  It is not rampant.  It is typically a small group of people who are engaging in this type of behaviour.  It is not representative of my community or of communities around the country.  We need a full debate on the issue in the House.  I am a founding director of a community policing forum in Cabra.  I know that communities are engaged.  Community garda&iacute; provide an invaluable service.  They know who belongs in their communities.  We need a debate on the resourcing of community garda&iacute; in every community around the country.  The other group we need to involve in this debate is the social media platforms.  Snapchat, Whatsapp and TikTok have to stop acting as if they have no responsibility in this space.  They cannot abdicate their responsibility.  We cannot allow them to do so.  They have a social obligation and responsibility to ensure that materials and content being shared on their platforms are not antisocial in any way.  We need to hold them to account.

This issue is becoming extremely prevalent on our streets in all the towns and villages.  Going home from Dublin on a Friday evening, I used to notice the large numbers of youths out with drink and so on.  You need only have watched \"Claire Byrne Live\" last night to see images that are replicated in every single town around the country.  I am a firm advocate of the recently established community safety partnerships.  There have been three, including a pilot in my own county of Waterford and another in inner city Dublin.  That is the way forward.  We must work together.  Antisocial behaviour is a serious issue.  The vast majority of this is being carried out by young teenagers.  When I was a young teenager, my parents - God rest them - did not let me out and about like that.  Parents must take more responsibility.  Councillor Liam Galvin was on the programme last night and said that parents need to take more responsibility, particularly for kids aged under 16.  Something such as fixed fines should be put in place for situations in which children stray like that.  Something has to be put in place to ensure more care is taken.  I agree with the comments Councillor Galvin made.<\/p> <p>The second issue I will speak about relates to the arts community, for which I am a spokesperson.

He is correct that no one has addressed it from the Government side and it is shocking.  It is about time someone in the Government addressed it.<\/p> <p>I raise the issue of University Hospital Limerick because a good friend of mine had the unfortunate experience of being there last Thursday night and into 1 October.  He experienced seeing 75 patients on trolleys; bear in mind this was 1 October.  Trolleys were backed up one against another and there was no social distancing whatsoever.  None was possible because of the number of patients on trolleys.  It was so bad that a member of the canteen staff could not enter the ward with her tea trolley.  That is how chaotic and disastrous it was last Friday, with 75 patients on trolleys.  It led to people getting up to help themselves to tea, which led to further chaos.  What really struck my colleague was the despair not just of the patients left languishing on trolleys, but of the staff.  The hospital is still understaffed, with rosters featuring people who were on holiday.  On the same evening, healthcare assistants were asked to unload trolleys, not for patients but for stores.  This is the chaos that has become endemic across University Hospital Limerick.  I have raised this issue several times each year in the six years I have been in the House.  The point is that it continues to get worse.  Indeed, on Sunday night, the figure had risen to 85 people on trolleys.  Fine Gael has failed on healthcare in Limerick for a decade at this stage.  The problem of a lack of commitment to Sl&aacute;intecare is massively connected to this.  There is an ideological issue at the heart of this.  We on the left believe in a national health service.  It is quite clear to me from the actions of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, that the conservative parties do not.

Members will know BreastCheck is currently rolling out a programme whereby women between the ages of 50 and 69 will be invited for a free mammogram every two years.  That is a very welcome development, which no doubt has saved many lives.  However, Councillor Costello, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 36, believes a free mammogram for all women over the age of 40 will save more lives.  I have no doubt she is correct in that.  Each year, 3,700 women are diagnosed with breast cancer.  Some 34% of them are aged between 50 and 69.  Councillor Costello knows what she is talking about.  She also runs the biggest cancer support group in the country, Breast Friends.  She is in no doubt that the rolling out of free mammograms for all women over the age of 40 will save lives and it is very hard to argue with that.

The N24 will be the most important national roads project to be delivered in the years ahead and will serve to link all our five cities.  That is why I am proud that I and Fine Gael colleagues in neighbouring counties, Wexford, Kilkenny, Tipperary and Limerick, advocated strongly for the retention of the N24 in the plan.  The NPF states we should have interurban travel of, on average, speeds of 90 km\/h.  I feel the only way that can be achieved is by having a dual carriageway between Limerick and Waterford.<\/p><p>On public transportation, it is fantastic to see the commitment in the plan to the funding of projects that will emerge from the new Waterford metropolitan transport strategy, which is at a preliminary design stage.  I would like this to be expedited.  It is positive to see the extension of the award-winning Waterford greenway to New Ross and the inclusion of a new Plunkett station as part of the North Quays transportation hub reinforced in the plan.

It is overdue.  We need that investment in public transport.  Obviously, however, none of these things are easy.  When it comes to something like the permanent closure of level crossings, that brings disruption to communities.  Part of the brief to Irish Rail is to automatically close the level crossings as part of the process, as opposed to trying to make them automatic.  This is something that will become part of the other parts of DART+ as well, because we are told that it will happen not just in DART+ West but also in the other parts of DART+.  It is as if Irish Rail is operating with one hand tied behind its back.  Obviously, the best approach is to find an alternative route if it is closing down a road, but sometimes that is not viable as the infrastructure is too invasive.  Even then, if it kept the level crossings open at non-peak times, it will still have to find other alternatives.  However, it should still be on the table.

I see everyone wearing pink, ranging from the Cathaoirleach's pink tie to the pink ribbons to the pink or salmon shirts, I am not sure which.  It is great and it is lovely to see it.  I thank everyone for their support.  Every family in Ireland is affected by loss and by breast cancer, so it is very important.<\/p> <p>I welcome the launch of the &euro;165 billion national development plan, the largest budget ever.  There is a focus on investment in hospitals, residential units, schools, housing, roads, cycle ways and public transport.  The &euro;200 million N5 Ballaghaderreen to Scramoge project is one of the three that have been highlighted in the list, which is very welcome in terms of it progressing very quickly.  Yes, we need more acute hospital spaces, as has been mentioned by my colleagues.  We will see this happen in my area with a 50-bed unit in Portiuncula University Hospital as well as a stage 1 process for a new rehabilitation unit in Roscommon University Hospital and a 50-bed unit for the Sacred Heart Hospital and Care Home.  These projects are listed as ongoing and in progress under the NDP and will be progressed to completion in the next couple of years.  There is also over &euro;9 billion for an urban regeneration project in Roscommon.  The roads are being dug up at present in Main Street and The Square.  There is also the Ballaghaderreen public enhancement project.  All these projects require funding and a budget for capital investment.  That is what the Government has committed to in the years ahead.<\/p> <p>Separately, I wish to mention that day services in Ballinasloe are reopening this week.  That is absolutely crucial because many older people depend on this service.  It provides a respite for carers and a day of activity and engagement with friends.  People have not had that service for over 18 months.  This week the service returned and there is great excitement.  People can hear the sound of laughter and music and can engage in playing cards, doing exercise programmes and in individual care plans.  Life is coming back to normal and that is wonderful.  I thank the more than 40 volunteers in Ballinasloe Social Services and the board and committee there that have to do fundraising because the budget never meets all the needs within the service.  I thank the manager, Ms Teresa Coughlan, who has done great work in reopening yesterday.  There will be great excitement this week.  The service covers areas in south Roscommon, Ballinasloe, Clontuskert, Lawrencetown, Taghmaconnell and Moore.  It is a great service and we welcome it back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#Y00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>This week we are focusing on some of the huge infrastructure projects the Government is planning, and I welcome the news about them.  However, I also look at how they will be implemented and how much regard will be had to the views of local communities in respect of those projects.  There appears to be a crisis in our local government, both in terms of the powers of councillors to do the jobs they must do locally and the resources that are available for the local authorities.  Given that so many Members of this House are directly connected to councillors around the country, it is appropriate that we have a debate on those issues.<\/p> <p>Looking forward, the strategic housing development, SHD, legislation is going to be wound up and, as far as I am concerned, that cannot come soon enough.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->SHDs are an example of how we as a central Government have bypassed our local authorities and local authority members.  For example, I was at a meeting in the last week on the development at Baker's Corner pub near where I grew up.  That is undoubtedly a good development but there are aspects of it that will bypass the county council and go directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, costing every resident who wants to make a submission &euro;20.  At the same time, the regulator is saying there needs to be more investment and that fees have not gone up.  This already costs people huge amounts of money.<\/p><p>When we talk about Europe we talk about subsidiarity and the principle that we should devolve decision-making as much as possible.  We have done the opposite with local government in Ireland.  We have centralised and stripped powers away from local government, particularly from local authority elected members.  They are the hardest working elected representatives in this country and the worst looked after in their pay and resources.  In the last 20 years we have seen a successive stripping away of their powers and it is a crisis of local democracy.  If we do not trust them to do their job, how can we expect the populace to have faith in them and invest in that local government?  We need to have a debate on this and we need to bring steps forward to restore confidence in our elected local representatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#Y00300","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank colleagues for the variety of topics that have been raised.  Senator Ward has outlined the mistakes that we have made as a State over many years by centralising too much.  One can see how unsuccessful it has been in our health service delivery and in how we are now unravelling and unwinding it and going back to regionalisation.  The Government acknowledged last year that the SHD process was an unmitigated disaster and we are going back to the way we know how to do things well.  That is empowering our local politicians.  We also need public consultation with local citizens on the changes that make an impact on their lives.  We need to have that proper communications process and we see it working well with TII, as Senator Carrigy mentioned.  I will ask for a debate on that unravelling and the new process that will replace the SHD process.<\/p> <p>Senator Ward and other colleagues have highlighted the importance of restating the State's intention to deliver on major infrastructural projects with the second iteration of Project Ireland 2040 being announced by Government yesterday.  As the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform detailed, it is &euro;165 billion, which is the largest amount of money that has ever been put behind a national development plan.  As one of our colleagues mentioned this morning, &euro;11.4 billion of that is allocated for public transport investment.  If MetroLink is going to cost &euro;10 billion it does not leave an awful lot for the rest of the country.  We could probably put triple the amount of money into the national development plan and still have people giving out that there is no money associated with particular projects that we all care about.  It is a rolling project and something we are proud of.  It is the continuing investment by the State into making people's lives better and providing them with services.  I acknowledge and thank all the colleagues who have raised that this morning.<\/p> <p>Senator Dolan talked about life slowly returning to normal and I am happy that those day services in Ballinasloe are reopening.  Senator O'Loughlin is the chair of our cross-party Oireachtas group on Alzheimer's disease and dementia and I thank her for the presentation last week of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland's pre-budget submissions.  Life is starting to return to normal for those people who rely on the provision of day services.  I mention the huge amount of services that are provided, not necessarily by the State but by private organisations and I know only too well how fantastic the Alzheimer Society of Ireland is.  It is good to see that life is coming back to normal.<\/p> <p>Senator Currie mentioned that the DART+ West public consultation process is closing tomorrow.  Along with her I would encourage all of the citizens concerned to have their say because changes will be made and we want that to be done while empowering the people whose lives will be impacted by those changes.<\/p> <p>Senators Maria Byrne and Gavan talked about the need for a debate on University Hospital Limerick and such a debate is required.  I would contest one point; there has been significant investment in Limerick over the last ten years although clearly not enough investment has been made.  Some 96 new beds and a major extension have gone in but there is a need for a debate on what is needed now and what will be needed in the short term.  I will try to arrange that as quickly as possible.  It is nice to see colleagues from the same locality agreeing for a change.<\/p> <p>From Senator Maria Byrne's perspective, I also want to acknowledge the concern around what seems to be the downgrading of the N20 and M20.  That needs explanation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If the expected plans for the Limerick-Cork project have changed, they need to be brought to the attention of all the people who will be affected by that.  I will convey that message to the Minister for the Senator.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer sought a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the One-China policy.  I will ask for that debate.  The Minister will be in the House this evening and next Wednesday evening.  The debate sought is important, particularly given the events of the past week or ten days.  I will again ask for that debate and come back to the Senator on it.<\/p><p>Senator O'Sullivan spoke of &euro;3.5 billion that is the mainstay of the Taoiseach's shared island initiative and the investment across the shared island, which is important.  I will ask the T&aacute;naiste for a update for the Senator on the task force for the Shannon Estuary.<\/p><p>Senator Cummins raised the issue of the &euro;11.6 billion for new public transport and &euro;5.8 billion for new roads.  Senator Gallagher asked for a letter to be sent to the Minister for Health seeking free mammograms for all women over the age of 40.  I will put that letter in the post on behalf of all of us today.  I will let the Senator know when I get a response.<\/p><p>Senator Gavan, among others, spoke of St. Brigid&rsquo;s Day.  Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin spoke about it when opening our proceedings today.  When I was a child my primary school was St. Brigid&rsquo;s National Holy Faith Convent School.  I do not remember that she was from Kildare but I remember always thinking that she was ours.  I grew up in Finglas and the Senator grew up in Kildare but St. Brigid belongs to all of us from every county in every part of the country.  I hope we settle on St. Brigid&rsquo;s Day for the new bank holiday.  Regardless of whether we call it Brigid&rsquo;s Day or St. Brigid&rsquo;s Day, we all know the important role she played.<\/p><p>Senators Carrigy and Fitzpatrick raised the issue of the anti-social behaviour and its prevalence not only in Dublin.  The prevalence of the issue in Dublin was raised in the House a number of times in recent weeks.  We saw from the television coverage last night that it is prevalent in Limerick, Cork, Galway and in many of our urban centres.  My son, who is only 22 years of age, emigrated to Berlin in June and is home at the moment.  He went out socialising at the weekend and when he came home yesterday evening he told me it is nearly impossible not to get involved in a fight in Dublin city because of the number of people who come into the city specifically and solely looking to either involve themselves in or cause trouble.  It is bizarre that our young people have nothing else to do except find their entertainment in that way, shape or form.  A number of colleagues sought a debate on this issue last week.  I think we need a new task force on policing not only in Dublin but in many of our urban centres to adopt a specific response to this new type of entertainment.  We opened our streets in the past year because we did not have anywhere else for people to entertain themselves but it certainly was not with the hope that this would be the result.   I will bring that message back to the Minister for Justice.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell, as he has on a number of occasions, spoke passionately about a topic he really cares about and believes in.  I can do no more than bring the concerns he raised again this morning back to the Minister and ask for a response.  I will go one step further and phone the Minister today.  The matters the Senator highlighted, particularly in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report in recent days, require a response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#Z00200","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#AA00200","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>If it is not necessarily in a debate form, they definitely require a response.

He was right in stating support for the film industry needs to be highlighted in the budget that will be presented next Tuesday.  Senator Carrigy also mentioned this issue.  Those in the industry have had a devastating number of years.  They provide every section of society with entertainment.  They definitely need to be supported by way of tax measures next week.<\/p> <p>I applaud Senator Clifford-Lee on the pairing arrangement she entered into with our colleague, Senator Flynn.  It is something that should not be understated.  It is an important arrangement and an enormous gesture but we should not need gestures.  We should have proper arrangements in order that women and men can take maternity and paternity leave.  It is long past time for moaning and nagging about it.  We should have it in every walk of society, every part of political life and every part of our working lives.  It should be taken for granted that a woman when she has a baby can spend time at home with the baby and a man when his wife or partner has a baby can stay at home and bond that family relationship.  On behalf of all of us, I extend Eileen and Liam heartiest congratulations on baby Lacey&rsquo;s safe arrival.  I know Eileen had a tough couple of months.  I have no doubt that Billie will be a great big sister.  I wish them well.<\/p> <p>Senator Wall spoke about St. Brigid's Day and also called for a debate on housing.  The debate we had on housing last Wednesday was adjourned rather than concluded.

He is also looking for a debate on the Northern Ireland protocol.  He raised this last week and I was able to text him later to say that the Taoiseach will come to the Seanad on 4 November to have a debate on that and to take statements from us.  A very important part of the Taoiseach's proposals and programme is the shared island initiative, and I think the input of the Northern Ireland protocol to the prosperity and the increase in business between North and South will form part of his statement.  We could probably have a debate on the Northern Ireland protocol separate from the debate with the Taoiseach.  I will follow up on that for the Senator today.<\/p><p>Senator Garvey talked about the rent price increase in Clare being at 16.1%, which is off the wall, and the requirement for rent pressure zones.  That will probably form part of the debate with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage when he comes back to the House.  I will let the Senator know the date of that engagement as soon as I can.<\/p><p>Senator Keogan talked about child safeguarding in schools and the policies arising from instances that have been brought to her attention.  I can speak about this only because when I was Minister for Social Protection - and it is that Department, for some reason, the gender recognition legislation sits under, not the Departments of Health or Education - there was a review of the 2015 legislation done, independently commissioned by the Minister at the time, who just happened to be me.  There were quite a number of recommendations arising from that review as to how to update the 2015 legislation, but, unfortunately, I do not believe anything has happened on that since then.  I might send a letter on our behalf to ask the Minister the current status of the recommendations and when new legislation will come that will provide safeguarding and guidelines to everybody who deals with children, whether schools, sports clubs or hospitals.  I will follow up on that for the Senator today.<\/p><p>Senator Ahearn opened this morning with the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, extending T&uacute;s and the CE scheme, which is welcome.  Things have not been normal for those workers since the onset of the pandemic.  Therefore, they have not been able to learn and be mentored in the way they would normally be, so it is a  welcome extension.  The Senator also talked about the issue of work permits.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, was here this morning and last week discussing work permits and the pilot scheme he is trying to get off the ground.  The issue is probably not unique to the hospitality sector because our horticulture, agriculture and farming sectors are crying out for workers.  There is food being left in the ground because they do not have anybody to pick it, which is crazy.  Whatever red tape is there, we need to cut through it to make sure we have food security and staff for the industries that are only trying to get back on their feet.<\/p><p>Senator O'Loughlin started by mentioning, as did other colleagues, the fact that October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  We wear our pink with pride and in solidarity with the women we have lost and the women who are still fighting, and fight they will continue.  Senator Gallagher's suggestion to try to decrease the age by which women in Ireland get mammograms is a welcome initiative, and I will send that letter off.  We will wear our pink and wear it proud.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#AA00500","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1633440600,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Report of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action: Motion","time":1633440600,"counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#BB00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1633440600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat Seanad &Eacute;ireann:  \t(1) notes the agreed Report of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action under Seanad Standing Order 116 on COM(2021) 551, 554, 555, 557, 558 and 568 &ndash; Legislative proposals of the EU &lsquo;Fit for 55&rsquo; package, which was laid before Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 28th September, 2021, in accordance with Standing Order 116(3)(b);<br \/><br \/>(2) having regard to the aforementioned Report, and in exercise of its functions under section 7(3) of the European Union Act 2009, is of the opinion that the proposals COM(2021) 551, 554, 555, 557, 558 and 568 do not comply with the principle of subsidiarity for the reasons set out in paragraph 3 of the Report; and<br \/><br \/>(3) notes that, pursuant to Standing Order 116(4), a copy of this Resolution together with the reasoned opinion and the aforementioned Report shall be sent to the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021100500002#BB00400","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1633440600,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1633440600,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.44 p.m. and resumed at 5 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
