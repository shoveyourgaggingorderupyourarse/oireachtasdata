We will have a presentation this afternoon from representatives of Tusla.  I welcome CEO, Mr. Fred McBride, chief operations officer, Mr. Jim Gibson, director of transformation and policy, Mr. Cormac Quinlan, service director, Dr. Aisling Gillen and service director for Dublin and the mid-Leinster area, Ms Patricia Finlay.  I thank them for coming here this afternoon at short notice.  The committee is also grateful to the witnesses for agreeing to a shorter meeting this afternoon.  I also welcome members and viewers who may be watching these proceedings on Oireachtas TV.<\/p><p>Before we commence and in accordance with procedure, I am required to draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.<\/p><p>They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p> I remind members to switch off their mobile phones - which I forgot to do - because it will interfere with the sound systems.  It affects the ability of the parliamentary reporters to record what people are saying.  It makes it hard for people watching or listening at home to pick up what is being said.<\/p><p> I advise witnesses that submissions or opening statements they have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  After the presentations, there will be a series of questions from members for approximately one hour and 50 minutes until 4 o'clock.<\/p><p> The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss HIQA's report and the investigation into the management of allegations of child sex abuse against adults of concern by the Child and Family Agency upon the direction of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The report arose from the RT&Eacute; \"Prime Time\" programme which revealed that Tusla had sent notification to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, containing a false allegation of child sex abuse against a Garda whistleblower, Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  In light of these circumstances and concern about more systematic issues that might require a response at national level, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, instructed HIQA to carry out a statutory investigation under the Health Act 2007.  The HIQA board approved this investigation which began in March 2017.<\/p><p> The investigation report was published yesterday and made a number of recommendations to improve safety, quality and standards of services provided by Tusla regarding referrals of allegation of child abuse involving adults of concern.<\/p><p> As Chairman, I take the opportunity to thank HIQA for the speed with which it dealt with this statutory inquiry.  To complete a statutory inquiry into such a large organisation in just under a year is no small feat.  I thank HIQA for its very significant input into the activities of Tusla and the policies surrounding it, underpinned by legislation passed by these Houses.<\/p><p> Before I invite Mr. McBride to make his opening statement, I note for the members the comprehensive document prepared by the secretariat and circulated to them.  If they have an opportunity, they should read it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#A00500","speaker":"1300","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to talk about the HIQA investigation and report.  We acknowledge and welcome the recommendations.  I also welcome HIQA&rsquo;s acknowledgement that there is now clear strategic direction and a long-term vision of what we want to achieve.  HIQA has made it clear and consistently stated both in this report and in other inspection reports that where a concern about a child is expressed to Tusla and we have information to indicate that the child is at immediate risk, the child gets an immediate response and that response is deemed to be protective and keeps them safe or reduces the risk.<\/p> <p>  HIQA also confirmed the consistent finding of Tusla staff advocating strongly for the children and families for whom it works.  They have shown a capacity to maintain good relationships and improve outcomes for children.  Of course, we receive 53,000 referrals a year.  We cannot possibly respond to 53,000 referrals immediately and therefore, of course, a degree of prioritisation must take place.  This HIQA report focuses on those referrals where it is not deemed that children are at immediate risk, how we prioritise these referrals and what action we take on them.<\/p> <p>  It was reassuring for us, albeit a very challenging read in the report, that the investigation report highlights exactly those issues faced by the agency which we had already identified and which we have been proactively addressing, mostly over the past two years.  I know the agency is four years old, but in the first two years we were really just trying to keep services going and it was not until 2016 that additional investment was made available to us - very welcome as it was - that we began to reflect on and analyse the work that needed to be done.  We embarked on a very comprehensive organisational cultural programme and reform.  One of the HIQA external advisers, to whom I spoke the other day, remarked that it was both an ambitious and a radical attempt to change child-protection services, which is what it is.<\/p> <p>  I point out some of the significant progress we have made since Tusla was established.  By 9 July we will have rolled out what we are calling the national childcare information system, an integrated computerised system.  This will mean that for the first time in this country all our 17 functional operational areas will be on one integrated IT system, which we hope will eliminate inconsistencies that previously occurred with a mixture of paper-based systems and a plethora of obsolete and outdated computer systems.<\/p> <p>  As the report acknowledged, we have been developing many interagency protocols to assist in working with key partners, particularly in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE.  The report also highlights, particularly in the governance review, that interagency and collaborative working was a consistent strength of Tusla, with many examples of children being safer as a result.<\/p> <p>  We have also invested considerable time and money in what we call our prevention, partnership and family-support programme, which supports families in their local communities with initiatives such as Parenting 24-7 and Meitheal.  We have developed the child protection notification system so that for children who are subject to a child protection plan there is live and accessible information available on a multiagency basis which the Garda, medical staff and accident and emergency units can access across the country.  In another first for the country, we now have an out-of-hours service that covers the whole country rather than just Dublin and Cork.<\/p> <p>  Despite that progress, I absolutely agree that there are inconsistencies in our system and in our response to referrals where a child is not identified as being at immediate risk, as highlighted by HIQA.  We are actively addressing this through our new national approach to practice.  The last time the members of the committee visited us in the Brunel building, they had an opportunity to see some of the detail of that national approach to practice, which we are callings Signs of Safety.  We are confident this will bring a consistency throughout the country so that children and families receive a consistent, timely and proportionate response.<\/p> <p>  We also accept HIQA's findings that we need to further improve our governance and accountability arrangements.  Some further key posts are required in that regard.  Accountability is about identifying problems and taking responsibility for these problems, understanding their causes and putting in place actions to remedy these.  That is exactly what we have been doing for the past two and a half years in particular, but also before that.<\/p> <p>  The agency is accountable to a board and, as I emphasised at the press conference yesterday, staff are held to account in a proportionate and fair way through robust HR procedures.<\/p> <p>  I wish to speak about the legislative context and we may get a chance to discuss it in more detail.  In particular I refer to the legislative context concerning retrospective and historical allegations of abuse.  That is where an adult comes forward now to say that something happened to them as a child.  We have been thrust into a space by case law, which places a responsibility on us to balance fair and due process for the person against whom the allegation has been made on the one hand and on the other hand trying to make an assessment of the risk to children now and what we need to do about that.  There are significant legal constraints around that and we may get an opportunity to explore some of that in more detail today.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, in the past two years we have reduced the number of unallocated retrospective allegations by approximately 60% which, by any industry standard, is a pretty reasonable improvement.  The pace of change has been rapid and I accept the Minister's supportive comments about what we have achieved so far.  We need to increase the pace of change and we look forward to the discussion with the oversight group the Minister intends to set up on how that increase in pace might be achieved.<\/p><p> We accept the recommendations that HIQA set out and see them as an endorsement of our programme of reform.  We undoubtedly have some way to go but we are actively addressing all the issues to ensure practice across the country is consistent and of a high quality in order that we can provide a timely, proportionate and appropriate response to children and families.  We acknowledge that quality is variable at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>As we have a substantial amount of time, I propose to allocate ten minutes to each member for questions and responses.

There is always a degree of unknown elements with 53,000 referrals a year.  Almost all of them - 98% or 99% - are screened, although they do not all move to an initial assessment.  Somebody looks a referral and decides whether immediate action needs to be taken.  HIQA acknowledges that, from the evidence it looked at, no child who needs an immediate response does not get one.  That is consistent with what we know ourselves because we respond immediately to children who are at immediate risk or in harm's way.  We monitor the cases which are waiting to be allocated and where the circumstances change, we look for any new information that comes in on these cases.  It is entirely possible that a child could be in harm's way without us knowing.  In the case of more than one third of unallocated cases, I would not even call them \"unallocated\" because they are being actively worked by our duty and intake teams.  It is simply that they do not have a single, dedicated social worker attached to them.  I realise and accept that having a duty team working cases is not ideal but I do not think it means they are unallocated.  That is a debatable point and I do not suggest I am absolutely correct in this regard but I am trying to provide nuance in this respect.<\/p> <p>  Other cases are monitored by the duty team and when there is any new information suggesting a case be given a higher priority, we do that.  We contact schools, we may visit a child at home and we talk to people in the community.  Can we always know there are no risks to children?  I am sorry but we cannot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>It is important to outline our service delivery design.  Before the agency was established, it was quite common for a community care area to have four or five points of contact to refer a matter relating to a child.  Within our service delivery framework, we now have dedicated contact points in each functional area of the Child and Family Agency.  As for the percentage split of referrals to the agency, 60% are for child welfare or children in need cases and 40% are child protection cases.<\/p> <p>  The system has become more sophisticated.  The HIQA investigative report was a point in time.  We have mentioned the prevention, partnership and family support, PPFS, programme.  In each area, we have a team that reads, evaluates and directs referrals.  For example, 1,300 staff and other members in the non-government sector have been trained in the Meitheal programme and there have been 1,409 requests.  There are 99 family support networks across Ireland that pick up and help families in need and early intervention and support such as this ensures these cases do not materialise as serious child protection concerns.<\/p> <p>  Some 28,500 children in Ireland have received a family support service and we are ramping the service up.  Every report and inquiry in Ireland concluded there was a dearth of family support services and early intervention programmes and we have worked exceptionally hard and tirelessly since our establishment, with the collaboration of Atlantic Philanthropies, which put &euro;10 million on the table for us, and with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and NUI Galway to develop this side of our business.  A research report will be provided in September, which will show the results of this work and really good outcomes for children in Ireland.  There are 53,000 referrals and they are not just about child protection but are about child welfare as well.  We try to get in early to resolve problems to support families and children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gibson"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I am utterly disillusioned after reading yesterday's report.

They used to be national panels run by the national recruitment service of the HSE.  For the first two years, we were entirely dependent on that system for recruitment.  I am absolutely clear it did not and does not meet our purposes or needs.  It is not quick enough and is too bureaucratic and inflexible.  Over the past two years, we have attempted to take back some degree of control at least over that process by setting up our own Tusla recruiting capacity.  Recently, we have taken back the social work panels from the national recruitment service and have set up regional arrangements for recruitment.<\/p> <p>  We have also been in touch with third level institutions and we have a third level liaison group.  Through universities and colleges, we are trying to promote Tusla as an employer of choice and ensure people get the support they need when they come to work.  We are trying to work with universities to ensure new graduates are as ready as they can be for the practice, albeit that everybody will need some support in his or her first two years.  I have also personally been to recruitment events outside Ireland trying to recruit social workers, particularly from the North and the UK.  Those are some of the actions we have taken.<\/p> <p>  We have also been looking at a retention strategy and we have been recruiting in large numbers.  The problem has been keeping hold of staff, to be frank.  We are looking at other measures, such as creating a senior practitioner grade, to try to encourage people to stay in practice.  Currently, career development often means moving into management and we want to give opportunities to people to stay in practice and be rewarded and recognised for their experience.  The turnover of social workers in the Republic of Ireland is 8.8% and in the UK it is 15%.  We have real problems but comparatively speaking, it is not quite as bad as other places.  We really need to work further on that in order to support people in doing this work.  We want people coming to Tusla who really want to do the work.  We cannot have people coming in because they need a job and would rather be working in the mental health, disability or probation areas.  I do not want that and we do not need cases where people stay for a short period and leave.  We need people who are dedicated to this area of social work and who really want to work with us and be supported.<\/p> <p>  We are also looking at our skills mix and we will have a workforce plan ready in the autumn that will describe the sort of mix we think we require.  It is not just all about social workers, as important as they are, particularly in the area of child sexual abuse.  We need qualified social workers to do that work.  Their work can be supported and supplemented by social care workers, family support workers and our very valuable administrative and clerical staff in order to free social workers to do what they need to.  That work is in train.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Is morale low among social workers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#D00300","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>It does not feed into the retention issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#D00500","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>No.  Members may wish to look at a recent survey done by Dr. Andrew Turnell, who is working with us on our Signs of Safety approach, and which had a reasonable return rate.

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also interviewed the child a number of times but the Director of Public Prosecutions did not proceed with prosecution.  The care order was granted and a UK forensic psychologist examined all the DVDs of these interviews and gave evidence on the grounds of credibility.

We appreciate it.  They have acknowledged the systemic failures that exist within Tusla as an organisation.  I do not intend it to be personal when I say that the people at the top of Tusla need to have a cold, hard look at the organisation based on this report.  Perhaps they are doing that.  It is too bad that we hear about the various instances that occur so regularly.  When we, as legislators, are discussing this matter with the witnesses today, we are seeking answers to our questions in order that the public can be somewhat reassured that the most vulnerable children in the State are being looked out for.  Is there a problem with the skills mix that needs to be resolved?  What can the witnesses say to reassure those who are tuning into today's proceedings?  Mr. McBride said at the outset that a child could be in harm's way without the knowledge of Tusla.  I accept that this can happen but I suggest that such cases should be exceptional.  Is that too much for us to expect from the organisation?  I understand why Mr. McBride wants to be realistic about what people can expect.

We can only know about what we find out about, what we are told about, what we see and what we observe.  There are children at risk in many families and situations in Ireland and Tusla and other State agencies do not necessarily know about them.  Sexual abuse, by its very nature, happens behind closed doors.  There are efforts within families and other extended networks to keep it secret.  I have to say that realistically, we cannot know about everything.  As HIQA has reported, when these matters come to our attention and we think there is an immediate risk or a child is immediately in harm's way, we respond immediately and we do something about it.  This report is about how we prioritise our response to cases involving children who are not at immediate risk and how we make sure that response is appropriate, sufficiently timely and proportionate.  While we should not overreact to something, equally seriously we should not under-react.  That is the best way I can answer the Senator's question.  I am trying to be honest and realistic.

As we said earlier, we receive 53,000 referrals each year.  We have 24,366 open cases in which there is a concern that children may be at risk.  I mention that to give the committee an idea of the volume of work we are doing.  As we have communicated on a regular basis, the unallocated cases represent the big concern for us as an agency.  It has been mentioned that the number of such cases has been driven down by 51% since 2014.  We recognise that approximately 4,700 cases are unallocated.  In some of those cases, we must try to define what the concern for the referral is.  It is really clear for our business.  If we get a referral about a child who will not wear his coat to school during the winter and his mother is really struggling with that, and at the same time, we get a referral about a young girl who has disclosed to her teacher that her father entered her bedroom and acted in a sexually inappropriate way, we will deal with the latter referral there and then.  We will sort that situation out there and then.  There are many referrals on our system in cases like that of the child who will not wear his coat.  As part of our national approach to practice, we are looking at such cases and drilling down into them.  As I said earlier when I was speaking about the prevention, partnership and family support programme, there is a place and a pathway for those children to go to.  We will look at the child who is not wearing a coat at some stage but not on the day on which the referral is received because our resources are finite.  We will deploy them where children are most at risk.

Systemic issues have been mentioned with particular reference to the screening exercise.  Screening has two main goals.  When we get a referral, we have to gather information, analyse it quickly and make a judgment on what we should do in respect of the matter.  Obviously, we check what information we already hold in respect of that family.  That is the task of screening.  One of the most important goals of screening is to identify children who are at immediate risk at that point in time and to respond to that.  It is stated clearly in the HIQA report and every other inspection report that we do this consistently well all of the time.  Beyond that, we look at what response is needed in other cases and how we prioritise those cases.  In 2015, when we reviewed our system to identify the problems with regard to screening and prioritisation, we identified that the existence of inconsistencies and delays in this respect was an issue for us.  Since February of this year, we have been applying the national approach to practice at the front door during the analysis stage.  This has allowed us to bring much better consistency and rigour to the process.  We know that gathering information, supplying good analysis and judgment and involving everyone in that process is really important in effective child protection systems.  As part of our efforts to embed that approach to practice at the front door, we have completed four pilot sites - one in each region around the country - since February of this year.  We are applying the methodology at the front door.  We are looking at unallocated cases in those areas and at new cases coming into the system.  Consultants are sitting beside social workers as they take calls.  They are supporting them in using the national approach to practice.  We are planning to roll out this piece of work across all the other areas by the end of this year.  It will help us to decide what we take in or do not take in.  It will help us to get the right service to the right child for the right reason.  We are embedding that.  During the work we have done to date, staff have been telling us that this approach is leading to more timely responses to priority cases and better analysis from the first call that is received.  When we have been doing this work, we have seen a 30% average reduction in non-allocated cases.  Relationship-based work is first and foremost when social workers are engaging with families and finding networks for children from the outset.  Safety planning is beginning earlier as well.  We are seeing real improvements in what is happening as part of the screening and prioritisation exercise.  New revised guidance for the entire service will come out of that work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Quinlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I should have pointed out that the ten minutes that are available to me include the time taken up by the witnesses' responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#E01100","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Apologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#E01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Quinlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>It might seem like I am cutting off the witnesses as they respond to me.

Tusla is dealing with many legacy issues.  This is affecting the reputation of the organisation.  It is incumbent on Tusla officials to address that.  Tusla is sometimes unfairly talked about or hammered for cases that arose before the organisation came into being.  Tusla has to deal with that.  Tusla should deal with that, try to explain where the problems have come from and what it is doing about them.  This is because it affects the morale of staff working in Tusla.  It affects the ability of the agency to recruit and retain staff.  It also affects public confidence in Tusla.  It is important to put out the message that many of these issues are legacy issues.  They are present in many other elements of our country and in various Departments.  That is unfortunate but it is a fact of life.  I am keen to see the agency do a little more to defend itself and articulate better what it is dealing with and why as well as how it intends to deal with those issues.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to staffing.  Clearly, Tusla does not have enough social workers.  When we had the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs before the committee this time last year, she was honest in saying that even with all the courses in third-level institutions being full and churning out qualified graduates, we are still playing catch-up.  We are far behind the level at which we need to be.<\/p> <p>  I accept Mr. McBride's comment to the effect that social workers are enthusiastic and committed.  I do not doubt that for a moment.  They have extremely heavy caseloads and are far beyond safe levels.  I have one specific question.  What is the average caseload for a social worker?  What is the recommended caseload for a social worker?  We may as well put out what exactly we are dealing with.<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to the alternatives to social workers and how we can use the budget if we cannot find the people we need now.  I know for a fact that social workers go home at the end of each day and then type up their own notes, send emails, stuff their own envelopes and post their own letters.  That is fine when they have the time to do it, but they do not most of the time.  When are we going to see administrative staff come online?  To me, it sounds like an immediate requirement.  Administrative staff should be in place now.  There should be a pool of administrative staff, with one secretary for every five social workers.  Something along those lines would work to take the stress off social workers in having to do the basic day-to-day administration.  That would free up time.  When will that come online?  A total of &euro;40 million has been allocated to Tusla this year.  I assume that we will have similar funding for next year, if not more.  What is it being spent on?  Where is the &euro;40 million being spent this year?  What is it going on?<\/p> <p>  Are there alternatives to social workers?  Obviously, prevention is far better than dealing with a child who needs to be taken from her home.  Early intervention is key.  What is Tusla doing around creative community alternatives to try to prevent children coming in to care in the first instance?  What is Tusla doing around addiction, counselling and parenting services?  There are basic things that should be done.  Do we need to go into a family home to help families to clean the house or to help the parent get the child to school in morning?  That may involve hiring a taxi.  That is basic stuff.  What level of funding is going into such work this year?  What level of funding will go into that work next year?  What additional services will Tusla bring on stream that will come under the umbrella of creative additional community alternatives?<\/p> <p>  Other issues arise in respect of early intervention.  What is the plan regarding family resource centres?  Are we going to open more of them?  Where will they be located?  Does Tulsa have enough funding to do that?  Does Tusla need more funding for that next year?  How much is Tusla spending on that this year?  What will Tusla spend on it next year?<\/p> <p>  Where are the pinch points in Tusla resources?  What does Tusla need?  Do we need to be putting pressure on the Minister and the Government for budget 2019?  We are moving into budget negotiations now.  I am also a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  We are now getting in submissions from the various sectors on what they are looking for.  What is Tusla specifically seeking in 2019?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#F00800","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>There are a range of helpful points and no one person can answer them all.

The Deputy asked a question about Tusla inheriting legacy issues.  She mentioned how, at times, we have been hammered for various things.  In many ways we welcome the opportunity to be here to talk about positive initiatives the agency is undertaking.  I am keen to mention something we can really be proud of as an agency.  The investigations and the work we are doing have found that we provide a child-centred service.  We are passionate about ensuring the voices of children and parents are heard in everything we do.  It is vital that their voices are heard in how we deliver services.  They can influence the way we work.<\/p> <p>  One example is that we have invested significantly in the training of staff with regard to child participation.  We are keen to ensure that, at all times, this is a cornerstone of our culture.  At present within Tusla we have 45 teams throughout the country.  These teams have been awarded an independent quality mark called the Investing in Children Membership Award.  Those responsible for the quality mark have independently verified that Tusla staff are doing really good strong child participatory work.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the caseload.  I have been a social worker and a social work manager.  A social worker may be allocated 12 children in care.  Of those 12 children in care, it may be that six are really settled in foster care.  They may be doing really well, going to school and may be really attached to their foster carers.  There may be no court work linked to such cases.  The social worker will have a role to visit the child and ensure that the placement is meeting the needs of the child in question.  In contrast, a social worker might have four children in the caseload who are in real difficulty and who have really strong presentation of trauma.  They may be presenting with complex needs.  Their foster carers or family may be really struggling.  Such cases may take far more time.  That is why we have brought in our caseload management system.  This something we are leading on throughout Europe with our caseload management system.  The idea is to provide a weighting to different types of cases.  We provide a reduced caseload weighting for our newer graduates.  Again, it is about retaining them and ensuring they have a manageable workload.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Finlay"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I wish to make a point of clarification.

Our social workers are now more mobile.  One wonders in this day and age why we did not have mobility earlier.  Social workers use all sorts of mobile device.  It means that they can do work, rather than sit for three hours doing very little while waiting for a case to be called in court.  Case recording was one of the issues highlighted by HIQA.  Social workers can visit families and type up case notes in their car or somewhere quiet which are immediately linked with the national child care information system, NCCIS.  Social workers have told us mobile technology has saved them between five and ten hours a week, which represents real progress.<\/p> <p>  Prevention has been mentioned.

As Mr. McBride said, I lead the prevention, partnership and family support programme.  Around 2013, within the Health Service Executive as it was at the time, we set out a question for ourselves and brought in people like the chief executive of Barnados, representatives of the Daughters of Charity and the chief executive of Pobal.  Senior managers in the HSE asked what was needed to really advance family support services.  As a result, our prevention, partnership and family support programme was born.  It comprises a number of strands.  Supporting parenting is the core business for all of us.  Our business is supporting parents across the continuum of care.  Sometimes it is providing top-up advice and support that we all need as parents.  That support leads to mandating in the supervision of parents in more difficulty, for example, at the top end of the continuum.  There is our corporate parenting piece, our children in care piece.  We act in <i>loco parentis<\/i>for over 6,000 children who are in the care of the State.  In identifying what supporting parents means across the continuum of care and the evidence that tells us how best to support them, parenting 24\/7 is a set of key messages based around four practitioners.  If one is working with parents across the life cycle of a child and in different circumstances, what do we need to think about?  For example, fathers matter.  When I sit in on a case conference, I must ensure the voice of the father is heard in the room also.  <br\/><br\/>My colleague has mentioned participation.  There is a strand of work associated with it.  We have trained 1,300 staff across the country in participatory practice with children and young people.  In such training the child is put at the centre of decision-making in their own lives.  Children are encouraged to be part of the decision-making process in how we design, develop, deliver and evaluate our services.  We have many such examples. <br\/><br\/>Another piece is our area-based approach - the prevention, partnership and family support programme.  As part of the continuum of services that Mr. Quinlan articulated, we have established within Tusla an early intervention pathway.  We have put in place senior managers for prevention, partnership and family support within the 17 area management structures.  Below them we have senior co-ordinators and co-ordinators who have established 99 child and family support networks across the country.  We operate Meitheal, our early identification of need and practical help tool.  We have many examples of parents who have stood out publicly.  One striking example of success is a non-national lady who came to the country with her husband.  Unfortunately, he left her with three very young children and no money.  She was living in a flat complex that was burned out and  ended up in homeless services, which was good because she ended up back in our services.  she has been part of the Meitheal process for the past two years.  When she came to the country, she could not speak English, but now she can.  Her children are doing well and she is accessing training and employment.<br\/><br\/>Our high prevention piece is our creative community alternative whereby we work very hard to keep in the community children who are on the edge of care and children who are in care.  That means that we view the child in the context of the family and the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aisling Gillen"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I am conscious that I am out of time.

They were not getting help from others and were going around to everyone.  We rolled out the scheme on seven sites and hope to expand to 17 next year.  We have achieved efficiencies within our budget to help us with the project.  If we can prevent children from leaving their families and communities, we will not have to spend a significant amount of money per week on private residential placements.<\/p> <p>  A couple of questions were asked about administration work.  The Deputy is right in saying social workers should not waste time doing filing, etc.  The national child care information system is pretty good and does a lot for social workers.  More importantly, Mr. McBride and I visited an area manager by the name of Caroline in north Dublin who told us that she spent the first three and half months of her current job working on appeals.  It is a fact that we have totally relied on the HSE for a significant period to perform all of these corporate functions, but we need to be self-sufficient.  We have stated this in documents and communications we have sent to the Department which supports our desire to be self-sufficient.  In order to succeed, we are building a regional business and administrative hub based around the service directors in which there will be expertise in managing freedom of information requests, replies to parliamentary questions and getting answers to Members in a more efficient way.  <\/p> <p>  Health and safety is another matter.  Tusla is a large organisation.  As our CEO has stated, we need to work within many frameworks and show that ours is a safe and consistent agency. <\/p> <p>  I want area managers to meet their principal social workers to analyse unallocated cases, referrals, the cases of children in care and support our staff in that work.  We have created administrative posts in the past two years at social work team level.  They need such support.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider the issue of foster care.  HIQA's inspection report identified that we fell down when it came to Garda vetting.  If we did not have everyone vetted in the three year cycle, ours was deemed not to be a safe and effective service.  Having a good administrative support process - a Garda vetting unit within Tusla - generated a significant improvement in that regard.  That is a good example of how administrative issues were dealt with by good and efficient measures. <\/p> <p>  Family resource centres have been mentioned.  We have spoken about the sad fact that children must tell their stories many times.  We are really good in Ireland in making assessments.  As an agency, we say a child only needs one assessment.  He or she then needs to receive therapeutic support.  As many as 11 more family resource centres are coming on stream.  I am totally responsible for the 6,130 children in the care of the State.  I am not saying they all need a therapeutic intervention, but a good number of them as a result of experiencing neglect and abuse.  We are building therapeutic hubs using our partnerships with the community and voluntary sector.  We have a pilot scheme operating in counties Waterford and Wexford which is working well and children are receiving support.  We want to support children in care.  In north Dublin there is a creative alternative community programme that supports children in foster care who present with challenging behaviours.<\/p><p>Foster carers need the correct supports.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gibson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Is the therapeutic hub in the family resource centre?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#H00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>If one looks at Dublin, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre has expertise in therapeutic interventions.

We had a discussion on 22 February 2017 when the witness appeared before the committee, and I read that report last night.  The need to integrate 17 IT systems was mentioned.  Many topics have been discussed already, so I am not going to discuss that issue again.<\/p> <p>   It was said that there was no electronic communication between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Does Tusla use email?  That is electronic communication.  Why did that not supersede letters or faxes?  I do not even put a fax number on my own literature any more because nobody uses fax machines, but I read, in the report I was given, that the precedent was set as post and faxes.  I understand that the systems are not integrated and a vanilla system is not in place.  Why were PDFs or spreadsheets not put on email so that an electronic record would have been available in the event of an audit carried out by the Garda or any other agency?  Why did that not take precedent over post or fax?  <\/p> <p>  I would appreciate some comments around HR and accountability.  There seems to have been a disjointed approach taken or some dysfunction in terms of how people applied themselves to their tasks, or indeed the process or model of how they were supposed to engage with their roles.  Who oversaw that?  Who was supposed to make sure that was done correctly?  I have read reports that suggested there was evidence of insufficient oversight to assure the executive and board of Tusla that staff members were adhering to the corporate procedures.  Who oversees that?  What part of the organisation makes sure that that actually happens?  Why is it so disjointed across the different sectors?  <\/p> <p>  It was mentioned that the electronic communication system will not be in place until 2019, but that the IT system will be available for use in July 2018.  We have been given emails.  Can the witness clarify that?  <\/p> <p>  In terms of recruitment of social workers, does Tusla have an outline of the recruitment process or model from end to end?  I do not expect the witnesses to articulate it orally, but if a copy of that could be provided to the committee it would be appreciated.  We want to know how many steps or processes a person has to go through in the recruitment chain, from end to end, and what other parts of the public service are involved.  That information would give us an impression of whether the process is too laborious or too long, leading to people dropping out of it.  It would also be good to know if any statistics have been collected around people dropping out of the recruitment process.  Where do they fall out of the process?  Does it represent 60%, 70% or 80%?  Given studies from overseas or in the UK, has Tusla carried out any studies around the blockages in recruitment been carried out?  It would be good to know why people will not come to the Republic of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#H00400","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I am not sure if HIQA was referring to email communication.

This is about modernising that process.  I do not want to speak about another State agency.  I accept what the Deputy has said, and agree that we need to modernise.  We have made one big step in that regard with our integrated childcare system.  If we get a referral or mandated report through the new portal it automatically drops down to the region and area where the report originated.  We had three members of staff working in our IT department until recently.  We did not even have a director of ICT until six months ago.  We are now building that capacity.  This is about modernisation, and being able to track information and communication between staff and between our agency and other agencies.  We have to deal with it.<\/p> <p>  The connection with the Garda PULSE system is possible, but there are some problems that have to be resolved from an IT, technical and information - data protection - perspective.  It will happen, but it will take time.  We are now using smart equipment, and the level of change we have seen has been significant for an agency that had many different types of databases in 32 areas.  Those 32 areas shrunk to 17 areas when Tusla was established, which was a significant challenge for the agency.  On 9 July every functional area in Tusla will be connected, which will ensure stronger oversight.  That system allows me, as a manager of a social work team, to look at all of the work going on in that team by all of the social workers.  <\/p> <p>  One of the issues mentioned by HIQA in its report was that we were quite slow to identify poor practice or concern about poor practice.  I am the team leader and I, the principal or the CEO, if he or she wishes, can take that helicopter-like overview of the system.  It can be clearly seen where someone is not recording things, and records which do not show good practice or incidents where a child-centred approach is not taken can easily be identified.  That has really modernised matters for us.  We are on a roll in terms of modernisation, and as one of the Deputies has said, we are aware that we are dealing with legacy issues.  The modernisation of the system was a huge legacy issue for us.  We are modernising now.  We only give laptops to professional people now.<\/p><p>We do not give them desktops because they are mobile.  We also supplement that with smartphones.  They are connected to their system now, wherever they are.  That is a huge thing.  The next piece is the direct work with children.  Our director is looking at apps that directly engage with children.  Children do not want to sit and talk to somebody.  They want a mechanism.  On the laptop, we will have apps to do direct work with children.  We are mid-stream in this modernisation and we are going in the right direction.<\/p><p> I email lots of people across the country in different agencies in my role as chief operations officer.  The traditional communication of Garda notifications was by letter and still is but now we are seeing them coming through in our portal.  I think in the last report, there were over 300 Garda-mandated reports that had come through the portal.  We can clarify the figures and give them to the committee.

To be clear, retrospective abuse is when a person comes forward today and alleges they were abused in the past, when they were a child, and they are concerned that the person who abused them may be in contact with children today.  Our obligation is to try to identify the child today who might be at risk from that individual.  When we have an identified child and reasonable grounds to suspect that he or she might be at risk, of course we intervene in the situation and such children go up on our system like any other child referred to our service today.<\/p> <p>  The secondary issue is that when we have this information, this person might, for example, be in a position of employment where they are working with children or might be part of a youth club.  Since the enactment of the legislation, case law has made the interpretation that we have a responsibility to proactively protect children who might be at risk from this person.  In doing so, our obligation is to share relevant information with relevant third parties so that they can make a protective decision.  We are obliged to consider sharing the information with a school authority, for example, so that it can take protective action against that person in the contact they have with children.<\/p> <p>  In order to share that soft information, as the Deputy can imagine, we have to have a standard of proof.  That is what the court has asked us to ensure.  We have to provide an evidential basis in order to be able to share such information because it affects a person's constitutional rights to employment and his or her good name.  That is where the legislation is weak, as we have pointed out.  We have a clear responsibility but the legislation does not give us authority.  If a victim comes forward today and has a concern, they are normally traumatised and upset.  They may begin to disclose with us and then step away from the process because of the hurt and harm it causes.  We do not have any ability to compel them to come back and speak with us or any powers to compel the person against whom allegation of abuse is being made to come and speak to us.  We are working with a responsibility but without powers of obligation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#J02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Quinlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1529499600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Reading between the lines, Mr. Quinlan is saying that the legislation is weak and it needs updating or strengthening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018062000002#K00100","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529499600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>We welcome the Minister's reference in her statement to the progression of proposals with the Department of Justice and Equality.

We appointed a national lead and regional leads for the national service improvement plan.  As of today, we have allocated all but 103 of those cases.  People get very concerned when they hear of retrospective abuse cases and so on.  Some of the analysis bears out what Mr. Quinlan said in terms of social workers having all of the responsibility without any clear authority.  It should not be forgotten that adults who have experienced an abusive life experience as a child find that incredibly difficult, painful and hurtful.  At times, they come, but pull back.  Our language is really important.  These are complainants.  They are making a disclosure, but they are making a disclosure about a criminal act perpetrated against them.  As stated by Mr. Quinlan, in 71% of retrospective cases we do not get past stage one because the complainants find it hard to tell their story to the extent that gives us sufficient information to progress to stage two.  The 71% relates to cases in the South in respect of which we analysed the work.

The themes identified in those cases include a delay in follow up and queries around timelines in terms of completion of work.  In our review we found that among the reasons for those delays was the complainant being unable to come and talk to us and additional work being necessary to get the complainant to come and tell his or her story about the disclosure.  This is an extremely difficult process for a person.  Very often he or she will have been working with a counsellor or psychiatrist for years to try to come to the point of telling us that story.  As these are retrospective cases, very often dating back 20 or 30 years ago, finding the person subject to the abuse allegation can be difficult.

How big is the problem in attracting staff?  How hard is it to get staff into the agency?  Deputy Chambers touched on this briefly but is there a need for more administrative staff?  I do not know if the agency gave a commitment to start recruiting administrative staff.  The biggest workload for social workers is administration.  Looking at this HIQA report it appears that we are back to square one with bad record keeping.  There appears to be a pattern here so perhaps the witnesses will address the question of how big an issue is staffing.  They should be honest and up-front about it.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to refer to training.  HIQA said in its report that it did not find any strong evidence of effective staff training and development.  That is alarming.  Has a review of the skills sets of staff in Tusla been undertaken to date?  What opportunities for upskilling are available to staff members?

It is difficult to recruit in terms of social work because there are only so many graduates each year and we are in competition with other agencies such as the HSE, the community and voluntary sector, the Probation Service and so forth.  I outlined earlier some of the more creative measures we are trying to put in place to recruit staff and to retain staff.  Regarding how big an issue it is, at present we have 246 social work vacancies and there is ongoing recruitment to try to recruit for them.  However, there are 156 agency staff filling some of these posts so there is a balance of 90 for which there is ongoing recruitment.  While there are 246 vacancies, we are not always good at explaining the fact that agency staff are covering a significant proportion of those posts.  Agency staff can up and leave but we have in place a plan to convert the agency staff into three year fixed-term contracts to provide some stability.  That is roughly the position with recruitment.<\/p> <p>  As we mentioned already, administrative staff are very much part of the plan and part of the considerations for changing and improving the skills mix.  It not always about getting in social workers, but also front-line professionals such as social care workers and family support workers and the administrative staff to support them.  We can provide separately a breakdown of the number of staff we are recruiting by grade if the Deputy wishes.<\/p> <p>  On staff training and development, some time ago we launched our continuous professional development strategy and as part of that we are doing training needs analyses.  People will have personal development plans as a result of that - it is not all in place yet - which will contain their training and development needs on an individual basis for the future.  Signs of Safety is the national approach to practise and we have trained about 1,200 of 1,500 social workers on this new approach.

There are many mature professional people in the community and voluntary sector who would like to follow a career in social work but due to their financial and family commitments cannot go off to college for four years to do a masters degree.  We welcome the recommendation in the report on the high level group to examine this issue.  If I could ask a training university to develop a course that would allow our staff to go on block release but remain in employment we would get two things - we would get people who are committed to our agency and want to remain in our agency and we would also invest in their professional development through professional qualification.  We need to move quickly on that to bolster our staff.  The demand is outstripping the supply in Ireland at present.  We do not train enough social workers.  There are other avenues for social workers to go to now in disability, elderly and mental health services.  We are in competition with them.

We are putting in local mechanisms and oversight groups to ensure that when a policy lands, it is implemented consistently.  We are also trying to keep our policies to a minimum.

When this occurs, one is not able to take the matter any further.  Ms Finlay has given some indication of some of the reasons we cannot progress things, one being that the disclosure is insufficiently detailed.

However, as the organisation with statutory responsibility to regulate, promote, encourage and foster the maintenance of high standards and good practice in the delivery of mental health services, we are disappointed that it has taken so long for this opportunity to meet with the committee.<\/p> <p>  The principal function of the commission is to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to take all reasonable steps to protect the interests of persons detained in approved centres under the Act.<\/p> <p>  Recently, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provided for the establishment of the decision support service, DSS, within the commission as part of a new legal framework that reforms the law relating to the treatment of people who require or who may shortly require assistance in exercising their decision- making capacity, therefore, it expands the functions of the commission beyond mental health.  The DSS forms a key part of the new legal framework for both the provision of information and the regulation of the diverse forms of assisted decision making arrangements.<\/p> <p>  In the past couple of years, the commission has continued to emphasise the human rights of mental health service users across all of its core functions.  All service users should be involved in decisions about their care and be supported to exercise their legal capacity.  Mental health service users should not be subjected to undue restrictions and should have access to basic general health services.  Residents should have access to adequate living standards in inpatient settings where their privacy and dignity is respected at all times.  These basic rights should be assumed in any modern mental health service and is a minimum we would expect for ourselves, our family and our loved ones.  Furthermore, people who use mental health services need to be afforded the same rights as those who use general health services.  <\/p> <p>  The commission registers, inspects and regulates mental health services delivered through approved centres.  Over many years of activity, a number of core issues have emerged.  These include the inappropriate admission of children into adult mental health inpatient services; inadequate staffing and variable funding in community child and adolescent mental health services, leading to unacceptable waiting times and forcing young people into emergency services; the continuing inability of some services to put in place an individualised care plan and therapeutic programme, which are the corner stones of a recovery focused, person centred service as per our national policy; the widespread use of restrictive practices such as seclusion and physical restraint as a normalised behaviour in services, which lack sufficient numbers of staff and-or appropriately trained staff; the fundamental and careless lack of attention to basic issues such as dirty and dilapidated premises, which do not ensure adequate privacy and where there has been a disappointing drop in compliance from already low levels; and the provision of services to vulnerable people with long-term mental illness who are accommodated in 24-hour community residences that are not subject to regulatory oversight.<\/p> <p>  In the view of the commission there is a glaring and inconsistent pattern of standards in service provision.  The lack of any real progress and commitment on these matters undermines the fundamental human rights of those people who use mental healthcare services.<\/p> <p>  Due to a failure of Government to update the statutory powers of the commission, more people are now using unregulated mental healthcare services, that is, services outside the approved centres, which leads to a significant risk of neglect and abusive incidents occurring.<\/p> <p>  The commission is calling on the Government, with the Health Service Executive as the statutory provider of services, to initiate a major transformation programme to deal with the service issues highlighted by the commission.<\/p> <p>  Reform of the 2001 Mental Health Act is urgently needed and the commission urges the Department of Health to take heed of our commentary in this area to ensure that the provision and regulation of a modern mental health service in Ireland is the norm.  If that does not happen, Ireland will continue to provide a level of unsafe and substandard services which are not aligned to best practice and, as stated, breach the fundamental rights of vulnerable people who require such services.<\/p> <p>  The commission notes the continued endeavours of the Government, the statutory and independent service providers and the voluntary sector in the implementation of A Vision for Change.  The commission has repeatedly indicated that much needs to be done to ensure the delivery of consistent, timely and high-quality services in all geographic regions and across the full range of clinical programmes and age groups.<\/p><p>The Commission is aware of a review group established to consider progress in the implementation of <i>A Vision for Change<\/i>.  However, the Mental Health Commission has not received any formal communication from the Department of Health in this matter.  This is a grave cause of concern, given the statutory role of the Mental Health Commission in overseeing quality in mental health care services.<br\/><br\/>The Commission welcomes the almost annual &euro;35 million budget allocation for spending on additional mental health care services.  The Commission is cognisant that the current level of expenditure on mental health as a proportion of overall health expenditure is still less than the 8.24% target envisaged in <i>A Vision for Change<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The Commission is also conscious of the continued difficulties in maintaining and increasing staffing levels in mental health care services.  From its inspections, it is aware that this has a significant effect on the quality and quantity of services that can be provided.  Given the labour-intensive nature of mental health care, it is imperative that this matter is addressed urgently to achieve full staffing across the mental health care services.<br\/><br\/>Since its establishment, the Commission has seen significant changes in the provision of services, but challenges remain in the delivery of high quality recovery-oriented services.  Although the Commission believes that staff understand the concept of recovery, it is not evident that this translates into recovery-focused care, particularly in the development of individual care plans.  It is concerning that while compliance has increased, just a small minority of approved centres had individual care plans that were recovery-oriented, with strong service user involvement and multi-disciplinary inputs.<br\/><br\/>The Commission is of the view that there needs to be an emphasis on changing the corporate culture in the mental health services to bring about the required systematic shift towards recovery in service provision.  In this regard, it will continue to focus on the need for individualised, recovery-oriented services that place service users and families at the centre of activity.<br\/><br\/>In respect of involuntary admissions, there were 2,337 involuntary admissions in 2017 compared to 2,414 in 2016, representing a slight decrease.  We are pleased to note that over many years there has been a decline in the number of families involved in referring people to involuntary detention, and this is welcome.  Their involvement still stands at 44% and we hope that in the future this figure will be driven down further.<br\/><br\/>In respect of community residences, the Commission continues to have concerns about 24-hour staffed community residences, which are providing care to a large cohort of vulnerable people with long-term mental illness.  The residences have been found to be accommodating too many people, to have poor physical infrastructure, to be institutional in nature and to lack individual care plans.  A major issue is that the residences are not regulated.  Although the Mental Health Act permits the inspector to visit and inspect &quot;any other premises where mental health services are being provided&quot;, community residences are not subject to regulation by the Commission.<br\/><br\/>We are currently undertaking a three-year programme and the inspection of 43 residences in 2017 has already been published.  Once again, this report highlighted glaring issues around the size of the residences, the limitation of staffing, the absence of privacy and space, the poor repair of buildings and the degree of institutional care provided in these homes.<br\/><br\/>Many of those living in 24-hour residences are ex-patients of the large institutions closed over the past 20 years.  This is a vulnerable population, and the emerging patterns from the inspections is that they are a forgotten group of people who are living their lives in unsatisfactory conditions.<br\/><br\/>It is recommended in the Report of the Expert Group on the Review of the Mental Health Act 2001 that community services should be registered and inspected.  The Commission is of the view that the regulation of 24-hour staffed community residences must be prioritised as a matter of urgency.<br\/><br\/>A most unsatisfactory situation still prevails, whereby children are being admitted to adult inpatient units.  There were 82 such admissions to 19 units in 2017 compared to 68 in 2016.  The admission of any child to an adult service is unsatisfactory.  A contributory factor to the continued admission of children to adult units is a shortage of operational beds in dedicated child units.  A significant influence is the inability of child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, units to admit children after hours thereby forcing admissions to adult care services.  This trend has been prevalent for many years and is not only an unsatisfactory situation for the child and his or her family but a clear breach of the human rights and dignity of the child.  This matter has been a concern to the Commission for many years.  It needs to be urgently addressed by the Government, the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, as the main provider.<br\/><br\/>In 2017, the Commission has also highlighted serious concerns in community child and adolescent mental health teams.  The inspector found these teams to be inadequately staffed and to have considerable variation in funding depending on their geographic region.  There was also a notable variation in waiting lists for CAMHS referrals and in the provision of emergency cover.  While CAMHS should be focused on children and young adults with severe mental illness, the staffing deficits in primary care have meant that children and young adults with mild and moderate mental illness are also reliant on CAMHS services.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, the Commission is concerned that there are serious human rights issues to be addressed in relation to the admission of children to adult services and the shortage of operational beds for young service users.  Additionally, the Commission is concerned about the long waiting times for those children referred to child and adolescent mental health services.  It is particularly concerned about the 1,300 vulnerable people with long-term mental illness who are accommodated in 24-hour community residences that are not subject to regulatory oversight.<br\/><br\/>Fundamentals in in-patient settings, such as individual care plans, privacy, the provision of therapeutic activities and staff training are also areas that require urgent attention.  There continues to be fundamental shortfalls in compliance with basic hygiene, physical repair and space restrictions within many services.<br\/><br\/>The 2017 inspections have once again highlighted the inappropriate use of seclusion and physical restraint in services which have become in many instances the normalised environment.<br\/><br\/>As the committee will be aware, there continues to be a chronic shortage of staff and appropriately trained staff.  Notwithstanding this, the Commission is acutely aware that the front-line staff presently operating services are highly motivated and working under extreme pressure to meet the demands made on the service.<br\/><br\/>The Commission is aware of other issues of access to approved centres which warrant attention.  These include, for example, policies of having to access mental health care services via accident and emergency units, which do not always have appropriately trained mental health staff, and difficulties in gaining admission to approved centres, as well as perceived early discharges.<br\/><br\/>Much work remains to be done to change service culture and to refocus on the full delivery of <i>A Vision for Change<\/i>.  Services must be accessible, comprehensive, responsive and timely.  Now more than ever, it is necessary to address systemic issues that hamper the delivery of services and the development of new, more appropriate, services.<br\/><br\/>Reform of the Mental Health Act 2001 is now a matter of urgency as a significant number of people are now using unregulated mental health care services, both day and residential.  This situation dramatically increases the risk of abusive or neglectful incidents occurring.<br\/><br\/>The Commission is concerned that over the past five years there has been a consistent pattern in the operation of mental health services.  Year-on-year similar issues such as individual care plans, the admission of children into adult units as well as issues of compliance with regulations, and privacy and medication issues, continue to be highlighted in inspection reports.  This continuing trend is worrying and indicates for the Commission a lack of interest and motivation by both Government and services providers to make meaningful change.  The Commission is strongly of the view that there is apparently little heed given to the commentary of the Commission by the Department of Health or Health Service Executive.<br\/><br\/>Nonetheless, the Commission will continue to work in supporting the rights of individuals and families who use mental health services and to seek to ensure that the service providers provide the highest quality of service provision in line with best practice, and to which they are entitled as a basic human right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018062000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Saunders","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Saunders.<\/p><p>Before I invite Dr. Muldoon to make his opening statement, I would like to respond to Mr. Saunder's statement that the Mental Health Commission was disappointed that it had taken so long to have the opportunity to meet the committee.

As the committee will be aware, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is an independent human rights institution which was established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  My office has a unique combination of statutory functions.  We examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children about the administrative actions, or inactions, of public bodies and promote the rights and welfare of children up to the age of 18 years.<br\/><br\/>One of the priorities of our strategic plan for the period 2016 to 2018 is to influence positive change for children with mental health difficulties.  In the light of this priority, we decided in 2017 to undertake a consultation process with young people under 18 years receiving inpatient care and treatment for their mental health difficulties.  The aim of the consultation was to facilitate young people in reflecting and sharing their views on mental health services based on their experiences from primary care through to inpatient services.  I thank the 25 young people, aged between 14 and 17 years, who took part in the consultation process.  We engaged with all six adolescent inpatient units in the country.  I thank the management and staff of the five units who facilitated our work with the young people involved, including Linn Dara CAMHS inpatient unit, Dublin; Willow Grove adolescent unit, Dublin; Ginesa suite, Saint John of God Hospital, Dublin; CAMHS inpatient unit, Merlin Park Hospital, Galway; and &Eacute;ist Linn CAMHS inpatient unit, Cork.  I also thank Ms Lorna Walsh, a member of my staff, for her involvement.  The young people involved were asked to consider three broad questions about their experiences of mental health services, namely, what they found helpful; what they found challenging and what changes they would like to see made.  <br\/><br\/>Different methods were used by the young people concerned to express their views, namely, semi-structured interviews, painting, photography, collage and mind maps.  Some of the images created by them can be viewed in the full report.  On what they found helpful, many of them were positive about the support they received from professionals, family members and other young people in receipt of mental health services.  According to them, professionals who engage and build trusting relationships with them have an important role to play in shaping their experiences of mental health services.  They highlighted that medical professionals who used empathetic approaches and could relate to and communicate well with them and their families contributed to their feeling heard and understood.  The knowledge and experience of teachers and school counsellors, as well as the arrangements put in place by schools to help them to cope, were commended by many of them.  They spoke positively about the efforts family members made to help them, including by travelling long distances to visit inpatient units.  Within the inpatient units, having a support group of peers who had experience and an understanding of the challenges in living with a mental health illness was identified as a valuable source of support.  The benefit of programmes and activities such as music appreciation art, physical activity and life skills groups, was also noted by the young people concerned. <br\/><br\/>Despite these positives, the young people concerned highlighted a range of challenges that they had experienced, both as mental health services users and more generally.  Many questioned the interpersonal and communication skills of the medical professionals with whom they had engaged.  For example, the use of clinical language caused confusion for some young people and left them feeling they were not believed or understood.  Some professionals were seen to be lacking in empathy and sensitivity, particularly when they made suggestions to &quot;keep trying&quot; and &quot;keep working on it&quot;, even when the young people indicated that they felt &quot;it wasn&rsquo;t working.&quot;The lack of opportunities to be heard was also raised as a significant challenge, both within the inpatient units and in wider services.  It was noted that professionals often communicated directly with the parent or parents as opposed to the young people.<br\/><br\/>Several of the young people concerned spoke about and questioned what they regarded as a rush to medicate, with the use of medication being suggested very early on in their treatment.  A small number said they had sometimes been physically restrained.  They found this challenging and frustrating and felt it should not be done.  They also commented on the restrictions placed on them within inpatient units owing to low staffing levels and feeling institutionalised, with the main problem being a the lack of things to do.  <br\/><br\/>Separation from family was a particularly significant challenge frequently mentioned by the young people concerned.  Many spoke about the burden their mental health care had placed on their family and mentioned that it weighed heavily on them and was challenging in coming to terms with it.  <br\/><br\/>With regard to school, some of the young people concerned felt their teachers and school counsellors lacked specialist knowledge of mental health and explained that their expectations of the supports available had not been met.  They had also missed school owing to their mental health illness.  As a result, their relationships with their friends had also been affected. <br\/><br\/>Many of the young people concerned spoke about the length of time it took to access CAMHS and the stark differences in the availability and consistency of the service throughout the country.  They described these delays and inconsistencies as being very difficult.  They also referenced the distance between the inpatient units and their homes, with one young person living an estimated six and a half hour drive from the unit.  Another young person spoke about how the lack of adolescent inpatient places had previously resulted in him being placed in an adult psychiatric ward, an experience he described as traumatic.  <br\/><br\/>The young people who took part in the consultation process recommended changes which they felt would improve mental health services and supports for young people in general.  These recommendations can be found in section 2.3 of the report and include the following: increased supports and awareness raising initiatives in schools, including the availability of additional therapists or guidance counsellors; increased staffing levels in services, including community CAMHS services; the establishment of a youth advisory panel in each inpatient unit to ensure young people would be heard and have their views considered; greater autonomy being afforded to young people in inpatient units to self-regulate and manage their behaviour; and the availability of additional programmes and a less restrictive environment within inpatient units.<br\/><br\/>Following the consultation process and in the light of the complaints and investigations and policy work of my office, we have identified a number of key areas of concern and corresponding priorities for action.  These are dealt with in detail in the report and include effective co-ordination and communication between those working in the area of children's mental health, as well as on a cross-sectoral basis, are central to delivering mental health services and supports that work for children.  I welcome the recognition in the report of the national youth mental health task force<i><\/i>that deficiencies in this area need to be addressed.  The delay in making the youth mental health pathfinder project operational is unacceptable, given the commitment of the Government to it.  The project will provide the vital structure to achieve greater co-ordination in the provision of mental health services for children and young people.  It needs to be put in place urgently.  Also, an independent mental health advocacy and information service specifically for children should be established without delay, as recommended by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the national youth mental health task force.  <br\/><br\/>I have serious concerns about the legislative framework for children&rsquo;s mental health services and the slow pace of reform in this area.  I welcome the passage of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2017 and its focus on inserting rights-based, guiding principles for children into the Mental Health Act 2001.  While these legislative proposals are an important step forward, the Government&rsquo;s commitment to comprehensively revise the 2001 Act as a whole must be progressed without further delay.  To address deficits in policy implementation and provide a single point of focus for everyone who has a role to play in advancing provision for children&rsquo;s mental health, I am calling for the development of a dedicated A Vision for Change for children to provide a dedicated, cross-sectoral national policy framework for children&rsquo;s mental health services.  The framework should set out what clearly the actions that will be taken and by whom, timelines for delivery and associated costs. <br\/><br\/>On financial and human resources, once allocated, resources should be ring-fenced.  The lack of clear and accessible information on the amount of money being spent on mental health services for children also needs to be addressed.  On human resources, consideration should be given to the appointment of experienced professionals, other than consultant psychiatrists, to roles such as clinical leads, with a view to ensuring children and young people will not be left waiting for the support they need owing to unfilled posts.  I call for all primary and post-primary schools to have access to an independent therapist-counsellor to ensure early intervention will be available to all children when they need it.<br\/><br\/>I again thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to present my report which I hope will assist it in its work.  I will be happy to answer questions members may have.  The views and experiences of the young people expressed in the report must be brought centre stage and considered meaningfully by all State and non-State actors with responsibilities to develop and implement proposals for reform in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018062000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon for his opening statement.

I am a trained primary school teacher, but I retired last September.  I am married and we have four beautiful and much loved children, ranging in age from 20 years to ten.<\/p> <p>  I knew nothing or very little about children's mental health issues until our own children were involved.  When I started teaching in 1990, there was little mention of children's mental health and I certainly never received any training in it.  My husband and I were unprepared when our oldest child displayed signs of depression and other issues.  Our oldest child first displayed low mood in second year at second level.  We thought it was adolescence or the onset of puberty, but we were so wrong.  After hearing him verbalise suicide ideation numerous times, we sought medical help.  As the case was urgent, CAMHS saw him two days later.  Of course, we were upset.  We did not know how to help him and looked to CAMHS for support and medical help for our son.  Over time, his diagnosis evolved and worsened.  We saw every member of the CAMHS team in their various roles.  He was assessed by all of them.  My professional training informed me that there may have been more to his diagnosis than the initial diagnosis.  Unfortunately. I was correct.  Over the next five and a half years his diagnosis worsened significantly.  As a result of all of his issues, he manifested the most awful behaviour.  I have never seen ADHD manifest like this.  At one stage we were paying &euro;150 a month for his medication and then I found out that every other county was allowing the cost of his ADHD medication under the long-term illness scheme but the area medical officer, AMO, in Wexford would not allow it.  I appealed this decision and it was upheld.  This is only a small thing, but many children benefited overnight.<\/p> <p>  At times I had to advocate to management for continuity of care and more appointments; however, my letters often went unanswered for many months, if they were answered at all.  As the assessments were concluded, we got a better picture of his diagnosis.  Dr. Kieran Moore, the clinical lead, left no stone unturned for our son.  We had many difficult days; often there would be multiple appointments in a week and we only missed two in the whole five years.  Our son was also an inpatient in a Dublin hospital unit for ten weeks.  That was a horrible experience and a horrible Christmas, one I want to forget.  He returned home for care to the CAMHS team.  The social worker, the clinical nurse manager and the consultant in CAMHS south Wexford are beyond professional.  They did everything they could for our son who was seen by Dr. Kieran Moore very often.  Sometimes the appointments were very difficult, but he did everything he could, including sourcing an external specialist from the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p>  My personal opinion of the service is that the CAMHS team in Wexford is only a skeletal team.  They offer a service that is barely addressing the huge issue of children's mental health.  The professionals I have mentioned are highly qualified, very experienced and kind to both patients and their families, which makes a great deal of difference when one is so vulnerable, but, alas, other staff are part-time and can only offer appointments on a part-time basis.  To say the least, the appointments they offer are patchy.  At one stage, three staff were on maternity leave, none of whom was replaced.  The consultant was on leave numerous times but no locum was ever provided.  I queried this as it affected my child but to no avail.<\/p> <p>  The premises are totally inadequate.  There are not enough consultation rooms and no therapies are offered.  Our son was only offered two sessions of psychology in five and a half years.  They did get a recent extension of a tiny portacabin, which is totally inappropriate.  Knowing what I do now, depression and other mental health issues need more than tablets.  There are many therapies that could be made available that work well with children and teenagers, but, alas, the children of County Wexford cannot get them.  First, there are no staff to offer the therapies and, second, there is no accommodation available in the CAMHS premises.<\/p> <p>  My own experience of advocating for our child taught me many lessons.  We were told that our son was the only pupil in his secondary school to have depression.  That seems incredible in a school of 700 boys.  The same deputy principal has since contacted me numerous times looking for information for other parents who are struggling, just as we did.  If one does not advocate for one's child and speak up, or if you cannot speak up, you will not get the care you need.  Depression is viewed as a disease.  Even a child is considered to be faulty or a lesser person and this was said to us in a primary and a secondary school.  There is huge stigma and shame around children with a mental health issue.  CAMHS never blames parents but society and schools do.  The gossip at pitches, on the sideline and within a small parish can be very hard to take.  Many times we felt alone and had no idea what to do.  We needed more than tablets.  We needed therapy for our son and therapy for our family, but, alas, none was offered or available.<\/p> <p>  Eventually, on the school's insistence - the school was correct to do so - our child sourced counselling in it.  No counselling was available in CAMHS.  Our other child needed help from CAMHS after a mental health emergency.  Alas, even after promising her help, our child was not seen for six weeks.  They did not respond in a timely or an appropriate fashion.  That made her issues much worse and compounded and exacerbated a fundamental issue of body image and the impact of having a sibling with serious mental issues.  The response of the person was that it was not possible to split in two.  That is not fair.<\/p> <p>  Our overall opinion of the CAMHS service is that it is starved of resources.  It is segregated from the general hospital, when it should be incorporated into it.  Do we accept segregation of mental health patients away from the population?  When will we learn that the mental health service deserves to be included in the hospital service, not separate from it?  In my opinion, this echoes the discrimination we have seen in the past when children and older people were excluded from society and hidden in mental institutions.  <\/p> <p>  The service is chronically understaffed.  The staff who are there are of the highest calibre and so professional.  They are kind to children and supportive of parents who are often under enormous strain.  They are under incredible pressure.  The waiting list is now four years long.  Our youngest child is on it.  He cannot fulfil his potential, either academically or otherwise, until he is assessed.  Meanwhile we wait.  He waits and many like him wait.  Other children with critical and complicated issues also wait.  Sometimes they are suicidal and wait; sometimes they need referrals and wait again.  We were referred to three hospitals over the period of five years.  Our son had to have multiple medical tests done elsewhere because CAMHS has nobody to take bloods or do an ECG.  The service in Wexford has no consultant.  His shoes are impossible to fill.  The HSE in its statement stated they were actively recruiting psychiatrists abroad.  That is not good enough.  They just do not understand.  They need to resource the service, employ professionals who are needed, put the CAMHS service into a hospital and offer a service that treats children holistically.  Why would the HSE employ another consultant with no changes to working conditions?  They are not listening.<\/p> <p>  I have written letters to management and politicians for years, all to the no avail.  This level of service would not be tolerated in the provision of cancer treatment, or any other branch of medicine.  Even the list for cardiac assessment in Crumlin was only 18 months long, the last time I checked.  Would you bring a child with cancer to a unit without an oncologist and just hope for the best?  No, you absolutely would not.  Why should the parents of children from Wexford, north and south, and Waterford have a service with no consultant?  That is an insult to our children and to our intelligence.  There is also a very strong case of inequality and discrimination.  Children are not receiving the care they need based on their address.  It is clear that the political agenda seems to be to open the horrible historical chapters of our past.  Is this done on purpose to divert attention away from the current waiting lists for children?  In County Wexford a person who is in dire need is four years on a list.<\/p><p>Will we have to wait 40 years to address the current crisis?  I hope not.  The Proclamation of 1916 urged us to treat all the children of Ireland equally.  If I live in Wexford, I wait four years.  If I live in Dublin or Galway, it seems I get a luxury of service.  Both of our oldest children have written of their experiences.  Our son does not mind his name being mentioned as he is in Barcelona but our second child very much minds her name being mentioned.  I will not mention her name but will tell the committee about what happened.  At the end of the day, society should protect the most vulnerable.  Our children are so precious and when they are sick we bring them to the doctor.  Now there is no doctor in a critical service.  It is time to say \"enough\" and to stop and listen.  Children matter and children's health matters.  If a society is judged on how it cares for its youngest and most vulnerable citizens, then Ireland fails.  I would like everybody here to understand the critical situation in Wexford.  I am passionate about this because I know what can happen, not only to the patient but also to the siblings, family and parents.  We as adults need to be the voice of those children.  We need to change the system, which will not be easy but can be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018062000002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Thank you so much, Margaret.

These are residential units that are mostly attached to general hospitals now, where people reside for a period when they are acutely unwell.  Those units have replaced the previous large institutions that we all know about.  For the first number of years, the commission also inspected those services but they have been closed down since.  The Act is very clear that the commission, through its inspectorate, can inspect the approved centres and can put into place changes to improve the quality of service in them.  They are commonly called conditions and there are various other steps beyond them.  The commission has been doing that since it initiated its inspection process in the early 2000s.<\/p> <p>  The issue to which I alluded briefly is that since that time, and quite rightly, more and more people are receiving mental healthcare services outside of approved centres.  They are going to primary care - to their GP - or to community mental health teams, staffed teams that provide support to people in their local community.  I mentioned the community residences, where people live in group homes in the community.  As time goes on and in line with A Vision for Change, fewer people statistically and theoretically would use the approved centres while more and more people would receive mental healthcare services outside of them.<\/p> <p>  The Act allows us to inspect any place where mental health services are provided.  However, it does not allow us to regulate or impose changes on those places.  We can inspect any community mental health team in the country and if we find issues that need to be changed we can make recommendations.  However, we cannot enforce them because the Act, which is now quite old, does not allow us to do so.  That is one of the issues around the review of the Mental Health Act.  Provisions are needed to allow the commission to regulate all services.  In my statement, I said that the vast majority of those now using mental health services are using services that are not regulated in the context of what the commission does.

The problem, as I suggested, is that the changes and improvements are often beyond the scope of a local service.

This was a highly visible structure through which the commission or anybody else could communicate on a national or corporate level with the mental healthcare services at what is called national director level, which is a very high level.  That was quite effective for trying to push change within the system.

Parents today are also much more emotionally aware and those in the 25 to 30 years age bracket know how to help their children in that regard.  However, we still need to provide services when something goes wrong.  That is why I am suggesting that therapists or counsellors should be available at primary care level.  A report is being launched at St. Patrick's hospital today which finds that some four year olds are displaying signs of anxiety but we can cut out some of the problems at source with very simple stuff.  The aforementioned report is very clear that many of the issues for children are related to marriage breakdown, difficult family relationships, blended families and so on.  These are normal aspects of life now but if children do not sort them out in their heads when they are four or five years old, by the time they are 14 or 15 years old, they can have a real impact.

Under legislation, the commission \"shall have such powers as are necessary\" for the purposes of its functions.  Given that in 2016, we had 68 instances of children being admitted to adult facilities, rising to 82 in 2017, is anybody listening to the commission?  To use HIQA as a comparator, it seems to have the ability to bring about change but it appears the Mental Health Commission does not, to be blunt about it.

To put that in context, in 2012 there were 107 such admissions, in 2013 there were 98, in 2014 there were 92, in 2015 there were 96 and there were 68 such admissions in 2016.  There has, therefore, been a shift.  One of the roles performed by the commission is to carry out inspections.  It sees what it sees, makes very clear statements as to whether what it sees is appropriate and makes recommendations for change.  There is a dialogue with the service provider around that and, as I said earlier, in many cases small changes occur as a result of that dialogue.  However, if that dialogue is not sufficient to bring about changes, the commission can impose conditions and timelines within which such conditions must be met.  Compliance is monitored by the commission through the inspectorate.  Inspections would take place on a monthly or three-monthly basis to ensure that the required changes take place.  Again, if one looks through the thousands of pages of our reports, one will see changes brought about by that process.<\/p> <p>  We have the power to impose much more severe restrictions such as closure.  However, one of the issues in mental healthcare, as everyone knows, is that the vast majority of services are provided by the statutory provider, that is, the HSE.  If one of those services is closed, one is faced with the problem of where the people using that service will go and who will provide an alternative service to them.  In many cases, there is no plan B because the statutory system is providing the services.  We need to be very careful about using more draconian measures.<\/p> <p>  Having spoken to the inspectorate, I can say that people working on the ground often welcome the commentary of the inspectorate and the commission because it provides very clear direction to them in terms of the changes they can make to improve the services.  When one talks to people across the system, many of them will say that bringing about change is a very co-operative process.  It is not just about saying a service must close or do X or Y.  It is about pointing out the changes that are needed and bringing people up to that change over time.  When one looks at the position historically, one can see that improvements have taken place.  The factors which mitigate against that are often down to the fact that people do not have the necessary resources or are working in buildings that are not fit for purpose.  Often the issues are not localised but are national and, as such, they require a national response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018062000002#G01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Saunders"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>This committee is grappling with a complex and difficult area in an effort to bring about some positive change.

Ms Brennan spoke earlier about the fact that some parts of the country have very good CAMHS and very good mental health services generally.  Galway has been highlighted as one of the best in that regard.  It can be done but it is generally done because of individual personalities who make things work.  It is down to good decisions on who to bring in, what the contracts look like and making it work for an area.  As a system, it is dependent on the individuals within it.  That is why I am seeking a new A Vision for Change specifically for children.  We keep referring to the original document but that was drafted in utopia, when we expected to be able to sell all of our old psychiatric hospitals for hundreds of millions of euro and reinvest that money in services.  We are now in very different circumstances and the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for mental health has told me that at least 15 psychiatric consultant posts have been unfilled for the past five years.<\/p><p>We are not producing enough psychiatrists to fill them.  That is where we need to start thinking in a new way, such as how else we can fill those posts and whether there are other posts that could do the same job for a period of time.  There is a bit of both.  The system when it is fully resourced with the right people will work perfectly, but when one has a situation where only one type of professional can fill it and one cannot get that professional one needs to start thinking about who else can fill the post.  That is one part of it, but it is also necessary to resource properly the earlier stage, which is the primary care, the early intervention, the GPs and the stages where young people are identified as quickly as possible.  I would love to see people without their professional hats on discussing how one would set this up as new.  It would be a conversation worth having if we put everyone in a room and asked: \"What do we want for our children and grandchildren regardless of what our profession is and what would be the best way forward?\"  There are examples of good practice around the country that are not supported by the system but by individuals with real passion and emotion.

I was meeting the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  I have a few observations for Dr. Muldoon.  I read the report.  The children and service users were very open and honest in it.  I compliment everybody involved with it because we need to get the truth out.  However, there appears to be a repetitive issue here.  On primary care, the committee has called for the development of a realistic plan and timeframe for the provision of 24-7 services, but that is not happening.  Like Dr. Muldoon, we have called for everyone to sit down together and take off their professional hats and put on their thinking caps.  We call it an outside-the-box and common sense approach to CAMHS.  We know the incidence of suicide is higher in certain geographical areas than in others.  My view is that if there is a restriction when it comes to staffing, and there is a diabolical situation at present, we can surely pinpoint geographical areas and get them fully staffed and working there.<\/p> <p>  Ms Brennan spoke about the lack of services even when one gets into them.  There was just option A and no B or C in terms of treatment for her child, such as talk therapy and so forth.  That is down to staffing.  There is one issue that always aggrieves me.  Why can we not fill the teams we have in CAMHS?  If we cannot, can we not consider the geographical basis whereby if there is greater urgency in CHO areas 2 and 5 we try to staff those fully first?  That decreases the pressure in one area.  I realise it could exacerbate it in others, but the numbers are not as high.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the Mental Health Commission, we raised staffing here last week.  If we cannot get the recruitment process right in any part of the sections, we have lost.  I submitted a parliamentary question last January and the reply was that the Mental Health Commission recruitment process has 22 stages before there is an appointment.  That is a bad indictment of good resourcing or good thinking.  I have a question for Mr. Saunders on the allocation of funds.  There was an under-drawdown of nearly &euro;9 million in 2005, &euro;5.5 million in 2006 and &euro;3.1 million in 2007, but all the budget was spent in 2008.  From 2009 to 2014 the moneys that were not drawn down amount to approximately &euro;12 million.  Where does that money go?  Does it go back into the system?  Is it ring-fenced for something?  It appears that across the entire area of mental health we cannot tie down a simple specific answer to a question, and when we cannot get answers we seem to go around in a revolving door all the time.  I am very worried when we cannot get clarity on a matter.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the commission's powers and responsibilities, does it look over some of the Bills we produce?  If we produce legislation is it part of the commission's remit to respond to it?  One example is the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act.

We know that 75% of all adult psychiatric issues start in childhood.  No business is set up without knowing what is being spent, where it is being spent and where better resources can be allocated.  When the Irish College of General Practitioners met in another committee with the Chair, they spoke about the need for demographic allocation and disadvantage needs to be considered there.  There is a better way of doing that with the limited resources, namely to find out where the need is greatest and the south east seems to have jumped to the top of that queue but there are other areas that need better allocation.  There is a way of improving the system but we need to start with the basic question of how much we spend on it.  That needs to increase.  We know it is only 6% of our national budget and the European average is around 12%.  We are way behind on that.  We know the money is not enough if the recruitment is not done properly.  Other areas that Ms Brennan mentioned where we could recruit are play, art and drama therapists and other such people who are in professions that have only come on the scene in the last ten to 15 years.

The second issue is one of resources.  One of the things we have been identifying is the fact that in CAMHS, for example, the amount of money available throughout the country ranges from a low of &euro;40 to &euro;92 per person per annum.

I give respect to Ms Brennan.  It is great that her voice is here and more recently it has been proven in this country that ordinary voices such as hers are the catalyst for change.  That is why we need to keep pushing this.  It needs to change but it must come from our ordinary families and children who suffer in this country.  I thank her for appearing before the committee.  We are not that scary but sometimes it can be daunting.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Mental Health Commission also.  What do they think about a prison becoming an approved centre?  I looked at their annual financial statements in depth for the last two or three years.  I am concerned about how much they spend on their legal representation.  I would like a written submission back to the committee on that.  It seems to be a complete overspend.  It feels like the lawyers are doing what they do best but maybe I am being condemnatory of them.  It is to do with the due process in tribunals.  Mental health tribunals are important and have become extremely important for people's rights in this country but they do not represent the patient in the tribunal as such.  They are only there to make sure that due process occurs but that does not give voice to the patient.  I have grave concerns about the lack of patients' voices in that process because lawyers and legal teams supposedly representing them only tick the box to say that due process has taken place.<\/p> <p>  Time and again, the Mental Health Commission has visited facilities that were very poor and unfit for habitation such as Portrane.  I know that there are often no alternative facilities but how do they justify registering such facilities and allowing them to continue to offer services even though they are so far below par and unfit?  I understand that we would have no other facilities but maybe that is the push that we need.<\/p> <p>  I have worked with mental health staff and represented them as a union representative.  There have been several occasions where we have felt like calling the Health and Safety Authority because of situations within our hospitals or approved centres.  That may seem like a last resort measure but perhaps it would send a signal out that something needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  I thank Dr. Muldoon.  He produced a survey with input from young people.  There were two private CAMHS units and three public.  The committee has discussed this before.  Were there any stark differences between the private and public responses?  What did children find good, bad or indifferent in those?  Some &euro;400 million is spent on psychotropic drugs and &euro;10 million is spent on talk therapies such as play, drama or art and counselling.  He also mentioned the restraint of children, that it seems to have increased and seems to be more drug related, especially with the powerful, synthetic drugs that are out there now.  Could he comment on that and the challenging behaviour that results from those drug induced psychoses?  I agree with the comments on A Vision for Change which was also previously discussed.  We need to have more of a community effort and to look at the appointment of experienced professionals to run the areas of our services that do not have any kind of order within them.<\/p><p>We put that question to the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and it was a definite no-no so maybe the witnesses might like to keep pressing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018062000002#J01400","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator because we were running out of time there.

We are now dealing with units that are attached to general hospitals.  Some of them are quite old.  In fact, most of them existed prior to the Mental Health Commission.  Our brief under the Act is to inspect them and attach conditions and we do attach conditions.  At any one time, a significant number of conditions are in place, which means there are things that people need to improve on.  As I said earlier, the staff in those services at a local level bend over backwards to make those improvements because they know they are heading in the right direction if they do so.  We must accept that they are there.  Often it is the only unit in the county and we cannot just close it overnight because there is no plan B.  The other thing to bear in mind around registration is that it is never simply a case of saying a place is providing a perfect service.

In particular, I thank Ms Brennan.  She was very courageous and I know she did that for her own child and the children in her own area and our country.I know how difficult that was for her and we really appreciate it.

It is something I would be keen to see.  I know it is the norm in many countries so how can we do this?  Does Dr. Muldoon believe that the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health are working together properly to address supports for our children?  Is that interdepartmental collaboration close enough?  Are the Departments working together in innovative ways to support them?  Is the promotion of happiness and mental resilience among our children being addressed at all?  In a recent survey, the majority of primary school principals said that they just do not know.  Children are really stressed out and more anxious than ever before and principals do not know how to cope with it and how to help these children.  Is that interdepartmental approach there?    <\/p> <p>  There was a reference to some teachers doing some work.  It is quite sporadic.  What needs to be done there to ensure that it is not so sporadic and that we have the proper training for teachers before we reach the stage where we get those counsellors on site?

Breaking with anonymity was a very powerful, brave and difficult thing to do.  One thing we have learned is that very often, personal experiences do the most in acting as catalysts for change.  It should not have to be like this but very often, it is the thing that empowers some people to sit up, wake up and see exactly what is going on.<\/p> <p>  I thank Dr. Muldoon for his work in his report in terms of giving a voice to children.  Very often, the most difficult thing we face is giving effect to that voice for obvious reasons such as data protection and access.  Very often, it is the voice that is missing.  There has been a history of too much focus on paternalism in this country that needs to be rebalanced so that our children's voices can be heard.  I very much welcome that.  <\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Saunders and the Mental Health Commission for their work.  I know Mr. Saunders does great work both inside and outside the commission.  Very often, inspection reports are the launch pad for parliamentary questions I put and further work.  My first question is for Mr. Saunders.  I recently asked the Department of Health about the longest length of stay with regard to children in adult units.  The Department told me that it does not keep that information or those records.  I think this is quite unbelievable and unacceptable.  It is outrageous that this is the case.  I know the commission has had this information in past reports so I do not know why it is not available from the Department anymore.  For the Department to say it does not know how long children are staying in adult units is outrageous.  Dealing with Waterford, anecdotally, there seems to be a significant increase in the number of children staying in these units for four, five or six weeks.  Perhaps the commission could address that.  Is it just my interpretation of what I am seeing or is it a trend that is becoming more worrisome?<\/p><p>From talking to parents, I have discovered it is happening because of the lack of alternative supports, which was addressed by Ms Brennan, such as activities or alternative therapies.  Again, that is totally unacceptable.<\/p><p> Dr. Muldoon touched the most important finding of the commmittee, that being that we do not know how much is being spent on child mental health services.  I ask him to comment on another key finding, which is that &euro;400 million is being spent on psychotropic drugs in our mental health services but only &euro;10 million on talk therapies.  Medication has an important role in treatment but a ratio of 40:1 in its favour over basic talk therapy support gives a very clear indication of the focus of and imbalance in our health services.<\/p><p> We know that people recover best when treated close to their family, friends and care network.  Dr. Muldoon touched on that when he noted that separation from family is a particularly significant challenge frequently mentioned by young people.  People with eating disorders or members of the deaf community who need specialised supports very often are sent to the United Kingdom for a long time to receive appropriate support.  Those people are completely separated from their loved ones and care network.  The same language may be spoken in the United Kingdom but it is a different jurisdiction and those people are completely alienated from their families, friends and support networks.  I ask Dr. Muldoon to address the consequences of our young people being alienated by being sent out of the country to access medical supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018062000002#K01000","speaker":"1354","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":319,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome.

Mr. Saunders mentioned that the Mental Health Commission has noted a considerable variation in funding depending on geographical area.  How has that developed?  Is it because of a Minister being from a particular area or is it due to a lack of services such that one area gets more funding than another?<\/p> <p>  The facility at Linn Dara was mentioned.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the fact that beds are being closed there.  Why is that being done?

Is it a familiar pattern for families to wonder where to go, who to see and what happens if the services are not there?  Those are  the first things to strike families.  Families have come to me whose son or daughter needs services and respite but refuses to go into respite or avail of services.  What should families do in such circumstances, in particular if the child is violent, apart from sectioning the child?  I am aware of a case involving a child who was eating off the ground, walking naked indoors and outdoors and had severe mental health problems.  Many of the family members themselves end up on anti-depressants.  I offer that as an example of families such as Margaret's who do not know where to go.  They usually go to politicians but they are the wrong people to whom to go.   Doctors probably do not know what to do, hospitals are too busy to deal with them and the Garda can offer only limited advice.  Where do such families go?  I have asked that question before.  It is probably monotonous for those at home watching or listening to the committee proceedings but these are the type of questions to which people need answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018062000002#L00400","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I ask the witnesses to answer in sequence.

I will give a brief response, given the time limits.  On unregulated mental health care services, only approved residential centres across the country are currently regulated under the Act.  We regulate those centres and impose conditions and changes.  We can inspect other services but we cannot impose changes upon them.  We have the power to inspect and to make suggestions to community residences, community mental health teams in adults' and children's services and every other type of service but we do not have the power under the Act to enforce those suggestions.  That is the crucial issue and it is part of the review process to which I alluded much earlier in terms of the services.  We know, and it is nothing new to say, that most mental health teams across the country are under-staffed because of supply and other issues.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Browne raised the issue of duration of stay.  In 2011, the year in which the commission began to highlight the issue of children's admissions to adult units, the average duration in those units was approximately 11 days and children then went back to their families or on to appropriate children's services.  That has now come down to approximately six to eight days per admission.  It is important to understand the background to such admissions.  Some children go into adult services because children's services sometimes will not receive people out of hours.  Parents sometimes choose for their child, their loved one, to be served locally rather than travel 100 miles or more to a children's unit.  There may be a clinical decision that it is the most appropriate location for a child.  CAMHS may not be able to support people locally.  We earlier mentioned that community mental health children's teams are not sufficiently staffed to provide the support a child might require while living in his or her own home and the last resort is often, therefore, for the child to go to a children's service or, in some cases, unfortunately, an adult service.  That may not fully answer Deputy Browne but those are the headline issues.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Crowe raised a number of issues.  There is a problem in regard to transitional services.  Between the ages of 16 and 18 a person is constitutionally and legally a child but may be exhibiting adult-type behaviours and there is an issue in terms of who deals with such people.  Traditionally in Ireland, the children's mental health service finishes at 18 and the adult mental healthcare service kicks in.  There are logistical issues in regard to how teams co-operate with each other or not, depending on the situation.  The commission and many others have highlighted inconsistencies across the country in that regard, some of which are partly historical.  Some areas of the country historically have better financial resource allocations.  If there was a very large institution in an area, a very large budget would have been provided to support it.  When the institution closed, that budget may more or less stay in the area.<\/p> <p>  As mentioned by Dr. Muldoon, local clinical and administrative leadership is often the spark that drives change, such that change is promoted by personality or the dynamic of a team rather than having a national consistent change plan.

The whole essence of that is to try to create co-ordination and encouragement so that well-being becomes part of the culture of every school.  It is about emotional awareness across teachers, students and parents, so it is the school community that needs to have a well-being culture.  We are trying to promote that all of the time.<\/p> <p>  Within that, changes are needed.  The Deputy asked whether the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills are working closely together.  They are not working together closely enough.  They both have targets within a number of strategies, such as the Healthy Ireland strategy, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures and various other strategies.  However, with regard to co-operating with each other, it is not as good as it could be and this is something that can be encouraged.  We need teachers to be valued more than they are at present for the work they do.  We now have a well-being curriculum for junior certificate but we still find this is taken on board by certain teachers who might have fewer hours filled, and it might not always be encouraged as the most important part of the work they do.  There is a lot of work to be done in both the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health.  Co-operation is vital and that is where we need to have things like a counselling service available across the two Departments, and perhaps across other Departments.  They are starting to work on issues such as speech and language therapists being provided in schools, which is a case of co-operation between the two Departments.  If we can do the same with regard to a counselling service, that could work, but there is a lot of work to be done.  Even during the early years in primary school, we can start to encourage children, teachers and any of the professionals working with them to work on the emotional well-being and emotional vocabulary of children.  This would make a huge difference into the future and give them resilience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018062000002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I sit on the education committee, which prepared a report on promoting positive mental health.

What was very interesting was that, consistently, the young people included a focus in their comments on education, the importance of culture in schools and the professional and other supports, including peer supports, available in schools.  In the area for ideas for improvement, they put a very strong emphasis on prevention in terms of work to promote well-being and good mental health, but also on supports being available at that level, informal and otherwise, to build young people's awareness and understanding of their own mental health, if they are experiencing difficulties, and to help them address those difficulties.

With regard to geographic supports and the idea that young people have been taken away from their homes, the UN committee is very clear that the highest attainable standard of health care needs to include support and closeness to the highest possible level of support.  The way I always describe it is that it needs to be accessible, appropriate and timely.  The committee will see in our report that one young person was in an inpatient unit six and a half hours away from home and did not see the family for ten weeks.  That is a difficult thing to do at the best of times and we are doing people a huge disservice if that is the best we can offer.  International options are a huge problem, in my view.  We have all sorts of concerns about children who are held in clinical centres in England.  We find this happens with eating disorders because patients need to be PEG fed, for example.  Again, it is an area where we can increase our professionalism in order to bring those young people home.  From our perspective, this is a concern because it damages their rights to the best attainable health care within their own community.  I would also have a question mark as to the clinical and governance system when people are sent across to another country.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Crowe asked about Linn Dara.  I assume he is referring to last year's closure of 11 beds due to the difficulty in recruiting nurses.  My understanding is that it was back up to full capacity from October or November of last year and I have not heard of any difficulties since then.  However, it does show the vulnerability we have in that recruitment can be a difficulty for us and can lead to problems for children.  An average stay there is about six weeks, which means some 60 young people may have lost out on that opportunity while those beds were closed.  It is something for which we can plan.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Saunders talked about the 16 to 20 years age group.  We still have CHO areas where CAMHS teams do not take anyone above 16 years of age, which is a disgrace.  We have a centralised operating procedure which says they should do this but some of them are not.  It is not even from 18 to 20 years but from 16 upwards that children are lost to a proper CAMHS service.  We still have a lot of work to do in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The committee has heard perfectly today about the impact on families.  If we had a service where they looked after our young people when they came in to us, the families would not have to fight, search, navigate, cajole and protest.  None of those things would have to happen and they would still have a difficult time.  If we were to do it properly, we would have a holistic service that provides support for everybody in that family that has an issue in regard to siblings, and parents would have some support.  We have to start by giving the identified child every support possible and making it as easy as possible for the families.  That is where an advocacy service and similar services can help, so they do not have to do all of the fighting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018062000002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Deputy Crowe had some questions for Ms Brennan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018062000002#M00900","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>On the cost of medication, the area medical officer for the HSE area dictates what can be allowed on a long-term illness card.

I appealed this as I felt it was inequality and discrimination based on where we choose to live, and I won the appeal.<\/p> <p>  On the question on the schools, the youngest child I ever had who expressed suicidal ideation was seven years old.  We did not have a counsellor in that small rural school and we did not know what to do and had to get an external counsellor.  Counselling in secondary schools has been cut and cut again.  To get a slot for a teenager, one would have to be very lucky.  I know the counsellors in three schools.  One was brought in externally and the other two were on the school staff and teaching, so they were working their counselling around their teaching hours.

I will start.  I will address Mr. Saunders and then Ms Brennan.  If there are questions that Mr. Saunders is not able to answer, I would be obliged if he could provide those answers at a later stage so that we can include them in the report.<\/p> <p>  Who does the Mental Health Commission report to?  Who funds the Mental Health Commission?  If it is the Department of Health, surely there is a conflict of interest?  How can it tell the Department of Health that it is not doing a good job if it is paying the commission to do that?  I am a little concerned about that.  Will Mr. Saunders clarify that?  He said the commission was established in 2002.  As mentioned earlier by Deputy Brassil, the commission has written thousands of pages of reports and, 16 years on, we are still seeing the same problem.  Do you have any power at all?  When I say \"you\", I do not mean Mr. Saunders but the Mental Health Commission.  Let us be very clear about that.  Does the Mental Health Commission have any power at all?  With all the reports and what it is finding, nothing is changing.  When Mr. Saunders talks about how he thinks the commission should have the right to access external services, to measure, identify and investigate them, that would worry me a little.  Since the commission has very little impact on mental health services, surely if it starts to focus the spotlight on external services, it will be taken away from the HSE?  That worries me because we as a committee are trying to make the HSE accountable.  I would like Mr. Saunders to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  My next questions are for Ms Brennan.  I want a real, honest, basic answer to this question.  What is she going to do now that the services are going to be removed or stopped?  If they are returned, the chances are that it could be in about a year's time.  To recruit a psychiatrist in the south-east area would take at least a year.  What is Ms Brennan going to do now?  She mentioned the four year waiting list for her child.  What was the waiting list for?  Was it for initial assessment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018062000002#N00600","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Initial assessment.

I feel that parents are forgotten in this.  The biggest role in a child's life is the parent's.  Ms Brennan has fought for all these services and awareness.  I see that in the different reports.  That is unacceptable because the first port of call is the parent.  The parent will notice signs.  If one is not trained to notice these signs, it is a drawback, because timing is crucial with issues such as this.  A programme should be put in place for parents such as Ms Brennan who need early intervention.  She needs to know the signs.  She has children and is not used to this.  It is a whole new world to her.  In my own area, I see people fighting for medical cards, not being able to afford the cost of doctors and waiting to go on a list for an appointment.  That is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to Dr. Muldoon and his excellent report.  It is crucial that we set up a national youth mental health taskforce.  Dr. Muldoon's report states that many young people spoke of the length of time it took to access child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  When one gets to a certain age, one knows that there is an issue in the system.  This system is broken.  It is not fit for purpose.  Families are affected.  There are children and parents who are crying out for help.  They are really stressed because they feel that their children need that help.  There is no help there for them either.  The whole system needs to be looked at, as do all these reports, whether they are worked on or money is put into them.  We keep bringing up staffing and I know how crucial it is, particularly with teachers in schools but also with counsellors.  It could start off with the small things, such as extra help in schools or for parents.  It is not massive money and it boils down to funding.  I do not care what anyone says.  There is a massive rural and urban divide.  One can see it.  Different CHO areas all get different funding.  Many will get more than others.  That is unfair.  We need to make sure that everybody gets equal treatment and it is not happening here.<\/p> <p>  I was reading Mr. Saunders' report on advising the Minister regarding regulations for approved centres.  He has gone through all the different areas.  He says he had inspected 43 residencies in 2017 details of which are published on the site.  He has noticed massive issues.  We know staffing is a massive issue.  There is the absence of privacy, space, poor repairs to buildings and issues with institutional care.  What are the HSE or the Minister doing about this?  These reports are fine and we welcome them but what is being done?  That is the issue today.  It is not acceptable that 82 children were in adult units.  That figure is going back up.  It was 68 in 2016 and in 2017 it is up by 14.  That is unacceptable.  A Vision for Change is not working.  Can everybody get together and start listening to Ms Brennan and the children who are crying out for help, put a programme together and start with the simple things such as getting school counsellors back and helping the teachers?  Train teachers in the signs.  Dr. Muldoon said that one can sometimes even see signs by the age of four.  We all need to address these matters for the long term.  We must develop a system, help and awareness; the Chairman would tell the witnesses that at every meeting I have attended I have stated awareness is the biggest issue.  Parents are not aware and teachers are not aware.  There is the awareness of what they are entitled to and the awareness of signs.  There is such a lack of information and until that is sorted, this system will not work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018062000002#N00900","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I apologise for having to leave.  I missed the second presentation so some of my comments may have been dealt with.  I will deal with three issues.  The first relates to recruitment and retention.  I heard a Minister this morning, when he was addressing this very issue, say that it was an international problem and that Ireland is no different from anywhere else.  He proposed that tele-psychiatry would be the answer to recruitment and retention.  I would like the witnesses' view on that.  From my experience, the one-to-one personal contact that a patient has with his or her carer, whether a doctor or a nurse, is most important, particularly with regard to continuity of care.  If one is trying to solve mental health issues over the Internet or Skype, it is a poor substitute for having a nurse, doctor or therapist to speak to a person.<\/p> <p>  The second issue relates to community care teams, specifically CAMHS.  In my area in west Clare, we do not have a consultant psychiatrist.  We have not had a psychologist for six years.  We have half a social worker.  The team is very understaffed.  The problem with that is that those who are left standing are burning out.  Not only do we not have the personnel to fill the gaps, but those who are there are under serious pressure.  There seems to be a lack of urgency in addressing this issue.<\/p> <p>  The third issue relates to talk therapy and medication.  Many quite serious mental health issues do not involve a biochemical imbalance but the treatment that is given is very potent medication.  I do not think that is appropriate.  I know we referred to &euro;400 million for psychotropic drugs and &euro;10 million for talk therapy but it is not as simple as that.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, the tendency to reach for the prescription pad is very easy.  If one does not have the top therapists, psychologists and cognitive behavioural therapy available that is the option.  One is treating conditions which do not involve a biochemical imbalance with very potent drugs.  Perhaps the witnesses might address those issues.<\/p><p> The amount of medication being prescribed for children with mental health issues is quite frightening.  Quite often these medications are not addressing the issue at all, but rather are blunting symptoms instead of treating the underlying condition.  I ask the witnesses to address those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018062000002#N01000","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I will invite the witnesses to speak in a sequential manner.

He gets rewards when he hits a target.<\/p> <p>  He is entitled to resource hours in school.

It is down to me as his parent and I will do everything.  If it costs me a fortune in Lego, that is fine.  I will do everything to help my child as I have done for the others.<\/p> <p>  As regards teachers in schools, if one is interested one can opt into mental health care courses given by Professor Fiona McNicholas who provides them in teacher centres.  Teachers have to opt in and get substitute cover.  Those who are not interested do not opt in.  I have been to one course and Professor McNicholas is absolutely brilliant.  I met several secondary school teachers at the courses, some of whom are not trained counsellors but are taking on the role of counsellors in schools.<\/p> <p>  I would advise committee members to not be so quick to dismiss medication.  It helps in a lot of cases.  A doctor would not prescribe a medicine for a child if it was not needed.  They are not that trigger happy with prescriptions.  They will do what is needed at the time and start on a very low dose.  I have never found a doctor who is prescription happy.  They will do whatever the child needs.  If he or she needs something for concentration, low mood or to calm him or her down, doctors will not give out medication willy-nilly.  <\/p> <p>  I am at a loss.  The CAMHS team will collapse without a specialist.  We are not even in hospital, yet children with serious psychiatric problems are in a general hospital on a paediatric ward, where there are babies in cots.  They are left there and parents are told staff cannot mind their children because they are not trained in psychiatric illness.  On the two occasions I refer to nobody from the CAMHS team came to visit.  I had to deal with the situation.  I had to sleep on a chair or the floor and mind my child.  That situation needs to be addressed.  It happens quite often.  As Deputy Browne said, children who need to be in a specialist unit are in wards with babies in cots for weeks.  In University Hospital Waterford children are in a private room off an adult ward which is no bigger than a cupboard for weeks with no therapy and nothing to do all day.  I cannot tell the committee what I have seen there.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018062000002#O02300","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Brennan.

I agree tele-psychiatry is not a substitute.  Mental health care services across all programmes are about people reacting with people and support far more than in general medicine and other forms of health.  There is room for tele-mental health or e-mental health, but it has a very specific purpose.  In general, one should never try to replace people with machinery in the area of mental health.<\/p><p>I agree totally with Deputy Harty on that.<\/p><p> The second point to note to which the Deputy, and all of us, have alluded is that the community health teams are incomplete.  People are working under pressure to provide a complete service with half the team.  To use the analogy, how will a football team win a game if half its team members are not on the pitch?  It is as simple as that.  It is a complex problem to solve but it is simple.  We do not have the right people in the right place to provide that service across the country.<\/p><p> On the issue of drugs, I respect all views around that.  There is a history in mental health and in other parts of services of people relying on drugs because of the absence of something else.  Equally, I am sure drugs work in certain cases.  A number of years ago, the commission did a piece of research on benzodiazepines use in older populations and showed clearly that there is usually an over-prescribing of maximum doses in those cases.  One rationale for that would be that there is no other way of managing people's behaviour, which is wrong.  I have no doubt that in medicine generally, people sometimes resort to the prescription in the absence of other solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018062000002#O02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Saunders","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":371,"content":"<p>It is telling that when Dr. John Hillery highlighted the reason he was resigning from the Health Service Executive, HSE, position yesterday, he considered his medical ethics compromised and gave the example of having no respite for somebody with an intellectual disability and behavioural issues and therefore having to medicate them to keep them more relaxed and keep them down.

I have a question on age appropriate mental well-being classes in schools.  We recently published a suicide training and prevention Bill.  That was a small move but incoming public sector workers will get a minimum of a programme like SafeTALK, which will give them the coping skills to spot the signs.  Would it be an advantage for that to be rolled out to schools?  In that way, somebody who is working with children or with the public will have the skills to spot people who are in trouble.  I know that is only one part of a bigger issue but as Mr. Saunders said, like the football team, if we do not have all the ingredients we will not be able to make the cake.  This would be the first step to giving the people who are dealing with this area directly, namely, teachers, garda&iacute; and Government officials, the coping skills to spot the signs and help people when they are in difficulty.

The issue is how to provide a consistent level of intervention for all children in schools.  I am very aware that many issues in Ireland are addressed locally, again by this idea of some regional spark that has been developed.  Many very good services are provided by voluntary organisations but they are inconsistent because of resource issues and geographical variations.

The amendments propose to provide for the creation of an offence in the case that a person advertises, or causes to be advertised, an alcohol product on an information society service unless all reasonable steps are taken to ensure the advertisement cannot be viewed by children.  These steps include whether age verification controls have been used to prevent access by children to an advertisement.  This amendment uses the framework of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive which comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten.  My officials have previously consulted that Department and the Department of Justice and Equality on this matter.<\/p> <p>  The Audiovisual Media Services Directive is a sector-specific directive for television and services that are similar to television.  I am informed that the extension of its scope is to include any audiovisual content on any platform would cut across several EU directives and other regulations.  In addition, I have concerns about the effectiveness of this proposed provision.  For example, if it was introduced for websites hosted in Ireland, advertisers could simply move to websites which are not hosted in Ireland to avoid the necessity to comply with this proposed amendment.  Finally, I am unclear as to how effective age verification controls could be implemented under the proposal.  A reliance on self-disclosure is not a robust method of enforcement as children may simply claim to be over 18 and, therefore, access the alcohol advertising.  European legislation, similar to the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, which addresses all the issues regarding intermediary or online platforms, is required to address the issues involved and I do not propose to accept the amendments.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 30 proposes to change the broadcasting watershed times in the Bill that applies to radio broadcasts to make them the same as those that apply to television.  The watershed times were set out to prohibit alcohol advertising during times when children might be in the audience.  For radio, the watershed times provide that alcohol advertisements can be broadcast at times children are at school during the week and at any time on weekends.  These times were agreed in consultation with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, which have the expertise in this area.  I am conscious that we are introducing new prohibitions on advertising with this Bill and inherent in this new regime will be the potential loss of advertising revenue to broadcasters.  However, I am determined that we address the proven impact that advertising alcohol to children can have.  On that basis, I will follow the advice given, and targeting this measure to times when children are likely to be in the audience for radio to ensure that this measure is both effective and proportionate.  Section 21 provides that the Minister for Health must carry out a review of the advertising sector after three years.  On this basis we can examine thee provisions again after we have had an opportunity to see their effects in practice.  For these reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#B00700","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":394,"content":"<p>The purpose of the amendments is to deal with the consumption of alcohol by minors and the targeting of children and minors through advertising.

A health committee must be very careful about what it says and does and what message it sends out in terms of adherence to good practice.  The issue that has arisen in this particular case concerns the space devoted to warning people who might consume alcohol.  That is understandable.  I presume Irish products are no more carcinogenic than products from the United States, France or any other country in Europe or outside it.  The worry is that perhaps the impression might be given abroad that Irish products are particularly harmful when other products constitute a similar threat.  We accept that warnings are required on labelling but we must be sure that goods imported into this country by competitors carry the same level of warning and I am not certain we can enforce that.<\/p> <p>  I have not gone through the directives and even though I can remember most things I do not remember the detail of the relevant one off the top of my head.  It is sad.  I agree in principle but I add a note of caution on the inherent danger.  It is a bit like the proposal for a capital transaction tax.  It is great if everybody does it.  I have no problem with that at all.  If it is done by everybody right across the board, including for imported goods, we are then on an even footing.  However, if it is only applicable to us in this jurisdiction, notwithstanding the directive, then we could place ourselves at a disadvantage.

Opposition amendments Nos. 10, 13 and 20 propose the removal of the amendments to the labelling and advertising provisions made in Seanad &Eacute;ireann which inserted a warning on the direct link between alcohol and fatal cancers.  Amendment No. 10 proposes to remove this warning from the labels of products.  Amendment No. 13 proposes its removal from the notice on licensed premises and amendment No. 20 proposes to remove the warning from advertisements.<\/p> <p>  At the time of the introduction of the cancer warnings in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the Minister for Health expressed the view that having a specific warning for cancer could create a hierarchy of diseases and potentially have the effect of implying that other equally serious conditions are less important.  The original intention of the health warnings provision was to ensure that consumers are informed of the generality of health risks associated with alcohol and not to highlight one particular risk.<\/p> <p>  Since that time the measure of including a cancer warning on labels was assessed at EU level under Regulation No. 1169 of 2011 on the provision of food information to consumers.  On 2 May the European Commission communicated its decision that it was not issuing a negative opinion on the provision.  A negative opinion would have effectively blocked the provision from being enacted.  As no negative opinion was issued there is no block at EU level to this measure being enacted.  The Commission response stated that it would further assess this issue when the draft regulations on the format of the warning are submitted to it.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of this measure is to provide health information to the consumer on the link between alcohol and fatal cancers.  It is no more than that.  The result of the provision will be that consumers will be made aware of the settled international scientific consensus that there is a link between alcohol and cancers and he or she can make a decision on that basis.<\/p> <p>  Rather than discussing why we should introduce this measure perhaps the real questions is why should we as consumers not know about the direct link between alcohol and fatal cancers.  The 2016 Healthy Ireland survey found that only 21% of respondents were aware of the link between alcohol and breast cancer when drinking more than the recommended number of standard drinks and only 16% of women between the ages of 15 and 24 knew of it.  Only 40% knew of the risk in relation to bowel cancer.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 13 proposes to delete the reference to the link with cancer on the notices that will be placed on premises which sell alcohol in reusable containers such as by the glass in an on-licensed premises.  I do not see why the consumer who buys alcohol by the glass should not have access to the same information as one who buys it in a labelled container.  Amendment No. 20 removes the warning from advertisements.  The provisions on advertising are designed so that consumers can make informed choices about drinking alcohol but also to ensure that advertisements for alcohol products will no longer be able to portray alcohol as being entirely positive and risk free.<\/p><p>Billions of euro have been spent each year on the advertising of alcohol and research demonstrates it is effective.  As legislators, we have the responsibility to balance the risk-free messaging in advertising with factual information about its risks.  For these reasons I do not propose to accept the amendments.<\/p><p> Deputy Durkan spoke about competition and this will apply to all products sold in the State and will not apply to any products intended for sale outside the State.  There will be no case where an Irish product will be required to have such information and compete with products manufactured elsewhere.  Deputy Kelly dealt with labelling with cancer warnings.  As Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion I know it is very important to communicate to members of the public the proven harm that alcohol can cause to health and that the wide range of serious illnesses caused by alcohol includes cancer.  I also acknowledge the work of the Irish Cancer Society on this matter.  Members of the Opposition may push an amendment to remove the cancer warning but it can be dealt with again on Report Stage if the amendment is withdrawn.  In the meantime I will speak to the Minister about this again.  I do not know if that would be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#F00700","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":469,"content":"<p>There is a reference to measurement of calories, which the Minister of State mentioned earlier.

This provision echoes the approach to that taken to licensed premises in the Bill selling products that do not have a label.  However, there is a significant difference.  It is fair to say that we are all likely to spend more time in a restaurant or pub than in an airport shop.  The time spent in a licensed premises means that the message on the notice has more time to attract our attention, once or several times, and perhaps even encourage discussions on its contents with those around us.  There is no similarity between this and an airport, which for the majority of consumers is a place that we are passing through in a hurry with an eye on a flight time.<\/p> <p>  One of the strengths of this provision as it currently stands is that no unfair competition is created within the State.  Every retailer in the State must sell products with the health information on them and they are not forced to compete with another retailer who does not have to have this information on its stock.  It will undermine the fairness of the provisions if retailers in airports are allowed to sell products without that information on the product.  Finally I do not wish to introduce any unnecessary complexity for suppliers that deal strictly with the domestic market.  The provision as it stands requires that all products sold in the State must have health information.  I see no reason to introduce a further requirement that suppliers will have to distinguish between products for airports and products for other retail outlets in the State.  For these reasons I do not propose to accept these amendments.

This requirement was provided for in an amendment to the Bill that was accepted on Report Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I note other Deputies have also proposed removal of this provision.  I am proposing to remove it as a result of its assessment by the European Commission.<\/p><p>The provision was assessed under Directive EU 2015\/1535, laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on information society services.  That assessment examined the provision in the context of Article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Article 34 prohibits a legislative measure which has an equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction on imports.  Member states are allowed by Article 36 of the treaty to enact such a measure for the protection of health only if it can be shown that the measure is proportionate.  To be proportionate, a measure must not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain its objective.<\/p><p>In its comments on the requirement that at least one third of the size of the printed material on the alcohol product be given over to evidence-based health warnings, the European Commission said that it was not proportionate.  It is the Commission's view that the objective of the protection of health through provision of health warnings on alcohol products could be met by a lesser restriction, such as a requirement that the health warning be of a smaller, yet visible, size.  The purpose of providing for health warnings on alcohol products is to make us all aware of the health risks associated with alcohol so that we can make an informed choice.  If those warnings are visible, then the objective is achieved.  The requirement that a proportion of the printed material be given over to such a warning does on the face of it go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives.  It might prove very difficult for Ireland to defend the measure in the Court of Justice of the European Union.  For this reason I propose to remove this requirement and, as was the original intent of the Bill, provide for the forms of warnings on labels to be determined in regulations to be made under section 12(10)(a).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#H01600","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Presumably this will comply with EU regulations and directives and the ministerial regulations that are to follow will also comply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#H01700","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":499,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#H01800","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Presumably, it will apply to all products sold in this country, whether imported or otherwise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#H01900","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":501,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#J00100","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":502,"content":"<p>How will that labelling be done?

Equally, those from outside the State who wish to sell in the State will have to comply with our rules, however that happens.  My understanding is that can happen in a variety of ways.  Either labelling can be done where the product is manufactured or the distributors can attach an additional label, which is the case with other products.  A multiplicity of labels for different markets already exists within the industry.  We simply would be requiring a specific label for this State.  The hope is that we will be a leading light and other countries will eventually take our lead, which would make the requirement significantly less onerous as one label became more useful in more countries.

The provision relates to one third of the printed material.  Many medical products use concertina labels, so something could be a part of the label without actually being seen.  It is hidden in a little envelope of sorts on the side.  We should be conscious of that and ensure that \"one third of labelling\" means \"one third of visible labelling\" rather than \"one third of total labelling on the bottle\".<\/p> <p>  The idea that putting a label on a bottle is a massive job and has a significant cost is almost like saying there is someone going around with a roll of labels sticking them on each bottle.  It is a cheap and simple thing to do, but it is being beefed up into something far greater.  We can get this to work for imported medicines with overlabelling, so I cannot see any barrier to doing the same in respect of alcohol.  We are labelling for the Irish people and the Irish market, and we do not need to be overly concerned about other countries' behaviour.  With the smoking ban, we were the leading country.  As Deputy O'Reilly mentioned, we could be the lead in this respect as well and other countries could follow suit.<\/p> <p>  I do not ever want to fall out with Deputy Durkan, but the irradiation of food having a similar carcinogenic effect as alcohol is just a little bit of a sweeping statement for the health committee on a Wednesday morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#J00700","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":508,"content":"<p>No, no.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#J00800","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":509,"content":"<p>If the Deputy would like to provide the data-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#J00900","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#J01000","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":511,"content":"<p>-----we can have a big fight about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018062000002#J01100","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1529481600,"counter":512,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":513,"content":"<p>That claim has emerged.

The offence under the Bill relates to selling alcohol products within the State without the required warning and information.  Any person who sells an alcohol product without the required warning and information can be prosecuted under the section.  The range of persons who can be prosecuted includes wholesalers, manufacturers and retailers.  If a product is manufactured in the State without the required labelling information and products are sold to a retailer or wholesaler in the State, the manufacturer can be prosecuted.  The wholesaler and retailer also may be prosecuted if they sell the product on without the required labelling.  It is not an offence to import for sale in the State an alcohol product that does not bear the required information and warning.  However, a person who imports an alcohol product that does not have the required labelling and sells the product within the State without affixing the required information and warning will be prosecuted.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Donnelly's question, this will be done by way of regulations, which will have to include a provision that labelling will be visible.  I have no idea how the label will appear until those regulations are in place.  I am sure the questions of what the label looks like, how it will be positioned and how the contents will be visible will be subject to scrutiny, but people should not have to bring magnifying glasses with them to the supermarket just to read the labelling.

It is not just a public health measure but also a child protection measure.  All evidence suggests that the earlier a person is initiated into alcohol consumption, the greater the likelihood of negative alcohol-related outcomes later in life.  As such, one of the key aims of alcohol policy should be to delay that initiation into drinking among young people.  Many of the measures in this Bill are targeted at that.  For example, alcohol-related merchandise will not be sold in sizes suitable for children under this Bill, which is a good idea.  However, the prohibition on outdoor advertising within 200 m of schools, while welcome, suggests that children only exist within the school environment.  They have to come and go from school, they socialise and they live in communities.  Where there is outdoor advertising, it is not possible to simply shield the eyes of the child.  It does not work like that.  The logic is that advertising will not be permitted within 200 m but will be allowed within 201 m.  If we are serious about this it has to be more than a simple box-ticking exercise.  Concrete measures must be taken on child protection.<\/p><p>The second amendment defines a &quot;public place&quot;.

As a first step in restricting the advertising of alcohol products outdoors, it was considered appropriate to target the restrictions at areas most frequented by children and young people.  The Bill, therefore, provides that a person shall not advertise, or cause the advertisement of an alcohol product in a park or open space owned or maintained by a local authority or the Office of Public Works, OPW; in or on a public service vehicle; in or on a train or on a light rail vehicle; in or at a train or bus station; at a designated bus or Luas stop, in or at a school, including its grounds, or within 200 m of the perimeter of the grounds; in or at a place where an early years service is carried on or within 200 m of its perimeter; or in or at a playground owned or maintained by a local authority or within 200 m of the perimeter of such playground.<\/p> <p>  Section 21 provides that there must be a review of all the advertising provisions within three years of the commencement of that section.

The Bill also has significant relevance to children living in Ireland.  Where a child enters his or her own local shop or garage, he or she will not see alcohol products or alcohol advertising in the general area of the shop.  Clothing intended for wear by children that refers to or promotes an alcohol product will not be manufactured, imported or sold in the State.

When a child attends an event specifically for children, he or she will be exposed to alcohol images or messages.

Opposition amendment No. 28 proposes to prohibit sports sponsorship by 31 December 2023.  This topic was examined and debated at length prior to the publication of the Bill.  A consensus could not be reached on a prohibition on sports sponsorship.  There have been many discussions about the pros and cons of banning alcohol sponsorship of sports in Ireland.  The main arguments in favour of a ban have centred around concerns about patterns of alcohol consumption and related harms and the \"normalising\" of drinking this sponsorship purportedly brings about.  The arguments against such a ban were that the funding gap left by such a move would be extremely difficult to bridge, affecting all levels of sports, including grassroots levels for young people.  There is a lack of specific evidence that such a ban would be effective.  During discussions with the Joint Committee on Health and Children at the time, the then Minister, now Taoiseach, indicated that in the medium term a ban on alcohol sponsorship was not realistic.  Therefore, as a beginning, the measures in the Bill aim to restrict the alcohol advertising permitted at sporting events and the sponsorship of events in which the majority of participants or competitors are children, events aimed particularly at children or events involving the driving or racing of motor vehicles.  The Bill provides at section 21 that there must be a review of all the advertising provisions within three years of the commencement of that section.

Subsection (6) of section 18 relates to a publication that is published by or on behalf of the holder of an off-licence where such a publication is intended to promote the sale of alcohol products in the off-licensed premises.  As set out in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill as initiated, it was intended that such publications would be exempted from certain requirements of section 18 in recognition that they are of a special category.  The intention was to exempt such publications from the prohibitions in section 18(2) on alcohol advertisements on the front and back cover of a publication and on any wrapper or other covering in which they are contained.<\/p><p>In addition, it was intended to exempt them from prohibition in section 18(3) on the importation of publications which have more than 20% of their advertising space given over to alcohol advertisements or which contain advertisements in breach of section 18(2).

These reports were prepared by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and the inter-agency group on homelessness chaired by Mr. John Murphy, former Secretary General.  I am joined by Ms Mary Hurley, assistant secretary, who has responsibility for social housing and homelessness, and Mr. David Kelly, principal officer, who has responsibility for the Department's homelessness and housing inclusion supports unit.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate that tackling homelessness continues to be a top priority for the Government.  I have always said that one family in emergency accommodation or one individual on the street is one too many and that remains my position.  Working with my Department and local authorities, the committee can be assured that every effort will continue to be made to address this issue.  The two reports that I have recently received will be carefully considered and any further policy responses that may be required will be brought forward to ensure we continue to provide individuals and families with the supports they need.  Resources and funding are not an issue, and I have made the point to local authorities many times that all the required funding and resources of the State are available to them to advance new initiatives in response to homelessness in their local areas.  I have emphasised the importance of being innovative in their responses to homelessness and in providing the most suitable and appropriate solutions and supports to those experiencing homelessness in their local areas.<\/p> <p>  While homeless families and individuals continue to present, it is important to note that progress is also being made on the ground.  The number of people sleeping rough has fallen dramatically.  In April 2018, the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, undertook a count of rough sleepers and confirmed that the number had reduced by 40%, from 184 in November 2017 to 110 in April 2018.  Housing First is working, with a new national director and a retention rate of almost 90%.  This shows that we are keeping people out of homelessness once we get them into a home.  In 2017, 4,729 individuals exited homelessness, which is a 54% increase on the previous year.  The number accommodated in hotels still remains below the high level it reached in 2017.  There are now 22 family hubs in place and these are the preferred first response.<\/p> <p>  People are spending less time now in emergency accommodation than they did previously, thanks primarily to the new family hubs, with 45% of families in emergency accommodation exiting within six months.<\/p><p>Through the dedicated efforts of exit teams, 2,080 families left hotels last year, the majority of whom moved into homes rather than hubs.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, despite the number of exits from homelessness that we are achieving, ongoing presentations to homeless services mean the number of people in emergency accommodation remains unacceptably high.  According to the April homelessness report, there were 5,963 adults in emergency accommodation, including 1,712 families with 3,689 of dependants.  At my request, research was conducted earlier this year and a comprehensive report was submitted last week by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  The report, which is available on my Department's website, includes detailed information across a range of areas, including reasons for family homelessness; prevention activities; citizenship of service users; the use of emergency accommodation; and exits from emergency accommodation.  I very much welcome the progress, outlined in the report, that the DRHE is making in preventing households from becoming homeless.  There is scope for us to do more in this area, particularly as the report refers to the number of individuals who are unwilling to consider a HAP supported tenancy in the private rental sector as a housing solution.<\/p><p> The report examines the reasons for family homelessness, with the vast bulk of presentations relating either to family circumstances or issues with private rented accommodation.  The data collected on presentations arising from issues with private rented accommodation are not sufficiently detailed to allow us to analyse the reasons in most cases, but where sufficient information is provided, the issues specified mainly relate to the sale of a property.<\/p><p> With regard to exits from emergency accommodation, the report noted that families will typically exit emergency accommodation within a quicker timeframe when residing in a family hub rather than a hotel or bed and breakfast accommodation.  This emphasises the importance of the continued development of family hubs.  While I would prefer not to have any families in emergency accommodation, it is clear that a hub provides a better temporary solution than a hotel, and hubs are only temporary.  The report identified that approximately 500 people with a range of medical conditions are being accommodated in emergency accommodation.  For the majority of these individuals, Housing First will not be the answer and their complex needs may require longer term supported accommodation.  The report outlines that 595 offers of social housing were made to households in emergency accommodation, of which 81% were accepted.  It also notes that families willing to avail of HAP were found to exit from homelessness much faster than families that exited through an offer of local authority or approved housing body tenancies.<\/p><p> Details of the citizenship of services users are also included in the report, with Irish nationals accounting for 67% of users of emergency accommodation, other EU nationals accounting for 12% and non-EU nationals accounting for 21%.  A number of the issues identified in the DRHE report highlight areas where other arms of government have a role to play and agencies such as the Health Service Executive and Tusla are actively involved in the response to homelessness.  To ensure the State's response to homelessness is effectively co-ordinated, I established the homelessness inter-agency group following the housing summit of last year.  The group is chaired by Mr. John Murphy, former Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The group includes representation from my Department, the Department of Health, the HSE, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform, the County and City Management Association, the DRHE and Tusla.  The group recently submitted a report to me, setting out a number of recommendations to improve the State's response to homelessness.  A number of recommendations relate to areas within my Department's remit.  It is my intention to bring forward policy responses to address these recommendations within a short timeframe.<\/p><p> While there is much work that we can do to prevent homelessness and improve the experiences of those who become homeless, the real issue my Department is striving to address is the delivery of more houses.  We will continue to face a serious challenge with people presenting to our services until significantly more homes are built, both in the social and private housing areas.  Rebuilding Ireland is a six-year programme to bring our housing sector back to a stable state and we will achieve sustainable progress on the homeless front as new homes are delivered.  Last year alone, more than 26,000 additional households had their social housing need met, utilising a budget of &euro;1.4 billion.  To build on this progress and meet the needs of additional households, the budget was increased by 36% this year to &euro;1.9 billion.<\/p><p> We must bear in mind, as is made clear in both reports, that for many people in emergency accommodation today, simply providing a home will not be the answer.  Their needs are more complex and we must be sensitive to those needs.  That requires more complex policy responses that take time to implement and will not always be successful in the first instance.<\/p><p> I look forward to engaging with the committee members on the reports, both of which have now been published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#B00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":625,"content":"<p>For members who have just arrived, each member will have five minutes to ask questions and there will be five minutes for answers.

Fundamentally, we are all committed to ending homelessness and doing what we can to ensure that happens.  Clarity and transparency are important when dealing with homeless figures.  What is the Department's response to Focus Ireland's view of the report set out this morning by Mr. Mike Allen when he described the report as \"a communications strategy for bad news rather than a research strategy to resolve a problem\".  That is a serious charge, I would have thought, from a group which is on the front line in dealing with homelessness.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions that I want to go through because we are restricted to five minutes and I would appreciate the Minister's response.  The report states clearly that the Government intends to achieve capacity for a more detailed analysis.  How will that be done given that less information will be available from quarterly reporting as opposed to monthly reporting?  I wonder what is the rationale for the decision to move to quarterly reporting and how that will be done.  If the Minister has fewer data that he is willing to publish, how will it be easier to look at trends and react proactively to remove people from risk areas?<\/p> <p>  Although I do not want to jump from one issue to another, I want to ask about the homeless inter-agency group which was set up in 2007.  I have raised this issue by way of parliamentary question.  I understand the group only met once in 2017.  Has it been formally replaced?  Is the Minister using other structures?  If anything, I would have thought he would consider reactivating the inter-agency group.  From my perspective, it is crucially important that we have more, not less, oversight.<\/p> <p>  Focus Ireland also takes issue with the fact that the report does not mention the overwhelming evidence of a growing shortage of properties available within the rent limits applied under the housing assistance payment, HAP.  Will the limits be revised?  I note work has been done in risk areas on stopping families falling into homelessness.  Will the Minister elaborate on that work?  I was not too sure when I heard Ms Eileen Gleeson mention on \"Morning Ireland\" that the Dublin Region Housing Executive did not regard HAP limits as a problem or one of the reasons people were falling into homelessness.  I ask the Minister to address those couple of issues and I will come back in afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#C00300","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":627,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Darragh O'Brien for his questions.  His first point related to the response to the report from Focus Ireland.  The response of Focus Ireland, in attacking the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive in this way, was disappointing.  The DRHE is on the front line, helping thousands of people and doing an incredible amount of work.  It works with Focus Ireland, Dublin Simon and the Peter McVerry Trust and together these organisations do excellent work.<\/p> <p>  This report is a detailed study, although not as detailed as I would like it to be.  It is clear that we need to do more work in this area.  The report also comes with some robust recommendations and speaks to some truths that we need to speak to regarding people's fears around HAP.  We need to be honest about these matters.<\/p> <p>  It is a welcome report.  I am interested in driving the solutions and working together with the committee to do that.  That is what we should be focused on.  Focus Ireland seemed to have picked a particular line out of the inter-agency group report, which is a different a report, and attacked the DRHE on that basis.  There is a misinterpretation of the relevant line in the inter-agency group report and maybe we can come back to that in a further round of questions.<\/p> <p>  No decision has been made on the recommendation in both reports that we move to quarterly reporting and we will not jump to a decision either.  What we have is the kind of detail that we would like to see in a quarterly report and some additional detail.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that increased frequency does not mean increased transparency.  There is a reason a number of bodies produce quarterly reports.  We can better understand trends over one quarter and get more detail and the kind of detail that we do not get in monthly reporting.  Monthly reporting gives us different figures, some of which increase, while others decrease, but does not give us the detailed information that we have in this report.  We need to reform the pathway accommodation and support system of information known as PASS to obtain more detailed information in it.  We will see if it can be upgraded and ascertain what is the best way to publish information that informs us about matters that are helpful in terms of policy formation.  The report has told us something helpful about HAP - I am sure we will get into that in more detail - that the monthly reports do not tell us.<\/p> <p>  On the operation of HAP, roughly 2,270 tenancies have been established through HAP this year alone.  That includes the establishment of approximately 900 homeless HAP tenancies.  We continue to establish 300 to 350 HAP tenancies a week.  HAP is working; it is successful.<\/p><p>There are some problems that need to be fixed and thus help people who get trapped in emergency accommodation or fear going down the HAP route because of either what they have heard or it might not meet some of the needs they feel a permanent home would meet, which I understand.  We need to talk about some policy responses that will help fix those issues. <\/p><p> An inter-agency group was established following the September housing summit but I think the Deputy referred to another group called the national homeless consultative committee, NHCC.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#C00400","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":629,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#D00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":630,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that the committee will meet again this year.

The Minister has mentioned that there has been a focus on HAP, in particular the fears about same, and I have discussed them with his officials.  Let us bear in mind that sometimes one is placed on a housing transfer housing list when one avails of HAP.  The local authorities do not deal with HAP in a uniform manner.  I believe that many people will decide not to transfer to HAP because they believe they will not remain on the main housing list.  That is a big problem for people who are eight, nine or ten years on a housing list.  It is a problem when the Department says: \"Okay, you are on HAP now, we may be able to assist in sourcing a rental property that has a 12-month lease but you are not on the housing list.\"  However, later one is told that one is not on the housing list but on the transfer list.  The resistance to HAP is, therefore, understandable.  I urge the Minister to change that provision and for a uniform approach to be adopted across the country.<\/p> <p>  We need a uniform approach to be adopted for the additional discretionary payment for HAP, and also where people receive top-up payments and assistance from their families.  I have heard of instances where HAP has been refused in total because a local authority has not allowed an additional top-up payment.  More important, this matter is about the uniform nature of the application of the HAP and where a person or family is placed on a housing list.  When the Department must explain that a person or family has been moved to the transfer list and that there is another main housing list, then all of us can understand why there is a serious concern and resistance to the scheme.    <\/p> <p>  Some very good items have been highlighted in the report about the fears and limitations of HAP.  How quickly will the Minister implement these changes?  He has indicated that he will take the views of committee members on board.  I urge him to ensure that if someone goes on HAP that he or she remains on the main housing list and to remove all ambiguity about the matter.  Perhaps there is no resistance to doing so but I do not understand why such a provision has not been made up to now.  Removing all ambiguity about the matter would make a massive difference straight away.  The Minister would certainly have my support if he decided to adopt my proposed change.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#D00800","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":636,"content":"<p>The purpose of this engagement is to hear the views of the committee members as to what they think, as a committee or individual representatives, is the best way forward based on the information in the reports.

Some HAP tenancies have failed but tenancies in the normal private sector fail too.  Social housing for homeless people fails for tenants as well.  Legislation provides that one must ensure that a place meets the housing need of the person so he or she comes off the housing list.  For the vast majority of people, HAP meets the housing need.  However, we must ensure that local authorities use the transfer list because fewer than 1,000 people have come off the transfer list to date.

As a committee, we invited the Minister to come here to provide us with the detail as to why those people were removed from the list and allow us to properly interrogate the matter.  He said that he could not meet us at that time because he was waiting for more detailed information.  He also told us that two reports were going to be produced, one by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, and another by the inter-agency group, and that when their reports were completed he would come in here to talk to us about the issue of alleged miscategorisation.  We raised the issue again after April had passed and then we organised today's meeting.  In the first instance, the people who requested this meeting want it to be about the miscategorisation, as the Minister called it, of 875 adults and children.  Yet nowhere in either of the reports that has been presented to us has the Minister given us the information that we sought two months ago.  We asked for the figure of 875 adults and children to be broken down into the number of adults and children in each of the affected local authority areas, and the types of accommodation and arrangements they were in at the point at which it was decided to remove them from the monthly reporting lists.  Such information was requested as it would allow us to interrogate whether the measures were appropriate.  Was the Minister misinformed about the contents of these reports that led him to tell us that we could have an informed discussion when the reports were put in front of us?  Has something changed?  Why does the Minister still refuse to give us the information?  I refer him to two or three parliamentary questions requesting the information but to no avail.

It was not just me who wanted it to happen.  I am more than happy to discuss the reports because there are many interesting things to say about them, but they are not what the invitation to attend the meeting was related to.  The Minister has been invited in the first instance to help us to get to the bottom of this matter.  If he is right when he says all 875 adults and children have been erroneously miscategorised, he should give us the information to enable us to make a decision on it.  The difficulty is two months have passed since the initial decision was made.  It is clear that the Department has information on the 875 individuals.  Given that we have been asking for this information for two months, I do not understand why the Minister will not share it.  If he believes he can convince the committee that miscategorisation has happened, he should do so.  I have expressed my views on the matter.  I have gone to each of the local authorities that have been affected by it and able to identify 20 households that I think have been miscategorised.  All of the information I have on the others involved who comprise the overwhelming majority of the 874 adults and children in question suggests they were not miscategorised.  They were homeless at the time when they were removed from the figures.  We cannot make progress because the Minister will not share the information with us.

We are confused because he will not give us the information he has available.  One of my concerns about the reports is that we all know that the reluctance to engage with the HAP scheme is an issue.  There is nothing new in the reports and there are no data to substantiate them.  I am very concerned by the line in the inter-agency report that refers to the withdrawal of emergency accommodation from people on the basis of their difficulties with the HAP scheme.  The reports are silent on the solutions to the crucial problems with the HAP scheme.  If a family moves to the HAP scheme, the length of time they will have to wait before they get a council house is extended and, in many cases, greatly extended.  There is a six-year wait on South Dublin County Council's transfer list.  There is a genuine fear of insecurity in the private rental sector.  There is a lot of misreporting or misinformation in the media today about people refusing the housing assistance payment, even though that interpretation is not supported by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive report.  Ms Eileen Gleeson said this morning that there was a degree of nervousness in that regard.  The solution is to do what South Dublin County Council is doing which is not even mentioned in either report.  It involves allowing people in receipt of the housing assistance payment to continue to access the mainstream choice-based letting list on the same basis they have done so previously.  This ensures they are not disadvantaged in any way by moving to the HAP scheme.  I would like to know why this option to solve the problem is not mentioned in either of the reports.<\/p> <p>  I do not like to be critical of those who produce these reports, but I have a difficulty with the wording used in one section of a recent report which claimed, \"It can be assumed that a significant percentage of the Non-EU individuals may not have entitlement to housing support\".  I do not think that can be assumed.  Either there are data to show that non-Irish families do not have an entitlement to a housing needs assessment, or there are not.  The idea that it \"can be assumed\" out a very dangerous signal.  Perhaps there are data to back it up.  If there are, I would like the Minister to share them with us.<\/p> <p>  It would be an enormous mistake to move away from the monthly reports.  I am one of the few who spend a great deal of time looking at the quarterly reports.  They are very good, but the problem is that they receive virtually no media coverage.  It takes approximately a day and a half to try to interpret them because they are complex and difficult to understand.  The value of the monthly reports - it is different - is that they provide a clear monthly indicator of whether things are getting better or worse, almost like a canary in a coal mine.  I understand the reasons for the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive's proposal to move to quarterly reporting.  Although I disagree with these reasons, I respect them.  If the Minister moves to quarterly reporting, rightly or wrongly, it will give people the impression that he is looking to conceal the month on month fluctuations in the homeless figures at a time when they are potentially getting worse.  It would be an enormous mistake to hide them in a much bigger and more turgid quarterly report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#E00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":654,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.

It would be completely out of line to do so.  The line in the inter-agency report that has been mentioned has been misinterpreted.  I do not know why that has occurred.  The report was produced independently of me.  It is clear that the relevant part of the report states we need to look at how we can improve the HAP scheme and when we have done so, we will need to go back and see whether there is still an issue with people moving into the private rental sector.  That is how I read the line in question.  When I spoke about this yesterday, I made it clear that no one was talking about a threat to remove emergency support from people who were facing this crisis in their lives.  That would not solve any problem; rather, it would make things far worse for them, which is not the business we are in.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the nervousness with regard to the HAP scheme.  I think a line in one of the reports suggests this nervousness relates more to the concept of the HAP scheme, which is an indication that changes need to be made.  If someone is electing to move into emergency accommodation, rather than a private rented home, there is a flaw in the system.  What is unfortunate is that people are becoming trapped in emergency accommodation because they are developing a fear of moving into the private rental sector.  We have to address such issues.  Some potential solutions are mentioned in the reports, but they do not cover all of the ideas.

It is for the same reason I will be having an engagement with the local authorities at the next housing summit.<\/p> <p>  When there was some talk about non-EU nationals a few months ago, some unhelpful quotes appeared in certain newspapers.  The fear is someone might be trapped in emergency accommodation because we have been unable to assess appropriately what his or her status is and whether he or she is in the right type of accommodation.  It depends on the person's status, whether he or she is seeking asylum, whether there are other complications in his or her past and how he or she came here.  Our first response must always be one of compassion and care.  It must involve getting such a person into the system, looking after him or her and giving him or her support immediately.  We can then try to find a sustainable path for him or her.  That is on what we want to focus as we follow up on the inter-agency report and its recommendations.  I have had a number of engagements with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on how we will work together to make sure we can do this.  This is not just about people who are non-Irish or non-EU nationals.  It also relates to protocols for the release of prisoners, etc.  If there is a risk people who are coming out of prison might move into homelessness immediately, we need to look at how we can prevent that from happening.<\/p> <p>  The monthly reporting is not clear.  When I receive this form of information in my office every month, I find when I start to ask questions that matters are not clear because the details for which I am looking have not been compiled.  The month on month data are not useful in understanding trends or other things - one month we will see one number up and another down.  We saw when the miscategorisation issue arose that the numbers were not necessarily the right ones.  Some local authorities may have been too hasty in reporting back to the regional executive which then reports to us.  We have to be careful what we are reporting is accurate.  The Deputy is worried about the impression I might give if we were to move to quarterly reporting.  He is concerned I might not want to talk about the numbers.

There is a lot of meat in them and a lot to glean and learn from them.  However, it is very disappointing to see that there are still substantial numbers of people in emergency accommodation in hotels.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Coveney, was exceptionally ambitious and I always admire a brave politician who sets down statistics, figures and objectives to achieve but it is exceptionally disappointing to see the number of people who are going back to hotel rooms at night and calling them home.

While it is true, as Deputy Boyd Barrett pointed out, that a hotel room is preferable to nothing, this was one of the key objectives of the Government and it has not been achieved.  We must keep the focus on this issue.<\/p> <p>  According to the homelessness reports for April, there were 5,963 adults in emergency accommodation, comprising 1,712 families with 3,689 dependants.  I accept what the Minister has said about many of those individuals having complex needs but we must face the challenge and address their needs.  A number of issues are highlighted in the reports but we must not lose sight of the fact that the figure itself is huge.  Where can we find comfort in terms of how we can cut those figures?  They are staggering and must be addressed.  We have a housing crisis and a change in Minister is not going to change that situation.  We have to work together, pool our resources and knowledge and support those providing front-line services who are trying to deliver.  I do not doubt the motives of anyone in here.  Everyone in here, of all parties and none, is absolutely committed to addressing the homelessness issue, as well as the problems with regard to social and affordable housing.  In reality, there are lots of people who would like to purchase a house but cannot afford to do so.  They are also on our social housing lists.  <\/p> <p>  I am aware that the Department wrote to the local authorities earlier this year seeking details on accommodation categories being recorded for the individuals and families in emergency accommodation in their areas.  The Minister has said that the work is ongoing and that the survey being conducted is not yet complete.  It would be very helpful for this committee to get a copy of that survey when it is complete.  We need to see the data from the Department's survey as well as the feedback from local authorities.  That will help us to understand better the complexities of the problem and the challenges that lie ahead.  That information is critical and I would ask that the correspondence and feedback from the survey be forwarded to the committee as soon as it becomes available.<\/p> <p>  The Minister will be appointing a new chairman to the board of the National Oversight and Audit Committee, NOAC, in the coming weeks.  That organisation has done a lot of oversight work on figures and statistics relating to the local authorities but it could do a lot more if it had more resources.  Given that a new chairman will be appointed soon, perhaps now is the time to look at that.  Would there be value in having an oversight body such as NOAC to set certain criteria, examine the data set and scrutinise the figures in detail prior to them being published?  An awful lot of the debate now is centring on statistics and figures rather than on the delivery of homes for people.  So much of the debate in the D&aacute;il, Seanad and at this committee has focused on the figures, the length of time people have been waiting and so forth.  Too much expertise and knowledge is being tied up in this area.  We need to use the resources we have to focus on providing homes for people because that is the bottom line.  I have no hang up about who owns those homes or who has built them; I just want homes for people.  I would ask the Minister to examine whether there is a role for NOAC in examining and validating the figures.  The figures must be credible and independently validated in order for people to believe them.  I await the Minister's reply to that question and would ask again that the aforementioned survey results be forwarded to this committee as soon as it is complete.  I ask for a report on the data requested by the Minister from the local authorities as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#F00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":667,"content":"<p>Senators Boyhan and Murnane O'Connor will have to leave at around 6 p.m. so I will allow the latter to speak now before calling on the Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#F00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":668,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

Unless major changes are made to the HAP scheme, we will end up with more homeless people in rural areas because rents are increasing in all of the areas that have not been designated as rent pressure zones.  More and more people are coming to my office who will become homeless shortly.  The homelessness crisis is causing many people to fall through the net.  <\/p> <p>  The Department is holding a summit involving all of the local authorities shortly.  The Minister needs to sit down with them and stress the importance of joined up thinking.  I know of areas where no homeless clinics are held and I know of local authority areas that have no emergency staff available at weekends.  What is happening at local authority level?  The local authorities are key because they are at the coal face.  They are also the source of the Minister's figures.  I believe that every local authority should have a homeless clinic but that is not the case at present.  I urge the Minister to obtain the relevant information from the local authorities in the coming weeks so that this committee can determine what exactly is happening in each local authority area.  The Minister has started to move on quite an amount of legislation, for which he must be given credit.  Furthermore, in my own area in Carlow, the local authority is buying houses and the Department is definitely providing funding for the building and purchasing of homes.  Progress is being made, albeit slowly.  Homelessness is still a major issue but if the funding is provided and the local authorities address the issues involved, it will be sorted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#F00400","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":669,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their questions.  I absolutely agree with Senator Boyhan that the numbers in hotels are very disappointing.  It is unacceptable.  Putting a family in a hotel is not the appropriate first response and that is why we have moved to the hubs programme.  It is important to have targets in order to drive policy but when it comes to families, the issues are far more complex than people might have realised initially.  The hub programme has been far more successful in terms of being able to move people on into sustainable accommodation.  We have 500 family hub spaces at the moment, with another 400 coming on stream in the next six to eight months.  If one compares the figure for people in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation today with a year ago, it is the same which makes people think nothing has happened.<\/p><p>More than 2,000 families exited hotels, the majority of them into homes rather than hubs.  Exits have continued but so, too, have presentations and so we continue to have to accommodate people in hotels.  We hope to get to the point in the coming months where this will no longer be the case for new presentations.  We will continue to work with the families in hotels and bed and breakfasts to get them into sustainable homes.  <\/p><p> Reference was made to the homelessness report for April and children.  We will debate that report in the D&aacute;il next week.  As part of the inter-agency group work, along with my officials I have been working with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, to ensure appropriate supports are in place for children and we keep them to the fore as we design policy responses.  We take great care in looking after families.  Last month, the number of families was down but the number of dependants was up because a small number of families presented with more children.  We continue to face challenges finding suitable accommodation for larger families in the social housing stock and in other areas.  <\/p><p> On the categorisation survey, when I have that information I will move quickly to publish it and then we can have a debate on it.  On the appointment of a chairperson for the National Oversight and Audit Committee, NOAC, if the person selected accepts the appointment, the appointment will be made soon.  This person, whom I know, knows a lot about the local authority system and has many ambitions in terms of reform of the system.  Senator Boyhan spoke about a layer of oversight by NOAC.  I am open to considering the proposal.  It has been suggested to me that the work to be done around homeless figures should be conducted by the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  In opening up that possibility, I do not want to in any way undermine the work being by the Department and the local authorities.  As evidenced by the CSO's work on the completions data, it has better data sets and bigger teams and we need to explore if it might be able to do a piece of work on this area.<\/p><p> Senator Murnane O'Connor raised a number of questions but she has left the meeting.

The Senator also mentioned local authority homeless clinics.  If a need for them is identified, we will put funding in place for them.  In terms of emergency and weekend operations, I can only speak to my own experience with local authorities.  The local authorities are represented on the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, and while there have been very unfortunate situations where a person in emergency accommodation or sleeping rough has died the executive does interact with people late into the night, early in the morning and at weekends.<\/p><p>On the order of priority in terms of exiting hubs, it depends on the needs and circumstances of the family, including size, the location of choice and so on.  The local authority works closely with the hub operators to ensure there are no unnecessary delays for families exiting hubs.  The data indicates that large families exist hubs in less than six months.  Senator Murnane O Connor also spoke about long-term health needs.  We know that approximately 500 people might not ever be able to exist in a tenancy without supports.  The Senator also referenced a lack of joined up thinking.  There is a lot of joined up thinking between Departments and agencies but on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>rather than formalised basis.  Some hospitals and NGOs are working together on issues such as hospital exits.  I recognise that more needs to be done and that is why I appointed the inter-agency group last September after the first housing summit.  The agency will continue its work.  It will continue to produce reports and help my Department work with other Departments to ensure that as a Government we are meeting the needs of all of the people in emergency accommodation.  In terms of my Department, I will ensure that it is not remiss in its responsibilities to work with the group and other colleagues in government to get the job done.<\/p><p>Presentations from the private rental sector accounted for almost one in two families coming into emergency accommodation.  In some cases, the survey was not completed so sufficient data was not captured.  This points to the need for more work in terms of data collection.  In cases where a reason for homelessness was given, it was properties being sold.  We need to drill down into the numbers in the cases where no reason was given and to collate data over a longer period of time to properly understand what is happening in the private rental sector.  While we continue to face a shortage in housing we will continue to face a problem in the rental sector, particularly as rents rise.  It is worth noting that in the last two quarters there has been a dramatic deceleration in quarterly increases in rent, which is to be welcomed.  In the fourth quarter of last year, rents decreased by 1.1% and by 1% in the first quarter of this year.  We will have to continue to put in place protections for renters as we bring on new supply.  We also need to develop a more mature rental sector in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#G00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#G00400","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I want to address two issues.  First, the removal of 875 people from the official homelessness statistics and, second, issues related to the housing assistance payment.  At the end of April, when the official homelessness statistics for the month of March were produced 875 people had been removed from the housing waiting lists.  According to the Department, they had been \"reclassified\".  Others used different language such as fiddling the figures, cooking the books and doctoring the statistics.  They understood that 10,000 people officially on the homeless list was politically sensitive and they sensed that the figures were kept below that number by any means necessary.  The Minister quickly went to bat and denied that was the case.  In making his defence, he made great play of the fact that two reports had been commissioned and he said that when those two reports were brought before the housing committee and society the true position would become clear.  We now have those two reports and, to be honest, they do not leave anyone any the wiser as to the reason 875 people have been taken off the homeless list.  <\/p> <p>  When the Minister was challenged about this today he said that there is a third report and it will clarify the situation but he has not told us when that report will be produced.  Will it be produced before the D&aacute;il adjourns for the summer recess in mid-July?  Will the Minister be out-the-gap at that point such that we will not have to discuss these issues until September?  No information has been presented in terms of timescale.<\/p> <p>  Eight weeks on from these reclassifications the silence in terms of a detailed forensic breakdown as to why in the opinion of the Minister and the Department each of those reclassifications was justified is damning.  The lack of evidence is damning.  People will draw their own conclusions.  There has not been total silence, however.  The assistant CEO of Dublin City Council, Mr. Brendan Kenny, said on \"Morning Ireland\" on 31 May that Dublin City Council had carried out a reclassification of more than 200 people and that these were people not living in emergency accommodation.  Reference was made to 65 families who were in private rented apartments.  Under questioning, Mr. Kenny stated that the more than 200 people concerned were not covered by any lease, were not in accommodation which was in a legal sense secure or permanent and that all or the vast bulk of them were being covered under section 10 funding, which as we know is funding for accommodation for homeless persons.  The evidence about the fiddling of the figures continues to stack up while the evidence we were promised to dismantle that argument has not been presented.   <\/p> <p>  On the housing assistance payment, HAP, under the rent supplement scheme a person in receipt of rent supplement remained on the housing waiting list, which is the fundamental difference between the rent supplement scheme and HAP.  There are other differences as well.  It is understandable why a woman who heads a family that has been ten or 12 years on the housing waiting list would be hesitant about moving from emergency accommodation to HAP accommodation.<\/p><p>That person may have had the experience of going into emergency accommodation from the private rental sector in the first place.  In fact, the statistics from the DRHE report show it is the main reason people enter emergency accommodation.  If the Minister wants to end the situation whereby families in emergency accommodation are wary of offers of HAP accommodation, I can give him a simple solution.  Let them accept the HAP offer and stay on the housing list at the same time, which is the South Dublin County Council solution.  The Minister will not do that because the whole point of HAP for him and the Government is twofold, that is, to artificially reduce housing waiting lists and privatise social housing provision.  <\/p><p> The statistics in the DRHE report on the reasons people go into emergency accommodation are very powerful.  Family circumstance is a major reason, but it is not the only reason.  People come from the private rented sector for reasons such as properties being sold, repairs, renovations and so on.  If we want to stem the rise of homelessness and people being forced into emergency accommodation, is a simple solution not to bring in legislation to ban economic evictions?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#G00500","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Barry for his questions and the points he made.  On the recategorisation issue, some people are obsessed with the wrong subject matter.  It is not about the numbers and the list, rather about the solutions.  Having 10,000 families and people in emergency accommodation, such as hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation, is not politically sensitive for me.  I find it morally abhorrent.  I would feel the same about 9,000, 6,000, 5,000 or 4,000 individuals and families living in emergency accommodation.  The charges the Deputy has laid against me are very unfair, but let us forget that for a moment.  Let us talk about solutions.  The 10,000 families and individuals affected do not tell us anything that 9,500 would not be able to tell us, namely that we have a crisis and want to find homes for people.<\/p> <p>  The two reports we have give us clarity around the different challenges we face and the different categories of people who are in emergency accommodation.  The solution is not as straightforward as building houses or finding homes for people to move into.  From reading the two reports, it is clear the situation is more complex than that.  People have long-term support needs, are unsure about their status or need other care and supports which they feel they will not get in the private market.  I understand that.<\/p> <p>  The categorisation survey will explain how each of the categories in the report is being cared for and in what kind of accommodation.  There is no third report.  The survey was meant to be part of the DRHE report, but it was not finished in time and I did not want to delay the DRHE report because I wanted to publish it before the committee sessions, something I was quite clear about.  I hoped it would be completed.  In terms of the timescale, it is almost complete and we will have it in the few weeks.  The Deputy may regard the recess as involving him being out of the gap but the Government continues to work every week even when the D&aacute;il is not sitting.  I will continue to work on these challenges on behalf of the Government and people I represent in government to try to solve these problems.<\/p> <p>  As I said, recategorisation is not the opinion of my Department.  It was agreed between local authorities and my Department when we discovered what was happening around section 10 funding.  The Deputy is misrepresenting Brendan Kenny.  Section 10 funding is for emergency accommodation, but as I said at the beginning of the year at the second housing summit prevention and being innovative are key.  Section 10 funding has been used to put people into homes where they are at no risk of falling into emergency accommodation or being tenanted.  They have their own front doors and keys and will be safe and secure.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is focusing on the wrong issue.  There is no evidence on his side that anything inappropriate has happened, other than us trying to get a better and truer picture of the people we need to help so we know how to help them.  It has been admitted by Sinn F&eacute;in that a recategorisation error occurred.  Around 1,000 people have been able to use the transfer list since the introduction of HAP.  It has been rolled out in Dublin for a year, and many people have moved from HAP into secure social housing.  We want to do more than that.  The main reason people have come from the private rental sector, as outlined in the report, was the sale of a house.  That speaks to another of my concerns, namely rental properties exiting the rental sector and being lost to renters, something which will only decrease the supply of rental accommodation.  Some of the current proposals would see a further flight of landlords from the market.  We need to encourage more landlords into the market.  It is a separate area, but all of these things are related.<\/p> <p>  The report also tells us that the majority of people who came out of the private rental sector did not give a reason as to why.  We need to drill into those figures.  Again, it speaks to the need for better and more detailed reporting which, if we want it to be accurate, will take time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#H00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":677,"content":"<p>On a specific question-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#H00300","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":678,"content":"<p>If it is ten seconds because you are over your time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#H00400","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":679,"content":"<p>It will be even less.

There is a lot of detail to get through.  I will start with homelessness.  I want to acknowledge the work that has been done in the area.  The Minister said more than 2,080 families have been taken out of emergency accommodation and now have secure tenure, something which we must acknowledge.  I understand it is a 50% increase on what was achieved in the previous year.  The most frustrating thing from everybody's point of view is that the 2,080 families who have been housed have been replaced by another 2,080 families.  We seem to be going around in circles in regard to the homelessness figures.  At times there is too much information.<\/p> <p>  The Minister's statement concerned me with regard to why people are becoming homeless.  He said the report examined the reasons families become homeless, with the vast bulk of presentations relating to family circumstances or issues with private rental accommodation.  I do not know for how many years there has been a housing crisis.  I am very disappointed that the Minister said that the data collected in regard to the presentations arising from issues with private rental accommodation is not detailed enough.  In fairness, we are five or six years into a homelessness crisis and still do not have the correct information to enable us to make the right decision, which is disappointing.<\/p> <p>  Everybody has spoken about the quarterly and monthly figures.  I will not get into the details.  We have all been used to monthly figures and a move away from them could cause certain ramifications which would be unnecessary and would take away the focus from the real issues in respect of homelessness.<\/p> <p>  The Minister might give committee some more information on one matter.  He said new presentations in respect of homelessness will not be going into hotels.  Can he expand on that statement?  Regrettably, we are still using hotels too much.<\/p> <p>  Everybody has spoken about HAP.  It is time to get rid of the HAP transfer list and put everybody on the one list.  I know of constituents who are genuinely afraid to go on to HAP because of their fear that they will not be considered for the social housing allocation.  There is genuine concern about that.  There are complications in moving from one local authority area to another, whether one is in the HAP scheme or on the general council housing list.  If I want to move from Dublin to Wicklow I will start all over again.  Local authority synergies need to be expanded so that people have more options than just the local authority area in which they are living and can transfer credits they have built up to another area.<\/p><p>It is disappointing that another glaring thing that came out of the report was just left there on its own.  There was a 19% refusal rate for offers of permanent social housing and no detail was given as to why there were refusals.  We have spoken about how choice-based letting seems to be much more successful than the general allocation.  I think that statement is on page 8 of the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, report.  It is left there in bold and it does not get into the detail of why.  I think we need to get a much better understanding of the reasons people are refusing permanent accommodation.  In another section, I think the witnesses refer to where 595 offers of permanent social housing were made to homeless people in 2017.  I will not say that people are gaming the systems because we have had that debate, but that seems quite high relative to the number of people who are on the homeless list.  Some 595 people were offered permanent solutions, yet there are only approximately 3,500 adults on the list in Dublin.  If I was a gambling man, I would have a better chance on the homeless list than I would on the housing list.  We need to clarify exactly what is happening with that.<\/p><p> Another issue, which I think the Minister, Deputy Murphy, mentioned, relates to non-nationals.  The DRHE also received a small number of referrals of non-Irish national families living in extremely overcrowded, substandard accommodation.  Do we have any knowledge of the breadth of that or the depth of what is happening with non-nationals?  It refers only to a small number of referrals and we all know that it is much bigger than what is being referred to here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#H00900","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions and for acknowledging the hard work that has happened over the last year or more.  I talk a lot with the front-line staff and know that people can sometimes feel that nothing is happening.  A huge amount of work is going on and it is important to acknowledge that, and that we need to do more, and always recognise that the work does not stop.  Presentations continue but we are not going in circles.  The hub programme and the use of housing assistance payment, HAP, show that.  People spend less time in emergency accommodation if they are in a hub and get out of emergency accommodation quicker if they are going into a HAP tenancy.  The vast majority of HAP tenancies have been successful.  We are making progress.  The Dublin authorities believe that we are beginning to see stabilisation of presentations in Dublin but one cannot tell that month to month, so there needs to be a longer reporting period.  I hope that is the case.  We will continue to put in solutions that we think are working, including new solutions that are necessary based on these reports.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right that the data in these reports are not detailed enough, even though much work was put into them.  It is interesting that the recommendation was originally for quarterly reporting of our homeless numbers, approximately four years ago, when the Department and others were looking at this.  It was decided to go with monthly reporting instead.  The scale of the challenge was not as large or complex then because it did not have the different categories of people with different and specific needs.  The amount of work that had to go into monthly reporting was not anticipated as being so great with regard to trying to understand the trends.  Where a family presents as homeless, ideally, the first measure is preventative because we have caught them early enough and can find accommodation for them, either through floating HAP stock, through HAP, or through a social housing home.  Until we get to that point, we want the hub to be the first response so that, when a family presents, no one goes anywhere near a hotel.  That is what we want to get to and why we will have 400 more family hub spaces coming online in the next six to eight months.  That is why we are going to move to a floating HAP stock.  The idea is that, rather than seeing this movement in and out of hotels, as we saw in the course of last year, we are then just talking about the numbers in hotels reducing until they are gone.  That is the aim of the policies, to get the best supports in place for people who are either at risk of homelessness or find themselves in emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I am convinced that there is more that can be done with the transfer lists so that HAP can continue to work to meet people's housing needs and not shutting off the prospect of moving into a permanent social housing home.  Inter-authority movement will be addressed because it needs to be addressed.  That is clear from this report.  There is no information on why people were refusing the offer of a permanent home in their area of choice.  We need more information on that.  We have to be very sensitive when we talk about these things, in trying not to paint everyone with the same brush.  There are challenges there.  We hear anecdotes about refusals.  We all hear them from local authorities, as politicians.  I have to work based on evidence, not anecdotes.  With regard to the non-nationals figure, we made a call around Storm Emma for people to come into emergency accommodation because if they did not, they could potentially die due to the storm.  As a result, people who were not sleeping rough in the streets or in emergency accommodation but were squatting or doing something else came into our emergency accommodation.  As they came in, we realised that there was a greater problem with non-EU nationals than we had realised before.  The difficulty with understanding why people are there, how they came to be there and what is the pathway is that there are issues around language, some of the staff on the front line not being trained in some of the justice issues that need to be addressed, and the reluctance of some, for whatever reason, to be as forthcoming as they might be.  These are challenges that we will address with the Department of Justice and Equality to make sure that the best care is given, that people understand what their rights are, and how we get them into the appropriate pathway, out of emergency accommodation, following those engagements that we have.  Some of the people on the front line are maybe not trained to deal with the large number of presentations of non-EU nationals that we saw on the back of Storm Emma.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#J00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I think the DRHE has requested clarification of the definition of homelessness.

There are two criteria there.  It puts it to the local authority to interpret those criteria and make a decision itself.  An interesting thing from a bureaucratic point of view is that someone has to be declared as homeless before he or she can get supports that would prevent him or her from becoming homeless.  That person might not be homeless at all.  One has to assess people and declare them as homeless before one can give them homeless supports.  They may never go into emergency accommodation or ever not have a roof over their heads.  We have to look at some of these issues again to see if there is terminology or a bureaucratic mechanism that is failing us with regard to being able to more quickly help people and get a proper understanding.  Although I have not had a chance to talk to the DRHE about the report yet, it might also be talking about the people who have long-term health and support needs who will never be able to sustain an independent tenancy who are currently, for whatever reason, such as section 10 funding, declared as homeless.  Is that the right thing to do?  It might also be a request for further definition under the Acts.  I will discuss this with the DRHE and at the housing summit.

I have to run.  I apologise in advance since I have to speak elsewhere in about six minutes.  I might not be able to stay for the Minister's response but I will read the transcript.  The first question I was asked to bring up with the Minister is about stopping people getting evicted, which would stop people currently going into emergency accommodation from going in.  As we know, the majority of those going in come from the private rental sector.  A specific question I was asked to ask the Minister is where the regulations are for rental properties in receivership.  It was promised in Rebuilding Ireland and has not come through yet.  Buy-to-let properties being taken over by receivers is an example of where people are being evicted and they should not have to be.  That is a specific question.  As Deputy Barry said, why does the Minister not just freeze evictions for now?  We could stop the flow.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe in HAP.  It is a bad policy.  It is effectively privatisation of social housing.  All that said, insofar as the Minister is committed to it, as I mentioned to Ms Mary Hurley earlier on, he needs to instruct the DRHE or local authorities, if people manage to find a place that will accept HAP which is over the limit, to go out of their way not to say no and then drive them into homelessness.<\/p><p>I will read this message which I got today:<\/p><blockquote>Unfortunately, due to the [bleeping] HAP rules, we are not able to rent our home in Enniskerry, which we found, as we are only able to get &euro;1,500 from Wicklow while it is &euro;1,950 in Dublin, [which is just over the border] so on Friday we are moving into a hotel in Bray, which is going to cost them [the council] &euro;4,930 a month.  Wouldn't it be easier to let me have the Dublin rate?  I am emailing Eoghan Murphy and our local TD Simon Harris as a matter of urgency.  It took me three months to find this house in Enniskerry.  There is nothing in north Wicklow under &euro;2k and Dublin is even higher.  I am so upset, angry and scared.  My daughter is distraught.  She was all set to move into the new place...<\/blockquote><p>We have to do something about examples like that.  The decision being made not to give the uplift to the Dublin rate, which is just a few miles over the border, means we are going to pay a lot more and that woman is going to be in a hotel in Bray.  This stuff has to change.<br\/><br\/>The critical point I want to make to the Minister is this.  He said he has only been in the job for the last two years, and so on and so forth.  There is a problem with HAP and we have this controversy about why people will not accept HAP tenancies, although I somewhat question that.  It is more the case that people are being told that a property has been advertised or that a landlord accepts HAP, and they are told to find the property themselves, although families with children find it very difficult to do that.  The reason they do not want this is that HAP is not social housing in the way a council house is.  Does the Minister not think it is about time to admit they are right in saying that?  He says HAP is working.  Can he be honest?  A HAP tenancy, which is maybe secure for 12 months and where people can and do get evicted, although the Minister said some HAP tenancies last longer, is not as secure as a council house.  Can the Minister admit that is true?<br\/><br\/>People are right in saying it is not the same as a council house and it should not be treated under legislation as being the same as a council house.  The decision to treat it the same as a council house was made in 2011, which is when the legislation was changed.  The initial legislation was drafted by Fianna F&aacute;il in 2009 but Fine Gael-Labour commenced it in April 2011.  Should the Minister not just admit that it was wrong?  Even if he says it is a temporary solution, and I do not think it is a good temporary solution, will he acknowledge it is not a permanent solution and should not be treated as such?  People who are on lists for years or in emergency accommodation should not be forced to accept that it is the same as a council house when they know it is not the same as a council house and does not have the same security.  If the Minister acknowledged that and allowed people to stay on the list, we would at least be facing reality, the reality that people on housing lists and in emergency accommodation have to live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#J00500","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for his questions-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#K00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":691,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett has to leave now.

It is not right and there are many anomalies within it.  There are 9,652 on the homeless list for April, 3,689 of whom are children.  The length of time people are homeless, whether in a hotel, a bed and breakfast or a hostel, is getting longer and longer.  The Minister said there was a speeding up with regard to the hubs but that is because many people from the hubs are taking HAP tenancies, where and if they can get that.  This is one of the big problems.<\/p> <p>  I have a serious concerns about HAP.  I agree with some of the other Deputies in that I am very much opposed to the whole idea of HAP.  It is a windfall for many private landlords, particularly given the way it has been introduced.  I will give one example.  In Hampton Wood in Ballymun, some 130 units were bought up by Ires REIT, a private company, and all of those units are going to HAP.  The council has so far taken 50 of these for HAP at almost &euro;1,800 for two-bedroom houses.  Let us think about that.  What person can afford that sort of money?  What about the amount of money the local authority has to put up, notwithstanding that the tenant has to pay a certain amount.  It is mad economics.  I do not understand why the local authorities could not have bought these units and used them as social housing.  I do not understand why we are not proactive enough.  Perhaps there is a problem with many of the local authorities in terms of being proactive in this regard.  It is clear that companies as big as this one have bought up hundreds of units across the areas.<\/p> <p>  I have another serious concern.  The Minister mentioned there are 763 people in hotels.  Given the Pope's visit is coming up, people are going to be pushed out of hotels.  Where are they going to go?  The Minister said we will produce more hubs.  This happens every time there is a major event in that people get thrown from Jack to Jill, and some of them end up couchsurfing or end up in all sorts of messes.  It is an indictment of us as a society that this can happen.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to people refusing HAP.  I can understand that.  I know of people who are high on the housing list and who are asked to take up a HAP tenancy.  Some of them have to travel from one end of the city to the other, with children.  They are taken out of their community and brought into a completely different environment.  No one would buy a house in a location where they do not want to go, for starters.  I can understand why some people have refused to take up what the Minister calls social housing.  I do not consider HAP as social housing and I think it is the wrong definition.<\/p> <p>  It is mind-boggling.  At the end of the day, it is clear that nothing has changed.  Since 2011 the number of homeless people has tripled - that is the reality.  The Minister is right to say that those who are leaving homelessness go various different ways, whether to HAP, to social housing or otherwise.  The problem is they are being replaced.  People are desperate because many landlords are making up excuses that they are selling their houses and they are putting people out.  That is why there is no change in the figures.  Obviously, if we do not build enough social housing, that is going to continue.  It is very frustrating.<\/p> <p>  A member appeared on television in regard to the European Investment Bank and the Minister mentioned he was in negotiations with it.  Why is it taking so long?  We have been pointing out for years that the European Investment Fund is available.  To go back to 2011, when I was housing spokesperson for my party, I was raising this issue.  Everything seems to be moving at a pace which means the homeless figures are not changing and our reaction to events is not changing.  We need to start building estates and homes in larger quantities, and we need State input to that.  Unless we do that, we will be coming back here for years to come.  It is very frustrating.  I feel nearly lost for words at this stage, given the number of times we have revisited this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#K00700","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.  I will address Deputy Boyd Barrett's questions first.  The Deputy makes a point about how stopping evictions will prevent people entering emergency accommodation.  However, there are two issues here.  One is that landlords could leave the rental market, which would result in a loss of supply and people being evicted because there would not be enough properties.  Different people would then enter emergency accommodation because new people are looking to rent every week, either because they have returned home or have reached an age where they are starting a new job.  If we were to freeze evictions, we would not stop the problem of people entering emergency accommodation.  We could, however, strengthen protections for people who are renting, which is what we are doing in the forthcoming legislation.  We could also incentivise landlords to sell to other landlords and offer longer leases.  That is an issue I am progressing.<\/p> <p>  The regulations on receivership will be introduced in legislation in the autumn.  A working group is addressing that issue and will report to me shortly.  Movement of housing assistance payments between local authorities is an issue we need to consider.  Based on the contents of the reports, the financial figures cited by Deputy Boyd Barrett do not make sense for the taxpayer.  However, we must be careful in this regard.  For example, if we were to apply Dublin rates to Wicklow, would rents be pushed up for everyone?  I know one family in that very difficult position.  Would we then have 49 other families following behind them as a result of rent increases and pressure arising from the decision to apply Dublin rates to Wicklow?  We will examine this issue but we need to be careful there are no unintended consequences from any policy change.  <\/p> <p>  To correct Deputy Boyd Barrett, I never said I had only been in the job for two years.  I was pointing out that HAP transfer lists and HAP in Dublin had only been in place for a certain period of time, yet a number of the figures we see on the use of the transfer list are positive.  The place finder service, which operates in 17 local authorities, is working.  Some local authorities have a number of place finders.  The housing assistance payment also works.  We have evidence that it meets people's housing needs and that it works.  However, we know the transfer list can do more and we will see what we can do with that with local authorities.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Ellis referred to recategorisation.  Some people are obsessing about the wrong part of the crisis we face.  People in hubs are spending shorter periods in emergency accommodation but a home is better than a hub or emergency accommodation.  Renting in the private rental sector is far better for a family or an individual than living in a hub, despite the many supports provided in hubs, some of which are not available in the private rental sector.  That said, a home, whether a local authority house or a HAP-supported tenancy in the private sector, is a better place for the development of families and children.<\/p> <p>  We will need to maintain HAP on its current scale until more homes are built.  I would not have made this policy decision but we found ourselves in a position where house building had been outsourced almost exclusively to the private sector.  When activity subsequently collapsed, there was no capacity to build social housing homes.  That has now changed as a result of a policy decision we made.  Project Ireland 2040 provides that from now until at least 2027, local authorities and approved housing bodies will continue to deliver new homes into the stock of social housing homes every year and we will not be reliant on the private rental sector.  As we do this, we must rely less on the private rental sector.  We see this already in the numbers and ambitions set out in Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of different contingencies for which we must plan.  Some are immediate, for example, the Pope's visit, while others cannot be foreseen, for example, a natural weather event or some other event in a hotel.  There are other potential challenges around Brexit.  For all of these reasons, we are putting in place new contingency measures.  A number of contingencies are available every night which go unused in the system.  We will not force people out of hotels during the Pope's visit but we must make sure there are contingencies in place to ensure accommodation is available in the event that new presentations are made.  We continue the practice whereby no individual or family has to sleep outside emergency accommodation on any given night.  <\/p> <p>  The European Investment Bank funds a significant amount of infrastructure in this country but it can do more.  We must always be careful when we are dealing with taxpayers' money.  We do not want to expose taxpayers to the types of difficulties they experienced following our exposure to the financial crisis and the difficult circumstances in which hundreds of thousands of people found themselves as a result.  We must also ensure that when we use European Investment Bank funding to undertake a project, we get it right because if we get it wrong, I guarantee that this source of funding will dry up immediately and the project for which it was used may not be replicated as a result.<\/p> <p>  A number of large sites will come on stream.  The policy is always to achieve mixed tenure because we believe that is the most successful way to build communities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#L00100","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I apologise for not being here earlier.  I was attending a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport that started at 1.30 p.m. and finished at 6.30 p.m.  I support the actions taken by the Minister.  My view of the housing assistance payment is totally different from the views expressed by the members who spoke previously.  HAP replaced rent allowance.  A person who was in receipt of rent allowance could not be employed, which meant that people in employment and on low incomes were excluded from rent support and could not get homes.<\/p> <p>  I came across a case recently involving a lady who happens to be an immigrant with a young family.  She works in the health services locally and until recently could not afford to keep her family with the money she was earning.  She could not pay her rent because she could not get HAP at the time.  Thankfully, she subsequently received HAP, which means she can live in a house, support her family and work.  HAP assists everybody but particularly people who had been excluded from rent support previously because they were working.  If people did not have the option of renting privately, they would have nowhere to live and would be forced to live in tents or on the side of the road.  To those who say HAP is not an option, I would reply that there is no other housing available.  Given that people do not have other options, it is nonsensical to claim HAP does not make sense as an option.  While many of those who receive HAP cannot choose where they live, they often end up living in a place with which they are very happy.  Obviously, it is an advantage for some people to live near their mothers and fathers or other family members.  However, that is not necessarily always the case when people move into a council house.  There is no discrimination in the allocation of council houses.  There is fine housing everywhere.  An individual can be lucky to live near family members and have family supports.<\/p> <p>  There are problems with HAP.  I received a strange explanation when I raised a particular issue.  If someone living in the wonderful town of Drogheda in County Louth is on HAP, that is fine.  If the person finds a house to rent in the part of Drogheda that is in County Meath, the HAP support will be paid by Meath County Council but the person can stay on the Louth County Council housing list.  A person can live anywhere in the town of Drogheda and provided he or she comes from County Louth, he or she can stay on the Louth housing list.  However, if a person living in County Meath moves to Drogheda and receives HAP from Louth County Council, he or she must come off the Meath County Council housing list, thereby losing the years accumulated on the list.  There are issues with boundaries, particularly boundaries that divide a town or community, and it would be worthwhile addressing them.  My view is that given the scarcity of housing, people who move to an adjoining county - I appreciate the position in respect of Dublin versus other counties is different - should not lose their right to remain on the housing list in the county of their choice on the basis that the only HAP home they can secure is located in an adjoining county.  <\/p> <p>  I raise another issue related to Drogheda.  There are 155 social houses to be allocated in my town before the end of the first quarter of next year.  That is a significant number because for years, we did not have any social housing.  The position in County Louth and east Meath is changing significantly in this regard and new houses are being built all the time.  I visited a private estate a year ago when there were about 80 houses on the site.  There are now 250 homes in the estate, which indicates how much development is taking place and how much progress is being made.  Addressing these issues takes time and the Minister is using all the powers available to him.  I appreciate that we still have a great deal of work to do but I also acknowledge the good work that has been done.  <\/p> <p>  I have raised the next point a number of times.  Louth County Council has used compulsory purchase orders to initiate work on vacant and boarded up properties.  Families are now living in 60 homes in the county that were boarded up a year ago.  What is the story in other parts of the country?  I know there is a website detailing vacant homes.<\/p><p>Can we have a progress report on that matter at some stage, if it has not already been provided today?  We could add at least 2,000 or 3,000 houses to the stock if what is happening in County Louth happened in the rest of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#L00200","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  His comments on the HAP scheme are welcome and I share them.  It is a real support and does meet people's needs.  The private rental sector is necessary, as I have acknowledged, but it should not be as necessary as it is.  These are the legacy issues the Government took up in 2011.  We have been working to address them and are working ambitiously on Rebuilding Ireland, under which 50,000 new homes will come into the stock of social housing.  The HAP scheme gives choice, autonomy and independence.  However, that independence and autonomy are not going to work for everyone.  We recognise this, which is why we have a stock of social housing coming.  It is also why we are talking about other supports to come with the HAP scheme, as well as the place finder service.  New homes are being built and not just by local authorities.  We saw the CSO data in terms of the new transparency as a result of a request that I made that they be drilled down into to get us actual completion numbers.  It is very good information and we want to build on the numbers again this year, but there are more things we need to do.  We have to continue to be proactive in this area.  I will continue to host housing summits to drive the local authorities.  When it comes to compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, the local authorities have the power, policy, money and resources.  We need to make sure they are doing what they should be doing when it comes to CPOs, vacancies and other matters.<\/p> <p>  We are here to talk about the two reports.  That being the case, this is not to move into another area, but when we talk about new measures, when we look at the numbers, yes, we are seeing these increases in supply.

Local authorities vary in their definitions of it.<\/p> <p>  The age profile shocked me.  I was shocked to learn that 21% of those who were declaring themselves to be homeless were between the ages of 18 and 24 years.  I would love to have more information on what their reasons were and so on.  It could be due to a change in family circumstances, etc.  A total of 58 families cited family breakdown as a reason.  On first reading, one might think that referred to marital or relationship breakdown, but I believe it is actually a breakdown between a parent and a child, with the child declaring himself or herself to be homeless.  May we have a little more detail in that regard?<\/p> <p>  I am delighted that Housing First is successful.  It was an initiative under Rebuilding Ireland, with a collaborative approach by voluntary and non-voluntary sectors.  It was an initiative by the Peter McVerry Trust and I am delighted it is successful and supporting persons who are very vulnerable.<\/p> <p>  On refusals, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd alluded to houses coming on stream in Drogheda.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire there are 48 properties that will come on stream shortly.  In Monkstown there are step-down houses that will come on stream, as well as a number of other smaller projects.  While they are all small, together, they are very good.  There are 12 houses in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and I believe two were refused.  Two brand new, award winning houses in the heart of D&uacute;n Laoghaire in a preferred location were offered to two people living in emergency accommodation and refused.  The Minister might not be able to discuss it here, but I would like to know the reasons.  They could be very legitimate, but I would like to know what they are.  In the future we might be able to communicate better with the families to have a better understanding of the reasons there are refusals.<\/p> <p>  There is a real misconception about the HAP scheme.  Deputy Fergus O'Dowd was bang on when he said it was an interim measure in finding a long-term solution.  Nobody says where we would house people if we did not have it.  It is very popular to say it is not working, without having to come up with a solution for how to house people in the interim.  We put a roof over their heads.  The HAP scheme also enables people to get back into the workforce if they so choose and supports them on various levels.  It is a big step from the rental accommodation scheme.  We nearly reward people for going back into the workforce and support them in doing so.<\/p> <p>  I note that the current figure for Exchequer funding for new builds is &euro;1.06 billion, with an additional &euro;77 million from local authorities.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown &euro;18 million of local property tax receipts goes into housing provision.  I presume that is from where the local authorities' &euro;77 million is coming.  People think the local property tax is used for various purposes, but a good portion of it is used for the provision of housing by local authorities.  It is good to see that reflected in a breakdown.<\/p> <p>  The HAP scheme is an interim solution to allow us to get supply up and running.  We are seeing all of the indicators moving in the right direction, although there is a lot more to be done.  It is very easy to knock something when one does not have to come up with solutions or test the ideas one is bringing forward.<\/p> <p>  The Minister might not be able to respond to all of my questions today.

Also worrying is the figure for lone parents who are massively over-represented in emergency accommodation compared to the general population.  Having met some of the families and lone parents living in emergency accommodation, a huge amount of care and support is provided for them, but it must be very difficult for them in those circumstances.  That is why it is always superior to see them in a hub and also to get them into their own homes.<\/p> <p>  On family breakdown, we have the numbers for the different types but no more than that.  It will require a much more detailed piece of survey work in interacting with an individual to get behind the reasons there was a falling out with a parent, for example.  <\/p> <p>  The Chairman is right to single out Housing First as a measure that is succeeding well.  I do not like to name individuals, but I do think Mr. Bob Jordan, the national director whom I appointed earlier this year, is doing a fantastic job.  On the two refusals mentioned by the Chairman, I do not know the reasons.  I do not collect that information in the Department.  I was not aware that there had been two for the 12 houses under that scheme or that they were by persons living in emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman is right to use the word \"misconception\" in respect of the HAP scheme.  The report mentions people being unsure and afraid about the concept behind the scheme.  The evidence tells us that it does work in the vast majority of cases and also that we need to make some changes to it to make it work for others who are unsure of the concept or have refused to participate in it while living in emergency accommodation.  We can do that work.  The Chairman and Deputy Fergus O'Dowd are dead right.  If we just abolished the schem, what would the solution be?<\/p> <p>  On new builds and the local property tax, yes, it is used for housing, especially when the rates are raised.  Additional money then goes into housing provisions under the requirements to be met.  There are two review groups looking at the local property tax.  One involves the Department of Finance in conjunction with my Department, while the other involves my Department alone in considering the baseline rates and allocations.  The work will conclude at the end of the autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#M00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":702,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the detail of his replies.  Picking up on a few bits and pieces, I am not sure whether the CSO is the right agency to compile future housing reports.  I have not made up my mind on the matter.  If the Minister is of a mind to consider it and debating it with his officials, he should consider including in the figures, in a way that they can be separated out in order that the different categories are clear, the almost 100 adults and children in non-Department funded emergency accommodation in the city such as Morning Star and Regina Coeli.  That is important.  If the Department is moving towards the CSO reporting, including rough sleepers in the overall aggregate figure would be useful.<\/p><p>The position is similar in regard to Tusla domestic violence figures and step-down emergency accommodation residents.  For example, Professor Eoin O'Sullivan, as Ms Hurley is aware as he sends her his detailed analysis of each quarterly report, compiles a graph which displays the figures in a bar chart showing section 10 funding, Tusla funding, non-funded emergency accommodation, etc.  I recommend that to the Minister.<\/p><p> On HAP, I do not want the Minister to mistake our position for that of others.  HAP has good and bad things and I have never called for it to be abolished.  In fact, I have always argued that we need a rental subsidy.  I agree with Deputy O'Dowd that the facility allowing HAP recipients to work is an improvement on rent supplement.  When that was announced I welcomed it, as did Deputy Ellis.  However, the difficulty is that the legislation was not designed as a temporary solution but, rather, to say that the housing needs of those using it had permanently been met.  That was the intention of the legislation.  I accept Deputy Eoghan Murphy was not the Minister at the time.  However, because of the nature of the rental market, it may not be the case that those housing needs have permanently been met.  Some HAP landlords may extend the lease every two years but others may not, which creates an instability.<\/p><p> The crucial point is that if one is on the housing waiting list of Dublin City  Council for 11 years and the average waiting time for a council property is 12 or 13 years in one's area of choice and one moves on to HAP, the number of years before one will have a chance of getting a council house increases.  That is the disincentive identified in this report and previously and that is why I wish to explain the system used by South Dublin County Council which I think fixes that core problem.  A year ago, South Dublin County Council stated that a person who goes into HAP, whether from emergency accommodation or otherwise, is taken off the global housing list, as per the legislation, and placed on a HAP transfer list, as the circular requires, but the person's access to housing is through choice-based letting and the original years on the housing list remain intact, which means nobody who moves from the standard list onto the HAP transfer list is in any way disadvantaged.  That system has been up and running for a year and my only concern is that the report of the inter-agency group did not look at it and ask the simple question as to whether it has fixed the problem in the South Dublin County Council area.  The housing managers there introduced it because a year ago they were aware of the disincentive the Minister is now contemplating.  They discussed it with councillors and found a solution which I understand from my constituency work has resolved that difficulty.  I can now tell someone who comes into my constituency office to take a HAP place if he or she has been on the housing list for ten or 11 years because he or she will not have to wait any longer for a council house than would otherwise be the case.  I urge the Minister to consider that system.<\/p><p> I am concerned by the language used in the inter-agency report where it states: \"it also needs to be considered whether it is appropriate for the State to provide emergency accommodation to households who are unwilling to consider HAP\".  That is particularly concerning in the context of what I have just said.  I think the Minister addressed this point earlier but I ask him to clarify it.  I presume he is saying the matter has been considered but this is not going to happen.  People were nervous about that statement when they saw it in newspaper reports this morning.<\/p><p> I am also concerned that the report of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, states: \"It can be assumed that a significant percentage of the Non-EU individuals may not have entitlement to housing support.\"  The Minister did not answer the earlier question on this issue.  None of the reports, including the very detailed and good report of the DRHE, published last week, contain any evidence of the truth of that statement.  Does such evidence exist?<\/p><p> I am not obsessing on homeless figures.  In fact, we could have dealt with this six weeks ago if we had received the information.  The problem is that information from county managers which is in the public domain stands in stark contrast to what the Minister tells us in regard to the reasons, the nature of the people removed and whether it was done by agreement or instruction.  It is the job of the committee to scrutinise the decisions of the Minister.  When Mr. Brendan Kenny tells us that the approximately 200 individuals who were removed from the list in April are still homeless, it causes an alarm bell to ring in my head.  When the director of housing in Louth emails every councillor and Deputy in that local authority area to say the 100 people removed from his list were still homeless but the council was requested by the Minister's Department to remove them, that sets off alarm bells.  I do not want to get into a row about it again today.  However, in order to resolve this issue the Minister must bring that detailed information to the committee and either convince us that what he did was right or allow us to properly scrutinise it and decide if what he did was wrong and those families should be returned to the list.  It is not members of the committee who are sowing confusion, but, rather, the Minister's failure to disclose the information which led him, his Department or someone else to have those families removed from the list.  In my view, the Minister has added to that confusion today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#M00500","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":704,"content":"<p>For clarity, in private session Deputy &Oacute; Broin agreed to circulate the emails he received in regard to the reclassification of those figures.

Rather, I was pointing to and emphasising the economics of it.  I know there are some advantages to HAP, such as people being able to work.  Before 2011, when I was a councillor, rent supplement cost significantly less than &euro;300 million.  The HAP, rental accommodation scheme, RAS and rent supplement now cost over &euro;500 million, although the RAS and rent supplement are being done away with.  An unemployed person who has a family and monthly rent of &euro;1,400 will seek &euro;1,000 from the State towards that rent.  That is the reality of what is happening and it is bad economics.  We need to look at building more social housing.  I keep emphasising that point.  It bugs me that we have missed opportunities to acquire homes, such as when Ires Reit bought large numbers of apartments in Hampton Wood.  If we are not building homes, we at least should try to buy them.  We will get better value for money in the long run if we do so.  That is the point I was making to the Minister.  It greatly upsets me that Ires Reit has 130 units in Hampton Wood, and will benefit from HAP.  The council has taken 50 units and will take more because it wants to try to get people into homes, whether under HAP or otherwise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#N00400","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":707,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.  In answer to Deputy &Oacute; Broin on the Central Statistics Office, CSO, that proposal or suggestion was put to me but I have not approached the CSO in that regard.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting that one of the reports states that emergency accommodation should not be looked at as a catch-all for everyone who is vulnerable.  There is sense in that because if we look to one number all the time, it will not tell us of the successful pathways out of there for those people, nor what real complexities we are facing.  That is why we should try to disaggregate the number and understand which people in emergency accommodation can be helped through a traditional pathway such as the private rental sector or a built home.  The inter-agency group is working to understand which people have long-term health needs, justice issues or other requirements.  We will have more discussions on the recording system because we also need to reform the pathway accommodation and support system, PASS, and the kind of information it collects. <\/p> <p>   I appreciate the clarifications on HAP and Sinn F&eacute;in's position in that regard.  On instability, Deputy &Oacute; Broin stated that going into HAP may extend the waiting time for a person to get a permanent social housing home.  However, being in a home is far superior to being in emergency accommodation and our priority must be to get people out of emergency accommodation first.  That is why we have HAP and the transfer list.  For the vast majority of people, the HAP meets their housing need.  The inter-agency group has not finished its work and continues to meet.

We will continue to need to co-ordinate our work and responses, drill down to some of the information that has already been unearthed and pursue some of the recommendations.<\/p> <p>  My interpretation of the section of the inter-agency group report referred to by Deputy &Oacute; Broin is that we would look at the initial recommendations, 1 and 2, and see how best we can implement them.<\/p><p>I do not agree with the interpretation that some have put on it, that it suggests that we would refuse, threaten to withdraw or withdraw emergency accommodation from people.

Eoin O'Sullivan's analysis is not ours.  He includes other figures such as direct provision and everything else.  All other matters that we report on in respect of housing are quarterly.  Most organisations report quarterly because that allows them to better understand trends, analysis and data and when they report on that quarter they do not do it a week or two after that quarter has ended, they have taken a month or month and a half to analyse the information and present it in the right way.  That is the best way to do it to get accurate information from the people who have prepared the report.<\/p> <p>  On the gathering of data, there is guidance for that.  We are reviewing it.  We will wait until we get the survey back to see exactly what is happening on how information is being collated.  A body of work needs to be done on the pathway accommodation and support system, PASS to see what information it is bringing into the system when we put the numbers into it.  That is what we are trying to do.  Both reports speak to the necessity of improving the information we have and that means gathering it in a better way before we publish it and the analysis of it. <\/p> <p>  I do not dispute Deputy Ellis's position on the economics of HAP when I look at the numbers on how we are using taxpayers' money but we cannot consider this just from an economic point of view, we have to consider it from a social need point of view too and we do.  We are building more houses.  The ambition of Rebuilding Ireland and Project Ireland 2040 is to build a stock of social housing homes every year that is a percentage of the total delivery of homes in the private sector such that no matter what happens in the future that safety net is there for the most vulnerable people in our society.  That is the absolute aim under Rebuilding Ireland.  Until we have more homes built we will continue to have an over-reliance on the private rental sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018062000002#O04300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1529510400,"counter":751,"content":"<p>In regard to Hampton Wood, that experience is being repeated elsewhere: companies such as Ires are buying large quantities of new housing and are advertising that they will give 130 units for HAP.

There is better care and support in a hub centre than there is in a hotel.  That is why the hub is the preferred model as a first response.  People spend less time in emergency accommodation as a result.  Local authorities have to build, acquire and long-term lease, but we must get the balance right.

This agreement was negotiated on behalf of Ireland by a team comprising officials from my Department, who are with me, experts from Ireland's astronomical academics and industrial representatives.<\/p><p> As members are no doubt aware, the agreement was the culmination of several months of intense work and collaboration between the team and the European Southern Observatory, ESO, representatives.<\/p><p> The Government committed to initiate negotiations with ESO for Ireland&rsquo;s membership as an action in Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for research and development, science and technology.  As part of a study commissioned in 2015, ESO was identified as a pivotal international research organisation, posing significant benefits to Ireland.<\/p><p> International co-operation in research and innovation plays an important role in the development and sustainability of a world class research and innovation system.  International co-operation maximises the impact of international and national investment in research and innovation and develops international relations.  Membership of ESO will help develop Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint and support international relations with other members of the organisation and, in particular, with the host nation for the telescopes, Chile.<\/p><p> Benefits of ESO membership are significant, primarily that Irish researchers will be afforded an opportunity to work with facilities that would never be possible for Ireland to achieve alone.  The skills that will be developed by students and researchers, such as high volume data analytics, photonics and software education, are advanced and industry relevant.  In addition, Irish companies will be fully eligible to receive contracts from ESO, covering all business areas from provision of services to technical studies and delivery of advanced equipment.<\/p><p> The terms of Ireland&rsquo;s membership are based on the ESO Convention and Protocols, our negotiations were focused mainly on the financial contributions.  A special deal was tabled by ESO during initial discussions in 2016 with the previous director general.  This deal would calculate Ireland&rsquo;s membership based on 2017 prices rather than 2018.  The deal was secured by the negotiating team resulting in a saving of just under &euro;400,000.  As Ireland is joining in the final quarter of 2018, the cost for this year is &euro;0.75 million, increasing to &euro;3.46 million for next year, subject to indexation.<\/p><p> I am aware that several members have a keen interest in Ireland&rsquo;s membership of international research organisations and the development of our research and innovation capabilities.  I welcome the members' interest and encourage continued engagement with them.  I would, however, remind members that this committee is to discuss the terms and conditions of ESO membership.  Ireland has taken significant steps in recent years in achieving membership of Elixir, LOFAR and now ESO, as per our commitments in Innovation 2020. <\/p><p> I thank the select committee for affording me this time.

Will Irish membership give us decision-making power in ESO?<\/p> <p>  I understand the special contribution fee of &euro;14.66 million will be paid over a period of 11 years.  I do not have a problem with that.  Do the other member countries pay the same amount?  Is the special contribution an additional fee to the cost of yearly membership?  How much is yearly membership?  Does the Minister of State anticipate that it might increase in the coming years?  If the fee increases, how will it be worked out?  In the unlikely event that we need to leave the organisation, how is that facilitated?  Sinn F&eacute;in raised CERN in its pre-budget submission for the 2018 budget and will do so for budget 2019.  Is there an update on the position in regard to becoming a member of CERN?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018062000002#B00200","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1529509200,"counter":792,"content":"<p>There are a few questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018062000002#B00300","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1529509200,"counter":793,"content":"<p>I will deal with the cost.  Some previous reports had indicated greater savings based on the accession calculation for 2017.  However, this was not based on the gross domestic product, GDP, nor net national income, NNI, which is the figure  on which ESO calculates member states' rates.  While Ireland's GDP increased significantly in 2015, the NNI did not reflect the same dramatic increase.  We have been very lucky in a sense in that we have been able to negotiate a good deal up to 2028, which is a reasonable deal compared to other states.  Some 15 member states have joined ESO for good reason.  We had come under immense pressure, and rightly so, from people such as the Deputy and others who are very interested in research and development and have a great knowledge of it that we should join these organisations.<\/p> <p>  Ireland will have two seats on the ESO Council - one will be taken by an astronomer and the other by a Government representative.  We will also have a representative on the financial committee, which is important, and on the science and technology committee.  We will also have an industrial liaison officer.  The nomination process for these posts is under way.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the industrial return, which is measured through the ratio of expenditure in each member state and the percentage contribution to the budget spent on certain categories of contracts.  Big consortia, such as IBM, InnaLabs, SensL, NASA, SGroup, Openet, ESA and Technology Ireland, have been advocating that we join.  We are one of the few countries in western Europe which is not a member of ESO and we are missing out in many ways in disciplines such as astronomy.  Let me remind members that Ireland has a great history in astronomy.  At one stage, we had the biggest telescope in the world, located in Birr Castle.  There is an interesting statistic that, as a percentage of the population, there are more members of Astronomy Ireland than there are of other such organisations in any other country in the world.  If one looks at the telescope we opened, the I-LOFAR telescope in Birr, which is one of the biggest telescopes in the world, Ireland was chosen because of our astronomers and the knowledge of astronomy.  We will be able to compete for business.  Given the expertise of this community, it is well positioned to avail of opportunities provided by ESO membership.  We will also be able to bid for contracts.  Remember it will take ten years to build the telescopes and that will give an opportunity to some of our top researchers, universities and companies already dealing with the European Space Agency to win contracts.  That is a good win for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018062000002#B00400","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1529509200,"counter":794,"content":"<p>There were a number of other questions on the cost.

This is an important step forward for Ireland and for the Irish astrophysics community.  I was involved in this work last year.  I joined the Minister at the switch on of the international LOFAR telescope at Birr Castle.  It was a great day for the astrophysics community.  Some seeds were sown and some processes are in train already.  The Minister and some of us talked at length on how this process might advance.<\/p> <p>  I pay tribute to people, such as Mr. Joe Hogan who was a great advocate for ESO membership and brought some of his business expertise to the process in terms of making the business case.  Dr. Peter Gallagher is an outstanding astrophysicists, a person we can be proud of in the international science community but based in Trinity College at present.  I know Dr. Gallagher was instrumental in making the case for ESO membership and he explained to me and many others the many benefits that would flow from it and how it would benefit the community and the level of access they would have to the equipment, facilities and research data available through ESO.<\/p> <p>  I also attended the astrophysics conference in Maynooth last year, where the key note subject on the agenda was whether we would join the ESO.  I know there was delight in the community when it was announced on budget day that we were to join.  I am delighted that we are ratifying this.  Deputy Quinlivan asked enough questions and covered any questions I had.  This is a really positive development and I am delighted to support it.<\/p> <p>  I know we will not diverge into it, because the topic under discussion is the European Southern Observatory, but since we have introduced the topic of CERN to the debate, I would like to see Ireland joining all the international consortia and research collaborations because we get so much back.  Each of these groups and each of the associations have a multiplier effect.  When I joined the Minister of State at the European Space Agency, about 18 months ago now, we learned about the 7:1 multiplier effect, so that for every euro invested in space technology and the space agency, one gets &euro;7 back, between contracts awarded, research opportunities and study opportunities.  The same goes for ESO, which we are ratifying today, and for CERN.  In CERN the figure is more in the range of 3:1 or 4:1, depending on how one calculates it.  There is a significant opportunity.  I welcome the Minister of State's comments and I know from private and public discussions of his interest and commitment in the matter, so I look forward to progressing it.<\/p> <p>  I understand completely the argument about why full membership of CERN is preferable to associate membership, but it might be worth looking at the Israeli model.  What Israel has done is to go down the path where one has a higher level than associated membership and one gets between 25% to 30% back, above the 10% back that one gets as an associate member and one is on a fast track to full membership.  That might be a model to look at.  I understand the budgetary constraints but I am delighted the Minister of State and the Department are committed to that course of action.  We will have to try to find ways around budgetary constraints but I look forward to next year or the year after when the committee will be in a position to join CERN.  I hope it will happen sooner rather than later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018062000002#C01300","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1529509200,"counter":809,"content":"<p>I should say the intense demands on the capital programme and the tight fiscal space we are in means that we did have to make a decision on the best organisation to join in view of the money we available right now.

Ireland has an option, provided for in Article 3.1 of Protocol 21 annexed to the Treaty of Lisbon, to opt-in to individual proposals in the area of freedom, security and justice.  The protocol provides that Ireland has three months, from the date a proposal or initiative is presented to the Council, to notify the Presidency of the Council in writing of its wish to take part in the negotiation, adoption and application of any such measure.  The three-month period for this proposal is due to end on 16 August.  The exercise of this opt-in is subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  <\/p> <p>  Ireland can also accept a proposal at any time after it has been adopted, but in such a case, it will not have been in a position to vote on the final content of the proposal.  It must also be noted that Ireland made a declaration appended to the Treaty of Lisbon of its intention to opt-in to measures in the area of freedom, security and justice to the maximum extent it deems possible.<\/p> <p>  This proposal, as published, has a number of key elements relating to the fourth and fifth anti-money laundering directives.  These include: access to the bank account registries to be set up under the fifth anti-money laundering directive, by the competent authorities in each member state responsible for law enforcement, and in Ireland's case this will probably be the financial investigation unit, FIU, and the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB; the sharing of information by the FIU with other law enforcement competent authorities in Ireland; an exchange of information between FIUs of different member states; access by Europol to bank account information and exchange of information between Europol and FIUs; and procedures and data protection safeguards relating to the exchange of information processes to be created.  My officials have consulted the Office of the Attorney General.  They have been advised that there is no legal impediment to Ireland opting into this proposal. <\/p> <p>  While the proposal broadly reflects existing law and practice in Ireland, both the financial investigation unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau have indicated to my officials that this proposal, as part of the broader anti-money laundering framework, will further enhance the effectiveness of the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and associated predicate offences in providing for increased co-operation in a timely manner between FIUs, law enforcement authorities, including Europol, and other competent authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018062000002#D00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":842,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

Financial crimes have become more complex and multi jurisdictional.  Therefore, we need to constantly upgrade our laws to ensure that we keep up with the people who engage in financial crime.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions for the Minister on Brexit and realise that they may be difficult to answer.  We must be extremely careful because we have a land border on this island.  Obviously a lot of crime is also perpetrated between Ireland and the UK.

I would hope that that would continue, notwithstanding.<\/p> <p>  As I am sure Deputy O'Callaghan will be aware, one of the challenges that we have, in terms of our legal system, will be on the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.

It is one that, in terms of our engagement with our UK colleagues, will in all likelihood give rise to a greater level of concentration on the part of Ireland.

He raised a number of questions but some of them were not answered and these matters relate to the legislation that we are dealing with subsequently.  Today, we are not discussing the legislation.  However, these matters are closely linked to the fourth and fifth anti-money laundering directives and it is better that I ask my questions here rather than speak to amendments.  One question was partially answered but I seek clarity on it and another question was not answered.  The first question was where we raised our concerns about the fact that there is discretion available to member states, in terms of the obligation under Article 31.  The article outlines that states must apply a full public register of beneficial ownerships of trusts, as per the directive.  The Minister, in his response, outlined the fact that the legislation for beneficial ownership registers is being developed by the Department of Finance.  I know that the Minister for Justice and Equality does not have responsibility for that matter but it obvious that there has been some correspondence.  He said that it will apply to special purpose vehicles, that is body corporates.<\/p><p>Although the list will be initially viewable by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other appropriate authorities, the fifth money-laundering directive provides for wider access to parts of the beneficial ownership information.  He then goes on to state that we will be in full compliance with the fourth and the fifth money-laundering directives.  Can I take it from that that the State is not exercising any discretion in regard to Article 31 but, rather, will apply it in its totality?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018062000002#D00900","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529481600,"counter":849,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct insofar as this involves intense negotiation and ongoing monitoring with the Department of Finance.

We need to consider whether we could advance legislative proposals to be ahead of the curve not only in the public sector but also high risk areas such as gambling because money laundering is taking place, in particular in that sector.  That could be done by greater utilisation of efinance such that there is formalised transactional component .

This is our third meeting on rural transport.  We met officials from the National Transport Authority, NTA, on 28 March last and we met officials from Irish Rail on 23 May last.  We also met officials from various agencies on 23 May to discuss the flooding problems at Ballycar on the railway line between Galway and Limerick.  We will return to this topic in November 2018 to consider the progress that will have been made by that date.  The programme for Government, the rural development action plan and the national planning framework address the need for quality rural transportation, including bus services within regions and connectivity with long-distance rail and bus services.  Such forms of transport benefit rural communities and make them more sustainable and help to address social exclusion.  In addition, increased use of public transport helps to reduce the effects of climate change through reduced carbon emissions.<\/p><p>Today we are joined by representatives of the NTA and Bus &Eacute;ireann, both of which are heavily involved in the implementation of rural transport policy.  After they have made their opening statements, I will invite the members of the committee to put questions to them.  I suggest that members should limit their questioning to between three and five minutes.  They may come in more than once.<\/p><p>I will now read some formal notices for the information of witnesses.  I draw their attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise the witnesses that any submissions, opening statements or other documents they have supplied to the committee will be published on its website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Anne Graham, who is the chief executive officer of the NTA, Mr. Tim Gaston, who is the NTA's director of public transport services, and Ms Margaret Malone, who is the NTA's rural transport manager.  I also welcome Mr. Ray Hernan, who is the chief executive of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Mr. John Sheridan, who is Bus &Eacute;ireann's operations manager, and Mr. Robert O'Mahony, who is Bus &Eacute;ireann's public service obligation network works manager.

I understand it wants me to address the topic of rural transport.  To assist me in dealing with subsequent questions, I am joined by Mr. Tim Gaston, who is our director of public transport services, and Ms Margaret Malone, who is our rural transport manager.<\/p> <p>  Before I deal with the specific areas of focus, I would like to set the context by providing a brief overview of the NTA's remit in respect of rural transport services.  Public transport in rural areas is provided in various ways.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann provides rail services under contract with the NTA.  Any changes in rail services require the approval of the NTA.  Bus &Eacute;ireann provides a variety of services through its commercial Expressway services, which are licensed by the NTA, and through a network of subsidised public bus services under a direct award contract with the NTA.  Both services serve many rural towns with frequencies varying from weekly to several times a day.  Any changes in subsidised services require the approval of the NTA.  Other commercial operators provide a number of town-to-town services and intercity services across the State without any State subsidy.  If Bus &Eacute;ireann or any commercial operator is required to withdraw any of its commercial services, the NTA works to ensure communities are not left behind.<\/p> <p>  The bus services that are provided under the rural transport programme are contracted by the NTA and are managed by 17 Local Link offices throughout the State.  Although some 80% of these services are demand responsive, regular scheduled services between towns are also provided under this programme.<\/p><p> The rural transport programme is now known as Local Link.  Its objective is to provide a good quality nationwide community-based public transport system in rural Ireland which responds to local needs.  Key features of the rural transport programme include the completion of 1.9 million passenger journeys per annum, with 900,000 of those journeys provided for free travel passengers.  These figures include 200,000 million passengers who required assistance.  We also provided an average of 150,000 service trips annually.  Local Link services travel over 11.8 million kilometres annually.   More than 400 private operators provide the services, using the services of almost 900 drivers.  The programme funds the provision of once-off trips for individuals and community and voluntary groups to help address lack of transport as a factor in social exclusion.  Some 62% of service trips are defined as either fully or partially accessible.<\/p><p> Over the past two years, the authority has supported the expansion of rural transport services to include regular commuter bus services.  Operating at least five times per day over a five, six or seven days per week schedule, these services are specifically designed to ensure connectivity with other public transport services.  This connectivity facilitates passengers to make onward journeys typically to access education, employment, health, recreational and other opportunities.<\/p><p> The authority recently produced its Rural Transport Programme Strategic Plan 2018-2022 which sets out nine key objectives for delivery over the lifetime of the plan.  The key priorities of the programme continue to include addressing rural social exclusion and the integration of rural transport services with other public transport services.  The authority is implementing one of the listed actions in the strategy under objective area eight - encouraging innovation in rural transport service provision - regarding the provision of evening and night services to address unmet transport needs in rural areas.  Twelve of the 17 Local Link groups applied for funding and proposals were assessed by the authority, having regard to evidence of need, previous experience in delivering evening and night-time services, value for money, geographical spread on a national basis, range and mix of proposed modes of transport, connectivity and integration with existing transport options while not representing a displacement risk to existing services, and potential for the mainstreaming of pilot projects <\/p><p> The outcome of the assessment process was that a total of 53 additional services were approved for funding.  The details of those services can be found in the appendix attached.  The key characteristics of these new services include the fact that 19 of these services are extensions to existing regular public transport services.  There are 34 demand-responsive services.  The services will be provided nationally across 19 counties, and will run on average from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m., typically on Friday and Saturday evenings.  All 53 initially approved services will be operational by late June or early July 2018 and will run until December 2018 on a pilot basis.  In terms of reviewing the usage and patronage levels on these pilot services, the authority will closely monitor usage patterns and trends over the six-month period and advise the Department accordingly.<\/p><p> As five Local Link groups did not make an initial application, the authority advised in mid-May that it would consider any further proposed services from these groups should a need or demand exist in the transport co-ordination unit, TCU, area.  A revised closing date of Friday, 1 June was set for receipt of applications, and all five Local Link groups subsequently submitted applications.  These applications are being assessed by the transport planning team within the authority and a decision regarding funding is due shortly.<\/p><p> The authority is continually working with Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide improvements on its contracted services and is looking at expansion of those services given that the budget for public service obligations has increased since 2016.  The authority also promoted the improvements in regional cities, which have seen phenomenal growth in passenger numbers.  These improvements cannot be sustained unless significant improvement work is carried out by the city authorities in providing bus priority measures, particularly now as car traffic congestion is growing rapidly.  The work in enhancing the services provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann has been delayed significantly as it has had to prioritise the changes required as part of its business recovery plan.  It is expected that Bus &Eacute;ireann will complete that work shortly and that we can recommence the service enhancement work.<\/p><p> The authority recognises that there are many gaps in our services provision.  We have focused on the lack of service in our main towns and are prioritising the provision of new town services in Kilkenny, Carlow and Mullingar, all of which have a population in the 19,000 to 26,000 range.<\/p><p> In exercising its functions, the authority seeks to achieve the provision of an integrated public transport system of services and networks for all users.  Wherever appropriate, we seek to integrate and co-ordinate services to provide for seamless travel options where change of bus and-or mode is required.  This includes the operation of rural transport services - Local Link - which can facilitate connecting to mainline interurban services, irrespective of the provider of those services.  In fact, the National Transport Authority, NTA, is the only body that can bring modes and operators together in an integrated service pattern that provides the best service for rural communities.<\/p><p> There are a number of key infrastructural items that support public transport which are required to increase the attractiveness of public transport, especially in rural Ireland.  These include bus shelters, accessible bus stops and information at stops.  The provision of additional shelters has been very constrained in recent years due to a lack of funding.  The contract for the provision and maintenance of bus shelters now rests with the NTA rather than with each individual operator.  We are well placed to deliver a comprehensive shelter programme.<\/p><p> Our ambition is to deliver high-quality public transport in rural areas.  It is expected that funding will improve from 2019.  The authority needs to be in a position to put in place the staff resources that can deliver on our ambitious programme of improvements.  I trust that we can answer any queries that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529487000,"counter":925,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting my colleagues, Mr. Robert O'Mahony and Mr. John Sheridan, and me to discuss the topic of rural-based public transport, rural connectivity, and the role that Bus &Eacute;ireann plays in providing those services.  As the largest operator of public transport services, we recognise the key role we have and will continue to have in providing a range of public transport services outside Dublin in close partnership with key stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann operates a fleet of approximately 650 buses, providing 6,500 services on more than 220 routes every day to people in towns and villages throughout Ireland.  Within our road passenger network we have more than 1.2 million different origin and destination combinations, and more than 10,000 bus stops are serviced in both urban and rural settings.  We provide city services in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford, but we also provide town services in Sligo, Athlone, Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan and Balbriggan. We provide urban and rural services that link practically every town in Ireland, which is particularly important in locations where there is no rail link.  Last year, Bus &Eacute;ireann transported almost 38 million passengers on our scheduled services, while our school transport services carried in excess of 115,000 students every school day on almost 6,800 routes to more than 3,000 schools. <\/p> <p>  As a person from a rural background, I am well aware of the challenges faced every day by rural communities throughout the country and the ever-increasing level of commuting to work, college and other locations.  The fundamental principles of our approach to delivering public transport is to provide a reliable and punctual service that provides value for money to our customers.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is not just the largest public transport provider but also a significant employer, providing direct employment to more than 2,500 employees across 17 locations.  Bus &Eacute;ireann works closely with its large base of suppliers in communities throughout Ireland.  We contract in more than &euro;110 million from small, locally based private transport service providers, mainly for school transport services, meaning that Bus &Eacute;ireann is the largest customer of the indigenous private sector in Ireland.  This school transport scheme is a very good example of rural mobility and rural modal shift, providing sustainable employment in both urban and rural settings.<\/p> <p>  We believe that there are some basic building blocks that are fundamental to the integrated backbone network of services that we provide.  Each journey that begins from village to town to provincial city and possibly on to Dublin and beyond is important to us, and it is the network of services provided within available funding and resources that makes mobility possible for all our rural or urban-based passengers.<\/p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann services connect with a significant number of Local Link services nationwide, and I believe that the provision of improved and enhanced services will further the opportunity for greater connectivity throughout Ireland.<\/p><p> In the past year, Bus &Eacute;ireann, with the financial support of the NTA, implemented a completely revised and enhanced town service in Athlone.  Service enhancements like this have resulted in a 91% increase in passenger numbers within the first 12 months and will continue to facilitate and drive modal shift.  Significant service enhancements were also implemented along the M3 corridor in quarter 3 of 2017.  This year further investment will see further service enhancements in the cities of Galway, Limerick and Waterford, the towns of Drogheda and Sligo and local services in Mayo, west Cork and west Clare.  The enhancements outlined, which total approximately 50 changes to frequency or entail new services, will provide new services in the next three months, will provide greater access to local educational, employment and health facilities within the wider region.<\/p><p> In appreciating the value of connectivity, Bus &Eacute;ireann is supportive of a proposal to facilitate a \"town hub and spoke\" approach where Local Link would interchange into the backbone network provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  This would make best use of the NTA investment in Bus &Eacute;ireann services in recent years and would be focused on increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the overall public transport offering outside Dublin.  While 86% of the Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet is wheelchair accessible, I acknowledge that to facilitate the further roll-out of accessible services to our passengers, further investment is required at bus stops nationwide.<\/p><p> Again, with the assistance of the NTA, a significant investment in fleet will result in more than 135 new vehicles entering the Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet over the next 12 months.  These new vehicles encompass a variety of fleet types, all of which are low floor and wheelchair accessible and will be distributed across our nationwide network, including the improvements I referenced earlier.  In order to service this ongoing expansion of the national network, Bus &Eacute;ireann is now at an advanced stage in a recruitment campaign that seeks to recruit an additional 190 employees, made up primarily of drivers and mechanics.  These new positions will be required in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Mayo, Waterford and many other locations across the country.<\/p><p> Building on the steady growth of public transport usage outside the Dublin metropolitan area that has occurred in the past two to three years, Bus &Eacute;ireann welcomes all initiatives that will increase public transport usage across Ireland, including the recently launched BusConnects and looks forward to its roll-out outside of the greater Dublin area, GDA, at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/p><p> Congestion is no longer a Dublin city issue as many regional cities and towns are experiencing longer journey times, most acutely in the morning and evening peaks.  In recent years, congestion has had a significant impact on the average speed of Bus &Eacute;ireann services and subsequent journey times.  In order to ensure efficient journey times, timetable adherence and subsequent modal shift, it is critical that large-scale bus priority measures are put in place.  That will ensure the most efficient use of our fleet while ensuring reliable journey times for our customers.<\/p><p> I wish to re-emphasise to the committee that Bus &Eacute;ireann remains committed to providing as many inter-regional services connecting rural communities to the main population centres.  This applies also to our Expressway commercial services.  It will be appreciated by the members here today that we do not receive any public subsidy for providing these inter-regional and intercity services.<\/p><p> In summary, Bus &Eacute;ireann is steadfastly committed to providing a safe and sustainable public transport service to all communities outside Dublin in partnership with the NTA and our other stakeholders.  Most of these services could not operate without public subvention.  In this context I welcome the increased subvention provided by the NTA in recent years and its commitment to provide further funding this year and going forward.  We are aware of our responsibility, as Ireland's largest operator of public transport services, to ensure our operations are provided to the highest quality in terms of reliability, punctuality and value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Hernan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529487000,"counter":927,"content":"<p>As a number of members are indicating, I will call them in groups of two.

I will start with the night time rural transport service the Minister announced recently.  Initially, the sum of &euro;200,000 was mentioned but that was never going to cover all rural areas.  However, it was a start in the right direction.<\/p><p>Ms Graham stated:<\/p><blockquote>As five Local Link groups did not make an initial application, the authority advised in mid-May that it would consider any further proposed services from these groups should a need or demand exist in the transport co-ordination unit, TCU, area.  A revised closing date of Friday, 1 June was set [by the Minister].<\/blockquote> <p>Were any other groups entitled to apply for the extra money or was it just the five specific groups?  I would appreciate it if Ms Graham could clarify that for me.<\/p><p>I will start with Local Link but I prefer to call it rural transport.  I acknowledge the great work the rural transport service is giving to the people I represent in Cork South-West.  It is a phenomenal service and it is managed very efficiently throughout the entire county of Cork, which is a massive undertaking.  The service has worked very well.  If it is not broken, why fix it?  The service is funded at the moment through the NTA but local boards run the transport service.  Is it intended that it will continue that way or are changes contemplated?<\/p><p>Is it possible for Bus &Eacute;ireann and Local Link to interact more closely?  It is not always clear that it happens.  It is most important that a relationship would be built between the two services and that it could be further enhanced.  In future could Local Link consider the provision of public transport services for people with disabilities aged over 18?  If one has a severe disability and one is 17 years and 364 days old, one will get a transport service from the door to whatever institution one needs to access on a daily basis, but once one reaches the age of 18, one is given a free bus pass.  It is possible that 50% of people with disabilities can use the bus pass but the other 50% are not and there is no service for them in west Cork.  Such people are left stranded in their homes.  Elderly parents are driving them for up to five hours a day when there are up to three buses in the area providing a service to young people up to the age of 18 yet those who are 18 will not be picked up by the bus.  There is a breakdown in that regard which must be addressed because it is a very serious issue in the constituency I represent.  I cannot speak for other constituencies.<\/p><p>School transport is a big issue in rural communities, in particular the catchment area.  One shoe does not fit all.  It can happen that a brother or a sister has gone to a school of the family's choice at an earlier stage but when the youngest sibling is starting school, CI&Eacute; may state it will not take the child to the school in question but will take him or her to the nearest school.  I could argue about this until the cows come home and I might not get anywhere with it but in some cases there is very little difference between both sides of the argument.  When CI&Eacute; measures distances, it operates on the basis of the nearest way one can get to the nearest school but that is not the route the bus takes.  When measuring the longest route the distance is based on the bus route.  CI&Eacute; is taking every short cut it can to prove the point that the mileage is shorter.  The basis for its calculations is totally incorrect and I know it is happening.<\/p><p>It should quite simply be the bus route from the house to the nearest school or the bus route from the house to the school that is furthest away.  That is the fairest way.  They cannot be taking big buses up boreens.  That is not the way it works.  Measurements can be very tight in some situations.  Parents want their children to go to the nearest school rather than to the one that is furthest away.  That issue needs to be looked at.<\/p><p> The cost of transport for young people, under-18s and students, is an issue that comes up on a regular basis.  The cost of transport from my parish of Goleen to Cork is frightening.  It turns young people off.  They are looking for some alternative to the excellent service in Goleen, which I commend.  It is at 7.30 a.m. every morning.  It is great to have a service that goes to Cork but quite a lot of young people who would like to use the service cannot afford to do so.  They are students.  I am not sure of the exact charge but I think it is over &euro;30.  It is a lot of money for a young person who might want to commute a couple of times a week.  It is not feasible for them.  <\/p><p> The other issue is rail.  I have been fighting for rail to west Cork.  They are all laughing at me.  They were able to bring it to west Cork in the 1850s but we cannot bring it in 2018.  Obviously things are not getting any better but have moved back a good bit.  The one thing we could be looking at is providing a bus service to link with the rail service in Cork.  Bus &Eacute;ireann needs to look at that more closely.  As we are not going to get rail to west Cork, we need to have a bus service that leaves west Cork every morning and links to the train service.  While we may not have rail in west Cork, at least we would have a linking transport service to rail.  It is very important.  We need to look at it in more detail, if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#D00300","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529487000,"counter":930,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their excellent and very informative presentations.  The provision of public transport services is extremely important in the context of the environment and the reduction of our carbon footprint.  The more public transport services we have, the less dependence we have on cars to get to work or various services and appointments.  Fitting that in is the important thing.  I come from a very rural area and the rural transport programme is one of the most important programmes operated by the NTA.  I urge that additional resources are provided to ensure that the expansion of a sustainable rural transport programme across rural towns and villages is achievable.  I acknowledge we cannot have it in every corner and every place we would wish but it is extremely important.  I and my colleagues support the provision of important financial resources by way of subvention to enable Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide a maximum level of coverage across rural areas.  It is an essential service.  The big drawback is when people have a service and only a small number of people use it, it is withdrawn fairly sharply.  I understand the economic situation and valuation that has to be done on that but it has a significant impact on people.<\/p> <p>  School transport is extremely important.  It is an issue Ms Graham or Mr. Hernan might not want to talk about.  Eligibility criteria have to be reviewed and re-evaluated in the context of current demand and the current situation.  It is outmoded.  Deputy Michael Collins is correct.  When we talk about the nearest point, it seems to be the nearest point as the crow flies, which is an awfully silly method of evaluation.  Unless a young lad or young girl gets wings, he or she cannot go the way the crow flies.  I have had huge battles over the years on this issue.  I am in a rural area and know it very well.  There would be 0.2 km in the difference but they almost want people to go across the hedges, ditches and the walls to get there.  People are used to going to a place but are deprived of the opportunity of getting to the school because the other school is in the catchment area.  It has to be reviewed taking a common-sense approach.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, was probably looking at that but I hope the NTA is too.  Bus &Eacute;ireann will come back and say it will do whatever it is directed to do, which is grand and dandy, but does not butter any parsnips for people who have been deprived of the service as a result of rigorous bureaucratic evaluations of things.  It has to be looked at.<\/p> <p>  The expansion of the local night services, which I welcome, is extremely important in combatting rural isolation.  The significance of rural isolation has been referred to in recent reports.  Very often, people can live close to other people but still feel isolated because they cannot get into the local village to meet people and talk about the various issues of the day.  Have there been applications from the Longford and Westmeath areas as part of the extended application deadline?  A very good service is being provided there by Noel McCormack and I expect that that service has reapplied.<\/p> <p>  Mullingar is a town of 24,000 people.  I come from close to it.  A town service is absolutely vital and I am glad to see it included as part of the expansion programme for the current year.  I appreciate resources are always a constraining factor, I do not live in an ivory tower, but it is an important strategic town at the centre of the country.  It should not have been put on the long finger for so long.  We are delighted to see Athlone getting an enhanced service in the past 12 months or so but we want to see that service put in place for Mullingar.  They are of similar size and as Mullingar is the administrative capital of Westmeath, it is important that it is put in place.  I want to emphasise and promote that and ask that it would be done as quickly as possible.  It is very important.  <\/p> <p>  The bus service is excellent.  Buses are becoming more comfortable and I note Bus &Eacute;ireann intends to upgrade is fleet.  That is great.  I hope the NTA continues with that because it is important.  A lot of people who use buses to go to work use their laptops to do work and they want Wi-Fi.  We have to modernise to meet the demands of the consumer who is always right.  As that is important, continuing that operation will be important.  <\/p> <p>  In the past, trying to get bus shelters in place was one of the greatest curses.  I am sure my colleagues share that opinion.  I remember trying to get a bus shelter for the Downs outside Mullingar on the N4 for people travelling to Dublin.  If the IDA and Enterprise Ireland paid more attention to Mullingar, we would not have so many people migrating on the bus services or trains.  We are where we are, as they say.  Hopefully the IDA will redouble its efforts in Mullingar industrial park and get industry in.  Trying to get a bus shelter was an issue in areas such as Ballinalack and Rathowen where people would travel either west or east, depending on where they were going.  The National Transport Authority will probably be able to deal with that now as there is more integration.  A few years ago, people would win the lottery more quickly than they would get a bus shelter.  Bus shelters are important because people like convenience and accommodation.  The last thing one wants to do is step onto a bus to go to work or school having been drowned by heavy showers.  <\/p> <p>  Wheelchair accessibility is important.  I acknowledge what Mr. Hernan just said about 85% of the fleet.  I am sure all the new fleet will accommodate wheelchairs.  It is extremely important.  We must be inclusive and ensure there is maximum availability for all people.  I support Bus &Eacute;ireann very strongly.  It was an easy target for many years but it provided a lifeline to many rural areas.  Unfortunately when the financial recession hit, it was impacted heavily and withdrew a number of services probably because the services were not paying.  One cannot speak out of both sides of one's mouth.  I do not mind paying extra tax to provide the necessary subvention for Bus &Eacute;ireann and public transport services in order that they can provide services in rural areas and other places like that.<\/p><p>We cannot have our loaf and eat it.  We must provide the money, and that comes from taxation or borrowing, although probably less from borrowing.  If we have to do that, then that is what we have to do but we cannot be roaring and looking for services.  There is a lot of duplication around.  A person looks for additional services and then says that additional money will not be provided.  Some want additional services and lower taxation.  It does not work like that.<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses for their presentations and look forward to their replies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#E00200","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529487000,"counter":932,"content":"<p>I will call the witnesses to address the various questions posed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#F00200","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529487000,"counter":933,"content":"<p>Ms Malone will address the LocalLink services and I will pick up the rest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529487000,"counter":934,"content":"<p>In relation to Deputy Collins's questions on the additional call for the evening services to the LocalLink groups, this was a restricted call to the five groups that did not submit initially.

We would hope to have a decision on that probably by the end of the month at this stage.<\/p> <p>  As to the management structure and the structure of the LocalLink groups operating to voluntary boards nationally, we are very happy with the arrangement that is currently in place and we work very closely with the LocalLink groups.<\/p> <p>  There is a national procurement process due to start shortly.

In respect of a person's age and when one reaches 18 years of age, it is a question of trying to get a co-ordinated response through bringing the various parties together on this.  As the committee will understand, the Department of Education and Skills co-ordinates everybody under 18 years of age, in respect of providing transport services to the school or the location for people with accessibility and mobility issues.  This responsibility goes to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport over the age of 18.  I am not aware of any direct engagement with either Department on changing those rules.  We are just implementing policy as it currently stands but I am happy to bring attention to it and raise it as an issue in any direct engagement we have with both Departments.<\/p> <p>  On schools, I do not wish to try to pass the buck on this, but I believe the committee would have a good idea of my answer on this.  We operate the service on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, and all policy issue relating to the provision of that service are set by that Department.  The rules of eligibility and distance from the school, etc., as well as the family entitlement to go to the same school are ongoing issues for many rural communities.  Those are issues that have been raised and about which we have had numerous discussions with the Department of Education and Skills.  I understand is considering all of these aspects to try to streamline this and make it easier.  Unfortunately, we can only implement the policies that we are given and we do apply them rigidly.  If there are any disputes, there is an appeals process to cover that.

At the moment, in conjunction with the authority, we are reviewing the west Cork network and there are a number of prime issues that we are looking at, one of which is connectivity to and from railway services.  The concept we are developing at the moment includes operating all of west Cork services to both the bus station and the rail station in Cork.  It will not just be in the morning peak, it will be throughout the day.<\/p> <p>  As part of our planning process, where there is a rail hub, wherever we are redesigning a timetable, the priority is to make sure that an early morning bus, as far as possible, meets the first train which will allow people to make a day trip to Dublin that is, within a 24 hour period.  We are doing that in August in Ennis, where there will be early morning services from Kilkee and Doonbeg.<\/p> <p>  The fare structure we work with is an historic one that was developed in the 1940s and 1950s and was based on the distance a person travelled and based on the longer distance, the fare tapered off.  It is not suitable to a modern transport environment and we are working with the authority to revise that.  In December of last year, as part of the fares determination that the authority approved, we reduced the number of stages, which is the price that is paid for the distance travelled.  This had a significant impact in certain parts of the country.<\/p> <p>  We rolled out Leap nationwide.  One can get a 30% discount on one's single fare.    We accept that the fares that currently exist in west Cork, while they reduced slightly last year, are still at a level that is prohibitive, particularly to students.<\/p><p>We are about to start discussions jointly with the authority in terms of the fares determination for 2019 and west Cork is high on the agenda in terms of coming up with a proposal to deliver better value fares for our customers in west Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#F01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529487000,"counter":944,"content":"<p>On a service for people with disabilities, Ms Graham said we should talk to the local manager.

Recently, Dr. Eimear Cotter, director of environmental sustainability in the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, said Ireland is locked into a trend of rising carbon emissions.  She was referring to the transport and freight sector.  The freight line between the Port of Waterford and Ballina recently ceased.  Currently we do not have a national freight policy, yet freight is an environmentally sustainable way to transport bulk products.  Why did that link cease?  At a time the United Kingdom and other European partners are developing the rail freight networks, why are we closing them?  Further, if that line is currently closed to freight, is there any plan to open a rail service, for instance, between Rosslare and Waterford, and Ballina?  That would be a great link.  The line between Rosslare and Waterford has been closed.  We are going in the wrong direction because using the railway system is one way of mitigating congestion in areas but we are not doing that.  We are closing the services.  What is the witnesses' reaction to that?<\/p> <p>  With regard to low emission vehicles and bus lines, last year I visited Nijmegen in Holland where most of the public buses are zero-emission.  What is Bus &Eacute;ireann doing with regard to procuring diesel vehicles?  Is there a policy to move away from diesel to zero emission buses?  That is not new age talk.  The infrastructure is in place in other countries, and they are using it.  What is our policy on that and are we moving in that direction?  What are Bus &Eacute;ireann's plans to phase out older diesel buses and move towards using a more environmentally fleet?<\/p> <p>  Congestion has been discussed.  The sooner we operate an efficient and effective public transport system, the better for the country for many reasons.  I refer finally to a bugbear of mine.  I live in Tramore, County Waterford, and my daughter attends NUI Galway.  Every time she takes the bus from Galway to Limerick to connect to another bus to Waterford, the bus meets congestion in Limerick and she misses the onward bus to Waterford.  There is connectivity according to the timetable but that is not the reality.  I am hearing about this from other people.  In terms of efficiency, my daughter is losing time but she is only one of many.  What is Bus &Eacute;ireann doing to adapt its timetables to offset congestion at peak hours in different cities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#G00600","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speech","time":1529487000,"counter":947,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  It is great to get an opportunity to discuss issues with them.  Coming from a rural area in Galway, we have issues with school transport, which is a major bugbear.  One issue that comes up frequently is that when a new school is built, it distorts all the school transport rules and families end up being split as a result of that.  That is not helping the students in terms of their education.  We need to take a common-sense approach to that issue.  I hope that, working together with the Department of Education and Skills, we can come up with sensible answers to address the problem.<\/p> <p>  Senator O'Sullivan mentioned rail freight.  I would also like to know what is happening with the Ballina to Waterford line.<\/p> <p>  The other issue the Senator raised was the type of buses being used by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It will add 135 new buses.  Are they diesel buses?  If not, what type of buses are they?  Is Bus &Eacute;ireann moving towards the new thinking in that area, which we have not implemented here yet, which is to do with carbon saving and more efficient buses in terms of maintenance?<\/p> <p>  On the Local Link service, I am glad to see that the other five Local Link groups have put in their submissions.  One of the reasons I have a concern about rural transport links is that they are not being properly resourced.  They are taking on more areas.  I am concerned that Bus &Eacute;ireann is now talking about the new procurement programme, which will place a huge workload on the Local Link manager.  In many cases, they are managing the service themselves because they have no staff.  We can cod ourselves all day about everything we are doing but we have to provide the Local Link groups with the proper resources.  I recall that on the previous occasion the witnesses were before the committee they mentioned that the NTA uses a system whereby buses co-ordinate with rail services or whatever.  That software is not available to Local Link operators but it should be to help them in terms of the planning.  I was told that would be looked at but we need to put it in place.<\/p> <p>  On rural transport, Bus &Eacute;ireann has Dublin to Galway bus link or local bus links but the problem is that the pick-up points are so far apart, people use their cars to drive to the bus stop but when they get there, they keep going.  They do not bother using the bus.  There seems to be a conservative approach to setting up new bus stops quickly.  I am aware that private operators have also had the problem of trying to get additional bus stops or additional routes licensed.  However, the approach to the application of that is fragmented in that they have to go to the local authority and here, there and everywhere.  We need to tighten that up because we want to take people off the roads, out of their cars and on to public transport.<\/p> <p>  I have a question about Galway city and the provision of commuter rail services into the city from towns such as Tuam and Athenry.<\/p><p>Galway city is congested.  Despite what has been done to try to resolve this, apart from the outer bypass, buses still cannot drive over the bridge.  Buses do not go that route, which is mind-boggling.  They cannot go that route for whatever reason and this has been the case for years.  They cannot go from, say, Newcastle across the bridge to the Headford Road and then on to Parkmore.  They must go through the city.  The other thing that is wrong, and which we need to put right collectively, is that we talk about providing park-and-ride facilities, but the big obstacle to local authorities doing so is that we do not have the bus lane network to make the buses run more efficiently within the city.  The net result is that people from Loughrea, Gort and Tuam drive into the city, clogging up the place to go to work and spending perhaps three or four hours in their cars every day, when there is a solution.  The problem is that no one is taking this by the scruff of the neck.  The NTA needs to do this, bring all the agencies together and say we have a problem, this is the solution, and how are we going to do it?<\/p><p> One fine example of this is the bus lane into Claregalway village.  It has been in place for seven or eight years.  the former Minister, Mr. Noel Dempsey opened it a number of years ago, and that is neither today nor yesterday.  We have been talking since then about developing a bus lane from Claregalway right into the city at Two Mile Ditch.  This has not happened and still does not seem to be happening, although it is on everyone's agenda.<\/p><p> Mr. Hernan referred to a \"town hub and spoke\".  What does that mean?  For instance, Tuam a railway station is on a 13-acre site.  It could be a fine park-and-ride facility if a commuter rail link or bus services between Tuam and Galway were opened.  Could that be a \"town hub and spoke\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#G00700","speaker":"1260","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529487000,"counter":949,"content":"<p>! refer to Senator Grace O'Sullivan's questions about rail freight.  Unfortunately, we do not have a role in rail freight policy.  Our focus is primarily on public transport services and the use of the rail infrastructure for that.  Irish Rail and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will answer the Senator's questions in that area.<\/p> <p>  Regarding use of the existing rail infrastructure, including the closed rail infrastructure - and this would apply across the State - it is expensive to maintain and keep open.  People need to use them to offset the costs associated with not only running the passenger service, but also keeping the infrastructure safe and appropriate for use.  A number of years ago, the number of people using the Rosslare-Waterford rail line was not sufficient to keep it open for rail passenger services, so it was closed at that time.  We identified two years ago in our rail review some other rail corridors had low usage but operated at a high cost but there are no proposals at this stage to close any of them.  We believe that in some cases it is more efficient and effective to provide a bus service rather than a rail service.  The former is more flexible and can provide a frequent service for a much lower cost than for rail services.<\/p> <p>  We are moving towards low-emission fleet purchases in partnership with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It has been set out in the national development plan that no diesel-only buses can be purchased after July 2019, so we will be required then to move in that direction, but we were doing so.  The issue we had in recent years was that our funding was constrained.  To reduce the age of the fleet and to reduce other emissions, we decided to purchase as many diesel vehicles as we could with our available funding, rather than invest in a lower-emission fleet, for which a premium must be paid.  The cost for a lower-emission diesel fleet or diesel hybrid fleet is about 25% more per vehicle.  One can pay an even higher premium for a fully electric or similar type of fleet.  This is something to take into consideration as we move towards reductions in our carbon emissions.  In moving towards a fully electric fleet, infrastructure must be put in place as well for charging of the vehicles.  We have commenced this process.  We hope to commence procurement of a low-emission diesel hybrid fleet this year.  Both Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are proposing to trial a number of buses, and Mr. Hernan will probably refer to this.  We are moving towards a lower-emission fleet as quickly as we can and as quickly as our funding allows us.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Deputy Canney's questions.  Rail fleet is a matter for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Irish Rail.  We are moving towards a low-emission fleet.<\/p> <p>  We believe the Local Link offices are properly resourced.  Procurement is a requirement of our procurement laws and directives.  It is just the Local Link management service that is procured.  We will try to assist where we can to ensure the workload related to this is minimised as much as possible.<\/p> <p>  We have worked with Galway City Council and Galway County Council to put together a Galway transport strategy, which now needs to be implemented.  Funding is set aside in the national development plan for Galway BusConnects.  As soon as we have moved forward with BusConnects in Dublin, our next priority will be BusConnects in Galway and to commence that implementation with the local authorities on the ground.  This will include looking at improving both bus services and park-and-ride and seeing whether we can put in rail commuter services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529487000,"counter":950,"content":"<p>Regarding Senator O'Sullivan's comments on carbon emissions, I will elaborate on what Ms Anne Graham has emphasised.  Since 2015, all buses purchased by Bus &Eacute;ireann, in conjunction with the NTA, have been compliant with Euro 6 standards.  Euro 6 standard emissions are 98% less than the emissions of standard diesel buses that existed even ten or 15 years ago, and, therefore, emissions have declined significantly.  The emissions of a Euro 6 bus now is comparable to the emissions of a compressed natural gas bus, which is a significant reduction.  As Ms Graham said, we are working with the NTA on other types of buses - electric, hybrid and compressed natural gas, CNG - which is very much the focus of the Department now.  We are beginning to review these alternative bus types.  The last 135 buses to which I referred will still be Euro 6 buses, but thereafter we will look at acquiring other ones.  To be clear, there has been a significant reduction in emissions in recent years.<\/p> <p>  Regarding connectivity, particularly in the context of congestion and timetables, congestion has had a significant impact on our ability to align ourselves with the timetables and connectivity with other services.  This is something we face daily, to such an extent that we have put a large team together internally to work on this.  This year, more than 80% of all our routes will have new timetables implemented to very much take cognisance of connectivity not just with our own bus services, but also with train services.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Canney, the issues surrounding school rules are noted.<\/p><p>It is something with which we continue to deal with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  As a bus operator, I very much promote the concept of BusConnects, possibly as a greater and more flexible option than rail.  We can provide better value for money than a rail option, and probably a speedier way to market as well, in terms of implementing a modal shift from car to bus, at least.  I understand, however, that in order to move significant volumes of people, rail is the way to go.  There is significant investment going into Galway, Limerick and Cork, in particular, in terms of additional services.  In those three cities, we have seen double-digit growth over the past two years in passenger numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Hernan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529487000,"counter":952,"content":"<p>What will be implemented in Galway city?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#J00200","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529487000,"counter":953,"content":"<p>We developed a transport strategy with Galway City Council and Galway County Council.

I have questions for the NTA and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We are all very concerned about our environment, and my colleagues alluded to that this morning.  I come from the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  Are there any realistic or serious plans for a rail line from Dublin to Navan, continuing on to Cavan, where there was a line previously.  Some of it is used for the mines in Navan.  If we are serious about our environment, city congestion and making the cities realistic working places, which, as it transpires, they continue to be for people living in more rural parts, I would like to know Ms Graham's views on that and whether there is any sense of priority about a rail development like that which would bring commuters from Cavan and Monaghan into the city.  Unfortunately, we depend very much on our public transport.  Fortunately, we have a good bus service but we have no rail line.  I would like to hear Ms Graham's comments on that.<\/p> <p>  I do not see the environment in Cavan-Monaghan changing any time soon - the number of visits by the IDA to Cavan and Monaghan is a single-digit figure - in terms of any real investment or employment.  Unfortunately, we are back to a day when, like ten years ago, predominant employment for builders and skilled workers is in the city.  Any day travelling on the M3, one will find car loads of people stuck in traffic on that corridor.  That is why a rail line should be a realistic priority and something we think seriously about to service people in that area.<\/p> <p>  On a positive note, the feedback I get from constituents is that the local link is a positive development.  We have to look beyond 11 p.m. at weekends, if we are serious about rural isolation, servicing and providing real transport for people living in rural areas like Cavan and Monaghan.  That needs to be expanded upon.  While there have been initiatives announced recently, I wonder if there are plans for expansion in Cavan-Monaghan.  People come into my clinics from small villages, like Redhills, which are linked into the main towns of Cavan.  It also provides a great service for students attending Cavan Institute.  I would like to hear Ms Graham's comments on that.  What is happening is positive and we need more of it.<\/p> <p>  On Bus &Eacute;ireann, I have spoken to Mr. Hernan before about its adjustments, which he has called \"enhanced services\" for the M3 corridor.  I would like Mr. Hernan to reflect on those services and the changes that have been made.  What is the feedback on them?  Are they as effective as they were expected to be?  I would particularly like Mr. Hernan to comment on the change of bus drop-off points at the Mater hospital because for me and for my constituents it was a real bone of contention and a real disappointment when those changes were made, particularly for the elderly and people who are ill, attending the Mater hospital.  That was a very important stop to them.  I know changes were made to that.  Could Mr. Hernan reflect on that for us?<\/p> <p>  I do not want to repeat what has been said already but I concur with much of what was said about school transport.  While I understand that Bus &Eacute;ireann is the provider and has to go by the policies laid out by the Department of Education and Skills, I concur with what was said.  I came across a family of four siblings, three of whom were going to Virginia college.  The only school the youngest child could get to was St. Clare's in Ballyjamesduff.  There were three children in one family going to one school, and the last child was sent to another.  Could Mr. Hernan comment on whether there was a phasing-out period?  That would have been a logical thing to do, and perhaps it was done.  I am sure it is the same for my colleagues but the most frequent and probably the most frustrating representation made in my clinic is by parents coming in about school transport and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I spoke with my staff before I came in here.  They said last year they were getting responses much more quickly than this year.  Could Mr. Hernan tell us to whom we can go to deal with representations about school bus transport?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#J00800","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1529487000,"counter":959,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their opening statements.  I am going to start on school transport because I have been dealing with it for a long time.  We have the case of Kate, who has a valid medical card, but her parents were advised that Rebecca is eligible to get a school bus ticket but she cannot be issued with a ticket as there are no seats available on the bus.  Kate's siblings currently travel on that bus route.  Whose responsibility is it to provide a bus big enough to take all the eligible students?  Could Mr. Hernan answer that question, specifically?  Who decides on when the closing date is for applications for school transport?  Students who find that they have to repeat their leaving certificate are then considered to be late applications and are put into another category.  Who is responsible?<\/p> <p>  On school transport, I suggest this committee invite the Department of Education and Skills, which is responsible, and Bus &Eacute;ireann to come in and comprehensively answer questions.  Children are being deprived of seats on the bus.  I take the point that was raised around Government policy.  I have followed the policies right through from Fianna F&aacute;il's Mary Coughlan, who did the review in 2008 or 2009.  The buck must stop somewhere because children are entitled to a seat on the school bus, particularly in rural areas.  There are all kinds of precarious situations where one could end up with child protection issues, children arriving late for school and all that.  It has a real impact on children's education because there is not a proper school bus service.  I would like that to be addressed separately.  The biggest problem is the lack of flexibility, or the rigidity, around transport.<\/p><p>Changing anything is like trying to move the <i>Titanic. <\/i>Sometimes trains arrive in Westport five minutes after the bus for Louisburgh has departed.  It would seem logical to change the departure time once a lack of connectivity has been identified.  It is impossible to get routes changed and find out who is responsible.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, is failing abysmally on the key objectives regarding route development and expansion.  <br\/><br\/>One of the key objectives stated is to &quot;ensure that rural transport services are comprehensively linked to and integrated with public transport services provided by other entities including Bus &Eacute;ireann, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and other private operators&quot;.  That is not happening.  Does the NTA map services in all counties and is there a proper map of all the routes?  How often are these maps updated?  What community consultation takes place on these routes?  In my view, there is a lack of proper community consultation.  Was Mayo among the counties that made applications for LocalLink later?  <br\/><br\/>On communication and timetables, trying to have a timetable provided at a bus stop is like trying to send somebody to the moon.  Could the provision of timetables and other forms of communication be facilitated in order that people can find out what routes are available?  It is no good asking people to check a website because most of those who use rural transport services do not have access to broadband services or other technology.  A means of communicating with people must be found to enable them to find out when routes are running.<br\/><br\/>While I am glad bus shelters are back on the agenda, we were told they are dependent on funding.  Is funding available for bus shelters and, if so, will the witnesses outline the process for applying for bus shelters and the criteria and timescale involved?<br\/><br\/>Has any work been done on transport that is conducive to meeting the needs of children and adults with autism or non-physical disabilities?  Has research been done on this issue and, if not, will a study be done in respect of noise and other factors that cause distress for people with disabilities, specifically autism?  Will the witnesses also comment on moves to ban those with free travel cards from using transport services during peak times?  Such a ban, which is being mooted, would be a backward step for people trying to access hospitals, etc., and I would certainly resist it.  <br\/><br\/>The document also states that the level of engagement with the Health Service Executive differs between areas.  Will the witnesses comment on that issue in the context of the HSE's obligation and responsibility to engage with the NTA and Bus &Eacute;ireann?  A lack of access to transport has social and economic consequences.  Many people cannot turn up for appointments because they do not have access to transport.  People in parts of Mayo and Galway who have to travel three hours each way for an appointment - a six-hour round trip - need transport.  The survival of rural Ireland depends on the NTA and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I plead with both organisations to examine this issue.  While certain things work well, major changes are needed and many of these require nothing more than greater flexibility and a different approach, as opposed to additional resources.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#J00900","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529487000,"counter":961,"content":"<p>I will bring in Deputy Niamh Smyth briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#K00200","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speech","time":1529487000,"counter":962,"content":"<p>I have a question for Mr. Hernan.

Perhaps Mr. Hernan will outline the type of communications done in the lead-up to service changes. <\/p> <p>  On bus shelters and information at bus stops, we know major improvements are needed in this area and we want to roll out a comprehensive programme.  More funding is becoming available now, although not to the levels we would like either this year or next.  In future years, we want to rapidly expand the provision of bus shelters and, with our partners in Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus, improve the information and timetables at bus stops.  We have not done any specific research in respect of noise-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1529487000,"counter":965,"content":"<p>On the issue of bus shelters, what is the process for applying for a bus shelter?

People are travelling during the peak hours, during which services are increasingly congested and reaching capacity in some places.  Moving to off-peak would be one option to help to address the issue of peak travel and capacity issues.  As I said, it is not something we are currently planning but it is a measure that might have to be taken depending on where we go in terms of funding and providing additional capacity.

There are no plans to add direct services from, say, Monaghan town to Dublin but services are flowing from the Donegal-Letterkenny area through Cavan and Monaghan with a significant uplift in frequencies.

Why has Bus &Eacute;ireann not got a system that in May or June, the numbers of people who are eligible or discretionary are applied for and that it knows its figures by July to allow it put on whatever bus is suitable for each route?  This was discussed with Mr. Martin Nolan of Bus &Eacute;ireann when he was before a committee.<\/p> <p>  In a private business, that is how one makes money instead of leaving people standing on the side of the road or a youngster coming on after three more of them going on a bus.  It is bread and butter in any business as to how a person does tender.  With tender documents, a person must give him or herself the flexibility to have all the differently sized buses priced in on that route and that each year it is subject to A, B, C, depending on the number of people travelling and it is a three-year contract.  However, it must also be written down - meaning there is no comeback for the subcontractor - that any child who may not have a medical card but wants to go to school is facilitated.  Funnily enough, the buses are passing by and they are giving Bus &Eacute;ireann but they do not want to take it.  I am baffled at Bus &Eacute;ireann's system.  Whoever is in charge needs to have a damn good look at how it does its tender documents.<\/p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is hiring a significant number of subcontractors on its routes with no meters on some of the buses.  Why is that?  Is it because it has no workers to drive its buses?<\/p> <p>  The size of the buses on different routes varies.  On some routes, Bus &Eacute;ireann uses a 53 seater when a 19 seater would do.  It needs smaller buses for certain routes.  I cannot understand why it is not buying them for efficiency.  The whole country is on about carbon but there are large buses going up and down the roads with only a few people in them.  I am a contractor.  I do not send the largest tractor in the world to work the smallest field.  I adjust accordingly.  As is required, I can move it up and down.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has statistics on the numbers travelling on different routes, day in, day out.<\/p> <p>  I heard the views of two people this morning who are in favour of electric cars.  Going on what I heard from them, I would not like an electric bus.  People should know that the bus procurement budget has to be increased by 25% if we opt for electric.  From what I have heard about hybrid diesel, particularly in the heavy vehicle sector, the diesel part will be used most of the time.  There is no point in codding ourselves.  For between &euro;17,000 and &euro;20,000, a heavy vehicle can be converted to gas.  Why has it not been examined?  Gas is probably the only way forward for the next 12 years until they perfect the hybrid diesel system.  How many straight diesel buses has the company bought in the past two years?<\/p> <p>  School buses work a few hours day and are parked up for the rest.  Why is there not joined-up thinking between the NTA and Bus &Eacute;ireann for using them for local services such as Local Link?<\/p> <p>  Ms Graham earlier spoke about the numbers using bus shelters.  Essentially, if three people get on a bus in Ballinlough, County Roscommon, and 23 get on at Mullingar, due to financial constraints, the passengers in Ballinlough will be down the ladder when it comes to getting a bus shelter.  I want a straight answer to that.  If that is the way, there are parts of rural Ireland which will never see a bus shelter.  We are as well to be straight with them without announcements and people thinking they will get a bus shelter.<\/p> <p>  Is it correct that the NTA has nothing to do with the western rail corridor or any train service outside of the greater Dublin area?  I have travelled on the DART several times.<\/p><p>I understand the State has a lot of land extending out to Dublin Airport and I understand from talking to people in Irish Rail that there could be a spur from the DART to Dublin Airport.  We keep going down this road of tunnelling, which would cost a massive amount of money.  I worked on tunnelling, so I understand a bit about it.  We talk about 15 years to 20 years time.  The figures I am hearing from people in the rail sector is that &euro;200 million to &euro;250 million could solve it in the context of the DART.  Why is that not being considered?<br\/><br\/>Could the witnesses elaborate on why <i>per capita<\/i>people in rural parts of Ireland have less money spent on them compared to those in the city of Dublin in the context of public transport?  Am I correct in saying that the envisaged RuralLink service will pick people up at 8 p.m. and bring them home at 11 p.m.?  If one was in any other part of the country, one could get a bus at 9 p.m., or at 10 p.m. if one was in the city.  One might go to the pub at 11 p.m. and go home at 12 p.m.  Is one going to be restricted to a certain length of time?<br\/><br\/>I would like the witnesses to comment on the anti-social behaviour we are hearing about at the moment and on what they intend to do in terms of protecting buses and the rail network.<br\/><br\/>The witnesses spoke about future plans involving Galway County and City Councils.  There was talk in the national planning framework of a Luas-type system in Galway.  What will happen in Galway over the next ten years?  At the moment, Galway is chaotic.  Will there be a Luas-type system in Galway in the next ten years because as far as I can see, there will not be?  Galway needs bus corridors, of which we are all well aware.  What concrete actions are being taken in Galway?<br\/><br\/>To go back to the western rail corridor, to Galway, Tuam, Athenry and Claremorris and to the line that is closed, Ms Graham said it had nothing to do with her.  She said to Deputy Kenny that she did not envisage any new rail lines being opened under this plan, which is a ten year plan.  Will a Minister have to make a decision to do this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#M01500","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529487000,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>I call Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.

What we know is that many more rural people, as evidenced from the travel to work surveys, travel to cities to work than heretofore, and they are travelling further.  I will take Galway as an example, although from the very useful map, one can extrapolate the same thing for Limerick, Waterford, Cork and elsewhere.  The commuter routes out of Galway are as follows: Galway to Carraroe; Galway to Clifden; Galway to Headford, Cong, Shrule, Ballinrobe and beyond; Galway to Tuam; Galway to Roscommon; Galway to Loughrea and Ballinasloe; and Galway to Gort and Ennis.  What absolutely blows my mind is the lack of definition of what a commuter service is.  There does not seem to be any focus on the fact that a large number of people want to come into the centre in the morning and to get out as fast as they can in the evening.  However, they do not all start and finish at the same time.<\/p> <p>  I am going to define what a commuter service should be and what should be put in place along these routes.  At an absolute minimum, it should be within the hours of 7.30 a.m. to 9 a.m. and should be every half an hour.  For the rest of the day, it should be at hourly intervals.  With the railway line from Ballybrophy to Limerick, one would be better off walking.  There is one service in the day, one each way.  Who would want to take a service like that?  Miss one and wait until tomorrow.  With a commuter service, one misses one and gets the next.  Is there a commitment to that kind of frequency on the main commuter lines in and out of all the major towns and cities with third level institutions and hospitals because otherwise I cannot see how one will get the passengers?  It becomes a f&aacute;inne f&iacute;, a vicious circle.  If one does not provide the service, one will not get the passengers.<\/p> <p>  I accept the witnesses do not have responsibility for rail outside Dublin.  However, it is interesting to look at the passenger numbers and the population of a town like Athenry.  Proportionate to the size of the town, there is a huge number of people using the rail service from Athenry to Galway.  Why is this?  It is because by accident, between the Limerick, Athlone and Dublin trains, one has a reasonable service frequency.<\/p> <p>  I would like the view of the witnesses on what is a commuter service.  Is it one bus in the morning and one bus in the evening, with an hour and a half frequency after that?  Am I right that to really attract commuters, one needs at least half an hour frequencies during commuter times and maybe hourly at other times?<\/p> <p>  I am totally supportive of the RuralLink idea, that is, that one runs buses on the main routes and one gets the RuralLink buses to pick up people in the villages and smaller places.<\/p> <p>  The next issue is my hobbyhorse.  We, in rural Ireland, are fed up paying a subsidy in fares because people do not get fair play.  There is a fear of giving them fair play.  I am going to stay on this issue until we get justice.  The rate per kilometre on rural services, non-Expressway, is twice that of the urban services.  That is a simple fact.  It is archaic and there is a fear of changing it because a slight rebalancing might be required.  It does not matter how much rural people are over-charged as long as it is not rebalanced in respect of people who happen to live in big cities.  We are not taking this anymore and we are going to keep highlighting it until we get justice.<\/p> <p>  That leads to the question my colleague, Deputy Fitzmaurice, alluded to.  Bus &Eacute;ireann serves in excess of one million people in the most densely populated part of the country and it gets &euro;60 million of a subsidy.  Bus &Eacute;ireann and RuralLink between them get less than &euro;50 million and they serve up to 4 million people.  Maybe Mr. Hernan can confirm this, because he has access to the figures and knows the facts, but no State subsidy goes to Expressway, so we can take it out of the cake, and if I break it down the figure further, my understanding is that a fair bit of that &euro;50 million goes to urban services in Cork, Waterford and Galway.  In fact, when I take the rural services, I find that the subsidy per head of population is absolutely minuscule.<\/p> <p>  Some 1.1 million people live in the county of Dublin.  There are 800,000 people living in Connacht-Ulster.  That includes Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and the province of Connaught.  One would expect that Connacht-Ulster would get eight elevenths of the transport subsidy that Dublin receives.  One would think it would be the other way around in a city where there are thousands of people using the services and that the subsidy would be hugely skewed towards the rural areas.<\/p><p>We find, however, that it is the other way and that there is total inertia, bad services and unfair charges.  We do not need to wonder why people do not use the buses.  Country people are very pragmatic but I wish for services to be provided to meet our needs.<\/p><p> Other people may have difficulty getting responses to representations on school bus services but the service I get in that regard is first class.  The co-operation and facilitation of the Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus service is fantastic and I compliment it in that regard.  I accept that it cannot go outside the rules.  Is Bus &Eacute;ireann going to move into the 21st century and focus services on meeting people's needs?<\/p><p> It is impossible for young people attending university to get accommodation in places such as Galway.  To qualify for a non-adjacent grant, one must live 45 km or more from the college.  The witnesses can see on their map that Carraroe is the furthest westerly point of Galway Bay.  Most of it is less than 45 km from Galway.  Even if a student from Carraroe can get accommodation in Galway, he or she will not be able to afford it because the adjacent area grant would not pay for a few weeks of accommodation.  Travelling 45 km from Galway would bring one beyond Loughrea, Dunmore or Tuam.  A significant number of students and young working people have to get home in the evening because they cannot afford to stay in the city.  They cannot get home either, however, because there is no bus to take them there.  I acknowledge that work is being done on an evening service but it is too slow and more is needed.  It is archaic to be unable to get out of town after 6 p.m. on the arterial non-Expressway rural routes and it does not face the new reality.  These are practical and doable services for which there is a market but the service must be provided.<\/p><p> I ask Bus &Eacute;ireann and the NTA to consider a policy of toilets being provided on all new buses with scheduled route durations of more than two hours.  That is not necessary on short services but it is important, particularly for elderly people, that there be a toilet on buses with a journey duration of two hours or more.  Most modern buses that undertake long journeys have toilets.<\/p><p> Rail and subsidies were mentioned.  We are running national transport services for the entire country, not just areas with lots of people.  All people pay taxes.  The loss on the Cork to Dublin line is &euro;45 million, while there are losses of &euro;11 million on the Limerick to Ballybrophy line and &euro;13 million on the Limerick to Galway line.  The loss on Dublin suburban lines is &euro;51 million.  The witnesses may point out that the loss per passenger on the Cork to Dublin line and the Dublin suburban lines is far less than on the other lines I have mentioned.  Of course, it is less per passenger.  How does one get passengers to use a service that hardly exists?  If the services are provided, passengers will use them and the price per passenger will decrease.  Those losses take the central costs into account.  The savings would drop dramatically were the lines to be closed because there would then be no saving on the central services.  These lines need to be upgraded rather than closed.  They will not solve Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's problem because, simply, all rail lines need to be subsidised.<\/p><p> On Dublin, for years there was a very good campaign to reopen the Harcourt Street tram line.  It is now the Luas line from Bride's Glen.  It was also very fortuitous that the Broadstone line through Cabra was preserved as it is also now a Luas line.  For many years, people wondered why there was an empty tunnel under the Phoenix Park when most people want to arrive at Connolly Station rather than Heuston Station.  Connolly Station is in the part of the city where people work.  Suddenly, hey presto, the tunnel could be opened.  Services are not frequent enough, however, and it is a pity the train from Galway does not use the tunnel or arrive into Connolly Station on the Mullingar line, but that is another day's work.<\/p><p> There is an open railway line from Navan to Dublin which is regularly used by trains.  The only problem is that they are freight trains from Tara Mines.  Why does the commuter service which terminates in Drogheda not go to the railway station in the centre of Navan town?  Has there been a costing of the upgrade of that railway line to allow it to take passenger trains?  It seems obvious that the train could run to Drogheda, turn left, as do the ore trains, go to Navan and a few more stations between Drogheda and Navan and then return.  One would not need additional trains because the ones currently operating to Drogheda would suffice.  Why is the Navan-Drogheda loop not being used for commuter rail to Dublin?  In a similar manner to the Harcourt Street tram line now being used by the Luas or the tunnel under the Phoenix Park once again being used, some day the penny will drop and the line from Drogheda to Navan will reopen, as will the line from Athenry to Claremorris.  The latter will not happen under this Government but it will open in my lifetime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#N00300","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529487000,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Peter Burke to bring this round of questions to a conclusion.

I ask Ms Graham why that is so.  Was no application made?  It had been brought to my attention that the service from Granard to Longford town is very welcome.  However, Killoe, the biggest parish in Longford and which is almost at the midway point of the route, is less than a mile from the road on which the bus travels but the NTA seems unwilling for the bus to stop there in spite of the demand that has been demonstrated for such a stop.<\/p><p>Is there any way we could look at that?  Councillor Gerry Hagan, who lives in Killoe, brought this to my attention.  He has received many representations on it.<\/p><p> On trains at Mullingar station, there is supposed to be public consultation on putting extra routes on the Dublin to Sligo line.  I was concerned that they would go in the opposite direction to commuters, so that the train would leave Dublin in the morning to Sligo and leave Sligo in the evening going to Dublin.  What is the reasoning behind this being suggested?

To ensure the continuity of services for our customers, first and foremost, I made a decision that, in some instances, we would have cash fares.  However, we have invested in ticket machines.

If there is flexibility, I am more than happy to consider the matter.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned fleet management, or the allocation of buses and their size.  This has been an issue.  I acknowledge it is something on which we have focused in my time to ensure the size and capacity of buses are more aligned with the demand for the service.<\/p><p>One example to which the Deputy referred in the past was Athlone where the size of buses appeared to be excessive versus demand.  I can confirm that, with the additional buses due to arrive between now and the end of June next year, all buses in Athlone will be replaced by others of smaller size, which will be more reflective of the demand for the service.  Aligning the fleet with demand is consistently under review, both internally and also with the NTA.<\/p><p> The final issue to which the Deputy referred was the use of gas buses.

The proposal being worked on would see a bus service approximately every 30 minutes at morning and evening peak times and then at a core frequency of every two hours throughout the day.  The service would extend into late evening such that there could be a bus services at 7 p.m., 9 p.m. and 11 p.m..  That would meet the requirements of those who want to go to and from work, to college if they have late lectures, or to socialise in Galway.  That is our initial plan for services to and from Carraroe.  <\/p> <p>  When we make a change on a route, we review demand and the response from the public.  Almost exclusively, based on changes we have made in the past two years, the frequency will increase further.  An example would be route 458 from Ballina to Sligo to Enniskillen.  We increased the frequency of the service to every three hours and are now considering increasing it to every two hours.  Again, it is in reaction to demand.<\/p> <p>  There were two other comments on changes to networks.  Route 115 was mentioned by Deputy Peter Burke.  We are finalising that proposal and hope to introduce the new timetable in the first week of September, the week after the papal visit.  That is the current plan.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to route 336, from Kilkee to Ennis, and route 333, from Doonbeg to Ennis, we are completely revising the network.  It will be based on enhancing connectivity between Kilkee and Ennis and also linking Doonbeg with Kilkee.  A bus service will start in Doonbeg and travel to Kilkee and then to Ennis via Kilrush.  One will also be able to catch a bus in Kilkee, travel to Doonbeg and on to Ennistymon.  There are two routes, with a circular bus route in each direction.  We are considering increasing the frequency to approximately seven services per day on the main line between Kilkee and Ennis.  It will start early in the morning, with the first bus service at 6.05 a.m., approximately, which will connect with the first train service from Ennis to Dublin.  There will also be a later bus service at night at 9 p.m. from Ennis.  There will be a bus service at 7 p.m. that will feed from the last train service from Dublin to Ennis.  One of the requirements on which we receive a great deal of feedback was to be able to move from west Clare to Dublin, to do whatever business one had to do in the capital and to get back on the one day.  There will also be an increase in the number of services on a Saturday, a Sunday and public holidays.<\/p> <p>  On the vehicles to be used, the service will be rolled out initially with standard coaches, but part of the new fleet is to be allocated to this network.  Therefore, from early 2019, the service will be operated with fully low floor accessible vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1529487000,"counter":1063,"content":"<p>I had a question on fares.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#R00400","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1529487000,"counter":1064,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, there is another meeting which is due to start here-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#R00500","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speech","time":1529487000,"counter":1065,"content":"<p>It was a simple question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018062000002#R00600","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529487000,"counter":1066,"content":"<p>We continuously look at improving the fare structure to make it better value for customers.

We are honoured to be here and feel passionate about the bachelor of arts in visual arts, BAVA, on Sherkin Island, accredited by the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT.  For those who do not know, Sherkin Island is known internationally and locally as the \"Island of the Arts\".  The BAVA programme is a key driver in the island's economy.  It is a grassroots initiative taken by the island community which grasped the key issue of population decline and decided to build an economy through the arts.  There are five people living permanently on the island as a result of the programme.  In a time when traditional island incomes such as farming and fishing are in decline we have created skilled jobs in the community for three roles divided between four people.  This brings great benefit to the island.<\/p> <p>  Approximately &euro;60,000 in funding is required every year to deliver the programme.  For an investment of &euro;60,000, a programme valued at approximately &euro;415,000 is delivered by the community, DIT, the West Cork Arts Centre and voluntary input.  We market Sherkin as the island of the arts.  We have done surveys - further surveys are needed - which show the economic spin-off of the bachelor of arts in visual arts programme for the area is approximately &euro;150,000.  The BAVA programme provides value for money and is a very successful arts course.  It is a full-time four-year degree programme accredited by DIT.  Students attend classes on site for four years every alternate weekend.  Classes are held in a local community hall.  The facility is nothing fancy, which proves that high-end quality education can be delivered anywhere.<\/p> <p>  The programme was established by the Sherkin Island Development Society, DIT and the West Cork Arts Centre as a degree course in 2007, following a successful pilot programme which ran from 2000 until 2006.  As the community partner, SIDS is responsible for accommodation and facilities, including the community hall, and direct employment of an arts facilitator, information technology facilitator and administrator.  Between 2012 and 2016, the programme was co-funded by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Cork County Council.  In May 2016, the co-funding agreement was altered to provide that the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht would contribute 60% of funding and Cork County Council would contribute the remaining 40%.  The costs are broken down as &euro;45,000 for wages and employers' pay-related social insurance, PRSI, and &euro;15,000 for running costs, which include maintenance, insurance, professional fees, rent and materials.  The course provides value for money.<\/p> <p>  Within these four walls, in this great building, the Government and local authorities are seeking measures to tackle depopulation and other problems in rural Ireland.  The Sherkin Island community has an innovative programme which it wants to keep and secure for the future.  The bachelor of arts in visual arts is tried and tested.  It provides employment, directly supports 5% of the full-time residents on the island, brings inward investment and contributes to the island's social, cultural and economic life.  As the island of the arts, Sherkin Island has a sustainable tourism product.  We are a big part of the Wild Atlantic Way and cultural Ireland.  The BAVA programme is a significant part of our identity in west Cork.  It drives the reputation of the island as a centre of culture and the arts.  It is a service for which there is a demand and need.  For this reason, we need to keep it and secure its future.<\/p><p>We need preapproved funding for communities so that we do not have to have &euro;60,000 upfront every year.  It is a big ask for a small community to find that amount of money and to decide whether to borrow it and pay interest on it.  We thank all our partners, particularly our funders in the Department who have been on board and supported us down the years, as well as Cork County Council which has committed to another three years in funding.  It looks like we have secured the funding going forward and we are looking for a sustainable way to make this programme work.  It is a massive draw, not only to Sherkin Island but to west Cork and rural Ireland.  It does not have to be done in arts - it can be for any type of education.  We have lost our primary school and we are struggling to get an education for our kids at primary level so it is important to hang on to our arts degree programme on the island.  We will tackle the primary school issue in another way but we have to hang on to some level of education and the arts are a huge part of our identity.<\/p><p> Ms O'Neill Collins will talk about the arts side of the programme.  She is an artist, a facilitator, and islander and a founder of this.  She is passionate about it and she knows the arts inside out. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Aisling Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>I have been involved in this for 17 years and I came to the island almost 30 years ago.  When I first came, fishing and farming were important for the island but, unfortunately, they have disappeared and the arts are now our strength.  Sherkin Island is unique and people are now coming to the island, when they used to have to leave the island.  This project could be tried on any of the islands.  The most important thing is that, instead of a gallery, artists use the beach, the farms and the kitchens.  Any college could set up in a rural area but in this case the community is very involved.  A student working on REPS got involved with the farmers and did something on social dancing, which brought people out of themselves and led to information being shared.  The farmers, fishermen and ferry people all share their information on the history and culture of the place and the artists feed into that.<\/p> <p>  When a show is done for the degree course it stays on the island for two days and some 1,000 people come onto the island.  Many artists, writers, poets and musicians live in the island population and from September to May some 40 more come in, which makes a huge difference to the pubs and restaurants, the hotel and the hostel.  In the winter time there is an extra buzz from all this.  Without it the island would be dead.  People stay for weekends and do installations, videos etc.  There is a lot of contemporary art and the islanders have a sense of pride in it all because they feel ownership of it.<\/p> <p>  I was able to raise my children on the island and if I did not have the job I would have had to commute.  Many people have been involved and everyone has given blood, sweat and tears to make it work.  One gets worn down when one is always hunting for money.  We go to the United States for St. Patrick's Day and showcase our artists, which is special for an island of only 90 people.  I want my kids to come back and bring their kids but without this course a lot of things will die.  The funders came and saw the amount of energy on the island and the diversity of what was happening.  Artists work with exciting political issues and personal things and it feeds into Uillinn, the west Cork arts centre, and it is a hub that keeps going.  We all are in the same situation and have to get on.  It would be amazing if the Government and the powers that be could give it the energy it deserves.<\/p> <p>  Some 15 people are applying for the next run and we were blessed to have the Museum of Modern Art involved.  The Tate Modern in Liverpool was also involved and Dr. Michael Birchall opened the show for us.  He was blown away by it.  Jesse Jones represented Ireland at the Biennale and came to lecture here.  These are big names and we are proud to have them in Sherkin.  If we could just have a bit more the world would be our oyster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Majella O'Neill Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1080,"content":"<p>That was a fascinating presentation and gave us an insight into what is happening.

The benefit of this is that we are flexible and capable of responding to local needs.<\/p> <p>  The impact of the NCAD is felt far beyond the campus on Thomas Street.  Our graduates are innovators, co-creators and self-starters and are evident in all aspects of the economy from public engagement through working in public institutions, to technology and industry.  We have a long history of connecting our students and programmes with partners in education, the cultural sector and civil society.  Our contribution to enabling wider participation in the arts is seen in the work of our students as they follow their paths out of college across a range of fields and our school of education trains our country's art teachers.  All our students are encouraged, though their education, to think about the role of their practice as they leave college and the ways they can connect their work to either a specific audience or a specific context.<\/p> <p>  The NCAD has a long and very embedded commitment to access to art college and we will outline the access policy today.  We will reflect on some of the complex and deep-rooted social and economic factors that can militate against wider participation in the arts and how, since 2005, we started to tackle under-representation in the NCAD using a participatory and inclusive approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Sarah Glennie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1082,"content":"<p>We started an access programme in the NCAD 15 years ago and it was initially embedded in the school of education.

We have built relationships and established partnerships within the local community, with 35 DEIS primary schools and 42 DEIS secondary schools.  We also have a range of outreach programmes in the greater Dublin area and County Dublin.  Our focus is on bringing students into the campus.<\/p><p>This remains a key priority in terms of the access days we provide, our student shadowing programmes where the students spend time working along NCAD students, and our mentoring programme through which our student teachers mentor access students interested in a career in art and design.  We also provide portfolio scholarship programmes over the summer and during the year for students from disadvantaged areas.  We recognise the critical role played by teachers in raising academic aspirations for disadvantaged students and we have a whole range of pre-entry programmes of engagement with primary and post primary schools.  We have a supplementary admissions route.  We have post-entry support and, more recently, we provide a postgraduate studio support residency programme for our graduated access students.<\/p><p> In terms of the barriers to higher education in art and design, admission policies generally in Irish colleges are very competitive and selective, and entrance to art college can represent a double disadvantage for students with little cultural capital and little knowledge of the field.  Increasingly, many middle-class families avail of private tuition for their children such as grinds or portfolio courses, summer schools and trips abroad to galleries and museums, to gain some advantage in this competitive educational terrain.  For our access students the prospect of getting into an art college can be very complex.  The portfolio alone is a huge challenge with somewhat vague career prospects for those people in the art and design industry, particularly if they choose to do fine art, which is a pretty precarious profession.  Our access students, who come from a non-traditional route, may look different when they come to college.  They may feel different, act differently or dress differently.  It is very important for us to be able to make our access students, with whom we have made contact through the schools, feel that NCAD is their home and that they can come back and consider a career in this field.<\/p><p> In terms of a cross-institutional collaborative approach, I am sure many committee members are aware of the HEA funded programme for access to higher education, PATH.  It is aimed at widening participation throughout third level for those most disadvantaged and minority groups in our society.  NCAD is working alongside Trinity College Dublin, UCD, Marino Institute of Education and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology in a three-pronged approach to widening participation.  Path one is based on initial teacher education and trying to increase the number of learners from this particular area who go into the further education sector.  Path two involves the 1916 bursaries.  I am not sure whether the committee is aware of them, but this year 80 bursaries were given out to students from disadvantaged backgrounds across the five colleges.  Path three is bridges to learning, which deals with more in-depth for work packages under the umbrella of Dublin as a learning city.  This includes open learning modules in the universities and mentoring students from minority groups in the third level sector.  NCAD is particularly involved in leading the creative arts summer school, which starts next week, across the five campuses.  This is rolling out now and we are looking forward to a very co-ordinated approach across the sectors.<\/p><p> The community engagements in which we are involved are very much a range of local partnerships in the arts and beyond.  I will not go into huge detail, but these include IMMA with which we have a very strong relationship because we are on a cultural corridor in Thomas Street, luckily, and the national galleries and museums and Collins Barracks are all very close to us in the heart of the city.  We have a strong relationship with IMMA in terms of our school's visual culture, fine art and education.  We have future creators, which is an after-school digital learning programme for young people co-funded with Digital Hub.  Rialto youth project involves Easter and summer art programmes in NCAD in collaboration with our cultural institutions.  We also have student placements. mentoring and campus engagement with smaller groups such as SOLAS and Tallaght Community Arts.  NCAD runs an entrepreneurship summer camp with Axis Ballymun and the Rediscovery Centre in Ballymun.  This is a snapshot for the committee of some of the work NCAD does in our access programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Dervil Jordan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>NCAD is very committed to our students.  All art and design students are challenged through their learning to consider how their creative work will find a place in society and to think about the context for their work with potential audiences and the potential for their work as artists in collaborating with people working in specific contexts and different audiences.  We are starting a new initiative in September, studio plus, which is a new voluntary year for students between second year and third year.  The programme will encourage them to take their work out of the campus and work in different places in the community around us.  An example of this is our collaboration with Mercer's Institute for Successful Ageing in St. James's Hospital.  Throughout all of next year we will have students embedded in that unit.  The studios will be there and the teaching will take place in that institute.  It has an incredible innovative creative life programme and the students will be part of this.<\/p> <p>  For 25 years NCAD ran a learning programme in Portlaoise Prison, with NCAD staff providing opportunities for creative engagement for people in prison, critically at the same level of those being offered to people in third level education.  A lot of participants in that programme then went on to partake in further education in art and design.  In the context of today's discussion, we mention this as a past programme because we think it is a really good and clear example of where long-term investment and engagement really do lead to change.<\/p> <p>  The other learning we wanted to bring to the table from our history of engaging beyond the campus with people in creativity is the value of cross-sectoral collaboration, where we think beyond the silos in which we operate, which are often dictated by funding models more than anything else.  Professor Jordan mentioned an example of this.  As an educational institute we have collaborated with national cultural institutions such as IMMA.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the commitment of the committee to broadening participation in the arts, and we recommend that Government initiatives to support this are reflective of the ongoing work happening in a range of organisations in the educational sector and in cultural institutions, and that there is a commitment at policy level to longitudinal research in arts participation, something that has never really happened at a significant level in Ireland.  This would provide us with real evidential data of the impact of the creative arts for all of us to build informed strategies so we can really think about how, through creative art, we can meet the needs of our changing society in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Sarah Glennie"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.

At the centre of the festival are individuals, who are at the centre of all arts activity.  This is obvious in the images of people who dominate the festival and in the images of groups of people connecting with each other.  It is about the personhood of the individual, which is something that gerontologists talk about all of the time.  It is hugely important to all of us no matter what age we are but particularly as we get older.  It is about the social connections that come from attending our festival.  These were the two key points I was going to make through using images.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tara Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>We have copies of the presentations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#D00500","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>I can answer questions afterwards on the images.  We believe creativity is a lifelong journey, and the life course of people engaging in the arts and creativity is key.<\/p> <p>  I will make some points on aging and the arts, which might be new to some committee members but certainly will not be new to others who are here.  I do not need to go over the figures.  We all know that Ireland, as a western country, is getting older and by 2040 approximately one in four of us will be 65 and over.<\/p><p>That is something the State is considering well in advance.  It is positive that we are living longer and healthier lives.  It should not be seen in a negative light, which is something we are used to from some media coverage.  It means people continue to be engaged and have more time to be engaged in different activities.  They demand rich and meaningful engagement.  As a State, we must take care of that, which is what we are doing with the festival.<\/p><p> There is a demand for the festival and we see that every day it runs.  We see it in what is said to us after people have been to an event and we see it in the audience surveys we carry out every single year.  We see it in the evaluation we do every single year.  We have 100,000 people who come to our festival from every county in Ireland.  We see it also in the emails we get from all over the world from people who say they do not have a festival like this.  They tell us the work is amazing and ask what they can do.  We also have people from across the world who come to our festival.  I met five people from Japan, Canada, the UK and Germany who came specifically for the festival this year.  There is definitely a demand.  In 2017, Age UK carried out wellbeing research which surveyed 100,000 older people in the UK.  The No. 1 factor contributing to their wellbeing was access to creativity.  That was ahead of financial security and health, which was pretty meaningful.<\/p><p> Regarding aging and the arts, I mentioned earlier that there are many benefits to all art activity.  The reason we get involved in the arts are the personal benefits first and foremost.  They provide the intrinsic value and are about how we create a sense of identity for ourselves and meaning throughout the arts.  That is incredibly important as we get older.  It is there throughout our life course but as we get older, there is sometimes a suggestion that one's self identify has stopped somewhere along the way.  That is simply not true.  We continue to create and recreate our sense of self and the festival focuses on that.  Selfhood is key to it.  From those personal benefits, however, come societal and State benefits.  I mentioned the social connection that comes from attending the festival and meeting one's friends there.  We also run an audience network where we put together older people who want to come to the festival and to arts events in general.  We co-ordinate those events around the country and actively put people together.<\/p><p> If one wants to look at it from a public policy perspective rather than simply from a consideration of the personal benefits, the confidence and connections which emerge from the festival obviously contribute to social cohesion.  Our Sherkin Island friends here outlined the importance of that.  We see it also in the Bealtaine festival.  There are also physical benefits which are sometimes harder for people to see.  Research has proven that there are cognitive benefits from a focused and deep engagement in arts activities.  Those things are crucial for older people.  It is very important for the State to take that into account along with the sense of wellbeing which is at the centre of the festival.<\/p><p> To say a little about the festival itself, it is produced by Age and Opportunity Ireland, which is a national organisation that promotes wellbeing and quality of life in older age through education, sport and culture, which is where we come in.  We are funded through the Arts Council and the Health Service Executive and we are all about partnerships.  The festival takes place every single day of every May of every year.  We cannot do it without the partnerships we have in each and every county.  We are extremely community connected.  We have a network of thousands of organisations and events every year.  This was founded in the 1990s in response to a need and we have a long pedigree now.  A founder member, Ms Helen O'Donoghue, curator at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, is with me here.  The identified need was the need for access to the arts and creativity at all ages and, in particular perhaps, as we get older and have a bit more time to get back to things we did not have time for when we were working.  That is when one is not working in the arts, of course.<\/p><p> The festival is about access first, but also about representation.  We need to be able to see ourselves in the world around us to have that sense of selfhood.  As one gets older, some people, albeit not all, can feel more invisible.  The arts provides a very public way for people to see themselves mirrored in the world around them.  We try to tell the stories of all of us as we get older and we try to hold ourselves up very publicly to the world through the arts with the festival.  It is about visibility and representation.  It is about showing the individual's spirit, no matter what one's age.  One can be 80 and just as feisty and different an individual as a 20 year old.  One of the things that happens as one gets older is that one is homogenised into a ghettoised block as if one is part of a special interest group.  It is as if one loses a sense of self and is somehow amorphous.  As all of us who are getting older know, it does not work like that.  The framework for all of this is a celebration of the contribution of older people in Irish public life and the arts.  It is really about celebrating the contribution of age.<\/p><p> In a policy context, we feel we could do a bit better.  Obviously, we fit into broad Government policies, some of which are set out in the documents before the members.  Those policies are very much about older people staying active and sometimes creativity is tagged on.  We fit into arts policies most specifically.  Most recently, one pillar of Creative Ireland is creative communities which is about enabling every community to be creative.  As the festival takes place all over the country, we believe we very much fulfil that policy objective.  We are also part of Making Great Art Work, which is the Arts Council's policy document, but we are implied rather than listed.  Young people are very much part of that document.  Our view is that the policy needs to take account of the life course of all of us.  In the same way that young people are very important, and I do not take away from that for a minute, older people could be recognised explicitly rather than implicitly in a policy context.  There is also, of course, Culture 2025.<\/p><p> I will leave the committee with a couple of recommendations.  We meet a strong need.  The arts have a very particular role to play in older life in relation to identity, meaning, activity and health.  Because of those social and personal benefits, we feel we address an equity issue.  If I were to leave the members with one thing, it would be the need to look at the life course of people engaging in the arts in relation to policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tara Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>We like recommendations so keep them coming.

Arts and Disability Ireland is the national development and resource organisation for arts and disability.  Our role is to champion the creativity of artists with disabilities and to promote inclusive experiences for audiences with disabilities.  Guided by our strategic plan, Leading Change in Arts and Culture 2017-2021, our board, staff, stakeholders and funders, including our principal funder, the Arts Council, Arts and Disability Ireland works nationally through a series of multi-annual partnerships across the arts and cultural environment.  In 2017, this has resulted in 18 projects, 17 accessible performances and exhibitions and support for 24 artists in the creation of new work, showcasing, mentoring and training across nine local authorities.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, Arts and Disability Ireland was invited by the Arts Council to devise and manage a new funding scheme for artists with disabilities in Ireland.  Entitled \"Arts and Disability Connect\", the scheme is now in its fifth year and has supported 47 awards and distributed more than &euro;132,000.  The only scheme exclusively open to artists with disabilities, it was designed to serve as an entry point to the broad range of bursaries, project and production awards, commissions and collaborations available through the Arts Council and local authority arts offices.  However, we have identified while managing the scheme the need for a separate production award and the creation of new family-friendly work.<\/p> <p>  In 2006, Arts and Disability Ireland initiated the very first of our access services for audiences with disabilities with audio described performances at the Abbey Theatre and during the Dublin Theatre Festival.<\/p><p>Over the years a small number of venues and festivals have started providing Irish Sign Language, ISL, and, more recently, relaxed performances.  Currently, we are the sole provider of audio description and captioning to the arts in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Arts &amp;amp; Disability Ireland's audio description and captioning across Ireland peaked in 2014, with 23 and 30 performances, respectively, but declined to nine and seven in 2017.  If we compare that to Scotland, last year there were 248 audio described and 68 captioned performances in 2017.  A deaf woman told me that her seeing a captioned performance of <i>Romeo and Juliet<\/i><b><\/b>at the Abbey Theatre came 17 years after she had studied the play for her leaving certificate.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>A Strategy for Equality, the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, was published in 1996 and identified a network of national venues where audio description, captioning and ISL should be made available but 22 years later, these recommendations have yet to be realised in their entirety and are certainly something collectively we need to revisit.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 introduced the new public sector duty under section 42 of that legislation.  This is an encouraging tool to enable public bodies to embed human rights and equality, including disability.  However, the section offers no direct legal remedy for failure to comply.  Consequently, we encourage the committee to consider how the public sector duty under the 2014 Act will be realised in the context of an arts and culture environment.<br\/><br\/>In 2017, Arts &amp;amp; Disability Ireland commissioned the Going Out survey with the aim of understanding how people with disabilities engage with arts and culture in its broadest sense.  The largest quantitative audience survey of its type ever undertaken in Ireland, Arts &amp;amp; Disability Ireland reached 523 respondents with the strategic input of the National Disability Authority and over 20 other disability organisations.  The research indicates clearly that people with disabilities attend the arts, so it makes good sense to make arts attendance accessible to people with disabilities.  This is 643,131 people and 64% want to attend arts events more often.  If we made it possible for just half of them to come one more time, bringing a friend or family member with them, the arts and cultural sector stands to earn an additional &euro;7 million.<br\/><br\/>If I were to use one example to illustrate our vision for the arts, it would be Ignite.  This 2013 to 2015 partnership between the Arts Council, Arts &amp;amp; Disability Ireland and local authorities in Mayo, Galway and Cork created three new commissions each worth &euro;60,000, led by internationally recognised artists with disabilities.  This culminated with Cork Ignite on Culture Night 2015, Simon McKeown&rsquo;s 28-minute, large-scale projection that filled the fa&ccedil;ade of Cork College of Commerce and involved visual artists and musicians with disabilities from across the city.  With Ignite, we achieved so much of what is great about the arts, including collaboration, partnership, innovation and spectacle for an audience of 10,000 people.  We also illustrated that public investment in arts and disability can create opportunities for people with disabilities to contribute to the arts and cultural life of Ireland at the highest level and cause a city to stop and notice.  As one citizen of Cork put it:<\/p><blockquote>I never thought that I&rsquo;d be sitting down on the banks of the River Lee, in the month of September, on a cool autumn evening, enjoying myself.

We have seen through all the presentations that arts is plural and it is about having a collegiate approach.  There are those in our society who are seeking an engagement with the arts and there are people creating the product and developing the service that arts can offer.<\/p> <p>  McAuley Place is pretty unique in many ways and it is a pleasure and honour for me to be its chairman, given that I am not originally from Ireland.  I am from Northern Ireland.  I took over the chairmanship of McAuley Place last November and it has been an absolute privilege to interact with those who have such a vision for a wonderful environment as McAuley Place.<\/p> <p>  For those who do not know it, McAuley Place is located in Naas, County Kildare.  It is primarily a housing association - that was the original intent - and it provides 53 units of accommodation for those advancing in years.  It is first-class accommodation that is home for people, and the primary aim of McAuley Place is to provide a home.  For those who do not know me, I was previously chairman of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive for ten years.  I have always used the phrase, \"It is not where you live but how you live\".  Accommodation can be built that suits a location but it might not suit the people who want to live there.  The environment in which one lives dictates how one lives and how one conducts one's life in accordance with circumstances.  The arts play a major part in creating that environment so people can enjoy the social interaction that comes with living in whatever environment they inhabit.<\/p> <p>  McAuley Place has expanded and is a &euro;1 million-plus community enterprise.  Its income streams are generated from rental income, tea rooms, charity shops, a community centre and cultural activities and donations.  There is a fantastic sense of spirit within the town centre.  The resident base is varied and covers many traditions, and visitors and those who participate in our activities are from many traditions and nationalities.  There is a mix of genders and people from rural and urban backgrounds.  There are people who have come to live in an urban environment who were previously in rural areas and it is fantastic to hear their view on engagement with the arts.  We have created an environment where people can enjoy living while contributing to how we develop that environment.  Ms Margharita Solon had the vision for McAuley Place and I am honoured for her to be here today.  We are a double act in many ways and she will contribute on the aspects of her vision being translated into reality through the delivery of some programmes and activities.<\/p> <p>  We have much more to do.  There is a housing requirement - a term I use carefully - but we must get the right type of housing and the right environment in order to create the right communities and develop the correct ethos for living.  We must also create a culture where the arts and those involved with the arts understand what is meant by people \"living\".  It is not about creating something people do not want but rather creating something that people can buy into.  We must work with those in the arts family to refine and advance the product.<\/p><p>This is critical because we live in a new world of digital connection and we must bring that world into the arts, which is a challenge for us.<\/p><p> In many ways our biggest challenge in McAuley Place is Government policy, where Government policy sits in relation to Government resources and how that is matched with the collective vision of everyone in this room and others outside.  It is a question of how we bring this pluralism of vision, resource and policy to the table and how we can advance our thinking accordingly.  We have one big vision, which is our health-through-learning centre, on which Ms Solon will elaborate in a few moments.  That vision is still just a vision for us because the reality is that we find it difficult to find the right funding streams for us to take it forward.  The commitment of our organisation is that we will have to do that ourselves.  We have to go into advance borrowings as an organisation but we want to create and breathe life into that vision and create an additional, very positive activity stream for McAuley Place.<\/p><p> I believe McAuley Place brings a sense of hub to living in Naas.  Most people, if not everyone, around Naas knows McAuley Place; our challenge is to get to know them.  Their knowing us is fine, but we must know them.  We must advance our thinking in society.  We must do arts with society but also within society.  The challenge is to get the \"with\" and the \"within\" on the right platform.<\/p><p> I will hand over to Ms Solon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Rowntree","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1098,"content":"<p>Thar ceann &aacute;r mbord bainist&iacute;ochta, is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn a bheith libh anseo inniu.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.  We are honoured and proud to have Mr. Rowntree.  He is a visionary.  He talks not about processes but about people, about how processes serve people and people do not serve processes.  As soon as he came to McAuley Place, he hit the ground running and he got exactly what it is we are about and what we want to do.  I know he will take us to new heights.  We are absolutely honoured and privileged to have him here.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Byrne made the really interesting statement that we are hearing an awful lot more about an ageing society and that by 2040 there will be so many people over the age of 65.  In 2020, I will be 65.  What do I want?  This is about me and my ageing.  This is about my one year old grandson - no one ever had a grandchild before me - and the kind of society I want for him and where I want my 30 year old kids to be.  I want them to be in a place like McAuley Place where the arts connect us.  It is not that the old ones are over there, the children are in the cr&egrave;che over there, the disabled are over there and there is a programme going on here.  We are a community and we all live together, and the commonality between all of us is our creativity, which is part of the aspiration of Creative Ireland.  When I am 65, when I have a little more time, I want to learn how to arrange flowers like they do in the craft group in McAuley Place.  I want the opportunity to publish my own poetry in a poetry book in McAuley Place.  I want the opportunity to be in an arts project like the intergenerational community arts project that went on for over a year and brought carers, people with disabilities, people with learning challenges, unemployed people and everyone else all together.  However, there were no labels or badges.  The people connected because they were learning and doing something together.  One lady who participated in this arts project had terminal cancer.  She was living in McAuley Place.  Within two weeks of her moving into McAuley Place, she halved her pain medication.  Her condition was still bad, still deteriorating, but the arts, creativity and connection were releasing dopamine that was making her feel far better than any medical prescription could.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Rowntree said, we want to develop our vision for this old building, this health-through-learning centre.  People still look at us and say, \"What?\" and we say \"health through learning\".  Likewise, people asked us why we were providing housing in the heart of the town for older people and said such housing is always on the periphery of the town.  \"Housing with intergenerational what?\" they asked.  \"With intergenerational facilities,\" we replied.  They asked us what we meant by a creative model rather than a medical model.  Now they are coming from all over Ireland to see what it is we have done.  I have absolutely no doubt but that when, not if, we get the funding to complete this health-through-learning centre, it will be another flagship not only for Ireland, but beyond Europe.  Our health-through-learning centre will consist of a community lounge, just like a residents' lounge in a hotel.  If one is from the community, one can be in the lounge.  A label is not needed.  It is not that one is unemployed, has mental health issues, has disabilities, is new to the town or is an asylum seeker.  That does not matter.  If one is from the town, one can go into the community lounge.  One can go through the community lounge and out into an incredible urban woodland garden with a river running through it, where one can connect with the environment and with nature.  It is an amazing space that makes one feel well.<\/p> <p>  Then one can go into the three creative making rooms, where we have activities such as woodturning, weaving, flower arranging and basket making.  There are opportunities for people from NCAD to do this outreach with us, exactly the same thing Ms O'Neill Collins was talking about: repopulating areas.  Naas has been devastated with ribbon development outside the town, but McAuley Place is bringing people back in.  It will bring even more people back in so it has an economy of scale in itself.  We are doing all that we are already doing with what we have.  As Mr. Rowntree said, this is creating an even better hub in order that when, not if, we develop more houses, we do not need to replicate everything about McAuley Place.  McAuley Place is the hub that connects to these other satellite communities that we have created, that are intergenerational, creative and artistic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Margharita Solon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1099,"content":"<p>The Chairman said earlier he was looking for recommendations.  If I may be so bold as to put one or two forward, I believe it is in the interests of us all to look at the social capital we have available to us and to maximise the opportunity from that.  This is not about efficiency savings; it is about best value.  It is about stretching the envelope of opportunity as opposed to restricting the envelope of spend.  I believe that social capital needs to be understood and interrogated further.  Many organisations have huge amounts of social capital, as does Government, and we should do more research to look at what we can bring to the table and how we structure that in the form of partnerships, strategic alliances, closer associates, etc.<\/p> <p>  We should look at training and development in a structured fashion for volunteers, particularly around arts and culture.  We should look at models of intervention that add accreditation and value so people can feel rewarded in a different fashion for what they do because they have some badge of respect that says they have contributed and their contribution has been understood and acknowledged.<\/p> <p>  We must have a more co-ordinated policy around intergenerational activity which looks at appreciation, respect and development in these areas, where the outflows add to the other recommendation I have outlined.  We also need to establish a nationwide network of key hubs, which I think can be done quite swiftly, key centres into which people can feed.  Those can then have sub-hubs, but we need a nationwide network of regional hubs through which we can filter ideas, learning and development, and then we can outflow from those in a structured fashion.  The co-ordination of the arts is the simplistic part, its development is more long term, but the understanding of the arts is the job we have in hand.  We must work harder and more smartly at understanding the value and the contribution the arts make to how one lives, not where one lives.<\/p> <p>  Again, on behalf of McAuley Place, I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Rowntree"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1100,"content":"<p>M&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas.

I thank all the witnesses for being here because we got from them a really tremendous sense of the arts as it relates to youth, education, lifelong learning and the elderly.<\/p> <p>  I will ask a few very specific questions and then the witnesses can come back in and answer me as they see fit.  The first question is could the committee visit Sherkin Island?  What is the standard of the work?  Will Ms Moran and Ms O'Neill Collins talk to me a little about that?  Why do I not know more about it?  They can be thinking about these questions as we go.  Ms O'Neill Collins's contribution about any college coming to a rural area was a brilliant idea, and I would link it into something Ms Solon talked about, namely, that combination of people coming in and bringing their own knowledge and others learning from them as well as gifting their own knowledge.  The course is validated through DIT.  If we want to recognise the course more, do we give it more money?  Is that what the witnesses want?  Will they nail that for me and why I do not know more about it?<\/p> <p>  I know the Bealtaine Festival very well.  I admire it and think it is extraordinary.  Dr. Byrne makes the same point Ms Solon makes, that access to creativity is access to great health and that great health is great creativity.<\/p><p>The witness makes that point from that extraordinary survey.  I was at a big organisational event this morning about positive ageing and life ageing in towns and villages.  Creativity was only tagged onto things.  It was not central to what people were discussing.  Will the witness expand on the point that political parties, and perhaps all Departments, should have an arts section?  If the organisation was looking for one thing for this committee to make real what would it be?<\/p><p> Can the representative from Arts and Disability Ireland say if Ignite being reignited?<\/p><p> Can the representative of the NCAD tell us a little about the Mercer Hospital ageing unit and the Creative Life Centre?  Why has the college not argued for 25 extra points in the Central Applications Office, CAO, system to open up the arts for study by students?  We readily do it for mathematics.  What other things would the representative like to see NCAD doing, if it had a wish list?<\/p><p> On McAuley Place, could the committee visit it?  Can the witness tell the committee a little more about its music series, its art, its environmental art, the Alzheimer's choir and the food hall?  I know about them but the committee might like to hear about them.<\/p><p> My questions are really about what we can do.  Much of this can be policy and talk, which is very good and ethereal, but what can we do?  We are discussing something really interesting.  If we are going to age and age well, creativity must be the start of it.  When people talk about technology they always talk about creativity.  When they talk about economics they also talk about creativity.  However, we do not look at it artistically or we tag it onto something else or we have our eye on the main chance that it is to do with tourism and it makes money.  However, it is brilliant in itself.  If we started from that premise we might go further.<\/p><p> The witnesses might have other things they want to say that they might not have said earlier or that my questions might have sparked in them.

Majella O'Neill will be able to tell the committee about that shortly.<\/p> <p>  With regard to a visit, everybody in the room is welcome to visit Sherkin Island.  We will put them on a ferry on a beautiful day and they can all visit.  We are very lucky that the programme co-ordinator from DIT, Dr. Glenn Loughran, is amazing.  We have visiting lecturers.  As Majella O'Neill mentioned, we had Jesse Jones and Dr. Michael Birchall from the Tate Modern.  Throughout the course of the academic year DIT has people visit and give lectures.  We open that up to the community so they are probably the best times for people to visit.  We will let the members know about it.  We are lucky that DIT puts so much into it.

When one is focusing on trying to fight a fire it is hard to try to promote it and tell everybody what we are doing.  That becomes secondary because one is worried about whether it will be in place two months hence.  That was our reality until May this year.  That is why we were invited to speak here.  It has been sorted.  We are delighted with our funders in the Department and Cork County Council but the future is the issue.  It is a community of 90 people and we must find a sustainable method of funding so the members of the community, who got up off their bums and did something positive, do not have to find &euro;60,000 up front to fund it.  That is not sustainable for a small community in rural Ireland.  We need to have a meeting where everybody can discuss how to do this and whether there is a way of pre-funding it.

Professor Jordan mentioned the HEA funded programme of access to higher education, PATH, which has just started.  We always have short-term initiatives such as Ignite; therefore, there is additional funding for a moment and then it is gone.  For us, there is ongoing work on access and being able to encourage a broader base into the stream of arts education because that is from where our art makers will come.  That is one of the fundamental aspects in breaking down the socio-economic barriers to people seeing themselves as having the right to participate or be part of the creative community, as Professor Jordan discussed.  Changing that stream of people coming into arts education is one way by which we can address the issue.  The access programme is critical in that regard.  It is something about which we are thinking generally in the NCAD.  The idea of what an artist can be is really changing, as we have seen in all of the presentations.  I referred to the need to challenge young artists to think about what it now means to be an artist or designer or whatever categories into which we put people in terms of the boundaries we put around them.  An artist is not just a person sitting in a studio producing objects that disappear into a commercial system and are bought.  There is so much more potential in how their creativity can play a role in society.

We can all be creative, innovative, appreciate and mainstream.  It is important that the arts not be seen as a survival course; they must be seen as something that is endorsed and a business that represents those who are investing their skills and time in an enterprise.  What we have to do is help the arts to mould and others around them into a fabric that society appreciates and understands is required and that it also sees as sustainable.  One cannot develop the arts until one develops the framework and foundations on which they are set, as otherwise they are doomed to fail.  As I said, there is a need for a combined platform of policy, strategy and resources.  The resources can be brought to the table by the arts, but they must also be underpinned by social and investment capital from the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Rowntree"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1128,"content":"<p>I know n&iacute;l a l&aacute;n ama againn ach gach l&aacute; t&aacute; ruda&iacute; iontacha ag tarl&uacute; i McAuley Place.

Having never understood what they were, I have seen so many people in local community hospitals become involved in the arts.  They find so much joy in places such as Schull, Skibbereen, Bantry Hospital, Bandon, Kinsale and Dunmanway.  I have seen them in community hospitals and nursing homes and it means so much to the patients.  We have travelled that road and by now community hospitals are places we would all like to be inside.<\/p><p>I am not being too parochial about things with regard to Sherkin Island but I am delighted that Ms Aisling Moran and Ms Majella O'Neill Collins are here today to give evidence.  They were supposed to appear before the committee four or five months ago but the snow struck.  That might have been a stroke of luck because it may have allowed a bit more time for the issues that were outstanding and a cause of major concern some time to get sorted.  I recall that Aisling rang me at 7 o'clock that morning to ask if this committee meeting was going ahead.  I said \"Absolutely\" but then I pulled back the curtains in my apartment in Rathmines and said \"It is not; it is off, end of story\".  Aisling said that Tom might not agree with me.  I said that I did not care what Tom said that the meeting was off.  I said \"Forget it.  I will not be going outside my own door, let alone have you coming up from Sherkin Island.\"<\/p><p> To be honest, islands are suffering and haemorrhaging in many respects.  Islands are fighting an uphill battle.  There are eight islands in my constituency and I meet with islanders.  I go to the islands and I hear the issues but we are fighting the battle.  Sherkin Island lost its school a few years ago, which was a major blow to the island.  This degree course is a lifeline not only for the island but has a major financial benefit for other businesses in places such as Baltimore, Skibbereen, Union Hall, Glandore and Leap.  These places will all benefit because of the people who come to Sherkin Island for this visual art degree.  I commend the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for funding this course.  I also commend the local authority, the commitment of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the work done by the Sherkin Island development society over the past few years to continue this.  It went through a major difficulty at the beginning of the year but the stakeholders stuck with the task and remained focused, and thankfully the funding eventually became available to continue the course.<\/p><p> One Saturday approximately a month ago I went to the island for the graduation.  The local council chief executive officer, Mr. Tim Lucey, was there along with another local representatives and local people.  We were stunned at the large number of people flocking to the island that day.  It probably happens on other days too, but on that particular day the people were coming to see the event.  It clearly stunned me and others to see the benefits - not that I had any doubts about it - and I am glad the situation was resolved and is moving forward.  There is now a focus and they know where they stand for the next number of years.<\/p><p> The islands are facing a tough time and this initiative is unique.  I fought very strongly to make sure it stayed as it was.  There are negatives and positives.  When the school closed on Sherkin Island, the children of the island needed to get a ferry to school.  Perhaps some people do not call it a chaperone, but the parents are fighting very hard to get a chaperone to take the children on the ferry because parents are trying to work.  These are some of the big disadvantages.  The particular service is not in place at the moment as we are waiting for the Department to see if it can be put in place.  Bere Island had a public health nurse who was there full time but who has now been brought back to the mainland.  Every time it involves a fight to keep a service.<\/p><p> I was on Sherkin Island recently doing a clinic.  There was no phone line for six months because of Storm Ophelia and no agency cared.  If the islanders do not fight and shout, very few others will.<\/p><p> There are also positives about the eight islands I represent.  On Long Island, off Schull, which I visited recently, a couple from the UK has just opened a bed and breakfast.  Collins is their name but they are no relation.  There is talk about building a community centre on Whiddy Island.  We are aware of the amount of work done by Tim O'Leary with the Bank House.  Dursey Island has its new cable car.  Cape Clear Island and Bere Island are all fighting for services.  John Walsh does great work on Bere Island.  This art degree course is a great story for Sherkin Island and it has secured the future going forward.  Everybody needs to be commended in this regard, and for making sure the funding is kept in place.<\/p><p> I appreciate the opportunity to say all of this.  When it looked like the course was doomed, we were going to afford the stakeholders the opportunity to give evidence to the committee and to let the nation know the benefit of the course not just to Sherkin Island, but to the whole State.  However, as I said, the snow intervened and this may have allowed a little extra space and breathing time for this matter to be resolved.  Thankfully, it has been resolved and I am delighted all the witnesses are here today.  I second Senator O'Donnell's proposal that the committee members visit the islands.  It would be great to educate ourselves and to see what is going on, although we may or may not get to all the islands.  I would be quite happy to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#J01700","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

This means that we got our funding, like everybody else, in December 2017, for January-December  2018.  From September 2018, however, we will know what our funding is for 2019.

We are inter-generational, but on the flip side in five years' time, we will lose all our children because one cannot get a primary level education on Sherkin Island.  One can, however, get a third level degree.  It makes no sense and the policy works against us.  The policy exists for the mainland.  The Senator asked how come the committee did not know about Sherkin Island.  I am letting the committee know about the other issue we have, and which people need to know about.<\/p> <p>  The representatives from the National College of Art and Design spoke of progression.  Our students' progression shows how they go on to master's degrees and PhDs, and we have all the figures on this from the BA in visual art course.

We have 64 students who have gone through over the last 15 years.  None of those students has just left and put their tools away.  They are practising artists, they do PhDs, they travel abroad and they are involved in arts and health.  There is a plethora of things they are involved in.  The West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen helps to give them jobs and everything feeds into everything else, but the most important thing is the community's involvement.  There is ownership there.  If a community feels the respect when people come in, that the community is part of it also, then the world is the artist's oyster at that point.  We have an 86 year old graduate.  When she embarked on the course everyone thought she was definitely going to go down a very safe route artistically.  This student, however, became very involved in video.  She came to the course painting and drawing, but she actually learned technology and has just opened an exhibition.

I have visited Sherkin Island and know it well.  It is a beautiful island.  There is no better experience than being on an island.  People constantly speak of the need for connectivity but sometimes we also need to disconnect and there is no better place to achieve disconnection than on an island.  Members have asked many of the questions I intended asking.  One of the points underlined, however, was that we do not need to locate all third level education in Dublin or the other big cities.  Thousands of people are moving from counties around the country into the big towns and cities where they are encountering serious problems such as the accommodation crisis.  Something like an outreach campus in different parts of the country could allow students to remain in their locality and facilitate the cross-pollination of their ideas.  These could eventually develop for the counties in question, rather than having everything located into Dublin.<\/p> <p>  On the arts and older people, somewhere along the line we have inverted our value system in regard to older people.  We talk about being a more inclusive society but in many ways we fracture people from general society.  One of the points made, and it is a line I like, was that we are one community.  That is an important part of policy development in that the more integrated we are, the stronger and better we will be at all levels.  What has been the reception among older people for the services and the arts the organisations are delivering?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Naughton's point about a woman who read a book by Shakespeare but only consumed the play 17 years later was amazing.  It was not something that I had thought about previously.  Mr. Naughton also referred to large drop in the number of audio described performances.  Perhaps he could talk us through why that has happened and what steps are needed to reverse this decline.  <\/p> <p>  I have one question for all of the witnesses.  The stable funding model is key because all those with whom I work who receive State funding find that continually chasing this funding exhausts a good chunk of their resources.  The Government and Departments hate multi-annual funding because budgets change and the idea of committing to the future presents a challenge for them.  What is the best way to address this issue with the Departments?<\/p> <p>  My final question is one that people do not like to discuss in these types of forums.  The Departments that fund the work of the witnesses' organisations measure them in certain ways.  In what ways are they measuring outputs and in what ways should they measure them?  I ask the witnesses to deal with those questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#L00300","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1143,"content":"<p>I will comment first and Mr. Rowntree will follow me.  When we were trying to build McAuley Place originally, it took us three years to get our first planning permission.  When we finally went to the relevant Department for funding, we were told that we would not get it.  Our understanding was always that we would get funding once we secured planning permission.  It was at that stage that we were told we were evaluated in respect of bricks and mortar.  If we had gone for a greenfield site on the periphery of the town, a new building would have cost less than working in the heart of the town on a listed building.  We said this was surely about more than bricks and mortar.  It was about brownfield development, bringing new life into an area of the town that had not been working very well, engaging the whole community, keeping people out of nursing homes and promoting the arts as a tool for well-being.  We were told, however, that we could only be evaluated in respect of bricks and mortar.  The process is skewed.<\/p> <p>  It costs &euro;25 an hour for one hour of care for an older person.  We provide community-based care for older people and enabling people to remain independent in their own homes.  I refer to one hour of care.  There are 168 hours in a week.  McAuley Place should be evaluated on what it is doing to keep older people in their own homes but engaged and connected, including intergenerationally.<\/p> <p>  I will make one more point, after which Mr. Rowntree may wish to comment.  The Chairman asked about the reaction of older people to the arts.  I will give a fantastic example of an older couple where the wife was instrumental in setting up adult education in Naas.  As they had no children, they did not have grandchildren and were not connected with younger people.  They were participating in an arts project and the gentleman was the carer for his wife.  She was thrilled to see him engaged intergenerationally with all these people but he was also thrilled to see her engaged with them.  The participants broke up into groups and worked with the arts facilitator.  We will call this gentleman Jim, which is not his real name.  He came over to me that evening and said, \"You are never going to believe this but Jane came over to me and asked if I would be her partner in this project\".  He did not know why a primary school child would want to be connected to him.  He could not believe it but the child did not see the age or connectivity or anything else.  Jim's wife died and although they did not have children or grandchildren, he is still connected with the wider community.  He comes to the tai chi classes in McAuley Place and has lunch in the tea rooms.  I could speak of such cases for the rest of the evening.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Margharita Solon"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>I find that brilliant and fascinating but there must be many other older people who do not participate in anything.

There are many activities that we do not promote effectively.  We do not offer the invitation effectively to people to participate and we do not seek the audience.  We expect the audience and we have to be smarter about seeking it.  If someone goes to those people, knocks on their door, makes contact and asks if they would like to participate, I guarantee that most of them will say \"Yes\".  That is because someone has taken the time to visit them.  They will come then.  There is life and there has to be life beyond city boundaries.  If we do not have that, we will kill rural Ireland.  It is that simple.<\/p> <p>  We have a demographic timebomb and it is ticking.  We have to consider how to address the impact of that timebomb in respect of urban versus rural.  If we concentrate all our services and activities in urban areas, the impact will be more isolation in rural communities.  Communities will not die, not people, because let us face it, when we talk about communities dying, we also mean people will die.  We have to prevent that.  We have to make interventions which are structured and the arts are critical to that success.  <\/p> <p>  The Chair also asked about indicators of success.  We have to move away from expenditure driven indicators to performance and outcome driven indicators.  The Government has to be smarter about the questions it asks in respect of what is brought to the table.  Turning to the big process, all the organisations here, and others, have to be given the opportunity in the bidding process to state what outcomes they will deliver in return for the expenditure they seek.  They must then be held to account for those outcomes.  That is a smarter way to do business.  If we are to drive the arts into a business environment, then we have to encourage arts organisations to think of themselves as businesses.  We have to let them tell us their story and measure them against the outcomes that business would expect to be held against.  This is not about allocating funds and just seeking an expenditure trail.  We have to go way beyond that.  If we have these focused outcomes, the Government, in its summary report, will have a great news story to tell the public.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Rowntree"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1147,"content":"<p>I will respond to the question on participation, the need and demand for participation, measurement and how we reach people.  These issues were raised in one of the other questions.  Bealtaine was founded in 1995 and has grown in each of the 23 years since.  It depends on the participation of more than 100,000 people living in every county in Ireland, so it is self-evident in one way.  That is not said complacently but the organisation would not exist 23 years after it was founded if there was no demand.  As I alluded to earlier, we carry out a survey every year.<\/p><p>We are required to do so, but we also want to know what people think of what we do.  The results are completely overwhelming in the sense that people say things that are very personal to us.  For example, they have said, \"This has helped me find a sense of self,\" \"I need more activities like this,\" \"I came with my carer\" or \"I came with my son or daughter,\" and \"it helps us to connect to go to things together.\"  There is a strong demand for this, but, as I said, it has been around for 23 years and depends on the participation of more than 100,000 people every year.<\/p><p> On the issue of trying to reach people, we are in partnership with other organisations.  We are in partnership with the National College of Art and Design, NCAD, in the creative life programme in Mercers Hospital that Professor Glennie mentioned.  We reach people in medical settings, but we approach them in a non-medical way, as described by Ms Solon.  We are in partnership with Arts and Disability Ireland in trying to create greater access for older people in general to the events we run.  We are working through that network.  We are in partnership with the Irish Museum of Modern Art which Ms O'Donoghue represents, as well as Age and Opportunity Ireland.  That is a smattering of the hundreds of organisations with which we partner.  <\/p><p> A key initiative is a residency programme we run in a care home setting.  It has been very important.  We definitely need more support for the programme.  Very often care home settings are not like McAuley Place which is the standard bearer for a creative care home setting.  There are many absolutely miserable care home settings.  The programme is competitive.  Each time we have run it - twice - there has been great upset when care homes did not win.  Sometimes mass is considered to be an activity in a care home setting, as is bingo.  Members can take their pick.  When an artist goes into such a setting to work for two or three months, it changes completely not only the residents but also their families who see a noted change in them.  The staff working in the organisations learn the importance of creativity. <\/p><p> On the question of measurement, as we live in a neoliberal world, in general, measurement has become quantitative.  We understand the need to judge things in terms of figures.  That is one way of measuring things, but it is a very poor way to measure the arts and life in general.  We would all say the impact of the arts and culture is long-term.  Therefore, we need a long-term measurement.  The change will not happen in one day or one year.  Arts and culture have a long-term impact, which is the reason it is very rich over time which changes lives.  There are long-term studies and national surveys in Ireland.  We all hope the arts are tied into all of the national surveys.  In that context, the qualitative measurement is equally as important as the quantitative measurement.  None of us has a problem with keeping figures, even though we have a very low capacity to do so.  Capacity is needed to keep figures.  People need to monitor them, but it is the qualitative internal change that really matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tara Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1149,"content":"<p>To answer that question and picking up from where Dr. Byrne finished, for the first time this year Arts and Disability Ireland worked with Bealtaine.  One of the reasons we were interested in doing so was that the majority of people with a disability acquired it.  That is particularly true of older people.  We have found anecdotally - this is something we started to test and explore with Bealtaine - that the way to encourage people who acquire disabilities, older people in particular who need audio description and captioning, or the loop system, is to get them to say they need these systems or to make use of them.  That is part of the reason behind the work we are doing with Bealtaine.<\/p> <p>  To answer the question on the drop in the use of audio description and captioning as it relates to the theatre from 2014 through to 2017, there are a number of reasons for it.  One is that the model we were using with the Arts Council to deliver audio description and captioning nationally was its touring and dissemination at work scheme.  It was funding theatre, performance and visual arts companies to tour nationally.  The number of tours has got smaller in recent years.  They are visiting fewer venues and the tours are shorter.  That has meant fewer opportunities to provide audio description and captioning.  When we started to provide audio description and captioning on national tours, the first production, pre the touring and dissemination at work scheme, was Fishamble's \"The Pride of Parnell Street\" in 2011 when we visited eight venues.  It is now untypical for a tour to be that long or for us to get the opportunity to work on a tour that long.  We are in discussions with the Arts Council to change the model, whereby we would work with specific venues.  That was one of the reasons I mentioned the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  There are still recommendations that could, if properly activated, make a big difference.  If we were to move to a venue-based approach, we could take a longer term view and support a number of shows each year at specific venues throughout the country to develop them as hubs and an audience for access.  <\/p> <p>  The issue of resources is a concern which I have heard the operators of venues discuss regularly.  I am heading to Belfast to attend the Theatre Forum conference.  Those who are members of Theatre Forum have spoken about this issue extensively.  They are feeling squeezed.  The Arts Council, local authorities and others want to support the arts groups that come into venues, but they do not necessarily want to support their running costs.  The truth is that in the short to medium term access will cost them a good deal of money, more than what they have.  There will, therefore, be a need for more investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig Naughton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>On the question of evaluation, until last Novemeber I was the director of the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  I am now the director of the NCAD; therefore, I have worked between two departments.  Since taking over as director of the NCAD, having regard to the relationship with the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills, what is expected of us is much clearer.  There is a very clear policy framework under which we operate.  There is also a very developed conversation about what our role is in that policy framework.  It may not be a policy with which we always agree, but there is a very clear set of objectives.  As the director of a national cultural institution, there was no real evaluation because there is still an absolute absence of policy at national level on what is expected from the arts sector.  The conversation about evaluation did not happen.<\/p> <p>  I also say, more generally , in terms of a conversation about participation, that it is very important to think about how it can be supported.  To echo a little of what Dr. Byrne said, it has to be seen in a broader, more holistic sense than just numbers.  What is often left out in these conversations is consideration of supports for those who are making the culture in which we want people to participate.  Recently much emphasis has been placed on support of participation in enabling audiences which is incredibly important, but it must be balanced by support for the makers.  Speaking for an education institute that is making the future makers, we want them to be able to come to a country where our artists can sustain a viable practice and stay here.  Many artists leave because currently it is a very difficult place in which to maintain a professional practice.  We are in jeopardy of losing generations of artists.  We have all heard about the value of the work all of our artists across all sectors contribute to society.  That is very much lost in much of the discussion on arts funding and the thinking about the arts in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Sarah Glennie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1151,"content":"<p>I reiterate that the linkage between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department with responsibility for the arts is crucial in pulling together all of the strands we are discussing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Dervil Jordan"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1152,"content":"<p>Does Professor Jordan think it is evident?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018062000002#M00500","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1153,"content":"<p>It is evident in the arts in education charter.

As Senator Fintan Warfield stated, there is a very strong history and sense of community in the area and it is very important that it be retained.  The potential of creative practice is relevant in that regard.  Several of our projects have worked with groups.  We encourage students to work directly with community groups such as Bridgefoot Community Gardens or the big ongoing European funded project which is looking at the space of the artist in a local community.  A local parade was one of the events to emerge from the latter project.  In such environments creative practice is one of the tools with which people understand the sense of place.

I am joined by my colleague, Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO of the NTA.  I understand that the committee wishes to focus on the core bus corridor project, which is part of the BusConnects Dublin programme.  We will address some MetroLink issues after that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of background, the overall framework for transport provision to meet the needs of the region over the next two decades is set out in the Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy 2016-2035, which was approved by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2016.  The strategy outlines the various networks to be developed, namely, heavy rail, light rail, bus, road, cycling and pedestrian networks, together with supporting measures including park and ride provision, information provision, integration and demand management measures.  The core bus corridor project is outlined in that strategy.  A welcome uplift in public transport funding has been provided in the recently published National Development Plan 2018-2027, which has allocated &euro;8.6 billion towards sustainable transport measures.<\/p><p>The three largest projects are MetroLink, the DART expansion programme and BusConnects, all of which will serve the Dublin region.  However, resolving the transport deficiencies caused by the unavailability of investment over several years will take time, as major infrastructure projects take a number of years to deliver.<br\/><br\/>BusConnects Dublin, which was launched last year, aims to overhaul the current bus system in the Dublin region by building a network of new bus corridors on the busiest bus routes to make bus journeys faster, predictable and reliable; completely redesigning the network of bus routes to provide a more efficient network, connecting more places and carrying more passengers; developing a state-of-the-art ticketing system using credit and debit cards or mobile phones to link with payment accounts and making payment much more convenient; implementing a cashless payment system to accelerate passenger boarding times; revamping the fare system to provide a simpler fare structure, allowing seamless movement between different transport services without financial penalty; implementing a new bus livery, providing a modern look and feel to the new bus system; providing a number of supporting park and ride facilities; rolling out new bus stops with better signage and information and increasing the provision of additional bus shelters; and transitioning to a new bus fleet using low-emission vehicle technologies.  BusConnects Dublin is a programme of integrated actions that, together, will deliver a bus system that will enable more people to travel by bus than ever before and allow bus commuting to become a viable and attractive choice for employees, students, shoppers and visitors.<br\/><br\/>From the perspective of public transport, specifically bus travel, congestion is a major problem.  On the busiest bus routes, bus lanes are only in place for less than one third of the corridor.  This means that, for most of the journey, buses are competing for space with general traffic and so are also affected by the increasing levels of congestion.  As a result, whereas bus journeys should be fast, reliable and predictable, the increasing impact of congestion is undermining that objective.  Additional buses are being added to the system simply to compensate for delays in journey times.<br\/><br\/>The bus system in Dublin is important because it is the main component of the solution to address our current congestion problem and to meet our future transport needs.  As Dublin is a low-density city, there are few areas with the size and concentration of population for rail-based public transport.  This means that, for most corridors, bus travel represents the optimum form of public transport.<br\/><br\/>Dublin Bus carried 137 million passengers in 2017.  When combined with Bus &Eacute;ireann commuter services in the Dublin region, 143 million passengers were carried on State-operated bus services in the Dublin area, compared with 38 million on Luas and 33 million on the DART and rail commuter services.  The bus system accounts for over 67% of public transport passenger journeys in the greater Dublin area.  That means that, while the bus carries two thirds of all public transport passengers, the Luas carries 18% and DART and commuter rail services deliver the remaining 15%.  Due to its regional coverage and its flexibility, the bus system is, and will continue to be, the main form of public transport for most people across the Dublin region.  It is vital that we invest now in ensuring that it can properly perform this role into the future.<br\/><br\/>Overall, the core bus corridor project envisages the provision of approximately 230 km of bus lanes on 16 of the busiest bus corridors in Dublin, which we refer to as the radial core bus corridors.  These are shown in the appendix to my statement.  In addition to these, there is a plan for enhancement of the orbital bus corridors as part of BusConnects.  These proposals will form a separate plan, which will be advanced at a future date.<br\/><br\/>Our objective is to provide a continuous bus lane in each direction while maintaining two general traffic lanes.  In addition, we want to provide a dedicated cycle track on each side of the road, providing safe cycling facilities segregated from other vehicular traffic.  The standard layout also includes footpaths for pedestrians and supporting elements such as pedestrian crossings at all key road crossing points and bus shelters for waiting passengers.  However, this standard layout is difficult to achieve in practice and there are a number of challenges that we face in trying to implement it.  Difficult decisions will have to be made and some locations will require more changes than others.  I will set out some of the likely impacts that will arise from the core bus corridor project.<br\/><br\/>By creating more priority for buses and cycling, there will be changes to how traffic currently moves around the streets.  Some roads may become one-way, new bus-only sections will be introduced and, in some places, general traffic will have to take new routes in and out of the city.  Since there is so little unused space along these busy roads, it will often not be possible to accommodate the bus lanes and cycle lanes in the width available.  In order to achieve the required space, it will be necessary in places to acquire parts of front gardens and land in front of commercial properties.  This would require rebuilding garden walls a short distance back from the existing road boundary.<br\/><br\/>Given that the roads we are widening travel through residential and business areas, there will be a need to reduce the amount of on-street parking to accommodate the new layout.  As with the need to remove some parts of front gardens and footpaths, there will be also be a need to remove trees along some of the corridors.  The public consultation stage later this year will have details and locations of the trees and lands impacted once the initial designs are developed.<br\/><br\/>Every feasible option will be examined to minimise the disruption to people, their properties and the wider local community.  Where there is simply no viable alternative and we have to remove trees, portions of gardens or parking, we will ensure appropriate mitigation measures are put in place, wherever practicable.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the benefits of the core bus corridor project, specifically improving cycling infrastructure, the major bus corridors across Dublin city are also the main cycling arteries.  The widening of these roads for bus lanes provides the opportunity to transform the cycling infrastructure at the same time.  On each of the 16 radial core bus corridors, our objective is to provide high-quality cycling facilities segregated from the bus lanes and general traffic lanes as far as is feasible.  We calculate that more than 200 km of cycle tracks or lanes will either be built or current lanes will be improved upon.  A better cycling network is good for all transport users.  It avoids cyclists sharing bus lanes with buses and will remove many of the conflicts between buses and cyclists.  This initiative is the foundation of the overall cycle network that has been planned for the greater Dublin area.<br\/><br\/>The core bus corridor project will deliver on improving journey times and creating certainty and confidence in the bus system.  Improving current journey times on the key bus corridors will make bus travel more attractive, improve the efficiency of the services and give people the reliability of knowing exactly how long their journeys will take.  This may sound overly simplistic, but the concept of saving time and giving people back time from their commutes to the rest of their lives is a quality of life issue.  However, in the absence of BusConnects, journey times will continue to get worse and commuters will spend more time travelling to and from work each day.<br\/><br\/>Tackling the challenges of climate change is a national priority and BusConnects will contribute significantly to that objective.  Moving people from cars onto sustainable transport is a key component in reducing CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions in addition to addressing congestion and its adverse environmental impacts.  In addition to these beneficial impacts, we want to transition to a fleet of low-emission vehicles, further enhancing the environmental contribution of the bus system.<br\/><br\/>A well-functioning public transport system is a basic requirement for any metropolitan area that aspires to providing plenty of good employment opportunities for its people into the future.  With bus, rail and trams, Dublin boasts great services, but if we are to maintain our capacity as a city, region and capital and to continue attracting the best jobs and employers, we will have to do more, and urgently.  By improving the overall public transport offering, these proposals will make commutes shorter and more reliable, and will therefore make Dublin a more attractive location for employers.  It will also make it easier for people to get out and enjoy the city and all it has to offer, which is good news for businesses in the city centre and beyond.<br\/><br\/>The BusConnects report that we have published on the proposed bus corridors is intended to update people on the current status of the project and what is emerging in terms of the choices that need to be made to deliver a radically transformed bus system.  It allows discussion to take place on those choices and what we want to achieve with the overall bus system in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>As to the individual corridors, work is continuing on assessing options and developing proposals, which will be published for public consultation in September or October of this year.  Accordingly, more detailed information on the individual corridors will not be available until that later consultation stage.  When those details are developed, we will be contacting the relevant property holders - in advance of that public consultation - to provide them with the proposed details pertaining to their properties.  The <i>busconnects.ie<\/i>website will provide regular updates as the project develops.  It also provides the relevant contact details for anyone who wants to contact the authority with his or her views on our proposals.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Creegan will now make a statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#A01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1195,"content":"<p>Before he does, I will ask a question.

Since that publication work has continued on assessing that proposal and at this stage it is likely but not certain that we will propose a single bore tunnel.  A final decision has not yet been made on this issue.  However, if we do adopt a single bore tunnel arrangement it would then be the position that we would no longer need to operate a tunnel boring site at the Griffith Park station location which is on Mobhi Road.  The construction works for a station at this site would still be required but would be of a shorter duration than would have been required to service the tunnel boring operations.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to Na Fianna grounds, since the conclusion of the public consultation last month we have been assessing the submissions received and the various issues raised in them.  We have met with Na Fianna and Home Farm which is adjacent to it and with adjacent schools and have discussed various issues and options with all of them.  We undertook to assess and evaluate these options further and then to engage in further dialogue with those organisations when we had advanced that work.  That assessment work is ongoing.  No decisions on any options at this location has yet been made.

I hope that if other projects come before us, no matter where they are in the city or the country we display that same spirit of going out to the world and meeting with the people because that was very good.  I also praise the NTA for listening to the points raised and taking on board the concerns of those various stakeholders.  While the media reports that the solution is being considered, much as Mr. Creegan has said today, it is good that if anybody, the Oireachtas or a semi-State body is listening to, and taking on board the concerns of the citizenry.  There have been 8,000 submissions to the public consultation.  That is an unprecedented number.  I am genuinely delighted that those voices are being heard.<\/p> <p>  My two questions follow from the Chairman's question on that.  The witnesses might come back to them at the end.  What are the cost implications of single bore rather than a twin bore solution?  What are the timing implications of any change?  My understanding is that it would make no change unless it expedites the work and potentially makes it a bit cheaper.  Do the witnesses have any informed views on that now?<\/p> <p>  I have been fulsome in my praise of the agency.  It does great work and faces great challenges.  It is filled with good people and will have a good legacy.  The plan for 230 km of dedicated cycle lanes and 16 dedicated bus corridors has transformative potential for the city, which, as we all know because we have to come to work here in Dublin 2, at times crawls to a halt.  That will be exacerbated in the coming years.  Getting ahead of this and having a plan is important, trying to change people's mentalities in terms of how bus networks and transport systems work is important.  The BusConnects plan is important but there are some difficulties in its presentation for the consultation.  Why was such a specific number of affected households outlined in this phase 1 release?  If we do not know the identities of the households how do we know an exact number of them?  This is one of the issues that gives rise to great concern among the public.  There are 16 routes and along them there are more than 20,000 abodes yet a very specific number of 1,300 has been identified.  How was that arrived at?  Would it not have been prudent to either reach out to those households and tell them they may be affected if the plans stand unaltered or to wait and release phase 1 and the upcoming phase 2 of the consultation in September-October together?  If the NTA is going to alert property owners, for example, on one or both sides of the Swords Road, which is a very narrow road in Santry, that they may need to sell parts of their land would it not have been better to release both phases of the plan together or engage with those people at this phase 1 stage rather than leave them in the limbo they inhabit now?  It looks as if phase 1 was released for public relations purposes and that the real meat of the consultation is coming in September or October.<\/p><p>I wonder should both releases not have been released together to avoid this negative external attention we now face, which in many ways is very reminiscent of what happened with Na Fianna.

This is proposed for the September to October consultation, I imagine, but how will existing Dublin Bus services interact with this?  Will there be a crossover period?  I presume the routes will be amended and the amendment of the routes is within the NTA's remit.  How is that process likely to be handled?<\/p> <p>  Some media were reporting the BusConnects route or map, as a Dublin Bus service expansion, as though it was a given that Dublin Bus would be operating it.  I presume it would have to go to tender but perhaps the witnesses can comment on whether or not that is the case?<\/p> <p>  Much was done in Dublin city that was planned around the initial three  BRT mooted routes, which were proposed in 2014 or 2015.  Much development work has taken place on lands, based on the Swords to city centre stretch, in particular.  Many planning permissions have been given, etc., based on the strength of the BRT running along there.  The current BRT plan proposes an amendment to that.  What was the rationale for that deviation, given that was a long-standing, publicly flagged route in the previous round of consultation?  I would be curious to hear the witnesses thoughts on that.<\/p> <p>  We face big challenges.  I realise the garden aspect is the one that has caught much of the public's imagination but anything that gives public transport in Dublin a real shake-up is to be welcomed cautiously, if we can iron out the rough edges in it.  Hopefully, our two esteemed members of the NTA can give some answers to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#D00500","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1215,"content":"<p>The member would like replies to his questions now, if that is okay.

We were concerned that we would get tied up in what were the difficulties associated with delivery of the bus corridor project rather than focusing on both sides of the project which include the benefits and what can be achieved in the overall network of bus corridors in the city region and not to focus on the difficult side, which was the gardens.  That is why the decision was made.  Learning a little from the MetroLink consultation, it was about giving the public some information about how this project was developing, rather than focusing on the details.  It was very deliberate on our part to break it up into two phases - a discussion document initially and then detailed consultation to take place in September and October.<\/p> <p>  On the amendment of routes, this bus corridor proposal is required no matter what routes operate on it.  These are the core bus corridors.  One is always going to have a very frequent service level on these corridors no matter who is operating the services.<\/p> <p>  We have decided not to just provide BRT on three routes.  This proposal will bring a BRT level of service to all of the 16 corridors.  Much of the work that we had done on BRT fed into the core bus corridor project and we are proposing a BRT level of service in respect of frequencies on these core corridors.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about a service expansion, we are talking about the bus service for Dublin expanding.

On the metro north, or metro as it is called now, when will the detailed design be published or are will we get changes to the draft design on a drip-by-drip basis?  Deputy Rock was critical that we were not invited to the launch of BusConnects.  Some of us, however, had access to it and were well able to talk about it on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;<i><\/i>before it was published.  Without being invited, the information is being fed to some people.  We are happy with the potential changes which will be made to Mobhi Road and Na Fianna.  This morning on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; it was implied that this new solution would be cheaper and faster but that was not confirmed here today.  What I and the 8,000 people who made submissions to the consultation process would like to know is when will that consultation process be completed?  When will we know the definitive route of the metro?  Everybody along that route who has made submissions is entitled to have the information at the same time.  That must be clear.  That is not to take away from the great work that was done by the submissions and by Na Fianna which came into the committee.<\/p><p>We are here today to talk about BusConnects.  I gave it a guarded or a cautious welcome when it was announced and I stand by that.  My main concern is the time required to implement it, and that concern was not being allayed in any way today.  It is important that we plan and think in the long term.  The lack of investment over the past decade is having a huge impact on our public transport now.<\/p><p>What level of engagement and consultation has the NTA had with the respective local authorities on the route selection to date?<\/p><p>As I said already, according to the NTA this will be a ten-year process.<\/p><p> Does the NTA have plans to increase the capacity on Dublin Bus?  I can share examples with the witnesses about the capacity on the current quality bus corridors.  People are standing at the bus stop at 7.45 a.m. and have to watch seven or eight buses pass by before a bus stops to allow people to embark.  Are there plans to increase the bus capacity in the here and now?<\/p><p> Will any elements of the project be front-loaded such as, for example, the park-and-ride facilities?  Could these facilities be provided in a 12 or 18-month period, as this would encourage people to get out of their cars and migrate to buses?  The NTA alludes to the need to reduce emissions, which is a necessity.  When will we cease to purchase diesel buses?  When can we expect the new energy-efficient hybrid buses?  I visited Edinburgh a few weeks ago and took at least ten buses during the weekend and every bus displayed a big banner stating we were on one of the new hybrid buses.  When can we expect to see that in Dublin?<\/p><p> I welcome the commitment to the cycling network but the track record in this area is poor.  The budget for cycling infrastructure in the past two years has decreased significantly from &euro;18 million per annum to &euro;8 million, at a time when we have seen an increase of 46% in the number of commuters opting to cycle to work.  Funding was withdrawn from Dublin City Council for the Liffey cycle route, which turned out to be a fiasco.  Dublin City Council was at fault for not being able to select a route.  Can we have confidence that a similar situation will not arise in BusConnects?  It is hoped that An Bord Plean&aacute;la will reach its decision by 2020 and construction will commence in 2021.  Are they arbitrary deadlines or must these deadlines be met?  Can the NTA be a little more specific in order that it can be held to account if the project is not delivered within this timeframe?  This project must be delivered and those involved must be working to a timeframe because the 136 million passengers who rely on buses require a better service.<\/p><p> BusConnects will have a negative effect, which will have a bearing on households and on those who regularly use the routes at present.  Will the NTA outline exactly what level of consultation it will have with the people affected?  Will there be town hall meetings along the routes that will be affected?  Will everybody be notified of a potential risk of impact on their dwelling house?  I agree with Deputy Rock that the method chosen created unnecessary anxiety among people.  Without knowing the selected routes, it is hard to see how one could quantify the 1,300 houses that will be affected.  Unnecessary anxiety also was whipped up by some politicians who may have tried to get electoral gain from this issue. <\/p><p> A change in the livery has been raised.  What is the rationale for that?  At present Dublin Bus is achieving a 96% satisfaction rate, which is phenomenal.  The brand value of Dublin Bus is &euro;28 million.  What is the merit of doing away with that?  New bus corridors have been selected but now it is proposed to hold consultations on a network.  Will there be potential for a reduction of services in particular areas?  A potential reduction could have an impact on parents with young children with buggies or people with restricted mobility.  What will be done to ensure it will have no impact on the most vulnerable people who currently use the network?<\/p><p> The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform shared some nuggets in the past number of days, advocating that we should curtail the use of the free travel pass to the hours after the commuter rush hour.

The Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area, 2016-2035 must be welcomed and hopefully it will not end up being an aspiration.  I would like my city colleagues to be happy about issues arising from the route of MetroLink, such as the impact on the sports ground of Na Fianna and other disturbances.  However, we on the committee also must consider the cost implications.  The proposed single bore is almost the equivalent of a triple bore because to get the two bores into a single bore will require a bigger bore diameter.  That would drive up costs enormously in extraction and back-fill.  Has the costing been done for this proposal before we jump into taking this solution?  I am not an expert on engineering but I can do the maths.  Going deeper into the ground might be good for the residents on the route because it might lower noise pollution and keep it underground.  My concern is about astronomical costs that will delay further projects down the line, as the money will be used on MetroLink, which is an essential requirement for the transport network in Dublin.  Dublin Airport, one of the busiest airports in Europe has no connection to the city centre.<\/p> <p>  The proposed routes for BusConnects brings to mind a scene from \"The Field\".  We never thought that green areas would become so important to urban people but it is the case.  The tremendous motorways built in the north east by the second last Government have proven invaluable in terms of interconnectivity between urban areas.  At that time, in fairness to Departments and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, they communicated with the landowners and the various property holders to find solutions.  I hope the same process will happen.  Obviously one will need to compensate property owners for taking green areas.  My major concern is that on-street parking for housing terraces will go.<\/p><p>On page 21 of the BusConnects report, which sets out the \"plans to mitigate those challenges\" with regard to parking spaces, it states \"we will seek to provide, where feasible, alternative parking close by\".  How close by is \"close by\"?  How can private residents be compensated for the loss of parking spaces?  While we welcome the overall thrust of this plan, we do not want it to be pursued at the expense of other projects.  We do not want taxpayers to be inconvenienced or to have to contend with additional charges.  Perhaps this money could be spent elsewhere to improve the national transport network outside Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#E00500","speaker":"1278","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1227,"content":"<p>It would be an appalling vista to restrict the times at which people on free travel can travel.

People live with it day in, day out.  Bus lanes and narrow streets can add hours to the working day.  Deputy Troy has asked many of the questions I was going to ask.  However, I do not think one of them has been answered.  How was the NTA able to identify and calculate the specific number of properties, given that it said in its statement that \"more detailed information on the individual corridors will not be available until that later consultation stage\"?  When the announcement was made, people were frightened to think their properties might be among those to have parts of their gardens confiscated or their parking spaces taken.  I hope the NTA's failure to identify these people and liaise with them does not turn out to be problematic for it from a public relations point of view.  The least they deserve is to be given some information to put their minds at rest.  The proposal is fine and glossy but it is fairly scant on the detail.  That is something the NTA needs to look at between now and the public consultation.  It should openly give people some information well in advance of the consultation process on where and how this scheme will affect their properties, what it will actually entail and what effect it have on them.<\/p> <p>  It has been suggested that these works will commence in 2021 and will be completed over a ten-year period.  As we have often seen, for example in the case of the Luas project, projects that involve traffic management always tend to exceed the planned timeframes for them.  This means that the plans for managing traffic congestion for the duration of such projects are very important.  The officials from the NTA should provide a little more detail in that regard.  I did not see much detail in the documentation.  What will be the percentage increase in Dublin Bus services for the duration of this project and indeed when the project has been completed?  <\/p> <p>  I would like to hear the NTA's opinion on the proposal to ban free travel pass holders from travelling at certain times.  I sincerely hope it does not endorse this outrageous and ludicrous suggestion.<\/p> <p>  There needs to be a focus on park-and-ride facilities.  Regardless of where one lives, one should be able to avail of such facilities when one is travelling to work.  I know it is down to local authorities.  Deputy Troy asked about the NTA's liaison with the various local authorities in this regard.  One of the downfalls for every large town and city is the poor planning of the provision of park-and-ride facilities, particularly in commuter towns.

At the moment, all the indications are that the cost of a single-bore tunnel will be broadly of the same order as a twin-bore tunnel.  Maybe it will be a fraction cheaper.  The costs will be broadly similar.  Opting for a single-bore tunnel will not make any difference to the timing of the project programme.

It is fair to say that because the BusConnects project straddles all the local authorities, we have taken the lead role in trying to pull together the principles, the approach, the routes and everything else.  There has been a limited level of engagement with the local authorities so far.  Now that we have reached the stage we are at, we will ramp up that engagement over the coming months.  We intend to develop the BusConnects project on a collaborative basis with each of the four local authorities in Dublin over the coming period.<\/p> <p>  It has been suggested that the development of park-and-ride sites should be front-loaded as the BusConnects project is pursued.  It will be difficult to make bus-based park and ride successful until the bus lanes are in place.  As we said during a previous visit to this committee, we might be able to do one or two park-and-ride sites in advance but others will have to wait until the bus lanes have been provided.  Nobody is going to get out of his or her car to get on a bus that has a congested journey in front of it.<\/p> <p>  We were also asked about the sequencing of the projects, with specific reference to whether any part of the overall project will be front-loaded.  The 16 bus corridors cannot all be constructed concurrently.  The whole city would grind to a halt if we were to try to attempt that.  We have not prioritised any particular one at this stage.  Our current thinking is that we may be able to divide the city into quadrants and tackle one corridor per quadrant.  As we finish each corridor, we could move on to the next one.  We envisage that some version of that will be attempted.  A carefully thought-out sequence will have to be followed in due course if this project is to be delivered.<\/p> <p>  The changes to the bus liveries were mentioned.

The trade-off is that while there will be an increased and improved service along the route of the bus corridor, other services which currently exist will be sacrificed in full or in part to facilitate that.  Bus services in the Dublin area developed over decades not so much to serve places of employment, which is an important factor in the thinking of this proposal and I do not have a problem with that, but more on the basis of community and neighbourhood.  It is common for bus services to connect with a very specific community neighbourhood or large housing estate and for those services to be used a lot by people who are vulnerable, such as those who are sick or old.  The idea of strolling a quarter of a mile to the local bus stop is not as easy for these people as it might sound.  Is it the case that services that currently go into the heart of communities, into big housing estates, for example, will be curtailed to facilitate the new service and that there will be a trade-off?  If that is the case, the NTA has a responsibility to put all the information out there so that people can make a judgment not on part of the facts but on all of the facts.  The witnesses tell us there will be 16 new corridors, which is a positive, and 230 new cycle lanes, which again is very positive.  If the plan is implemented as it is currently being framed, however, what is the number of housing estates that currently have bus services going into the heart of them which may no longer will have such bus services?  I am asking the witnesses to comment on the general point of a trade-off.  Will housing estates lose out and are we talking about being able to count on one or two hands the number of housing estates that will lose out or will it be dozens, hundreds or more?<\/p> <p>  If there is a dedicated bus corridor, presumably there will be fewer cars on that route, so those cars will go somewhere else.  They will be pushed to the left, right, north, south and on to other routes.  There will be a knock-on effect in terms of congestion on those routes.  I do not expect that to be quantified fully at this stage, but what work is being done in that regard and when will that information be published?<\/p> <p>  There are concerns in trade union circles about the question of privatisation, which is no surprise given what has happened with Go-Ahead.  The witnesses mentioned the idea of revisiting the issue of tendering later in the year.  It does not take a rocket scientist to work out that some of these routes might be more attractive to private for-profit operators than the traditional bus routes that exist in Dublin.  In that context, I wish to ask about worker and trade union input into the plan.  I understand there have been several drafts of the plan to date, perhaps as many as four, but seemingly no consultation of real character with trade union and worker sources, the people who will be implementing a plan if it is to come in on the ground.  What is the position on negotiation with the people who drive and service the fleet day to day?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#H01000","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1303,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Barry.

Overall, a lot more services will be proposed in the redesigned set of proposals that we will publish than we currently have.  Not every service will be the same, and there will be issues undoubtedly, but our intention, as we said at the start of BusConnects, is to enable more people to travel to more places.  That has been at the centre of everything that we do on this.  In terms of the congestion issue, it is absolutely correct that displaced traffic moves somewhere.  The impact of that will be dependent on how successful we are in providing an attractive enough bus system such that more people are able to use it.  We will quantify that at a later point; we do not have it done yet.  We have more work to do.

We have got to be very conscious when one is talking about a bus pass that there is an array of people using public transport who are using a bus pass.  Some of those are people with disabilities or people who have no other way of moving around.  We have got to be very conscious of that.  It seems that we have a Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport who is really the Minister for Justice and Equality and that we have a Secretary General who has suddenly become the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Some of this is really an unacceptable way of communicating and there is a degree of scaremongering that is going with it.  I am very happy that we will write to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection because some of this is unnecessary.  I completely accept the point that unless this is funded, it cannot be provided.<\/p> <p>  We could look at BusConnects and the difficulties and say why it cannot be done.  I remember when the first of the bus corridors was brought in, there were all sorts of problems at the time.  In fact, where they work they can work very well.  I know some of these corridors reasonably well.  One would know them better if one used the buses and one could see where the pinch points and things like that are.  Take my own one bus corridor, route No. 66, which was one of the first ones that was developed.  Apart from the cycle lane, the corridor does not change; it is exactly the same all the way in.  How many others are more or less the same, and really do not require very significant amendment apart from the very important amendment to prevent mixing buses with bicycles?  Certainly, there are an increasing number of people on bikes.  Will they be segregated?  Is physical segregation what the intention is?  One sees that in other parts of Europe and it is a much safer environment for pedestrians to have a physical delineation between the two, and maybe even a difference in the surface.  That would be important in encouraging people to cycle more.  There was a proposal recently about a legal distance.  I had a concern about that because I wondered whether it would be implementable and enforceable.  I think the principle of it is a very good one.  The segregation is one question.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of the current capacity, have scenarios been looked at around the national planning framework, the number of passengers now, where growth will happen and what the capacity is likely to be?  Have those projections been done?<\/p> <p>  Again, using the example of the one along the N4, which is unlike the one to Bray - I do not doubt an improvement is needed along that corridor because we could see with the recent rail disruption that the bus corridor was also problematic - why would one confine it totally to the city or to Dublin, when in fact Dublin Bus has routes that go beyond?  For example, my own area is served by the Nos. 66s and 67s and there is already a population of approximately 50,000 in those three or four towns in north Kildare.  Leixlip, Celbridge and Maynooth are served pretty well by Dublin Bus, but the bus corridor only starts in Lucan.  Why would we exclude that location but still call it the commuter belt?  It seems strange to do that because we want to discourage people from using cars and encourage them to use the buses.  I would have thought that looking at that area also would have been important.  I have no doubt the same is the case in a couple of other locations.  It is certainly very obvious in north Kildare.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the orbital routes, I had expected, if it is BusConnects, to have seen the radial routes with the orbital routes published at the same time in order to get a visual on how that might work.  Obviously, there is timetabling and the points of connection between the buses, and I refer to the comfort of the areas people will require when getting off a bus and the provision of a decent shelter, which can be an issue in its own right.  All of that requires consideration.  In terms of people seeing it as an attractive option, if they get off one bus that is on a radial route and there is an orbital route they can connect with, they should not be waiting 15 minutes for the bus.  That those connections should be made easy.  Will there be a presentation on the kind of timetabling or will that happen some time in future?  Will routes be looked at first and then timetabling after that?  Will any indication be given of what people might expect?  If people see something that is well thought out and well designed, and they buy into it from the word go, it is a better way of appealing to people.<\/p><p> The bus is the workhorse of the public transport system.  In that context, I do not understand why so little attention was paid to the disruption that might have been created, and was created, when the cross-city Luas service was developed.  The signalling system works for the Luas but buses do not get the same priority.  Has consideration been given to prioritising buses too?  The new proposal means there will be more buses and a greater number of people using them.  Unfortunately, bus transport is the poor relation in terms of priority.  <\/p><p> Delivery has been mentioned by the witnesses and Deputy Lahart made some interesting points about delivery at the last meeting.  Is the delegation talking about the private operators who make up 10% of users being allowed to use the same routes as Dublin Bus?  Will it be a seamless operation; 10% of 1,000 buses is 100 buses but 10% of 2,000 buses is 200 buses.  Will the 10% figure remain static?  I accept the point made by the NTA that is has not made a decision or it will not make a decision to expand the scheme.  <\/p><p> What are the downsides, if any, of a single bore metro option?  I suspect that if there is a breakdown or fire that capacity will be lost in both directions.  Are there other downsides that we must understand?  I am sure there is a good reason that the NTA gave consideration to the two bore approach.  I would like to understand that situation so I would like to hear about the constraints and possible difficulties. <\/p><p>I have inquired about locating cycle lanes on bus corridors.  Will it be possible to segregate all of the new cycle lanes?  Is that where the money will be spent, in addition to the land? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#J00600","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1312,"content":"<p>Over the next number of years the NTA will undertake a lot of work, including MetroLink and the expansion of the DART and bus transport systems.

She identified the Lucan-city centre corridor, which is the easiest project.  For the reasons that she outlined, we expect to improve the project.  The route does not have segregated cycling along it and we will take the cyclists out of the bus lanes where we can do so.  There are issues at some of the junctions where the bus priority is well back from the junction but buses get delayed by left turning or right turning traffic, as the case may be.  The M50 junction is another place where we want to see if we can improve bus movement.  There are a number of places where we can improve movement but the corridor already has a reasonably high level of bus priority at the moment.  The Deputy could have picked another route and it would be a different story.<br\/><br\/>We intend to have segregated cycling everywhere possible.  We cannot commit to getting it in everywhere because such a plan would prove too ambitious.  It would mean we would have to knock down properties in one or two places and, therefore, we have not given such a commitment.  We will end up with segregated cycling facilities on the vast bulk of the route, which is good for both cyclists and the bus system.  It means that bus drivers do not have to interact with cyclists and <i>vice versa<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>We have not applied growth projections to this project but we will in due course.

Let us say a zoned area has a density of 50 houses per hectare.  We will have got that information from the local authority and built it into our model, including the projections.  If the situation changes then we revise and update our plan.  We also conduct sensitivity scenarios and ask ourselves what if the density is higher or lower.  Our plan predominantly stems from the zoned areas that local authorities create in their development plans.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked why we did not go further with bus corridors.  One will see in the proposed redesign of the bus service, that will be announced next month, that the services start to divide when one travels further out of the city and, therefore, bus frequency starts to drop.  We would love to do more but we need to start somewhere.  We started with what we view as key routes.  There is no problem bolting on something afterwards, if it makes sense. <\/p> <p>  I think the Deputy referred to the ease of movement between orbital and radial routes, and asked what could be done to address the matter.  Such routes will be part of the services plan that will be announced in a few weeks time.  The plan will include a lot more orbital routes.  The Deputy was right when she said that there must be a seamless transfer from one route to another thus making the routes attractive.  If that movement is not simple and easy then it will not be an attractive transfer.  The network redesign will provide the timetable information that the Deputy asked about.  The information will not say that a bus will come along at 4.02 p.m. or whatever but it will say that we expect to put a service on this route and a bus will come along ever ten minutes in the midday and every five minutes in the peak hours.  That information will be provided and people will be able to make a judgment.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether there are downsides to the single bore tunnel versus a twin bore tunnel.  There are a number of downsides and upsides for both options.  Like most things in life, there is no perfect answer.  There is one school of thought that says two tunnel tubes is a better idea in the event of an emergency because they allow passengers to move from one tunnel tube to the other tunnel tube through cross passages.  However, that requires narrow walkways to be included alongside the edges of the tunnel, which creates issues such as how do wheelchairs use the narrow walkways.  The other school of thought is that one tunnel tube is better because one has all of the space of the second track available to offload passengers and thus allow them to move much more easily up and down the track.  Most international experience is beginning to move towards the single bore tunnel.  Certainly, the design team that is involved with us now has a lot of experience in building a single bore tunnel, addressing all of the safety issues and ending up with a really safe project.  There are pluses and minuses. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1316,"content":"<p>I will pick up on some of the other questions posed by Deputy Murphy.  She asked, given that the bus is the workhorse of public transport, why buses do not get the same level of priority in the city centre compared with the Luas cross-city service.  In the lead up to the launch of the Luas cross-city service we conducted some very careful planning with both Dublin Bus and the local authorities.  We tried to ensure that all of the different modes of transport could operate through the city centre.  We published traffic management plans around the city centre.  A lot of improvements were made, particularly on the north quays, to improve the movement of buses through the city centre.  When we were in operational mode, we had hoped that the College Green proposal would be in place at that stage, which would have changed the movements of buses around the area.<\/p><p>When it transpired that that would not be an option, we had to make a decision to remove some of the bus services at peak times in order to keep general traffic moving through that area.  The bus can respond very quickly in terms of changing priority but we consider all services in the round and try to improve priority for bus and light rail at the same time.<\/p><p> The livery for the Go-Ahead services has been designed and those buses will come into operation later in the autumn.  We wish to provide a single livery across the Dublin services but we are still working with Dublin Bus on the livery and how it might be presented in terms of the services it operates.  We want it to be under a TFI bus livery such that customers are not confused about this State-provided bus service in Dublin.<\/p><p> The Chairman asked about staffing.

Some routes were amended, such as the No. 15 which I use.  It was redirected from College Green in advance of Luas cross city to facilitate that project.  However, it was not restored to its original route and the closest stop to the Oireachtas, for example, for a person travelling on the bus from Knocklyon or Templeogue is College Green or the Bleeding Horse on Camden Street.  I will come back to that because it needs to be separately addressed.<\/p> <p>  I could not be more enthusiastic in my welcome for BusConnects.  I know it is a clich&eacute; but it will involve the breaking of a number of eggs, which will be painful.  The NTA was correct to be upfront on compensation such that people at least know of it.  The timeline is very ambitious.  The city needs this project and I am a very strong advocate for it but it will hurt some people.  I wish to ask some questions relating to my constituency.  BusConnects is the way forward for the city and it is democratic.  If one had a Luas for everybody in the audience, life would be great but the problem is that when Luas lines are constructed everybody between the lines, such as those living in my constituency which is between the green and red lines, suffers because they do not have the service and are ambitious to get it.  There are associated issues such as an increase in property values.  That is not a democratic way to do things.  BusConnects will not cause the same increase in property prices as would rail-based public transport but it will have some effect.  It is essential to have an A to B seamless, segregated and guaranteed route.  I am the biggest supporter of the NTA in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Some of my questions have been answered so I will be quite quick.  One of the big advantages of Dublin Bus is its reach into housing estates in various parts of Dublin, as other members stated.  Will that suffer?  It is an essential part of the service which must be maintained but that can only be done if the fleet is increased.  Ms Graham is aware from the most recent Dublin Bus strike that there is significant loyalty to and sympathy for Dublin Bus in the city and that people are very understanding when drivers take industrial action and there is very little adverse public reaction to that.  Will some areas be left without buses?  Will buses be pulled out of estates?  That is the lifeblood of many people, particularly older people and those in disadvantaged areas.  Dublin Bus currently carries approximately 140 million passengers on the existing network. What will happen to that network?  I ask Ms Graham to help us with the narrative in that regard because the proposed bus corridors are separate to it but connected.  Dublin Bus has approximately 1,000 buses.  If BusConnects were in place tomorrow, how many buses does Ms Graham think would be needed to maintain the existing network as it connects to the corridors and to keep it running on a pretty efficient basis?  If the NTA got everything it wants and BusConnects was ready to launch tomorrow, how many buses would it require in tandem with the existing network?  <\/p> <p>  This is where we will differ.  Ms Graham stated that it does not matter who is operating the service.  Does the NTA propose tendering the 16 bus corridors separately?  Similar to the manner in which those who can afford to do so buy homes near the DART or Luas lines, some people have made home or work choices based on existing bus routes.  Has that been taken into account in this project?  I acknowledge that the NTA is not at the detailed design stage but it will have to sell to the public the interchanges at which several buses will arrive into a depot and a person such as Deputy O'Dowd may get off one bus and connect with another.  We need images of those interchanges and their geography and an explanation of how they will work because one of the drawbacks of the existing system is that people do not know how to connect.  One of the advantages of the Dublin Bus system is that it has many single journey route options that work very well.<\/p><p>How does the NTA work around that?  We need more orbital routes.  What data does the NTA have to suggest that people do not want city-bound routes, which Dublin Bus predominantly provides?  I do not expect detailed answers but we will need them because the NTA will get these questions at a public consultation.  In my constituency, the bulk of the Templeogue to Tallaght BusConnects corridor is in place, along the N81 to Templeogue Bridge.  There will be a little work to segregate it but there is ample land, which is public land and will not be an issue.  Why is the NTA not starting it from further up the N81, for example, at the Jobstown turn at the beginning of the dual carriageway?  That would be a relatively inexpensive addition to it.  There is a hard shoulder and there is public land available.  There may be little bits and pieces to be done to segregate it and a proper cycle track.  If it is being done between the M50 and Templeogue, what is the difficulty here? <\/p><p> If this is to be seamless, it looks like Templeogue village is a pinch point.  What are the NTA's plans for property owners who may need to be contacted there?  If the NTA is to fulfil its ambitions, several property owners will have to be contacted along the stretch from the Templeogue-Templeville Road junction to Terenure village.  Can the witnesses comment on that?  Garden acquisitions will be required on Rathfarnham Road between Rathfarnham village and the Rathfarnham crossroads at the Dodder River.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#L00500","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1323,"content":"<p>There is another group waiting to come in.

Ballycullen is one of the fastest growing areas in my constituency.  There are BusConnects corridors proposed for Tallaght to Terenure and for Rathfarnham to Terenure with a huge road width available because there is a park.  There is a quality bus corridor, QBC, on Firhouse Road that could very easily connect to the proposed Tallaght to Terenure corridor via the Spawell Bridge.  The cost would be minimal and the guts of the infrastructure are there but it is important for connectivity.<\/p> <p>  There is a QBC on the Ballycullen Road which connects to the Firhouse Road.  It is underutilised as a bus route serving an area that is starved of a bus service.  I wrote to the NTA and my hand was smacked.  I was told it was considering BusConnects and not to dare come near it with these proposals until it was done.  I thought that was a good sign and that it would be included in BusConnects.  This would connect two of the corridors.  There are QBCs on Firhouse Road, which is fully segregated, and on Ballycullen Road, which is almost fully segregated.  They connect at a T-junction.  If they were joined, I guarantee that local people would oversubscribe the bus service on offer.  The 15 does not serve them.  Dublin Bus has been attempting to sweat the 15B to facilitate them.  They need a dedicated service.  I will write to the NTA again about this but if I was an engineer, I would say these are two very easy gains.  Similarly, there is a bus corridor on Ballyboden Road.  That area south of Knocklyon is developing.  There are 3,000 or 4,000 housing units going up there and the residents will have nothing. <\/p> <p>  I am not a member of this committee; I am a casual interloper.

Schools and residents did not have an opportunity to appear before the committee although those on the northside had.  If an offer is made that impacts on one part of the city, all parts of the city should have an opportunity to appear before the committee.  The MetroLink is like a Berlin wall running through certain areas of the southside.<\/p><p>According to <i>The<\/i><i>Irish Times<\/i>, the Merrion flyover is being shelved.  I am waiting for a letter from Ms Graham outlining the factual position.  The residents of houses which were to lose their gardens or to have flyovers beside them are no longer in a position to sell their houses or move on because there is no clarity on what is happening to their front gardens. <\/p><p>Ms Graham gave an indicative figure of 1,300 front gardens and parking spaces that would be lost in the bus corridor.  More than 3,000 people feel they may be impacted by it.  Auctioneers have been advising people whose homes were for sale that they have to inform interested parties that the front garden may be affected.  Time is critical.  There is an indicative line on the map for a bus corridor on Pigeon House Road which would take away 90 car parking spaces with no alternative.  The owners of three or four one-bedroom cottages on that road who want to move to family homes and to have children cannot sell until there is some clarity.  This is having an impact on families.  I question how this is happening and its impact on many people.  <\/p><p>What will the impact of the single bore tunnel be on the southside if the NTA decides to go ahead with that?<\/p><p>Will that allow the single bore tunnel to go further south underground instead of emerging on Charlemont Street, which would have a significant impact?  Given the injustice that has been done to the communities on the southside and the lack of engagement by the NTA and this committee, because they have not received equal treatment, would the NTA meet representatives of the residents' groups on the southside to have a discussion during this period?  We asked for an extension, which was refused.  I can understand that but one of the reasons it was refused was that there was an undertaking to this committee that it would not extend the consultation period.  That was disappointing because those residents and schools did not have that opportunity.  This involves schools, residents and the demolition of homes.<\/p><p> I am a firm supporter of public transport, cycling and pedestrians, and have been since I got involved in politics.  However, this must be done correctly and inclusively.  Each part of the city must be treated in the same manner, but that is not happening.  On many occasions people have received their information from the \"Morning Ireland\" programme, which is disappointing.  In fairness, the NTA wrote to the garden holders in the case of the Merrion flyover at an earlier stage before there was a public announcement.  However, the manner in which it has done this up to now has caused great confusion.  With regard to the bus corridor and the metro, community groups have a great feeling of injustice due to the lack of consultation and engagement.  They do not believe they have been treated in an equal manner with the northside.  They attribute that to the statements made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, at an early stage in the consultation.  The public representatives on the southside have been quiet on this.<\/p><p> I ask the NTA to try to rebuild trust and engagement by meeting the community representatives on the southside so there can be proper engagement and equity of treatment, which has not been the case up to now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#M01600","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1339,"content":"<p>I wish to be helpful to everybody.

Given my background and the routine engagement I have with disabled people, what has been said does not come across as respectful and thoughtful in any sense, nor is it in keeping with Government policy.  I would have thought that the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would understand the ins and outs of money coming from a Department, not coming from a Department or not enough of it coming from one Department to another for a public scheme.<\/p> <p>  I will leave that aside.  I have half a dozen questions for the witnesses.  I am not expecting responses so I will rattle through them.  What engagement has the NTA had with local authorities across the 16 core bus corridors to establish how many disabled parking spaces and the like would be impacted?  Can the NTA explain the benefit of more than &euro;14 million in expenditure for rebranding the Dublin Bus fleet?<\/p><p>This matter has been raised by other members.  Has there been engagement with disability groups?  A change of branding by marketers might be exciting, but the elderly and some people with disabilities or medical conditions can get used to a style of branding and then be confused or put off if it is changed significantly.  I have in mind people with intellectual disabilities, dementia or other neurological conditions who know the sign for a certain type of bus, for example.  There needs to be thoughtfulness in respect of this matter.  When Translink makes changes to its fleet, for example, it invites members of the mobility impaired and wheelchair community to go to see mock-ups of those changes.  It is important that we not reach the point of the bus being unveiled before we find out that there is a blip.  People should know what compromises are being made before a conclusion is reached.<\/p><p> What discussions has the NTA had with the disability stakeholders about its new routes?  Will the BusConnects budgetary requirement impact on the budget or resources Bus &Eacute;ireann needs to ensure that its fleet is accessible and that disabled people can travel?

I am not a member of this committee, but I wanted to make fairly important points, some of which have been addressed by my constituency colleague.<\/p> <p>  Although I was not going to comment on the matter just mentioned by the Chairman, I am of the view that the committee should make its opinions heard in the strongest possible way.  I am old enough, and have been a bus user long enough, to remember the lunacy of when there were restrictions on the pass.  I sat on buses where ten or 15 minutes in circumstances were wasted by drivers having arguments with people who said they had been waiting at the stop since before the cut-off time.  In an era of discussions on high-speed connections and improving the service, the farce that is someone suggesting something that we had the good sense to get rid of over 20 years ago is beyond comprehension.<\/p> <p>  I will raise my core point with the witnesses.  Unlike my constituency colleague, Deputy Lahart, I do not welcome elements of the NTA's proposal on BusConnects.  While I welcome the strategy of improving our bus services and the idea behind it, given that an improvement is vital, I wish to discuss the manner in which the NTA has chosen to implement it.  I appreciate that every organisation has to make decisions about how it will do something, but I base my decisions on what I believe is at the heart of representative politics, that is, representing everyone in our communities regardless of whether he or she voted for us.<\/p> <p>  I draw the witnesses' attention to something that is inherently lacking.  Transport forms part of a city of communities.  It is not something that takes place in the abstract.  Nor does it involve the movement of many people from one part of a city to another, as desirable as that is.  Rather, it is about moving people through communities and neighbourhoods where there are families, sporting organisations and community groups.  While theoretical planning is welcome and has to be done, and the NTA will now be moving to a consultation process, there was a lack of real involvement before an undetailed announcement about something that would impact on the daily lives of hundreds or thousands of people was made.<\/p> <p>  I will take the witnesses through what I mean by that, particularly as regards the Templeogue proposal.  Developing that bus route will involve the closure of a road to inbound traffic and the diversion of traffic onto two other roads.  One of those is Cypress Grove Road.  It is a small point, but emblematic of how the NTA approached this matter, that it could not even get the name of the other road right.  It has actually proposed that the traffic be moved onto Springfield Road, which is a cul-de-sac in a quiet residential area.  That may be a typo, but I do not know how many hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands of euro have been spent on this document.  It was published without being proofread, a level of sloppiness that has caused excessive worry to residents who will not be directly impacted.  That is not worthy of an agency like the NTA.<\/p> <p>  I will not discuss the benefit of the QBC because everyone recognises that it will have benefits.  In its considerations, what weighting has the NTA given to people living in the area through which it intends to divert traffic?  It is proposing bringing roads to a standstill.  For example, hundreds of families living on or close to Cypress Grove Road will not be able to get onto it in the morning.  Given that someone in the authority will have examined the matter in some detail, the NTA will be well aware that these roads are already congested and have queue times in excess of 20 minutes between one junction and the next at peak times.  Despite that, the NTA will still move a volume of traffic onto it.  I appreciate that the long-term goal is for car drivers - \"God love them, they are stupid\" - to stop driving after the NTA has made it impossible for them to drive into the city, but that will not happen immediately.  As such, there will be an impact.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider the NTA's track record.  It said one thing about the interconnector around College Green but, when that did not work, it had to divert the bus routes to free up the complete gridlock.  I am worried about the impact of the plan on communities if the NTA does not get this right in the theoretical and planning phases before it goes live.<\/p> <p>  Many of the questions that have already been asked of the witnesses I would ask as well.  What will be the NTA's communication process with the communities?  I am not just referring to those along the routes, but also in the surrounding areas.  How does it intend to engage and how quickly will it do so?  Why did the NTA decide not to indicate clearly from the first moment what lands and gardens would be subject to compulsory purchase orders, CPOs?  I am sure it must have had an idea.  While it engages in a consultation process, whole roads and areas are being put into limbo for people who are trying to move, sell their houses and so on.  I cannot believe that there is not a plan sitting somewhere in the NTA's offices outlining whether the houses on, for example, the left-hand side of a road would be affected as opposed to those on the right-hand side.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about Templeogue village.  It is almost a complete logjam.  The witnesses can reply to me and Deputy Lahart in writing.  How does the NTA plan to address the route through that area?<\/p><p>How does what is proposed sit with the fact that South Dublin County Council has a redevelopment plan for the village?.  The left hand does not seem to know what the right is doing.<\/p><p> The question of other QBCs has been raised.  Before massive plans such as this - however necessary they may be - are put in place, a massive increase in the number of buses using existing, under-utilised QBCs would be much more welcome.  That is at the heart of what I wish to say.  If people had an opportunity to get on a bus, we would have a real indication in my constituency as to the level of bus usage.  There is a logjam on the N11 - the Stillorgan dual carriageway - at Donnybrook.  Everyone who travels the route by bus knows that.  People get on the bus because there is a proper service that runs in a QBC most of the way.  That shaves a lot off one's travel time when one compares it with a journey by car and people accept the fact that there will be logjams.  People in my constituency, those in Ballycullen and Firhouse, do not have that option.<\/p><p> I will make a final point which explains a lot of the cynicism people have about consultation.  I went through this as a councillor with Dublin Bus.  I appreciate that the witnesses are not here to represent that company.  Those who do represent Dublin Bus came, saw and said they would talk.  What they did ultimately was implement a structure that suited an element of the transport community.  It suited people who wanted to travel from an outer area to work in the morning as fast as possible.  That worries me because the witnesses seem to be thinking the same way.  Who was left behind?

It helps safety on our roads in two ways, first, by keeping dangerous drivers off our roads and, second, it has a deterrent effect of possible disqualification which reduces the risk of drivers engaging in bad behaviour.  In that regard the proper administration and enforcement of driver disqualification is critical to safety on our roads.  The disqualification of drivers and the enforcement of the various provisions is a shared responsibility of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  For the information of members it might be helpful initially to describe the process that leads to a driver being disqualified.  Essentially, there are two routes to disqualification, one is by accumulating seven penalty points in the case of a learner or novice or 12 penalty points within a three-year period in the case of a person who holds a full driving licence.  The second is by way of a court disqualification on being convicted of an offence for which the penalty involves disqualification from driving.  There is also a lesser known process known as a special disqualification order where a court order is sought to disqualify a driver, usually on the basis of not being medically fit to drive.  This occurs infrequently, with only a handful of such cases being taken each year.<\/p> <p>  Once the disqualification is confirmed, the information is updated on the national vehicle driver file, NVDF, which contains the driver record and is operated by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The updating of the driver record is initiated in the following circumstances: following notification from the Courts Service to the RSA via the national driver licence service, NDLS, where the disqualification results from the court disqualification; following notification by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Department's driver and vehicle computer services division, DVCSD, in Shannon, of the payment of a fixed charge notice for certain drink driving offences or where the accumulation of penalty points reaches the threshold for disqualification; following notification by the Courts Service of a conviction for a penalty points offence to the DVCSD where the accumulation of penalty points reaches the threshold for disqualification.  In each instance, the driver is written to by either the Courts Service or the RSA and informed that the licence must be surrendered to the NDLS within 14 days of the disqualification taking effect.  When the licence is surrendered the NDLS updates the driver record to reflect the licence has been received.  If it is not received, no amendment is made.<\/p> <p>  Recent media reports suggest that the number of licences surrendered is at a low level and this is borne out by the available statistics.  The table provided sets out the statistics and these indicate a very poor level of compliance.  We can see for the year 2017 that just one in six of those disqualified surrendered their licence.  It is a legal requirement for drivers who are disqualified, whether by the courts or by exceeding the penalty point limits, to return their licences to the licensing authority, the Road Safety Authority.  It is an offence not to return a licence following disqualification.  The penalty for non-return of a licence on disqualification is a fine up to a maximum of &euro;1,000 for a first offence, and up to &euro;2,000 for a second or subsequent offence. <\/p> <p>  As members can see from the table, only a relatively small minority comply with this requirement.  In 2017, some 9,449 drivers were disqualified by the courts, but only 1,289 surrendered their licences.  There are no doubt a myriad of reasons for this, including the fact that in some cases the driver does not hold a licence in the first place.  However, the level of compliance is entirely unacceptable and demonstrates a disregard and disrespect by those individuals for road traffic legislation.  Clearly, there has not been a strong culture of surrendering a licence in this country.<\/p> <p>  I contrast this with the position in Northern Ireland.  I know from engaging with the Driver and Vehicle Agency also know as the DVA, that it is the norm to surrender a licence in Northern Ireland.  No doubt this is attributable to the strong security presence during the Troubles when vehicles were frequently stopped and documents demanded which created a culture of compliance.  Compliance with this element of road traffic legislation in our nearby jurisdiction is also mirrored in the other areas of road safety as we know such as zero tolerance of a learner driver in Northern Ireland driving unaccompanied.<\/p><p>While the legislation in both jurisdictions is relatively similar, attitudes and behaviour are very different.  It should be noted that the mechanism for surrendering a licence appears to be less cumbersome in that it is surrendered to the court prior to the court hearing and certainly on conviction.  It is then transmitted to the licensing authority.<\/p><p> In this jurisdiction, the licence is not retained in court.  Rather, the driver is asked to post it to the licensing authority.  The rationale for this approach is that there is a period allowed for the driver to appeal a conviction.  In the North, they hold on to the licence while the appeal takes place.  There is no legal provision in this jurisdiction to provide for the courts to retain the licence.<\/p><p> At the same time, it is important to bear in mind that the matter of greater concern is whether people are driving while disqualified.  Non-return of licences cannot be taken as a proxy measurement for those driving while disqualified.  A person who has retained his or her licence may not be driving, while a person who has returned the licence, even to keep his or her head below the parapet, may continue to drive.  The penalty for driving while disqualified is a fine up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 and-or a prison term of up to six months.  The low surrender rates naturally begs the question as to whether those who are disqualified continue to drive while disqualified.  We know for sure that some do because we have data that show 84 convictions for driving while disqualified in 2017.  Naturally, as CEO of the Road Safety Authority, this is a very serious concern for me and is another challenge in keeping our roads safe.<\/p><p> This brings us to the question of enforcement of the licence surrender process and the general disqualification rules.  This is primarily a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but requires a significant input from the RSA and the Department of Transport Tourism and Sport.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has access to the driver record and is able to see whether a driver is disqualified and whether the licence has been surrendered in a particular case.  However, this information is not easily accessible at the roadside during enforcement activities.  As the Garda does not currently have the technology such as mobile devices to access the database files in real time, this inhibits effective detection of offenders.<\/p><p> To prosecute a driver successfully for failure to surrender a licence having been disqualified, the RSA would most likely have to have a representative in court alongside the Garda to give evidence on behalf of the RSA on the failure to surrender the licence.  The RSA would need significant resources to do that.  The Garda would also need significant resources to prosecute the thousands of cases of failure to surrender licences.<\/p><p> I understand the Garda has many priorities but one of my main responsibilities is to make the case for the appropriate resources, be they personnel or technology, to be allocated to road safety matters in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I have been on record in recent times to express the dissatisfaction of the RSA that the Garda roads policing unit has not been staffed or prioritised to the levels committed to.  I continue to raise this directly with the Garda at the highest level and I have also expressed my concern to the Policing Authority about this matter.  Clearly, if the roads policing unit is not at core strength, the ability of the unit to enforce the law is diminished and drivers who should not be on our roads may come to believe there is little chance of their being detected.  The visible presence of garda&iacute; with smartphone look-up capability on our roads is the measure that will do most to reduce death and injury on our roads.  It would also be the best use of the limited resources available to ensure targeted effective and smarter enforcement.<\/p><p> As regards the specific issue of how we improve the compliance levels so that more disqualified drivers surrender their licences, I think all the stakeholders should look at a number of measures which I will now set out.  The principal purpose of licence surrender is to prevent drivers from continuing to drive while disqualified.  Members will be aware that the RSA has explored the possibility of publishing lists of disqualified drivers.  The purpose of this initiative would be to bring public pressure to bear on disqualified drivers to ensure they would not drive and be a danger on our roads as well as deterring them from committing the offences in the first instance that leads to disqualification.  While there are legal and data protection impediments to proceeding with publishing such a list, we believe that the spirit of the proposal continues to have significant merit and we have more work to do to satisfy data protection requirements and to meet general data protection regulation, GDPR, requirements.<\/p><p> As part of this, we are exploring the possibility of creating an information portal where employers who have employees driving for work would, with appropriate privacy protections, be able to access their employees&rsquo; driver records.  This would be a progressive step, especially in keeping professional drivers of buses and trucks who are disqualified off our roads.  We are aware that they have been guilty of this offence.<\/p><p> It is clear that the greatest impact can be made by enhancing enforcement capabilities of the Garda to detect disqualified drivers who drive while disqualified more so than pursuing and prosecuting those who do not surrender their licences.  The RSA is aware the Garda has been developing an initiative that will see a specific focus on disqualified drivers including the need to surrender the licence.  I understand that the Garda is about to roll out this initiative which will allow it to extract the specific information on driver disqualification from the driver record and distribute it directly to Garda divisions so that the information is known to local garda&iacute; without having to access the driver record.  This should help target offenders and give more focused information on the ground and enable enforcement to take place in a proactive fashion.<\/p><p> I am satisfied that the legislation is adequate for both the offences being discussed here today, that is, the non-surrender of licences when disqualified from driving and driving while disqualified, along with the penalties prescribed therein, and that the necessary powers have been given to the Garda to deal with the issue effectively.  The necessary funding and resourcing must also be in place, however, to enforce and change attitudes and behaviour.<\/p><p> The RSA acknowledges and fully supports the Garda modernisation and renewal programme commitment to maximise the potential of technology.  In practice, this means that a garda will have access to all systems needed to undertake his or her duties on his or her person.  It also commits to the expansion of systems such as the automated number plate recognition, ANPR, system and the creation of watch lists.  There is no reason such lists should not include the vehicles owned by disqualified drivers.  In our regular interactions with the senior Garda roads policing management, the RSA has affirmed a commitment to support in whatever way it can An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the development and roll-out of smart mobile technologies.<\/p><p> I acknowledge that there is an issue as regards the surrender of licences, the statistics do not lie.  If all stakeholders work together, however, we can make progress in resolving the issue.<\/p><p> I will touch briefly on broader road safety matters.  Last year was the safest year on record and we are making progress.  I am afraid the position today is that we have an increased level of fatalities as against the same period in 2017.  Seventy-six people have died on our roads, an increase of five on the same period last year.  I appeal to all road users, as we enter the holiday period, to be extra vigilant.  There are greater levels of traffic on our roads at this time of year, with people driving on roads in areas with which they are not familiar.  Each one of us can take simple steps that will make our roads safer.  Almost all collisions are preventable.  It is up to each individual to change behaviour.  We will reverse the current spike and trend in the past month and will reduce the number of fatalities on our roads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moyagh Murdock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1386,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Murdock for her submission.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to improving road safety and reducing the number of deaths on the roads in line with the Government's road safety strategy for the period 2013 to 2020.  It works hard with all stakeholders to achieve this target.  Last year was the safest on record on the roads.  A total of 157 people lost their lives on the roads compared with 186 in 2016.  However, that is 157 deaths too many.<\/p> <p>  The 2017 road safety performance index of the European Transport Safety Council, ETSC, shows that Ireland has improved its position and moved from fifth to fourth in the EU member state rankings for road safety.  It had the fourth largest decline in the number of road deaths among the EU 28 between 2016 and 2017.  However, the figures this year so far have been disappointing, with an increased number of fatalities compared to the same period last year.  I presume Ms Murdock submitted her document yesterday.  I can confirm that, as of today, as many as 76 people have died on the roads, an increase of four on the figure on the same day last year.<\/p> <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na views the enforcement of road traffic legislation and the subsequent disqualification of drivers as important aspects in improving road safety.  Section 38 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended by section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 2006, created the offence of driving without a driving licence and, on summary conviction, imposed a fine not exceeding &euro;1,000 and, in any other case, a fine not exceeding &euro;2,000.  Section 38(5) of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended by section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 2006, provided for an increased penalty for a person summarily convicted of the offence of driving without a driving licence and who, at the time he or she committed the offence, was disqualified from holding a driving licence.  He or she is liable to pay a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or be imprisoned for a term not exceeding six months or both. <\/p> <p>  Additional powers were provided for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, allowing the arrest of persons who drove while disqualified, under section 6(b) and (c) of the Road Traffic Act 2014 which took effect on 22 June 2015.  In terms of the latter offence, advice was received from the Director of Public Prosecutions that there was no separate offence of driving while disqualified.  Section 38 creates an offence of driving without a licence.  Section 38(5) provides for a more severe penalty for driving without a licence during the period of disqualification.  However, the offence remains one of simply driving without a licence.<\/p> <p>  Section 40(2) of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended by section 59 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, created an offence for the driver of a mechanically propelled vehicle who, following a demand from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, failed or refused to produce for inspection a driving licence.  If the driving licence is not in the possession of the driver at the time of the initial demand, a further demand is made to produce his or her licence at a Garda station of his or her choosing within ten days.  If this demand is made on foot of a fixed charge notice, a record of it is noted in the fixed charged processing system, FCPS, application which is managed by the Garda Information Services Centre, GISC.  Procedures are in place to ensure all demands are followed up.  When documents are not produced within the allotted period, appropriate offences are raised and summonses issued. <\/p> <p>  When a demand is made that is unrelated to a fixed charge notice, a record of it is only created on the police using leading systems effectively, PULSE, system when documents are produced.  The member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will check the PULSE system for a record of production.  Where no such record of production is found, the member issues proceedings against the person concerned.<\/p> <p>  In the years 2011 to 2017 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initiated the following prosecutions of drivers who had driven without a licence.  The numbers of prosecutions are as follows:  28,405 in 2011; 25,117 in 2012; 21,606 in 2013; 20,801 in 2014; 20,004 in 2015; 20,966 in 2016; and 23,309 in 2017.  Each year close to 10,000 drivers are subject to disqualification, either as a result of a prosecution taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or an accumulation of penalty points for offences detected.  On average, there are 20,000 disqualified drivers at any one time.<\/p> <p>  Prior to receiving advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions, the numbers of prosecutions for driving while disqualified were as follows: 1,660 in 2011; 1,793 in 2012; 1,879 in 2013; 1,879 in 2014 - I suspect that figure is a misprint - and 1,561 in 2015.  A change was made in 2016, which has resulted in only three prosecutions.  Unfortunately, I cannot produce the figure for 2017 because the system was changed.<\/p> <p>  To pick up on what Ms Murdock said, the numbers of fatal collisions between 2014 and 2017 which involved a disqualified driver or a driver who had no licence were as follows.  In 2014 there were 179 collisions, five of which involved a disqualified driver and 18 a person without a licence.  In 2015 there were 155 collisions, of which three involved a disqualified driver and nine ia person driving without a licence.  In 2016 there were 175 collisions, of which six involved a disqualified driver and 11 a person without a licence.  In 2017 there were 144 collisions, of which two involved a disqualified driver and six a person driving without a licence.<\/p> <p>  Under the provisions of road traffic legislation, there are a number of disqualification orders, of which the committee should be mindful.  First, there is a consequential disqualification order which results from the provisions of section 26 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended.  A person is convicted of an offence specified in the legislation which mainly revolves around dangerous or drink driving.  In this instance, the court shall make an order declaring the person to be disqualified from holding a driving licence.  A consequential disqualification order operates to disqualify the person to whom the order relates from holding any driving licence whatsoever during a specified period.  As a general rule, a consequential disqualification order comes into operation 15 days after it is made.  I will go into more detail shortly.   <\/p> <p>  Second, there is an ancillary disqualification order which comes into force when a person is convicted of an offence under the Road Traffic Act 1961 or otherwise while driving a mechanically propelled vehicle or any other vehicle, other than an offence in relation to which a consequential disqualification order applies.  In other words, if somebody is involved in a crime and one wants to link it with the car.<\/p><p>In these cases an ancillary disqualification order shall disqualify the convicted person either from holding any driving licence whatsoever or a driving licence in respect of a class or classes of mechanically propelled vehicles during a specified period.  An ancillary disqualification order generally comes into operation on the 15th day after it is made.  I will come back to this point.<\/p><p> Special disqualification orders are catered for under section 28 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended.  If an officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or an appropriate licensing authority has reasonable grounds for believing a person who is the holder of a driving licence is, by reason of a disease or a physical or mental disability, unable to drive any mechanically propelled vehicle or any class or classes of mechanically propelled vehicles covered by the licence, such officer or licensing authority may apply to a justice of the District Court for an order declaring such a person to be disqualified from holding a driving licence until he or she produces to the licensing authority a certificate of fitness.  The same system applies to people we believe to be incompetent.  I do not intend to read the section of our presentation dealing with this matter.  In these case special disqualification orders come into operation immediately.  The court, in making such an order, may direct the suspension of its operation pending an appeal.<\/p><p> Consequential or ancillary disqualification orders come into operation on the 15th day after they are made, as provided for in section 30 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended.  However, a court may postpone the operation of such an order for a period of up to six months if it is satisfied that a special reason which it shall specify when postponing the operation of the order related to personal circumstances, including the nature of employment, has been proved by the convicted person in a particular case.  If a consequential or ancillary disqualification order or, where the order is related to a conviction, that conviction is the subject of an appeal, notice of which is lodged within 14 days of the making of the order, and the convicted person has duly entered into a recognisance to prosecute the appeal, the operation shall stand suspended pending the appeal.<\/p><p> The effect of these provisions is that a licence holder, in respect of whom a consequential or ancillary disqualification order is made, may continue to drive any class or classes of mechanically propelled vehicles covered by such licence for 14 days after the order has been made and beyond where an appeal notice, as set out, has been lodged, or where the court has postponed the operation of such an order for a special reason related to the personal circumstances of the licence holder which has been proved.  Special disqualification orders come into operation immediately when they are made.  If an appeal is brought against a special disqualification order, the court making the order may direct the suspension of its operation pending the appeal and, as a consequence, the person may continue to drive any class or classes of mechanically propelled vehicles covered by such licence.  A person who is the subject of a consequential, ancillary or special disqualification order shall, within five days of the coming into operation of the order, deliver his or her licence, if any, to the officer of the court which made the order and that officer shall send it to the licensing authority.  This is covered by Part 9 of SI 537 of 2006 which is also known as the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 2006.<\/p><p> The final aspect of this matter with which I want to deal is disqualification by reason of penalty points.  Penalty points are recorded against a driving licence by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on notification of payment of a fixed charge notice.  Approximately 73% of all fixed charge notices are paid.  Penalty points are also recorded when a conviction is handed down in court in respect of a penalty points offence.  If a fine is paid by the offender, the licence information is provided at the point of payment.  The licence document must be produced and cross-checked against the offender's details.  Notification of the payment and licence number is passed to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport which assigns the appropriate number of penalty points to the specified licence.  If a fixed charge notice is not paid, the case proceeds to court.  The summons document issued by the Courts Service contains an instruction to the offender to bring his or her driving licence to court.  If the person is found guilty in court, the details of the conviction, including the driving licence details, are passed directly to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport by the Courts Service.  If a member of the public fails to produce his or her licence in court and the Courts Service is unable to provide licence details for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, it is necessary for the court to provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a certified copy of a court order in relation to the offence and notification certifying that the driving licence was not produced to the court in order for a prosecution for non-production to be taken.  If penalty points are endorsed on the licensing record of a person and, in consequence, the total number of penalty points standing so endorsed equals or exceeds 12, or equals or exceeds seven in the case of a person who, at the time the points are endorsed, is a learner or novice driver, the person shall stand disqualified for a period of six months, beginning on the appropriate date for holding a licence.  In such circumstances, the licence held by the person in question at the beginning of the period shall stand suspended accordingly.  This disqualification by reason of penalty points is covered by section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 2002, as amended.<\/p><p> The notification by the RSA to the person concerned of the endorsement of penalty points and that person's subsequent disqualification also directs the person to surrender his or her driving licence to the RSA not later than 14 days from the appropriate date.  This is governed by section 5 of the Road Traffic Act 2002, as amended.  While it is a criminal offence not to surrender one's driving licence, if disqualified, the proof required to sustain a prosecution is not insignificant.  Evidence to sustain a prosecution would inevitably include evidence that the person held a valid driving licence at the time, was disqualified, aware of the disqualification and the requirement to surrender the licence and had failed to surrender it.  This would, undoubtedly, require the involvement of Garda personnel in each prosecution, as well as evidence from RSA personnel and, possibly, Courts Service personnel.<\/p><p> Each week An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receives a file containing driving licence information from the driver and vehicle computer services division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport which is known as the DVCSD and based in Shannon.  Garda personnel can use the Garda PULSE system to search by driving licence number, or by name and date of birth, to retrieve certain information from the DVCSD file, including an indication that a driver is disqualified.  While this facility is very beneficial, the search of the PULSE system must be requested over the Garda radio network by a Garda member on the ground back to the communications room.  Depending on the priorities of the communications room at the time, it can take some time to execute this request and provide a result for the Garda member.  As a consequence, such searches are not carried out as often as would be desirable.  In addition, the DVCSD, on behalf of the RSA, notifies An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na via the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau if a driver who has been disqualified as a consequence of the accumulation of penalty points has failed to surrender his or her driving licence to the RSA.  Copies of these notifications are transmitted to local divisions when Garda personnel are seeking to retrieve driving licences.  In addition, appropriate information on the disqualification is recorded on the PULSE system.<\/p><p> The practice of submitting a driving licence file after a driver has been disqualified or given penalty points originates from the existence of the old paper-based licence.  As the licence was paper-based, the practice was to have the licence physically endorsed with a stamp on it stating the person had been before the courts and some endorsement or disqualification had been imposed on the holder of the licence.  This was good practice at the time because the system was entirely paper-based and garda&iacute; had limited means of inquiry regarding the licence.  For the purposes of the meeting, I am showing the committee my own licence to show members what we are talking about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#U01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Sheahan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1402,"content":"<p>Mr. Sheahan is showing a bad example; he should have the new one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#V00200","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1403,"content":"<p>Hold on one second.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Sheahan"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1404,"content":"<p>The ten years must not yet be up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#V00400","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1405,"content":"<p>Yes.  With the introduction of penalty points, the practice of physically endorsing the physical licence ceased and the penalty points were placed on the driver's record rather than the actual licence.  The submission of the licence was an administrative function which assisted in the identification of the correct record on which the penalty points were to be recorded.<\/p><p>For the benefit of my friend, I point out that, in more recent times, the small ID card driving licence was introduced and this obviously has no capacity to have either a disqualification or penalty points recorded on the actual licence.  It is simply used to identify the driver, the class of vehicle the driver is licensed to drive and the correct record on which to record the penalty.<\/p><p> What is crucially important is that the imposition of a disqualification or the recording of penalty points is not reliant on the person submitting the licence.  Regardless of whether the licence is submitted, the penalty is recorded, which is the important piece of the process.  The real vulnerability and concern in this system is that the licenceholder can present his or her licence to a garda or any other person, perhaps an employer, who, if not educated in the matter, may think that the licence presented is both a clean and valid licence.  The option of chasing after people and demanding that they forfeit their driving licence and the pursuit of a prosecution may be a futile exercise.  The serious offence is not the non-surrender of the licence but, instead, the driving while disqualified or the fraudulent declaration regarding the status of the licence.  The solution to this lies, first, with an understanding that the licence is a means of identifying the driver and the driver record and, second, that a garda has access to the record behind the licence.  In the case of a garda, this access has to be immediate.<\/p><p> As can be seen in the submission, this is a complex issue and compliance levels, with drivers producing their driving licence on demand or surrendering their licence following endorsement, fall far short of expected levels of compliance.  As a short-term measure, the Garda IT section is developing a report that will allow Garda personnel on the ground to search for disqualified drivers in a particular geographical area.  This will assist local Garda personnel in monitoring disqualified drivers to ensure they are not driving while disqualified.<\/p><p> Much of the narrative around the surrender of driving licences by disqualified drivers appears to indicate a common perception that by surrendering a driving licence following disqualification, the disqualified person will not drive.  Unfortunately, what happens in practice is somewhat different.  The surrender of a driving licence is not a reliable indicator that a disqualified driver will not drive, nor is the failure to surrender a driving licence a reliable indicator that a disqualified driver will drive.  From a road safety perspective, a greater deterrent is required.  There is a provision in the First Schedule to the Road Traffic Act 2002, at reference No. 6, which is an enabling provision for the Minister of Transport, Tourism and Sport for declaring the non-production of a driving licence on demand as a penalty point offence.  My belief is that this would bring about a change in culture in terms of peoples&rsquo; attitude to possession of a driving licence and the significance and importance of having a driving licence.<\/p><p> The most effective deterrent to driving while disqualified is that Garda personnel can, by means of a user-friendly mobile device at the side of the road, check if a person is disqualified or not.  Modern mobile digital data devices, when applied to policing, afford a wide range of opportunities to a police service to improve the service they deliver to the public and increased visibility.  With a mobile device, a member can connect to Garda systems to read and capture policing data and, effectively, become a mobile police station.<\/p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently conducting a pilot in Limerick to uncover the most appropriate means of informing and guiding future investment in the latest mobile technology solutions for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the six months of the pilot, the users of the new Garda traffic app have noticed that detection of offences, such as non-payment of motor tax, driver penalty point disqualifications and stolen property, have improved as a direct result of having access to the app with instant details from PULSE.  The member can now check on the side of the road without contacting or returning to the station and can increase visibility by remaining on the roadside.  There is also a tangible change in the attitude of the public when they see that the member now has a smart mobile data device, ranging from more respect to quicker admission of guilt than may have been expected previously.<\/p><p> By providing the member with access to real-time information at the scene, use of the current driving licence insurance production, DLIP, process could be greatly reduced.  Making available current driving licence, road tax, NCT and insurance information would make roadside checks and issuing of fixed charge notices more efficient.  This would enable a member to make informed decisions and detect deliberate attempts to evade prosecution by providing false or misleading information.  It was for this reason that a forward-focused solution was sought, rather than getting tangled in the historical problem that existed.  Of course, this will require investment but it is an investment in our core strategy of saving lives on our roads.  If members of the committee wish to see the app, I have it with me and I can show them how it works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#V00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Sheahan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1407,"content":"<p>Can Assistant Commissioner Sheahan demonstrate it now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#W00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1529497800,"counter":1408,"content":"<p>I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Sheahan"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1409,"content":"<p>Thank you.

Therefore, the minute I stop the person and put in his driving licence number, the app tells me whether he is disqualified - for example, a red bar will come up on the screen if there is a penalty point disqualification.  In another example, the app will tell me there is a penalty point disqualification and a non-surrendered licence, and can give me those two pieces of data instantly at the side of the road.  In such a case, I do not have to look beyond that and I can arrest the person for the offence.<\/p> <p>  The next example shows information from a recent check in Limerick.

County Meath probably has the lowest ratio of garda&iacute; to population and Kildare has the second lowest ratio.  These counties have considerably worse ratios than the national average, with one garda for every 650 people whereas the average is one garda for approximately 450 people.  Even when handheld devices are used, it is a reactive type of policing because there are insufficient personnel to provide cover.

I thank them for their comprehensive and informative contributions.  What we are being told today beggars belief.  We are blaming current issues on legislation going through the D&aacute;il and filibustering.  However, according to what we have heard, perhaps the Minister is not doing his job.  Ms Murdock said, his departmental officials have been so busy with a one-line amendment for the past year and a half that he cannot go about his job of bundling existing road traffic legislation, which is poor as we saw in a television documentary.  We heard judges, garda&iacute; and others speak on that programme about disqualified drivers being back in court and out driving without proper action being taken.  Deputy Munster put down a parliamentary question not long ago asking what the Minister had done about the bundling.  We have been led to believe he put out a tender to law firms to sort out the legislation.  Is the Minister focused on his job?  The current legislation is a knee-jerk reaction because there was a spike in road fatalities in 2016 which was not necessarily caused by careless or dangerous driving.  I was recently at a conference on road safety abroad where it was acknowledged that there has been a phenomenal uptick in traffic on the roads in this country.  Those roads were left without proper maintenance over the past five or six years due to the unavailability of capital funding for local authorities.<\/p><p>What we have heard today is astounding.  Referring to other road safety legislation when a particular incident arose, Mr. Conor Faughnan noted that one of our reactions as legislators is to enact further legislation instead of enforcing the existing law.  As we have seen today, the existing legislation is not being tidied up properly.  The assistant commissioner referred to two types of disqualification under sections 1(<i>a<\/i>) and (<i>b<\/i>) and the confusion that causes where people are off the road.  It is astounding that the issue of people failing to hand in their licences has not been corrected.  This did not arise yesterday or today.  The RSA and the Garda have statistics to indicate it has been a major problem for five years.  Why has nothing been done to correct that blatant flaw in the legislation?<\/p><p>Reference was made to the fact that a person may have the right of appeal, but perhaps the judge allowed the prosecutor to hold on to the licence until the appeal is determined.  If the person was stopped on the road without his or her licence, the garda&iacute; can double check if it is held by the courts.  I am amazed that after what we have heard today regarding that the focus is on the existing Road Traffic Act being properly bundled and tidied up, and the lame excuse that a one line amendment has held up the whole show for the past year and a half<font color=\"#FF4040\">.<\/font><br\/><br\/>Perhaps some of my colleagues have been over enthusiastic in their deliberations in the D&aacute;il, but they have had only a couple of hours with the document.  We have had to read up on the dossier in high-speed time overall, but the Minister and his Department have been deliberating on it for a year and a half.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the fitness of the Garda, a previous Garda commissioner has said in a different forum that perhaps the reason there are so few prosecutions is because of the presence of garda&iacute;.  This is a phenomenon; people not being prosecuted when the law is broken.  If one was to follow this argument then if the garda&iacute; did not drive around a town during a festival occasion, when there tends to be more skirmishes, there would be no prosecutions.  Not having a Garda presence can mean more fights.  What is the difference there? Just because there are no prosecutions it does not mean the Garda are not doing their job.  We have to acknowledge this.<br\/><br\/>There will probably be a parliamentary question tabled by the end of this year regarding the more than two million breathalyser kits that have been used and how many tested positive.  The figures might be low.  Deputies could ask if the kits were working properly at all because such a phenomenal number of breathalyser kits had been used.  I commend the garda&iacute;, however, and they are doing their job.  They have been subject to criticism and at other times they get flak during spates of robberies in rural Ireland and so on. <br\/><br\/>I expect the RSA advertising campaigns to go on, but we have yet to see a campaign that tells people they cannot drive without a licence or when they have been put off the road.  It is a case of do not drink and drive, but there has been no advertisements similar to those relating to the TV licence - if one does not have a TV licence then one cannot have a television.  The focus on this issue has been lost through the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#BB01400","speaker":"1278","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1540,"content":"<p>In fairness, the Minister is not here at the moment-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#CC00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1541,"content":"<p>He should be here-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#CC00300","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1542,"content":"<p>Whatever comments Deputy O'Keeffe has in respect of the Minister can be made when we invite him in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#CC00400","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1543,"content":"<p>He should be here-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#CC00500","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1544,"content":"<p>We will ask him in as soon as possible and the comments can be addressed to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#CC00600","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1545,"content":"<p>I am trying to get across to the committee-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#CC00700","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1546,"content":"<p>The witnesses administer the law that we pass.

When it comes to road safety, the other major issue is young drivers.  Prior to the last meeting, there was a major road tragedy in Donegal, which involved a 14 year old.  I saw a report by a road safety official who said that the only way to stop road tragedies among young drivers in Donegal is to have a night-time curfew.  They are trying to wash their hands of the problem.  We know there are people who are mad about their cars in Donegal, and it can be a problem, but we do not see much mention of that.

I am astounded that we think changing the current legislation is going to sort out all these problems; it will not.  These problems should all have been sorted out by now.  It has been up to the Minister's Department and the Department of Justice and Equality to have sorted this out before now.  Those Departments need to come together, be up-front and acknowledge that if existing laws were properly enforced and regulated, judges would not have to deliberate between prosecutors and solicitors over technicalities.

This legislation was introduced to tackle the issue of young drivers so it is not beyond possibility.  We will monitor that measure.

Obviously when we go about producing legislation we need to have facts and figures in front of us.  Do we not?  The Minister, Deputy Ross, came into this committee as early as February 2017 and he had made comments even before that.  In 2016, he gave us a written statement which stated he thought the current legislation on driving with a blood alcohol level between 50 mg and 80 mg was being abused and not functioning properly or playing its part.  We went through committee and got no proper clarification.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na says it can produce figures and statistics.  Deputy Troy has just proved it can be selective about when it can produce its statistics.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had 12 months since I asked my previous question.  I tabled a question to the Department of Justice and Equality on 15 May asking for figures on repeat offenders, that is, how many people who were caught innocently over the limit with a blood alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg were caught again.  I asked this because the Minister, Deputy Ross, came in here more than 12 months ago and told us the law was being flouted and not being respected or recognised.  He told us that there were people being repeatedly caught while innocently over the limit.  We are told that these figures are not available.  What facts is the Minister working off?  We are talking about crashes involving people who have been drinking.  From what I can see, if there was a crash out on the road and if there was a bag of empty bottles 4 yd. or 5 yd. away from the vehicle, it would be logged as a crash related to drink-driving.  That is way the RSA compiles its figures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018062000002#DD01900","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1529497800,"counter":1577,"content":"<p>I do not think anybody would agree with that.

That needs to change.
