The second is policy, and our concern that this proposal represents a wasteful approach to transport infrastructure investment.  The third is politics, which is about the public consultation on the project, which we feel has been inadequate to date.  I will deal briefly with each concern in turn and, following that, my colleagues will address queries or questions from members.<\/p> <p>  The negative impact of the emerging segregated overground MetroLink solution has not been adequately considered in the process to date.  Converting the current green Luas line to a segregated high-speed overground MetroLink southwards from Charlemont has significant adverse social, environmental and commercial consequences for the adjacent neighbourhoods.  Because of its speed, frequency and inaccessibility, segregated high-speed overground rail, necessarily creates a clear physical partition within communities.  Notwithstanding its most recent response to our local politicians, the NTA has asserted that complete segregation of the line will be necessary as a design principle for the MetroLink.  That will directly impact on local communities at not one but five separate locations, namely, Dunville Avenue, Cowper Drive, a smaller crossing at Albany Road, and two crossings in the Milltown and Alexandra College area.<\/p> <p>  As a result of the proposed MetroLink solution, traffic volumes on the remaining key Charleston Avenue link route between Rathmines and Ranelagh will increase hugely with significant knock-on effects.  As pedestrian crossing of the upgraded line will not be permitted at any point, the proposed availability of a lift solution, in addition to overpasses, at crossing points as the only way of crossing is problematic.  At peak times, in particular during school term, the volume of cyclists crossing the current Luas line could not in any practical way be facilitated by lifts.  The displaced cyclists will have no choice but to reroute to busy alternatives compared to the quiet streets around the existing surface crossings.  We are talking about safety and the threat to life, not about inconvenience.  Our area has had a cycling fatality in 2018 so it is a huge concern to us.<\/p> <p>  Equally, the implications of the proposed segregated rail solution for families with young children and persons with limited mobility are of particular concern.  The existing Luas system facilitates those people well because it primarily operates at street level.  The segregated solution will require lifts at all stations and experience to date with the Luas illustrates the constant technical problems with lifts and also the fact that they become a hub for antisocial activity.<\/p> <p>  The segregated line will partition both the Beechwood Catholic and Sandford Anglican parishes, which has implications for their parishioners and also place an additional burden on social services including, for example, the local meals on wheels distribution.<\/p> <p>  The construction of the MetroLink will have a significant impact not only on our local community but also on today's existing users of the green line.  Given that it is proposed to shut down the green line while constructing the metro, it is concerning that the economic, environmental and social impacts have not been considered and clearly communicated.  How are the 50,000 commuters who currently move in and out of the city every day going to get to work for that nine-month period?  In addition, the management, logistical and health and safety aspects of hundreds of schoolchildren who currently cross the Luas line each day have not been adequately considered.<\/p> <p>  I will turn briefly from our community concerns to the subject of transport policy.  We do not accept that there is a convincing case in favour of the emerging preferred route for MetroLink, especially on the southside of the city.  The value of concentrating unprecedented amounts of transport capital investment in an area that is currently well served with a relatively recently completed light rail system is unproven and questionable.  Under the current proposals, there are large geographical areas in south Dublin where major public transport deficiencies will remain unsolved in the long term.<\/p> <p>  Serious questions arise about the waste of public money in dismantling the existing Luas line, which has only recently been expensively constructed, as well as the waste and environmental irresponsibility associated with destruction of recently constructed public transport infrastructure.  We have yet to see a detailed cost-benefit analysis of the impact of the closure of the line during the upgrade.  It is possibly the case that the economic and social cost to the city could amount to a multiple of the cost of the upgrade.  In addition, from a risk perspective it is not evident that any professional risk assessment has been carried out, as demonstrated by the fact that the current proposal for capital investment in transport on the southside of the city is concentrated on one line, which also means that all of the flows of people are concentrated on one line.  Accordingly, there is a single point of failure, which in business is considered to be a high-risk approach.<\/p> <p>  We believe that the current consultation process is inadequate.  The community is concerned about the absence of real, interactive engagement and the absence of any commitment on the part of the NTA or Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to meet local communities to directly address their concerns.  We have been appreciative of the rapid and enthusiastic engagement of all our local politicians who have moved quickly to listen to our concerns.  However, the implications of the proposed major investment requires a much more interactive and intensive consultation.<\/p> <p>  Since we submitted our documents for this meeting, the most recent proposal from the NTA and TII has been made available to us.  Sadly, the latest partial proposal focuses exclusively on only one of the many issues we have highlighted, namely, the Dunville Avenue crossing.<\/p><p> The emerging MetroLink proposal has been compared to the imposition of a Berlin Wall on the southern part of the city.  The latest proposal from MetroLink is akin to the opening of a Checkpoint Charlie on that wall.  Even when Checkpoint Charlie was opened in Berlin, the wall remained intact and the community remained divided.<\/p><p> Members of the Rethink MetroLink group thank members of the committee for the opportunity to meet them today.

We do not necessarily agree on all topics but we are working together to try to find solutions for the area.<\/p><p>Mr. Nash referred to the consultation process, which ended in May.  Do the representatives of Rethink MetroLink have a view on the transparency of this process?  Do they believe those who openly engaged with the process, in particularly at the event in the Hilton Hotel in Charlemont, were appropriately notified of the impact the emerging preferred route would have on the area, including, as mentioned by Mr. Nash, the potential closure of the Luas green line?  At our meeting last week, we were told that closure could be for six months, but I do not see how that could be the timeframe.  I ask for the witnesses' views on that.<\/p><p>Do the representatives of Rethink MetroLink have a view on alternative routes?

I thank him for facilitating this meeting.  I thank the witnesses for their submission.  It is apparent from what they say that they believe there will be very negative consequences for parts of the Dublin Bay South constituency if the proposal proceeds as planned.  I ask them to elaborate on that.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses also clearly believe that we need greater investment in public transport - particularly rail transport - throughout the city.  In the part of Dublin where we are, we are very lucky to have the Luas system operating.  Are the witnesses concerned about changing the character of that rail system to a heavy industrialised rail link as opposed to what we currently have, namely, a safe light-rail link that complements the residential nature of not only the communities they represent but also all communities?<\/p> <p>  My next issue relates to policy and it comes back to what the Chairman stated earlier.  This is not just about a micro local issue.  The rail transport map of Dublin shows that the eastern part of the city is very well served by the DART link from Howth to Bray and by the Luas green line.  Do the witnesses believe that, on a policy basis, the western and south-western parts of the city need to be further developed and accommodated with rail and Luas links?<\/p> <p>  The next matter might also be one for the committee.  From recent research it is apparent that a socioeconomic divide is developing in Dublin along east-west lines.  That is something that has occurred over the past 20 or 30 years.  Part of it relates to the fact that the eastern part of the city has been extremely well served by public transport, much to the disadvantage of the western part of the city.  If we want to ensure that western parts of the city have more home ownership and increased socioeconomic advantage, we should accommodate those parts of the city with better public rail links.  I would be interested to hear what the witnesses have to say on that.<\/p> <p>  People living in this area and along the Luas line went through a period when heavy works were being done on the green line, as did people on the red line.  The two lines cost approximately &euro;770 million to build and we are now proposing to dig up the green line.  What is the witnesses' view as to why this is being done?  Do they agree that the primary reason the NTA is attracted to this line for MetroLink is that it is land that is owned already?<\/p> <p>  Are the witnesses concerned that the Luas system, which is highly successful, is to be replaced by a more industrial-type heavy-rail system?  What impact do they think it will have on local communities?<\/p><p>Do they agree that when we are talking about rail development and public transport in the city, our first priority should be getting a fast rail link to the airport, whether underground, preferably, or otherwise?  That is the primary objective.  Do they also agree that if we are going to develop public rail links throughout the city, we should concentrate on promoting and extending the Luas red and green lines, which have been extremely successful?<\/p><p> On the local issues raised by the witnesses, the project is going to have a detrimental impact on their communities.  This will not be like some rural rail line where a train will come every hour or hour and a half.  It is going to effect a significant and permanent divide within the two communities.  I would like the witnesses to elaborate on the practical impact that will have.  I am probably close to the five minutes at this stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#E00900","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>The Deputy has five seconds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#F00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I hope the committee will agree with my recommendation that, at the conclusion of this hearing, a report making policy recommendations on the extension of the Luas and the inappropriateness of MetroLink, notwithstanding the non-statutory role being played, be produced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#F00300","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Callaghan.

Do they have any proposals to counteract that and, if so, can we hear them?  Information in that regard would be helpful to put to the representatives from the NTA when they come before us.  The lack of consultation and engagement by the NTA is not surprising but it is still disappointing, as is its lack of enthusiasm to meet with communities and hear their points of view.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses should remember that the NTA, like the HSE, was set up to implement Government policy and to take the heat off of the Government.  It has worked a treat.  When an issue is flagged now with the health service, it is the HSE that is automatically attacked as opposed to the Government.  The HSE only implements policy.  That is its task and remit.  On that note, I suggest the witnesses should meet with various Government Ministers next to raise their concerns.  The NTA is coming in next.  We cannot force it to do anything.  Given the lack of consultation, however, would it be helpful if we requested that NTA examine the feasibility, specifically for this project, of setting up a liaison officer for the communities?  Various community groups would then have direct access to that officer and he or she would be responsible for dealing with the groups, relating and responding to them, etc.  Perhaps the witnesses will let us know if that is something which might be helpful because when the public consultation is over, it is usually just shut down and that is it.

We all expected metro north to feature as part of the national development plan but I was surprised when MetroLink was announced, particularly in view of the profile of the public transport already available in the area.  Ranelagh and Rathmines are vibrant areas with a high density in occupancy rates where people can easily cycle into town, etc.  It surprised me that an already good Luas line would be upgraded so quickly.<\/p> <p>  On the information the witnesses feel they need, the consultation process was mentioned.  Is it information that the witnesses require?  I accept some of the points in respect of policy.  In the context of what is proposed, however, what information is not coming forward from the NTA?  The word \"consultation\" tends to be used very loosely and also to be in one direction with proposals outlined.  Real engagement, though, means consultation is two ways.  People are asked what they think to begin with, prior to the announcement.  The need for consultation is also met afterwards, including how cyclists and people with disabilities are going to be handled, what lifts are going to be installed and so on.  Will the witnesses outline what was deficient in the information required?<\/p> <p>  They might also outline their practical experience of how they were notified about this and the follow up.  I cannot lose an opportunity to say that the solution to Dublin's transport crisis is the DART underground.  We keep postponing that and thinking that we are going to add bits and pieces on and not bring it all together.  I cannot for the life of me understand why that did not end up being the highest of priorities.  It would have been disruptive but as disruptive as this.  I will leave it at that.  The main purpose of this meeting is to hear from the witnesses about their engagement and discover what questions we might pose if we take this matter up with the NTA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#F01000","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending.

I will take up Deputy Catherine Murphy's point regarding the DART underground.  It was suggested that the latter would run across the Dublin Bay South constituency.  I was a great supporter of the proposal because it would have connected all our public transport needs in the city.  It was objected to by a large number of residents.  I am putting the matter in context.  I do not support the current proposal but I did support another proposal that affected another community because it was balanced and the right idea for the city.<\/p> <p>  Public consultation is important because nobody expected the southside MetroLink proposal that has emerged.  Will the witnesses tell us about their experience of the public consultation, how they were informed and how they were engaged with?  The other matter not touched on is that relating to driverless trains and that brings us back to remarks in respect of the Berlin Wall.  I refer to the fact that nobody will be in the engine at the front of the train and there being somebody on the line.  The experience in Berlin was that large infrastructure had to be built on either side of the track to prevent people getting on.  That has not been touched on at all.  Do the witnesses have any views on driverless trains and the level of infrastructure - fencing, railings, walls or whatever - that would have to be built, from a health and safety perspective, in order to prevent people getting onto the tracks and the impact it would have on their communities?<\/p> <p>  I reiterate that looking at transport needs on the southside, starting on the coastal road, there is the DART line and then the Luas green line.  Moving further inland towards Harold's Cross, Terenure and Firhouse, there is no line.  That is a dense area of the city with high demand but there are no Luas or DART lines.<\/p><p>What is the view of the witnesses on the feasibility of putting a line in place in that area?<\/p><p> One matter that has not been highlighted is the financial impact on the city's southside.  We can talk about the impact on residents and the community but closing the line for nine months will put 75,000 commuters back onto the roads.  How will the Beacon Centre and Sandyford Industrial Estate manage to carry out their business?  What will the impact be on the greater Dublin area?  The alternative is to run it out through Rathmines, Terenure, Firhouse and the suburbs where there is a great need for public transport.  Since this was announced and there was a public consultation involving 8,000 people, there has been a roll-out of information but no reopening of the public consultation.  We started out with a dual-bore tunnel which is now a single tube, and with stations on the northside that now appear to have disappeared.  There seems to have been no further public consultation on whether there is to be an underpass or a flyover at Dunville Avenue.  It would be interesting to know if residents were given the drawings for the underpass or overpass by the NTA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#F01200","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Deputies and Senators would not be here unless their communities had very serious concerns about this and they have the full backing of the Members of Parliament in respect of their concerns.

I will deal with the community impact as this is something I see personally as someone who lives in the area.  On the southside, the proposal is for an overground line and for an underground metro on the northside.  It will be a high-speed driverless train which will be travelling approximately every 90 seconds, straight through what is a lovely village community.  It will be irreversibly detrimental to our community.<\/p> <p>  I have lived in Milltown and Rathmines for most of my life and I watched the Luas line being built.  I travelled here on the Luas today and I see how it has enhanced our community.  It revitalised it because it is accessible and really well integrated into the community.  I have spent the past few months at home with my new baby and his buggy and I have used the opportunity to look around my local neighbourhood to observe how it works.  It is a largely pedestrian community and people get to the shops or to school by foot or by bicycle.<\/p> <p>  I will deal with some of the issues raised by Deputy O'Connell.  The project affects the Luas from Charlemont down to Sandyford but I will concentrate on my community.  There are five pedestrian crossings in our small section of Luas line, two of which take cars, at Alex and Dunville.  Two of the crossings are not even mentioned in the metro submission, the one at Albany and the one at the back gate of Mount St. Annes.  The community is a community of older people and young families and the area is well suited to those groups because it is relatively flat and has a lovely accessible transport system with flat crossings, as well as a nice array of local shops and businesses.  At the Cowper stop, there is an old people's home which has a preschool in it so it suits both older people and young children.  The children leave their schools every day on their buggies and their scooters and cross the Luas line, unimpeded.  This has created a lovely village feel to the whole area and if one was planning an urban development this is what we would want to create but we are about to destroy it.<\/p> <p>  My next door neighbour is in his 80s.  He had a very bad stroke last year and now walks with a walking frame but he can cross the Luas line.  There are three preschools, five junior schools and three secondary schools in the area, all of them within spitting distance of our three Luas stops.  There are almost 6,000 pupils going to those schools, many of them travelling on foot or by bicycle.  There are 650 units in Mount St. Annes and they all use the back gate to get to town, on foot or by bicycle, or to go to Ranelagh, Rathmines, Rathgar and Terenure, and the same is true of the back gate at Alex.  If we replaced our flat pedestrian crossings with footbridges or lifts, this would deter people from walking or cycling.  If a journey is made a bit longer, there is evidence that it stops people from walking or cycling, meaning that they use their cars instead.  What is proposed will turn a pedestrian area into one in which more cars are used.<\/p> <p>  Anyone who uses the lifts on the Luas knows that, generally, they are not fit for purpose.  They are frequently broken and I have been stranded in Dundrum with my buggy and a woman in a wheelchair.  I got lucky because somebody helped me down the steps but nobody could help the lady in the wheelchair down the steps.  I do not go to Dundrum on the Luas any more.<\/p> <p>  It is well known that underpasses and lifts do not create safe spaces.  Last week, one of my neighbours in Ranelagh met two people shooting up in the lift there.  We were all really concerned about a young child who was with its parent at the Charlemont Luas stop a couple of years ago and who was stuck by a needle when grabbing the handrail in the lift at that stop and who then had to go through the psychological trauma of HIV and hepatitis testing.  Footbridges and lifts are not a good addition to small village communities.<\/p> <p>  We feel that this will sever our community and will adversely affect our schools, churches, shops and businesses.  It will force people into cars and will create a giant wall with a lot of noise that will lead to urban blight, where currently there is a lovely village atmosphere across a number of different areas, along with an integrated and accessible transport system. We are very upset about it and we cannot understand how the NTA could choose this option when we already have functioning transport and when there are vast swathes of the southern part of city that do not.  Buses are not going to solve the problem either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jennifer Gilmore"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Does anybody wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#G00400","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531911600,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I will address some of the points that arise from the issues surrounding consultation and, in order to be expeditious, will make straightforward points.<\/p> <p>  We fundamentally assert that the consultation process has been flawed.  I recognise what Deputy Imelda Munster has been saying about the experience.  There is a difficulty in that when consultation is not on a statutory basis, when it is almost as a courtesy and there are no rules, it can turn out to be a smokescreen.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy asked if we would share our experiences of the consultation process.  It arrived in our world sometime around April when the NTA went public on its plans.  In short order there was a very short form of consultation available to us locally on the Charlemont stop at the Hilton Hotel.  There were also occurrences on the north side, but, in effect, what it amounted to was a presentation on the boards of their its document.  There were no answers to questions.  If I asked a question about traffic flows, the data for Dunville Avenue or how they would impact on the tightly geared village of Ranelagh, I was simply told that it did not have that data.  In very short order we were invited, with everybody else, to make a submission by 11 May.  We met that date, having come together quickly as a community, but we have heard nothing back.  We are entitled to rely on the NTA's document which states: \"Following a full appraisal of the feedback, a public consultation report will be published by the end of 2018\".  Therefore, we think there will be serious concern that 8,000 submissions have been made and we have not heard anything about it.  <\/p> <p>  It is not as if the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, are digesting the submissions alone, but it is rolling on in the manner of a headlong driverless train because at this committee on 20 June the deputy chief executive made a statement in reply to Deputy Robert Troy - I have the transcript - that it would publish a new upgrade proposal by June.  At this point we are in consultations, but now it is jumping ahead towards a new publication date.  As it happens, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, made a statement in the Seanad in which he referred again only to the notion of a digested or composite report coming out towards the end of the year.  Nevertheless, the NTA is pushing on.  On 9 July, in a letter to Senator Kevin Humphreys, its deputy chief executive stated baldly there would be no bore - the underground system - beyond Charlemont station into Ranelagh and all of the rest.  How can he make statements such as this if we are still engaged in consultation?<\/p> <p>  The other side of consultation is communication and access in some form.  On 11 May, when we made our submission, we requested a follow-on meeting with the NTA.  We had a number of our representatives request that the NTA meet us.  The Minister made a statement in the Seanad in which he said he felt it would be inappropriate for him to meet us but that he would convey our request for a meeting to the NTA, but we have heard nothing from anybody.  The question was asked as to whether we had heard anything back about the new floated proposal which had been presented to Oireachtas Members.  The simple answer is \"No\".  We have heard nothing; it has been in the ether, but we have nothing with which we can deal.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Imelda Munster's suggestion of a liaison officer with authority, who would access and could give us some data is useful because the further point we would make is that a number of members have asked whether there could be an alternative route through Firhouse or elsewhere.  In a way we find that surprising because as far as we see it, there is only one game in town and that is the preferred route that has been published.  We have no data with which to engage for any other possibility.  For example, if we consider what Senator Kevin Humphreys said about the Firhouse route as an alternative, &euro;800 million has been spent on the Luas green line.  According to the NTA's stated position, the reason it must have a high speed, driverless MetroLink to Sandyford is it must service the growing demand, with a link to Cherrywood.  Here are some simple facts.  As a concept, the development at Cherrywood is wonderful, but what is proposed, as per the description, is that within a decade there will be 30,000 people living there.  There are actually 30,000 sons and daughters going to University College Dublin, UCD, to a campus of equal size.  If the other direction was looked at to deal with the issues of people living in Terenure, Rathfarnham and Firhouse, the facts are that there are 46,000 people living in Lucan, as opposed to the 30,000 who will live in Cherrywood.  According to the 2016 census, the Tallagh catchment area has a population of 287,000, the equivalent of the population of Galway, Waterford and Limerick put together, who survive on the equivalent of the green line, namely, the red line.  There is no sustainable argument that Sandyford cannot be serviced by the green line.  If there is new, fresh capital to spare, we argue that there should be a move to provide services to Terenure, Rathfarnham, Firhouse and Tallaght, where I worked for 30 years, to provide a new benefit.  That is what people call a win\/win.  <\/p> <p>  The point Ms Gilmore is making is that there are two kinds of people.  There are people who are resident adjacent to the current Luas line and somewhat aware of the proposal.  They are increasingly becoming aware of it, but they do not all know because their communities are coming to life.  There are others who use the Luas every single day and have built their life plans around it and they do not know at all.  Let us take young people living in Charlemont or Ranelagh who say they want to buy a starter home.  As they have a job with Facebook in Sandyford, they will take the Luas to get there.  They do not need to buy a car, which is good for them and the city.  They do not have an idea that they will lose this system on which they have built their life plans for nine or 12 months or however long it will be.  We cannot say how long it will be because we have not been told.  It is a major hit.  Coming to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's suggestion of collecting ideas and making a strong recommendation - we would welcome the committee doing so - if we, as citizens, want to change our front gardens to put a car in the driveway, we have to post a notice to let people know.  In order to reach out to all of these people to let them know, why should the NTA not have to have a graphic at every Luas stop along the way detailing the current plan and explaining in three points or so what it plans on doing, indicating which crossings will be closed and for how long the Luas will not be available?  Citizens are entitled to know this information, rather than waking up one morning and asking where is the Luas.  In terms of consultation, the different parties involved truly deserve to have the information.  It is not available and we cannot access the NTA.  Therefore, we would appreciate any effort the committee could make on our behalf to tell the NTA that it has to respond to these questions.<\/p> <p>  On the August date, we assert that it is highly inappropriate.  The Oireachtas is in recess.  Many people have to take their break at this time.<\/p><p>To say they will come back and drop something on the table at the end of August when we are working to a schedule whereby, as they told us in their document, it would come towards the back end of 2018 is entirely premature.  Part of the committee's recommendations should be that proper consideration should be given, the report should be given to us, and that this should happen in the autumn rather than in August.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":107,"content":"<p>There are some very important points there about due process, clear process and everybody being on a level playing pitch as to knowledge, which is very important.

If the witnesses have answered it, they do not need to come back to me on it.  I was looking for local knowledge on this issue of accessibility and about urban and community design.  I am 100% in favour of the metro and I recognise that we have to increase public transport capacity on the south side as well as on the north side.  We can do that best by running the metro line to Harold's Cross, Rathgar, Terenure, Rathfarnham and on to Firhouse and Tallaght.  The driverless, automated, segregated system is an entire design concept from start to finish.  The route I suggest means we do not have the difficulty we are having with this route where we are trying to integrate that driverless, segregated system onto an existing driver-accessible, low-floor, relatively low speed system.  That is a real difficulty.<\/p> <p>  I grew up and have lived most of my life in the area and I know it down to the minutiae of what it means to have that crossing at Albany Road that no one would ever think about because it is only small number of people crossing.  A person living on Moyne Road and who normally goes to Beechwood church for mass might not go to that mass and go to Rathmines instead.  It would change the whole character just by losing this crossing.   Mount Saint Annes is not featuring in any consideration but it is a loss.  It is not just our constituency.  It is as much an issue for Windy Arbour, Dundrum and Sandyford.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the witnesses have mentioned it in previous examples, but if not, will they give some flavour as to what the local accessibility means, because it is an intangible thing.  It does not appear in any balance sheet or any cost-benefit analysis.  People might not even be going to mass.  They might be going to St. Philip's.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#J00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>The Deputy felt the eyes on his back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#J00400","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>The loss will only be known when it is gone.

Mr. Murphy in particular made some points and I have done some research, so I want to focus on some points that might be more parochial.  There are a number of fundamental points I want to make which play into the argument.  One is about communication and consultation.  We have BusConnects, for example, the public consultation for which is also running through the summer.  We have extracted, fairly easily, an extension to that from the NTA.  Public consultation through the summer months seems to be a favourite of State and semi-State bodies, whether by accident or design, and I cannot help but be suspicious that it is by design to catch or wrong-foot people.<\/p> <p>  Another point, assuming this has not already been made, is that it is regrettable that the NTA does not meet the group directly.  I assure the witnesses that every one of their public representatives, all of whom I know well across parties, is ensuring that every point they make is being communicated to the NTA.<\/p> <p>  A further point is that this is ultimately a political decision.  Politics changed the route of metro north, the interconnector and so forth, and I believe it will be politics that will change this decision.  Given that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport weighs in on several other portfolios, I invite other Ministers to weigh in on his portfolio because that is the only way something tangible and change will happen in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#J00700","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":113,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is one of the few Deputies who requested that this meeting would take place.

I would expect nothing less.  Another fundamental point, which I have made before and I will make to the NTA, is that investment in public transport must be democratic.  In my constituency, the Luas red line serves Tallaght and there is a massive gap between that and the Luas green line.  The demographics relating to Cherrywood, which Mr. Murphy pointed out, are very accurate.  I know the Tallaght area and its catchment intimately.  The purpose and design of Cherrywood is that people can work and live there and do not have to travel distances to get there.<\/p><p>The democratic nature of investment in public transport is not evident in this.  The Luas green line is barely 15 years old and the Government wants to double down with further investment of &euro;500 million to upgrade it while there are suburbs such as Firhouse, Knocklyon and Ballycullen, which are burgeoning areas, along with Rathfarnham and Templeogue.  There are a number of concepts which I know the Green Party representatives have spoken about, and although they do not exclusive rights to them, we are <i>ad idem<\/i>on one of them.  There is a possibility of connecting the green and red lines for the same kind of money.  There are a number of routes by which the green and red lines could be connected, for example, along by Marlay Park out to Old Bawn and Tallaght, or from Churchtown via Templeogue village, Greenhills and St. Peter's Road out to Ballymount and the Luas red line at the Red Cow.  This would provide a circular Luas line connected with a metro line to form a T shape.<\/p><p>My view, which I believe is shared by some of my colleagues, although I do not speak for them, is that the NTA ought to proceed with the metro north element of this and get going on it pretty quickly because everyone is in agreement with it, but it needs to go back to the drawing board on this other piece.  That certainly would be our strong view, but it is politics that will make the decision on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#J00900","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Kinsella to wrap up on behalf of his group.

We believe fundamentally that this is the wrong route.  Any alternative route that is chosen, two of which we have discussed, has the following advantages.  First, it will avoid the destruction of the very successful and only very recently upgraded Luas green line.  Second, it will allow us to create a network of rail links which will serve Dublin and its commuting community far better.  Third, it will avoid the commuter chaos which will be precipitated by the closure of the Luas green line to allow the construction works to go ahead.<\/p><p>Fourth, it will avoid the negative business impact that will affect all the businesses along the Luas green line from Sandyford, through Dundrum shopping centre and into the city centre due to the difficulty both staff and customers will have getting to those businesses during the closure of that line.  Fifth, it will avoid the issue of a single point of failure.  It will allow some flexibility within the system if there is an issue on a line as there will be some ability to allow displaced commuters to move to another line and still get to where they want to go.  For all those reasons we believe an alternative route is a far better decision and a better way to invest taxpayers' valuable money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#J01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Kinsella","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kinsella.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#K00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for facilitating this meeting.

I am joined today by my colleague, Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy chief executive officer, and will be joined shortly by Mr. Tim Gaston, director of public transport services.  I understand that the committee wishes to focus in this meeting upon the Dublin area bus network redesign proposals, which is part of the overall BusConnects Dublin programme.  Last month we published our network redesign proposals which we believe will deliver a better bus system for the people of Dublin, for the city itself and for the region.  Our proposed new network will be simpler to understand and use, will offer greater connectivity to more people and will provide for a substantial overall increase in bus services.<\/p> <p>  The existing bus system in the Dublin area has evolved on a route-by-route basis over many years and, indeed, many decades.  We have reached the point where a complete and total review of the bus system is needed to position it to meet the growing transport needs of the Dublin region.  To undertake this review, we engaged Jarrett Walker &amp;amp; Associates from Portland, Oregon in the United States of America to assist us.  Jarrett Walker &amp;amp; Associates specialise in the redesign of public transport systems in urban areas and have worked in cities around the world, replacing traditional bus networks with revised networks that work better for more people.  It is important to note that the objective of our review was to redesign the bus system to make it more useful to more people and to enable more people to go to more places than they can currently by bus.  The report is a detailed and comprehensive document that draws on the local knowledge and expertise of planners and officials in Dublin Bus, local authorities and the NTA as much as it draws on the international experience of Jarrett Walker and his colleagues.<\/p> <p>  The first step in the redesign process was to review the existing network.  This identified several issues, including complexity, overlapping routes, too many buses in the city centre and a poor orbital service.  With regard to complexity, the sheer number of routes and branches is a barrier to understanding the network and discourages many trips for which the bus service could be useful.  Many overlapping routes with differing frequencies prevent buses from being evenly spaced to minimise waiting.  Along with very low frequency on some routes, this means many people wait longer than necessary.  There are too many buses in the city centre.  Many streets carry very high volumes of buses which produces major delay due to buses blocking each other.  On the poor orbital service aspect there are too many services running directly into and out of the city centre, but poor service for travel between many other destinations away from the city centre.<\/p> <p>  On the point about complexity, it is worth looking at the map that we have included in our written submission that shows the existing city centre bus routings.  It is beyond argument to say that it is virtually incomprehensible to most people; yet it is the best map available to describe the city centre bus network.  This means that people become familiar with their one or two bus routes for fixed journeys and avoid using the network for anything else.  In the case of visitors, most migrate to the Luas and DART system, which is much easier to understand and use, and avoid the bus system because of its incomprehensibility.  We want to change that and provide a better system that is easier to understand and navigate and, most important, will get more people to more places sooner.<\/p> <p>  In June 2017, we published the Dublin area bus network redesign choices report which set out information on the existing bus system and proposed a number of strategies that could be considered in the redesign of the bus network.  We sought public feedback on the simplification of the radial bus services to form high frequent spines, as they are called, the reallocation of some radial services to create frequent orbital services, and the use of interchange to allow connections between different bus services and between bus, DART and Luas.<\/p><p>A public survey was made available online and in paper format.  More than 12,000 people responded to the survey, approximately 1% of Dublin&rsquo;s population, which was an unprecedented level of response.<br\/><br\/>The level of support shown for the proposed strategies was extremely high.  Some 80% agreed or strongly agreed that it is worth asking people to interchange in order to create a network that helps more people reach more destinations sooner.  Some 89% supported the idea of consolidating routes into spines and 85% supported the reallocation of some radial services to create frequent orbital services.  From this feedback, we proceeded to develop a detailed plan based on those strategies.<br\/><br\/>I will now address the network proposals and the key elements of the redesigned bus network.  It is proposed to convert a complex network of overlapping routes into the city centre into seven high frequency &ldquo;spines&rdquo; designated A to G, with buses coming every four to eight minutes all day and even more frequently at peak hours.  Moreover, a new network of high frequency orbital routes will be created.  These will intersect with the main spines to form a web-like grid of routes where buses are always coming soon.  As well as providing for easy movement between the spines and the orbital routes, the orbital routes will allow much more movement between different areas of the city without the need to travel into the city centre. <br\/><br\/>A further proposal calls for the implementation of a much larger overall network of frequent routes where the next bus is always coming soon, within 15 minutes or less, and with easy interchange wherever frequent lines cross.  It is also proposed to introduce a new 90-minute fare that covers any combination of bus, DART or Luas trips beginning within 90 minutes so that no additional payment is needed to change buses or change onto DART or Luas.  The journey can be longer than 90 minutes; the fare just requires the last leg to start within 90 minutes.  Overall, the proposed new network will provide a 27% increase in bus services.  Just as important, when we calculate the increase in accessibility, the average person in Dublin will be able to get to 20% more useful places within 30 minutes than they can under the existing network.  The figure of 20% is the average across the region, with many people seeing higher increases.  Under the revised network nearly 1 million Dublin area residents will be within 400 m of a bus service coming every 15 minutes or more frequently all day, an increase of 250,000 people. <br\/><br\/>Overall, we believe that the proposed network proposals are vastly beneficial for the Dublin region, but there are trade-offs.  While most people will not need to change buses, some people will.  In some cases, people who currently have a direct service may have to change buses to get to their destination.  However, because these two buses will operate on routes with a much higher frequency of service, in most cases people will be able to get to their destination in a shorter overall time.<br\/><br\/>A public consultation process on these proposals has commenced and will run until 28 September.  All of the network redesign information has been published on the BusConnects website.  An online and printed survey is now available, allowing people to give their views and comments on the bus network redesign proposals.  The online survey is at <i>www.busconnects.ie.<\/i>We will shortly be announcing a series of information sessions across the region where people will be able to come to have details explained and queries answered. <br\/><br\/>These proposals constitute a major undertaking to redesign our bus system to better cater for today&rsquo;s needs and to be positioned to accommodate the region&rsquo;s future needs.By its nature there have to be trade-offs in such a massive redesign task, and not everybody can be better off under the new network.  However, the vast majority of people across the region will gain from these proposals, which will provide a network that will enable more people to get to more places sooner.  That concludes my introductory statement.  I trust that I can answer any queries that arise. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Graham.

The opportunity to have this engagement is welcome.  For the most part, BusConnects offers huge potential for a positive effect and an opportunity to enhance and improve the bus service that is currently operating in Dublin.  As Ms Graham quite rightly said, the service has evolved over a period of several decades, although I think Dublin Bus did carry out a reorganisation of the routes in the early 2000s, so there has been some progress in recent years.  It would be wrong of us not to acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  I am struck by the point Ms Graham made that a public survey was made available and more than 12,000 people responded to it.  To me, that indicates the pivotal role that Dublin Bus plays in transporting people around our capital.  It is terribly important that this consultation process engages with the people who use this service.  I welcome the fact that the NTA has extended the consultation process by two weeks to 28 September.  However, the month of August is a write-off for a variety of reasons, such as school holidays and people travelling abroad.  Moreover, unless the witnesses can change this today, we still do not know the times and venues of the public meetings at which people can tease out the various bus routes.  Given these facts, I think there needs to be flexibility around the date of 28 September.  That is something the NTA should bear in mind.  If it does not see the same level of interaction that it did previously, the NTA should certainly be flexible around extending that further.  <\/p> <p>  I think the NTA needs to very quickly publish the dates and venues of its engagements with communities.   To my mind, it should have been able to do this already.  I have heard a figure of 18 locations.  Perhaps the witnesses can correct that.  I do not think that is enough.  I think the process needs to extend to every part of the greater Dublin area as well - Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and all the areas served by Dublin Bus.  There needs to be a very strong presence on the ground.  People need to be able to go in and interact with the representatives of Dublin Bus. <\/p> <p>  I have gone through the website on a number of occasions.  It has been suggested to me that if it had a Google Maps add-on people could use the site to navigate the proposed routes, as opposed to merely looking at the maps.  It might make it an awful lot simpler for people to engage with the process. <\/p> <p>  I would like to hear some reassurances that this is not a box-ticking exercise and really is about engagement with the people it is going to affect.  Moreover, I would like reassurance that if a huge area of concern is identified it will be possible to change some of the proposals.  For example, most of the direct city services from commuter towns such as Balbriggan, Skerries, Swords and even Dunshaughlin have all been eliminated.  That has taken place even though there is a huge demand in the morning and evening, reflected in the number of people using the services.  A witness said that additional services would be provided at peak hours to limit overcrowding.  Perhaps that is an opportunity to look at retaining some of these services, for which there is quite clearly a huge demand.<\/p> <p>  It was said that the choices report came about as a result of consultation between the NTA, Dublin Bus officials and Dublin City Council officials.  Were any of the bus drivers, who engage with service users on a daily basis, consulted or made part of that process?<\/p><p>I hope this works and I am certainly not wishing that it will not work but it may be that changes are introduced and we actually notice an increase in the number of people going back to their cars.  People have become used to getting on to a bus and going from one point to a second point without the need to change over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#N01200","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Deputy, you have five minutes now.

Anyway, you should have examined the agenda prior to the meeting, Chairman.  That is your job.  That is what you are given your position as Chairman for.  If you did not look at the agenda, then you cannot blame everyone else.<\/p> <p>  I wanted to ask about the consultation undertaken during the drafting of the plan, in particular with disability groups and groups who work with elderly people in the community.  What was done to ensure they were catered for as part of the process?  Can the NTA deputation outline what was done?  More than anyone, these particular groups are inclined to rely on and use public transport.<\/p> <p>  We had a delegation in from MetroLink this morning to discuss the public consultation process.  The NTA has said that it would have more meetings.  Most people have raised the fact that they believe there is little in the way of public consultation or that it is very much one way.  I will ask the question again.  We asked the question at the earlier meeting as well.  Will the NTA agree to appoint a liaison officer specifically to deal with the public consultation processes?  Such a person could be available for communities and members of the public who have serious concerns and who believe the process currently under way is not addressing them.  I cannot imagine why the authority would be opposed to the idea.  Would the NTA as a public body agree to set up an official public liaison officer to deal with community groups and others with concerns?<\/p> <p>  Other concerns have arisen.  One relates to the severe reduction in direct services to the city.  That is probably the greater concern.  People may well have to get two or three buses to get to work.  Does the authority believe that is reasonable?  People place as much emphasis on convenience as on time or speed.  What if a commuter has to get three buses and is entirely dependent on those three buses arriving on time and on the frequency of the buses?  If that does not materialise or if a commuter is hassled because of the need to get three buses to work, then he or she may decide to take the car.  That is the first thing that will come into the minds of people.  They may take the view that it is simply too much hassle and too far to walk to the bus stop.  Even then, the commuter will have to get two or three others.  Alternatively, he or she could take the car.  This could well backfire and be a retrograde step.<\/p> <p>  People have asked other questions.  They may be localised concerns but they have been raised because people cannot get answers.  One relates to the Luas extension to Lucan.  The concern raised is that the route seems to be the same dedicated road space for bus corridors that is dedicated for the Luas track.  Can the authority representatives confirm whether that is the case?  If so, how in God's name is that supposed to work?  There are numerous localised issues but if the authority had an official liaison officer, then the officer could deal with these issues and give clarity to people.<\/p> <p>  Another question relates to Lower Artane Cottages and the road being widened and how the change will affect those concerned.  I know of a dozen or more who have been affected.  The authority will need a contact person ahead of submissions to clarify how exactly the plan will affect them as well as to inform them and enable them to make submissions.  The more information they have, the better.<\/p> <p>  That is about it for now.  In particular I am calling for answers to those questions.  Can the authority give details of the discussion undertaken with disability groups and representatives of elderly groups in communities?  They are the people most likely to use public transport constantly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#O02100","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.

The consultation has been pushed out to 28 September.  That is unacceptable because half of the people of Dublin will not be around for the majority of that time.  The city is empty.  If I want to be cynical I could say this happens frequently, either over the Christmas or Easter periods or the summer holidays.  I do not know the reason that date was agreed.  Is there a deadline we should be aware of?  I plead with the witnesses not to ignore the request from Oireachtas Members or the public to revisit the cut-off point of 28 September because people are only settling back into their homes and jobs at that time.<\/p> <p>  I still have difficulty with the maps provided, despite having taken a microscope and a magnifying glass to them.  I would love to have a detailed explanation of how these new routes will impact on the city street by street and house number by house number.  There will be loss of greenery and, in some instances, loss of property in the surrounding areas of the city but it is very important that we know how the impact of that on a house number by house number basis.  I would like to be provided with detailed maps covering the areas of Crumlin, the Liberties, Kilmainham and Ballyfermot because I still cannot read the ones provided, and I am not that dumb.  I hope the witnesses will be able to provide that.  Are they available in that detailed format online?<\/p> <p>  There was another question about the national children's hospital.  It appears the national children's hospital will not have a direct bus route other than from outlying areas.  That will be a loss to the people within the south side of city.  There is talk of restricting general traffic in Mount Brown to public transport only.  That is a very busy area already but when the hospital opens in 2021 or 2022, what will be the transport options to the hospital for people in the centre of the city, especially for those in the south side?<\/p> <p>  I note we are going back to a single deck fleet.  I remember the City Imp, the 123, that served Inchicore down to the Liberties.  We are returning to a single deck fleet but an electric vehicle fleet should be considered having regard to the environment and energy conservation in the future.  Why was the single deck fleet chosen?  Is it because the buses are more frequent?  Why was the City Imp and similar buses withdrawn having been introduced in the 1990s?<\/p> <p>  Was a study done on the Luas, and perhaps the DART also?  Despite a difficult start, the Luas has transformed the city.  Unfortunately, the transformation has meant that the city is clogged with cars which are beginning to take over neighbourhoods around every Luas stop.  One cannot park near my one in Rialto because cars have taken over the area.  Unfortunately, the residents are being penalised.  They are being told that the only solution is paid parking but the problem is not of their making.  It is the influence of the development of the national children's hospital.<\/p> <p>  Has consideration been given to connecting buses to each major Luas stop, where there is an outpouring of people from the Luas, to take them from there out of the city?  That would mean people would not park their cars at the Luas stop all day or wait to collect somebody to bring them further out of the city?<\/p> <p>  Route 17 covering Rialto to the UCD area will no longer service any of the housing estates in Crumlin.  I reiterate the need for a map outlining, step by step, the loss of property, trees and infrastructure heading towards the outskirts of the city centre.  In terms of the city centre, it is clogged with traffic already.  How will we manage to increase the speed of the bus service?  We cannot tear down old Dublin to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#P00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>That was four minutes and 55 seconds.

There are some very big losers, and that will be my primary focus.  People measure their journey from door to door.  If they have to travel a distance from a bus stop, for example, they will drive, park their cars and clog up suburban roads and so on, which is an unintended consequence.  That will happen.<\/p> <p>  I was involved in a major origin and destination survey, which was the first time CI&Eacute; collaborated with a community.  I did the groundwork in our local community in Leixlip.  That was in the mid-1990s.  The public transport was designed to match the results of that.  There were ten major initiatives as a consequence of the survey and they have worked very well.  All of them were implemented over a period of time.<\/p> <p>  The same happened in Celbridge and Maynooth.  There are 50,000 people living in those three towns, and it is estimated that an additional 30,000 will live in them over the next six years.  Some of that development will not happen but quite a bit of it will, and some of it is under way as we speak.  It is not an insignificant sized community, which is served by rail as well as bus.  There is very heavy bus use.  Whether they are in the west, east or north of the city, we want to discourage the car user and make public transport more attractive.  I believe the real losers in this proposal are those living on the fringes of the city or in communities that will not have the permeability some of them currently experience.<\/p> <p>  There is a huge dependence on the bus in the Dublin region.  That is not the case in other cities that are served by trains, underground services and so on.  It is not a normal feature and it is probably not comparable with other areas.  I caution against trying to replicate that in this city because of the absence of connectivity to the various train lines.<\/p> <p>  The information sessions will be incredibly important because people require detail.<\/p> <p>  In Confey, in my area of Leixlip, the 66A bus goes into a housing estate of 700 houses.  Essentially, people will now get some sort of feeder bus to Leixlip village where they will get on another bus.  They will get off in Lucan and get on another bus, whereas they are used to travelling on to a City Speed into town.  That is a description of something that could be very off-putting.  To give another example, some of the Celbridge buses travel on the Dublin road and bypass Leixlip.  They will now come into Leixlip.  When they come out of the other side of Leixlip, however, because Celbridge has the priority on that junction, the buses will queue and cars will get priority.  Have the junctions been considered?  That is one with which I am very familiar.<\/p> <p>  I accept there are gains in the proposal but the City Speed buses coming from Maynooth, for example, bypass Lucan and Chapelizod.<\/p><p>Under the new proposal, however, the spine bus will now go in that direction.  There is congestion in all these areas.  There is no possibility of a priority bus lane or a bus lane because of the width of the road.  Whatever about a bus lane, there certainly will not be room for cycle lanes.  There is far too little detail.  Has an origin and destination study been done?  Is that done only when designing a timetable?  I accept there are different versions of, or approaches to, this proposal depending on whether we are dealing with the routes, infrastructure or timetable.  I accept there are different processes to be gone through.  However, if I get on a City Speed bus in Leixlip, I can be at Heuston Station within 25 minutes and while the rest of the journey to the town will depend on congestion, it is quick enough after that.  Under this proposal I would have to get off the bus that I got on in Leixlip, which is full leaving there, and get on another bus.  Not everyone will fit onto the second bus.  They would then have to wait for another bus and, as has already been said, the weather may not be particularly brilliant.  I am familiar with Lucan and I do not know where bus queues could be accommodated there.<\/p><p> I have been describing my area, but the case would be exactly the same with the 37 bus, which comes from Carpenterstown.  In a counterintuitive way, people would have to go up towards Blanchardstown to get a bus into town.  In Bray, the 145 would be replaced with a 212 local bus from Ballywaltrim, which would come through the heavily congested main street in Bray.  The bus would then have to do a loop to the train station and back around.  To be honest, I cannot visualise why it would be attractive to get on a bus when one considers such scenarios.<\/p><p> Unless the periphery is got right it will generate even more traffic and people may well abandon their cars.  They may well drive from parts of north Kildare to Lucan and look for somewhere to abandon their cars, rather than having to change buses twice before getting on the bus they sought in the first place.  They will be the big losers and unless some of this loss is addressed, we will run into a situation where the exact reverse of what is proposed will happen, namely, that more traffic will be generated.  With regard to the smaller buses that are proposed, what would the fleet be like?  Would it be accessible?  Are they low-floored?  Have they been purchased?  I seek some detail in this regard.  Would they be run as part of the Dublin Bus fleet?  How would that be arranged?<\/p><p> We have a good working relationship in north Kildare with the public transport providers because we have engaged in a way whereby we have said what our needs are and, in many ways, they have been matched.  In recent years we have been told a business case has to be made for new route.  A development of 1,000 new houses is being built on a non-existing road.  What will be the arrangement for augmenting services?  Will a business case have to be made on each occasion this happens?  It is more likely to happen on the edge of the city, for example, in Fingal, north Kildare and Bray.  The closer we get to the city, the greater the gain and the further we go from the city, the greater the loss.  It is more attractive to use a car the further from the city one is.<\/p><p> This summarises some of the concerns I have.  I do not believe a forensic look has been taken at some of the junctions, pinch points and areas where people would have to connect with the bus on the spine, or of the queuing conditions people would encounter when they got off one bus, which may be full.  How would people be accommodated in this situation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#P00400","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":172,"content":"<p>N&iacute; raibh m&eacute; le labhairt, I was not going to speak but I feel I have to.

Unfortunately, sometimes in these Houses we look at glasses as being more half empty than half full.  Like Deputy Troy, I believe a strong positive effort has been made here with regard to improving the traffic congestion in Dublin city.  From my perspective, it is certainly worthy of being given every fair chance.  Having said this, it is important that committee members and others question and challenge it to ensure it is robust and that it has a better chance of working effectively.<\/p> <p>  I am impressed by the fact that international consultants from Canada have been approached.  Very often we do not necessarily have all of the expertise internally in Ireland, and it is useful to get the best practice we can from outside of our country and see how it fits into our requirements.<\/p> <p>  My questions are on public consultation.  I agree that the timeframe should be pushed out by another couple of weeks given the time of the year, as many people may be out of the country on holidays.  I would like a sense of where consultation with trade unions and other stakeholders is at.  These include bus drivers and key people who make this happen on a day-to-day, hour-to-hour and route-by-route basis.<\/p> <p>  On integration, as Deputy Catherine Murphy noted, linking with the radial routes is very important for those who live outside of Dublin in terms of how they connect to the internal network in the city.  Does the NTA have a sense of the direct and indirect financial implications?  What are the environmental implications?  How would we know when this is a success?  What are the key performance indicators?  What would tell us we have achieved the specific goals?  It is only then we would be able to measure how successful or otherwise we are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#Q00600","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I welcome the NTA.  It will be important to future-proof this proposal.  Not alone must it work but it must do so for many decades.  It has to be something that can be built on.  It is a new construct and foundation.  However, it could end up not being future-proofed.  I am concerned there is great pressure to conclude the project but it needs to be measured and measured again to make sure it is fully accessible to people with disabilities.  The cost of not getting this right in terms of accessibility would be high.<\/p><p>I do not wish to be alarmist, but people with disabilities and their families have appeared before the committee and their growing sense of frustration in that regard is palpable.  They understand that if they cannot use public transport or any other public service, they are being prevented from participating in the life of the country in education, employment, housing and so forth.  Transport connects everything from sport to families, work, training and education.  That frustration will not go without being expressed very strongly and it will not be expressed verbally.  That is the sense I have of where people are.  We are educating people very well and they are going to school with their colleagues, but if they cannot go somewhere after that, a price will be paid on the streets.  That is my view.  It must be done right.<\/p><p> With regard to the question about KPIs, it is unsuccessful if it is not accessible.  What engagement has the NTA initiated, if any, with people with disabilities and their organisations on this project?  If it has, when did it do it?  What engagement has it initiated, if any, with the National Disability Authority, NDA, and, in particular, its centre of excellence in universal design?  Does the NTA have an awareness of Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, on accessibility, which states state parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure persons with disabilities have access on an equal basis with others to the physical environment, transport and so forth?  It states these measures shall include the identification and elimination of obstacles.  We have an opportunity to eliminate some obstacles and barriers.  Yesterday there was an invitation to engage in consultation from the NDA at which a series of complaints and issues were raised by people with disabilities.  I have spoken to four of those people and two of them are in this room.  The other two are not present.  As they put it, without rehearsing it, there is a sense that things are going backwards.  I have the same concern.  How many vehicles have been built or constructed like the two bus types that were on display yesterday outside the NDA?  One was a single decker and the other a double decker.  To return to the NTA, has the board of the authority been advised of and\/or engaged in any consideration of accessibility issues related to the project and\/or its understanding and responsibilities in respect of Article 9 of the CRPD?<\/p><p> I have some questions about the opening statement and the comment that while most people will not need to change buses, some will.  What is the approximate percentage?  Has the authority considered this in the case of people with disabilities?  It is an inconvenience for anybody to have to make one or two interchanges, but it is well beyond an inconvenience for somebody who has a mobility or other impairment or disability.  The impact of making one or two changes is very heavy.  It is not simply an inconvenience and another routine that one gets into easily enough.  The statement also mentions - Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh said this was generally a positive move - that the authority engaged Jarrett Walker &amp;amp; Associates from Portland, Oregon.  Did it question and examine the consultants on their record concerning accessible public transport before it commissioned them for the project?  What is their record in that regard?<\/p><p> We tend to think of the person in the wheelchair or the person who is blind, but people have a range of disabilities, some of which are hidden.  They might have head injuries, different neurological conditions or intellectual disabilities.  Measures such as the livery and signage being changed have an impact.  Many of the people concerned have had to be briefed, walked through, coached or trained, whatever one wishes to call it, to be able to use public transport.  When that is done, they can get from A to B and know their interchanges.

I will try to be brief and precise.  <\/p> <p>  The information sessions are vital.  We have entered a public consultation process without a list of where the information sessions will take place.  They need to take place very quickly because there is a great deal of confusion among the public about indicative and exact lines.  I will discuss one of the routes which I took two hours to walk through last night.  It is the C route, which is the one closest to my home.  When one leaves Ringsend, there is no clear indication as to whether Pembroke Street or Bath Street will be used.  In walking the route I counted 50 car parking spaces that would have to go.  I have no notion of to where they will be moved.  That is why the information sessions are so important.  I counted five disability parking bays.  There is one woman with a severe disability and I do not know how she will be able to commute or gain access.  I walked around her home for some time trying to find where the bay could be put in close proximity.  Again, there has been no communication, which is a grave concern.<\/p> <p>  On the routes that will be lost, one is the No. 47.  It travels infrequently, but people have adjusted to the level of service.  Importantly, it takes people to their hospital appointments at St. Vincent's University Hospital and continues on to UCD for students.  The document does not state clearly that the route will be gone, but it will be because it is on the C route.  The authority is doing a great deal of work and has many balls in the air with regard to consultation on MetroLink, BusConnects, the idea of having 1,000 guards or 300 parking spaces or whatever combination there will be.  How many staff are working on the projects?  Is the authority fully resourced for the amount of work taking place in a very short period?<\/p> <p>  I will conclude with a comment.  It was fantastic to see the French football team travelling along the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es to celebrate winning the World Cup.  They were on an electric bus.  Paris and France are way ahead of anywhere else in the use of electric buses, yet the delegates are still talking about hybrid diesel buses.  We need to move on in that regard, especially given the concentration of buses in the city centre.<\/p><p>My questions about the C route may sound local, but if anybody in this room walked one of his or her own routes, he or she would probably come up with similar questions about people with a disability, parking bays and other issues and how they are to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#R00900","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I will address a number of issues.

It is big.  Dublin Bus has stated it conducted a review in 2011 that was almost equally as big.  It is the second major review in a decade, but it is significant.<\/p> <p>  I reinforce all of the points made by Senator John Dolan.  I am pleased he got to make them.  There are penalties for connecting and they will have to be addressed at final report stage.  They will come up in the public consultation stage.  They will affect people with disabilities and people who have challenges with mobility, not necessarily older people.  There is a penalty for having to disembark and connect with another bus service.<\/p> <p>  I like the idea of spines which I welcome.  I have used the example of the 15 route, the service that serves a lot but not all of my area.  Traditionally, if I hopped off the bus at Rathmines to go into a shop or the bank, I would have had to wait like an eejit for the next 15 bus to come along because 12 buses could pass me and I would not have been sure where they would have ended up.  Under this system, it would be the A spine; therefore, I would know where any bus with the letter \"A\" on it would take me.  That is very welcome and good news for commuters.  People are going to be challenged.  If one takes the far reaches of the constituency and beyond, for example, buses coming from Blessington, there will be a lot of connections in The Square.  There are some pluses in that there will finally be a connection from Ballycullen, Knocklyon and Scholarstown serving the Luas red line.  That is very much to be welcomed, but I have raised an issue which the NTA is taking up, namely, the lack of use of two really good quality bus corridors, QBCs, on Ballycullen Road and Firhouse Road which connect with the A spine on the Tallaght Road.  In addition, one does not have the entire length of the N81 as a QBC, but it could be done very easily and it would also add efficiency.<\/p> <p>  I am not a member of the committee, but the challenge for it is whether it embraces the concept of BusConnects in principle.  I do not wish to dictate to it, but that is the question it has to answer.  SIPTU embraces it, but the NBRU has a lot of questions about it.  I look forward to interaction with its members afterwards.<\/p> <p>  I have raised with the NTA the issue of localised park and ride facilities.  I know that it has plans for large park and ride facilities on the fringes of the city, but there is a need for localised park and ride facilities to encourage those people who are a little further from bus routes to access them.<\/p> <p>  There is real concern about the withdrawal of services from housing estates.  That issue is going to come up in more detail in the public consultation process.  We are reflecting these concerns and there will be an opportunity to tease out the issue.<\/p> <p>  We must acknowledge what Dublin Bus is doing and what it has done with the network.  Like the union representatives, I am a champion of the company and will defend it to the hilt, not just for the sake of it but also because it is a company that has turned itself around.  It has an excellent culture, CEO and staff who deliver.  It was back on the road first after the snow, quicker than any other form or mode of public transport.  It is the most flexible public transport mode we have.  As the infrastructure is developed for the interconnections, I hope it will provide things drivers do not have such as basic bathroom facilities when they stop.  It is so easy to overlook such an issue.  <\/p> <p>  That leads me to another question.  I think it is going to be really important, given the content of the NBRU's submission, that the other stakeholders engage with the NBRU.  It should not leave it exclusively to Dublin Bus.  I would like to see the NTA engage with the NBRU.  There are many worthy issues raised in its submission, but having looked at the BusConnects proposal, I can see that there are some areas that require face to face engagement in order to explain them.  I also think the NTA needs to meet the drivers, the front-line staff.  We have talked about people with disabilities, customers and people with special needs, but it would be worthwhile and is necessary as part of the BusConnects process to speak to the men and women who are delivering the service every day in winning hearts and minds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#S00400","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>My first issue is consultation.  Last week in the D&aacute;il during Leaders' Questions I asked about the consultation period being much too short.  I note that it has been pushed out to 28 September, but it should be extended until October, given the extent of issues to be discussed.  Last Monday week when I looked at the plan for my area, it was apparent that one would have to have the existing routes on one side and the proposed routes on the other and to examine them in minute detail to find out which areas had been affected.  One can see it fairly well on the two big maps.  I propose that the NTA further extend the consultation period.<\/p> <p>  Another issue about which I want to ask the NTA is the public survey that was carried out.  It was said more than 12,000 people had responded, or approximately 1% of Dublin's population.  Dublin Bus carries 140 million passengers every year.  It was said that was an unprecedented level of response.  What is the normal response level for such surveys carried out by the NTA?  Does it ensure specific groups are included in surveys such as people with a disability, older people aged over 60 years, students who travel to college or drivers?<\/p> <p>  When I saw the map, I noticed that services along the coastline looked to be well connected.  It looks really good in Rathmines and Rathgar and across the city, but as one moves out into working class areas, the difference between the current and proposed routes is evident.  The service to estates is affected.  The NTA referred to a 15 minute walk in the context of connectivity and jumping off one service and onto another.  Services in certain areas are being wiped out.  From what I can see on the maps, there is a real loss of service in areas on the periphery.  Up to 99 people are to be brought on double-decker buses every five minutes and dropped off to interconnect with a 28 seater Mercedes bus service which will come every 15 to 20 minutes.  That means huge queues of people will be dumped off in the connection area who will have to wait 20 minutes or more for the next bus which will only be a 28 seater.  That is what it looked like to me initially, but I accept that I will have to look at the proposal in more detail.<\/p> <p>  I do not have a car and use the bus every day.  I use public transport everywhere.  There is good connectivity throughout the city.  Bus stop No. 1987 is serviced by the 13, 69 and 68 bus routes.  The 69 bus route serves Rathcoole.  The 68 bus route serves Newcastle.  It services the Bulfin estate and cuts through the South Circular Road all the way down into South Great George's Street.  These three bus services are being taken off the route and will be substituted by the 63 bus which will come every hour.  I will be at the bus stop in Inchicore waiting for the 63 bus every hour.  I will be able to go to the Blackhorse tram stop and get on the Luas, but capacity on the Luas at peak times in the morning is inadequate.  I do not know whether the NTA has checked whether capacity on the Luas can be increased to allow extra passengers to get on at that point and travel further into the city.  That means that a lot of people will have a 15 minute walk to the next bus stop at the working man's club which oeople do not know is in Inchicore village.  The existing 40 bus service has been changed to the G spine and will come every five minutes.  We only made representations to Dublin Bus about four months ago because of the queues waiting at the bus stop at the working man's club.  When I go there between 7.30 a.m. and 8.30 a.m., there are 20 to 25 people waiting for a bus.<\/p><p>The 13, the 69 and the 68 will not go down that road but there will be a G-spine bus every five minutes at peak times.  There will be problems for everybody further down the road as a result.  In Drimnagh, there will be a complete clearout of 123 and 122 buses and there will be no connectivity with St. James's Hospital for any bus route.  The 68 will be gone and students will have to go down the orbital route to Rialto Bridge and try to get access to a bus there to take them to the Synge Street schools.<\/p><p> This is the biggest change to have been proposed for this city and it has been done too quickly.  Somebody said there would be a 15-minute walk but for older people that is a long walk, as it is for people with disabilities.  Waiting times are long and I am not convinced that it connects people.  In fact, it seems to disconnect people from public transport.  Does the NTA view the big spinal routes as being privatised in the future, perhaps in four or five years' time?  They are the areas where there is big capacity and usage.  I hope the NTA can give a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer to that.<\/p><p> There is no true connectivity to the national children's hospital as the 18 and 17 are being redirected.  There will be no access to colleges such as UCD and buses have been taken completely out of the Crumlin area, now having to go around the periphery of the estates there.  That has a serious impact on people and communities.  We are having a public meeting at the Crumlin GAA club next Tuesday and we will see what response there is to that aspect of the plans.  It should be interesting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#S00500","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I have an appointment which I cannot avoid at 3.15 p.m. so I ask the Vice Chairman to take the Chair at that point, if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#T00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>The Chair is lucky I turned up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#T00300","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I wish the NTA the best of luck with this because it will not be an easy job but it is an extremely important job.  We discussed the metro upgrade earlier on and that is difficult at local level but the number of challenges with BusConnects are a multiple of that.  I have experience of many years' involvement in QBC designs.  On every street the allocation of space is the most contentious local issue, whether it is because local retailers want car parking inside their shops or a traffic lane is going to be lost, and if we are to take out gardens it will be very tough.  I agree that we need to consult on this but we also need a sense of urgency as our city is grinding to a halt and it will not be good for the country if our economy crashes on the back of a city in which one cannot do business.<\/p> <p>  There is also an urgency around providing the switch to public transport and making the system work, which will avert a cost of &euro;2 billion per annum arising from gridlock.  I agree also that public transport should be reorientated to places which do not have choices at the moment or where communities are more dependent on public transport because the level of car ownership is lower.  I believe the NTA may need a dedicated office for that, something I spoke about with Mr. Creegan at a previous hearing.  If we always contract consultants for the detailed design, we may not get the economies of scale we would get from doing it as a single project.  From the point of view of engineering resources, we should switch money away from our road building and into this programme.  We want less traffic coming into Dublin city but we cannot achieve that while we are carving up road space.  It is up to the NTA to make the strategic decision to scale back all the road widening work in Dublin and reallocate engineers towards road design.  We cannot continue doing both because one makes the other more difficult.<\/p> <p>  I will not go into the details of any one specific design but this is an opportunity for radical change and we should look at College Green, the Liffey Quays and the entire gyratory system around the city centre, which I describe as like the Ben Hur racetrack.  The system around Westmoreland Street, Pearse Street, the Millennium Bridge and St. Stephen's Green disadvantages pedestrians and cyclists.<\/p> <p>  This is not just for the bus service but for the entire transport system and this is an opportunity to turn Dublin into a cycling city, at scale and with real ambition.  The gyratory system in the city centre is antithetical to cycling and we are competing with other cities which are realising the importance of transport systems.  Our nearest big competitor is probably Manchester, which has just decided to invest &euro;1.5 billion in its cycling infrastructure.  Our national development plan has some &euro;50 million for greenways and it is an utter disgrace that we are completely ignoring cycling.  There is money in the BusConnects project for cycling but I am flabbergasted at what we are suggesting for my constituency.  We are suggesting, for example, that we take cyclists off the main street in Rathmines, which is beyond belief because cycling is the main mode of transport on that street, something people would see if they went down there at 5.30 p.m. or 6 p.m., where it is like downtown Beijing 20 years ago.  None of the alternative route options seems workable in any way or at all connected with the idea of making Dublin a cycling city.  I could get on my bike now and be on any point on the M50 within half an hour but everywhere within the M50 should be an entire cycling city.<\/p> <p>  We need the bus network, which is essential, but it is time to develop cycling.  We have been talking about it for 25 years but we have done nothing.  We have put in patches of lanes here and there and if this is another case of squeezing cyclists in as an afterthought, and not giving them priority, we will lose out to the likes of Manchester where they realise that urban design, urban permeability and urban villages are the way to go.  If kids cycle to school, morning rush hour traffic is reduced by 30%.  It will be tough but we should do it big and do it properly, with real vision and ambition so that we include cycling as well as walking.  The hardest thing will be the politics of it because we will all represent constituents who will have concerns that their front door is being affected by a need of someone who is coming from five miles further out, or 30 miles in the cases of people coming in on the motorways.  They will cry foul but we have to do it.  We have no choice because car-based Dublin has to stop and a public transport-centred, cycling city is where we need to go.  The NTA will have the Green Party's support and we wish it the best of luck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#T00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I ask the Vice Chairman to take the Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#T00500","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1531911600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531911600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I will be assisted by Mr. Creegan and Mr. Gaston in trying to get through the questions and points raised.

When one drives around the city, Dublin Bus buses are instantly visible.  That was one of the purposes of the choice of livery.  We are not London, where the red bus is iconic.  Dublin Bus is a semi-state, taxpayer-funded company.  It is about ensuring that it is entitled to determine its own future as a taxpayer-funded company, notwithstanding the powers the NTA possesses.

I thank the Vice Chairman for the latitude.  The NTA needs to recognise - I am sure it does - that there is a huge amount of sentiment in Dublin towards Dublin Bus.  That is where the colour scheme came in.  It was thought that the buses ought to remain identifiable regardless of what colours Dublin Bus chose to use.  It is in the interest of consumers and of promoting positive competition between providers that consumers know the bus they are getting on is a Dublin Bus bus or a Go-Ahead bus when they are considering the service they receive.<\/p> <p>  A few months ago, I asked Ms Graham about the pay and terms and conditions of the Go-Ahead drivers and whether they would be the same as those of their counterparts in Dublin Bus.  She stated that it was her understanding that they would but it was a matter between the operators and the employees.

That is the situation.<\/p> <p>  We need to go through the other questions that have arisen.

One concerns the direct city service commuter town links.  If the NTA omits them, what will be done to prevent a private operator coming in to fill this gap?  There are a lot of commuter towns that are serviced by direct links at present.  If passengers will now be obliged to interchange once or twice, there is an opportunity for a private operator to come in.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the branding of the buses and the legislation's use of the word \"shall\", are the witnesses aware that Dublin Bus has said it has no objection to other operators using the Dublin Bus brand?  The NTA is proposing to change 90% of the fleet to accommodate 10%.  Would it not be better to use the branding that is currently on 90% for the 10%?  It would certainly make an awful lot more economic sense, given the fact that the Dublin Bus brand is so highly thought of.<\/p> <p>  When I made a suggestion about Google Maps, Mr. Gaston said that the NTA is in the process of developing a tool.  I think Ms Graham used words to the effect that the NTA hopes to develop a tool that will enable users to take a virtual journey on the new network.  When does the NTA hope to develop that?  The consultation process has commenced.  I would have thought that would be developed in advance of the consultation process, not midway through or, heaven forbid, at the end.  I ask the witnesses to update us on that.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Vice Chairman for leniency.  Finally, the witnesses said that only a certain percentage of journeys would need an interchange.  They said that a percentage of those interchanges will be at the same hub.  Do they know at present what percentage of journeys will need an interchange?  Do they know what percentage of those interchanges will take place at the same hub?  What percentage will require a walk of 100 m?  What percentage will require a walk of 400 m?  That distance is the parameter the NTA uses in saying that 1 million of its passengers will be within 400 m of a bus stop.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses will correct me if I am wrong, but I think they said that there will be no new fleet.  I imagine there would be a huge demand for additional buses to ensure that this works.  What additional buses will be required?  Are the witnesses confident that a multi-annual capital budget will be put in place to ensure that the additional buses required to make this work will be available?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#Y02400","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531911600,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Mr. Creegan will address questions on the fleet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#Y02500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531911600,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I should have been more precise.

The NBRU will always respond positively to any announcement that brings an increase to public transport accessibility and frequency, along with added jobs in the industry.  Industrial relations issues do not feature in our analysis as we purposely sought to stay away from the area for now to concentrate on the effect the plan will have on those communities our members serve as part of the Dublin Bus family.<br\/><br\/>The three issues of accessibility, frequency and jobs are fundamental to this debate.  We contend that the NTA have got the BusConnects plan wrong in its attempts to correct perceived problems in the Dublin Bus network.  First and foremost, members, as professional politicians, should not underestimate the reaction that will ensue from local communities should the plan, as announced, become a reality.  No direct buses, isolated communities, and a necessity to use multiple buses to reach destinations that are currently served by one direct bus, are just some of the issues that will play out over the coming weeks and months.<br\/><br\/>What do we mean by claiming the NTA's plan is wrong?  To put it simply, the authority's suggestion that the notion of a direct bus to the city will disappear in many instances, and the name of the plan makes that point very clear.  To us, the term &quot;BusConnects&quot; means that there will be a significant amount of interchange, quite an amount of walking from stop to stop, etc.  Appended to our presentation is a detailed breakdown of the new routes versus the existing routes, which makes interesting reading.  I suggest that all members, along with their local councillors and community representatives, give it their full attention.  We, in the NBRU, remain willing and available to talk them through its content.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Jarrett Walker is the consultant who was engaged by the NTA to oversee, redraw, refine and even rip-up the existing Dublin Bus network.  Interestingly, he has a number of fundamentals that he uses to advise on changes to public transport providers and authorities.  He applies the following seven principles: It takes me where I want to go; it takes me when I want to go; it is a good use of my time; it is a good use of my money; it respects me in the level of safety, comfort and amenity it provides; I can trust it; and it gives me freedom to change my plans.  I know that members think Mr. Walker has described Dublin Bus because that is what Dublin Bus currently provides and Dublin Bus fits into every one of his seven headings. <br\/><br\/>His view on elected officials and community representatives is: <\/p><blockquote>The politics of these major redesigns are never easy.  (&ldquo;Beautiful people will come to you with their elderly parents and their babies and say the redesign will ruin their lives.&rdquo;)  But with a sweeping overhaul, the benefits should be substantial enough to win over elected officials and other community leaders.<\/blockquote> <p>Let me give the NBRU's translation of his view: Flood them, that is the people who have reams of information, embellish to the point that it is all about increased, high-speed corridors with more frequency and, hopefully, the devil in the detail will not be noticed.  Fortunately for Mr. Walker, he does not have to get elected.  He does not even have to drive a bus in Dublin.  Consequently, he will not be around to pick up the pieces when his desktop plan is implemented.  Let me outline what happens in reality.  Behind every beautiful person, elderly parent and baby are real people who matter in our society and who rely on public bus transport.  Dismiss the anger from those in society who depend on buses at one's peril.  It is easy for Jarret Walker, and it maybe easy for those at the NTA, but it certainly will not be easy for the elected officials and community leaders that he referred to.  <br\/><br\/>Let us dwell on the original BusConnects document.  There is not one mention of disabilities between pages 1 and 58.  Of course, behind the description of people with disabilities are some of those &quot;beautiful people&quot; whom he referenced earlier.  A significant number of our fellow citizens are not alone reliant on their bus but they take part in familiarisation and training on their bus route number, bus stop placement and colour coding, without which they would be unable to use public transport.<br\/><br\/>What also appears to be lost thus far in the debate is the fact that the people who use Dublin Bus as their primary means of transport and those who may use it for recreation and leisure may not necessarily enjoy having to hop off one bus and onto another just to get to their destination.  We contend again that there is an overemphasis on the speed test and little, if any, emphasis on the convenience test.  The people who work or socialise in Dublin may place more importance on being able to get on their bus at their stop and get off either at, or adjacent to, where they want to go.  We strongly contend that the new orbital routes should be introduced on top of the existing network and that they be monitored to establish their success or otherwise.  At least such an initiative would ensure that those commuters who have bought their houses, sent their children to particular schools, etc., could maintain their commuting patterns without fear of major upheaval.<br\/><br\/>I will outline a summary of the issues and problems associated with the plan.  First, it is based on Parliament Street, which is a proposal that Dublin City Council has rejected, and a threat of a High Court action looms over any such proposal.  Without that thoroughfare or the College Green thoroughfare the city bus services will collapse.<br\/><br\/>Second, access to the new children&rsquo;s hospital is poor for such a large national infrastructure project.  None of the new high-frequency spines connects with the hospital.  Route 123 serves Marino, Fairview, Ballybough, Summerhill, the Liberties, Drimnagh, Crumlin and Walkinstown.  That route has been scrapped in favour of a link to Sandymount, Ballsbridge and Ranelagh.<br\/><br\/>Third, outer suburban areas have in the main, under these proposals, had their direct services to the city replaced with local services.  Dunboyne, Blessington, Skerries, Saggart and Newcastle are just some examples of the highly populated places that will be isolated.<br\/><br\/>Fourth, our lack of high rise buildings has forced citizens into the hinterland.  The BusConnects plan will take away their bus services.<br\/><br\/>Fifth, these outer suburban areas will be left to the mercy of the private commercial bus operators who will charge a pretty penny and have vehicles that do not cater for our fellow citizens who have mobility difficulties.<br\/><br\/>Sixth, the changes advanced by the NTA and Jarrett Walker will have a devastating effect on the elderly and those with disabilities both seen and hidden.<br\/><br\/>Seven, working class communities like Crumlin, Drimnagh, Inchicore, Coolock, Tallaght, Saggart, Rathcoole and Cabra will, under these proposals, suffer far more than communities in more so-called affluent areas.<br\/><br\/>The plethora of local services suggested in the plan will use 40 new 28-seat single deck buses.  That is a big reduction on the current double-decker fleet.  The concept of small single decker vehicles was tried and failed in the 1990s with the use of hail and ride buses call Imps.<br\/><br\/>The stripping of bus services away from areas where the Luas red line operates, or curtailing services to feed the red line, when that system is full to capacity at peak hours is a mistake.<br\/><br\/>Curtailing direct bus services to feed an already crowded Dublin Area Rapid Transport, DART, is unsafe.  The highly trumpeted ten-minute DART service will have no new fleet for at least three to four years.  The service will be made up by splitting longer trains into more frequent shorter trains.<br\/><br\/>A band called Bagatelle made the 46A bus route famous by mentioning it in its song, &quot;Summer in Dublin&quot;.  According to this plan, bus routes like the iconic 46A will disappear.<br\/><br\/>The plan isolates rather than connects.  The 140 million passengers carried by Dublin Bus in 2017 will be severely discommoded, possibly resulting in many additional car journeys that will be accompanied by chronic traffic congestion.  The wholesale changes could lead to the permanent fragmentation and destruction of an integrated network.<br\/><br\/>My presentation includes an appendix that shows the NBRU's initial analysis of the proposed changes to the current bus routes so I will not go into the changes in detail.  The members of the committee have been supplied with a copy of my presentation, including the appendix.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Leary for his presentation.

We also view the programme as an opportunity to ensure Ireland develops a quality road transport service that is convenient for the travelling public, and those who are dependent on such services, and which can deliver decent secure and sustained employment for those that provide the service.<\/p> <p>  While SIPTU welcomes the programme and the many positives it strives to deliver, we must also comment on the negatives with the aim of having such addressed at the initial stages during consultation and planning in order that when the programme is rolled out, there will be support for the service from all stakeholders involved in, and reliant on, public transport.  SIPTU has consistently called for the necessary investment in public transport and we welcome the fact the Department, through the NTA, is committing to such investment.  This investment in the BusConnects programme can and must alleviate the extreme and increasing congestion faced by our citizens on the roads of Dublin and the surrounding area.  CSO statistics relating to 2016 showed that private car usage accounted for 69% of all journeys while bus usage accounted for 4%.   SIPTU believes the BusConnects programme, if delivered successfully, can dramatically change this statistic and this would have a positive impact for citizens, workers, business and the economy.<\/p> <p>  SIPTU believes the BusConnects programme can help reduce our carbon emissions and help Ireland tackle climate change.  Not only can this strategy take private cars off our congested roads, the planned investment in low emission buses must be welcomed by all stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  The BusConnects programme can further improve the interconnectivity of our public transport system, which must be welcomed.  With the recent commencement of LUAS cross city, the opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel rail service and the public bike scheme, along with the necessary further investment in additional services, increased DART frequency, new rolling stock for Irish Rail to increase capacity and new LUAS lines, etc, SIPTU sees this programme as a vital step in encouraging and attracting people to use public transport.  SIPTU also views the proposals to introduce bus rapid transit and dedicated bus lanes on the entire length of radial routes as a positive step.  While there has been increased services and frequency on such routes, the fact that approximately only one third of such radial routes have dedicated bus lanes results in unplanned delays where buses interact with other modes of transport.  These delays discourage passenger usage as bus transport is viewed as unreliable.  SIPTU contends dedicated bus lanes must be adequately policed to ensure they have the maximum opportunity to provide the intended reliable services.<\/p> <p>  The proposed redesign of the fares system and the future seamless interchangeability of tickets on the various modes of public transport are also welcomed to improve interconnectivity and encourage usage of all modes of Public Transport.<\/p> <p>  SIPTU welcomes the plan whereby the NTA and Dublin Bus will be jointly involved in the planned public consultation on the programme.  While the NTA is tasked with delivering the public transport services, it is vital that Dublin Bus, with their experience and knowledge of the needs of passengers be part of this process.  Dublin Bus has always met and exceeded the key performance indicators, KPI&rsquo;s, set by the NTA in delivering road passenger transport services.  Their proven track record in operating a reliable, efficient and high-quality service and the ability of our members to consistently deliver such a service needs to be retained and built on if this programme is to be successful.  Dublin Bus has links in every community in the Dublin region and their staff are the first point of contact with passengers.  This undoubted knowledge and experience must be to the forefront of delivering new services.<\/p> <p>  SIPTU must also comment on the potential negative impact of the BusConnects programme, and particularly the possible impact on passengers dependent on the services and indeed on the workers delivering the services.  Under the provision of public transport, the NTA and the Department have an obligation to provide services which may not be economically viable but which are socially necessary.  This obligation must be met under the BusConnects programme.  The programme should not simply be about getting intended passengers from one point to another safely and efficiently.  We need to also take into consideration the needs of the disabled and the people reliant on the free travel scheme: pensioners and social welfare recipients.  Many of these passengers have no other means of transport and are reliant on their bus services.  There needs to be widespread consultation with the representatives of these groups to ensure they are not left behind, and that the services that are needed for access to education, healthcare and to the community are considered and improved upon in any future transport service changes.<\/p> <p>  SIPTU also has reservations on the impact of the programme on workers who provide these services.  We believe Dublin Bus is best placed to deliver the necessary services under BusConnects.  Any plans by the NTA to franchise out such services will be resisted by SIPTU, as it will inevitably lead to a for-profit service which will not benefit the passengers, workers or those dependent on the services.  SIPTU has been actively campaigning for the establishment of a sectoral employment order, SEO, for the public bus transport industry and we are again taking this opportunity to promote this agenda.  SIPTU, arising from the previous agreement in 2015 between the NTA, the Department of Transport, the public bus companies and the trade unions, whereby 10% of public bus services were tendered, will continue to organise all workers in the industry, as we view this as a way to best protect all workers who provide the services.  An SEO will provide a level playing field for all operators and workers in the industry and will provide security of services for the travelling public. <\/p> <p>  In conclusion, SIPTU is largely supportive of the BusConnects programme, with some reservations.  The public consultation process is vital and this consultation must be all-encompassing and involve all aspects of our society to ensure our future bus services delivers for all potential passengers, for workers and for the country.

Drivers have an input into their comfort and needs before the buses are even built but people who are visually and physically impaired and travelling on the buses have no input and will not have any input, according to Mr. Creegan.

We went through a long process with it in 2014 and 2015 when it originally announced the tendering of 10% of Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus routes.  As my colleague, Mr. O'Leary, said, the NTA seems to have the wherewithal to make decisions but it is answerable to nobody.  When we campaigned and lobbied the Department, the Minister and various other politicians, we got the answer that the NTA makes those decisions.  When we engage with the NTA, it says that it is obliged by the Department to make such decisions.  It does not seem to be answerable.<\/p> <p>  It is strange that the body designing and in charge of operating and laying out plans for future transport is also the body making decisions on who provides those services and who wins those services.  I do not take comfort from what the NTA said.  We hoped we would have been able to engage with it at this forum today, but perhaps we were naive to think that coming in.  We are, however, seeking to engage.  We believe the consultation process that takes place on any plans, whether it is BusConnects in the present format or in a changed format, needs to be widespread and to encompass the experts who deal with disabilities and free travel.  SIPTU is not going to come here and say we are experts on the individual needs of various groupings of people with disabilities, old age pensioners or whoever it might be.  Even if we did say it, I do not think we would be believed.<\/p> <p>  The representatives of those people need to be involved and engaged.  It is no use having consultation on a one-to-one basis where individual needs are pushed to the front and the wider picture is not taken into consideration.  Consultation is the important phase and we welcome that Dublin Bus is involved.  As Mr. O'Leary said, my two colleagues here, who are worker directors and bus drivers, deal with people day in and day out and people identify them.  People do not know the NTA, but they know Dublin Bus is providing the service.  We want to see that continue but we also want to see the people providing the service having an input into how it is shaped and designed.

Deputy Troy put it elegantly.  This is madness that Dublin Bus livery is going to paint 90% of buses for the sake of 10%.  Dublin Bus is painting Dublin Buses as we speak and it is a waste of money.  This is all reliant on those bus lanes and corridors.  I am a bus driver, Mr. O'Connor is a bus driver and we know that 90% of people ignore bus lanes.  Roughly 10% of people in the city do not.  What is it that suggests that because bus lanes and corridors are introduced, suddenly this plan is going to work?<\/p> <p>  In some cities this does work because closed circuit television, CCTV, on buses is used to monitor bus lanes and capture images of vans and buses using them.  Those people are prosecuted.  I brought this up, perhaps ten years ago, to see if we could get this introduced.  It fell on deaf ears.  That is the type of thinking needed and that is what bus drivers are telling these people.<\/p> <p>  I will address wheelchair use.  This drives me mad.  There are buses that cater for wheelchairs.  If I have two people on a bus with prams, however, and I politely ask them to fold them to let a wheelchair user on, they will tell me \"no\".  It happens every day.  I cannot enforce that.  It should be enforced somehow.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example from Dunboyne, which is heavily populated.  The 70 bus operates from there.  People have been told that they can get the 70 bus into town but they will have to get off in Blanchardstown and get another bus.  I have been told that the NTA figures show this will be faster.  Any bus driver or anyone with a bit of common sense will say that getting two buses into the city centre is slower than staying on one bus.  As Mr. Murphy said earlier, we have many reservations on the BusConnects project but we need to get into discussions similar to this with the NTA.

As has been said, it is unfortunate that we are speaking with the unions after the NTA because we could have raised some of the unions' questions directly with it.  It is important that we engage with the ongoing public consultation process.  We have received an assurance that it has been extended to 28 September and that there is a possibility of a further extension, if warranted.  I do not need to ask that the unions support those public consultation meetings, and indeed any consultation meetings being organised, to ensure that the wider community is fully aware and appreciates the significance of the proposed changes.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Leary mentioned that we alluded to post 2019 in respect of the direct award contract.  That is relevant to BusConnects because it is going to be a cornerstone of who is going to deliver it.  BusConnects is going to come in at the tail end of 2019 or the beginning of 2020.  We need to know who is going to be delivering it and rolling it out.  The clear message from the NTA today is that, under existing legislation, it has the power to change that away from Dublin Bus and put it out to tender.  The NTA does not consider that privatisation.  I would.  I refer also to whether a direct award contract can be carried on with.  I suggested we revert back to that in September this year.  We will be backing that up and, as a permanent committee member I will be ensuring, as will my colleagues, that it is an item on our autumn agenda.<\/p> <p>  Some valid concerns have been raised.  We will be raising those we did not get an opportunity to address earlier with the NTA.  The overall objective is how we can ensure there is an improvement in the service to users.  We are all united in that.  Dublin Bus carried 140 million passengers last year.  It is the workhorse of public transport in the capital.  We have to ensure we continue to provide a good service to the people using it.  Some elements within this proposal will improve that service and we have to welcome that.<\/p> <p>  Where elements are going to have a negative consequence, we will need to work within the confines of the consultation period to try to eliminate those.  I do not know if the witnesses were in the Visitors Gallery earlier.<\/p><p>I referred to the fact that the removal of the direct route could leave it open for private operators to enter the market and operate on that timeframe.  I would welcome hearing the opinions of the witnesses on the matter.<\/p><p> Mr. Hannan alluded to the fact that I referred to branding.  I did make the point that if the legislation contains the provision for just one brand, which Mr. O'Leary disputes, there is nothing that states what the brand should be.  The Dublin Bus brand has been rated as highly satisfactory and Dublin Bus has said that it would not object to another operator using the brand.  It makes sound economic sense that 10% of the buses would change, as opposed to changing 90% of the buses to reflect new branding.<\/p><p> Mr. O'Leary made a valid point about a matter that I was unaware of.  He said that before a bus is ordered, a Dublin Bus committee ensures that the buses are fitted out and adapted adequately for the drivers, and rightly so.  The drivers have the very responsible job of ferrying between 60 and more than 100 people to their destination and ensure that is done in a timely and safe environment.  Therefore, it is only right that the drivers are comfortable in their working environment.  Likewise, it would be important that disability advocates would have an opportunity to have an input into the design of buses to ensure that when new buses are ordered, they are properly adapted and fitted out to cater for people with varying levels of ability and disability.  I do not just mean physical ability.  Some people are visually impaired.  Some people are autistic and are sensitive to the colours and textures that are used on buses.  It is important that we consider these matters as well.<\/p><p> I have a final point to make but I cannot recall it right now.  If I recall it later, I will rejoin the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#EE00700","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of the unions for their opening statements.  There is a contrast between both presentations but there is probably a contrast in the views of the committee members in terms of the plan having positives and negatives.  We, as public representatives, will first consider how this matter will impact on our communities.  In terms of my community, there are more negatives than positives, unfortunately.  We must address the public consultation aspect because there is a high level of having to change buses the further out one goes.  As many as 50,000 people live in the Leixlip, Celbridge and Maynooth area, there is a lot of development happening and there is a projected additional 30,000 people planned to relocate there up to 2024.  It is not a small area in terms of the consideration that it requires.  While I am a member of this committee, I must consider the needs of the people who live in the region in addition to the wider needs of making the transport needs of the greater Dublin area work efficiently and effectively so that we reduce the amount of traffic congestion.<\/p> <p>  Presumptions have been made about capacity levels.  I am aware of other transport providers.  I refer to the 6.20 a.m. train from Maynooth to Dublin.  One will get a seat as far as Leixlip but one will not get a seat from there on in.  The capacity on the way back at peak time in the evening is so bad that we have nearly reached the Japanese scenario of train staff having to wear white gloves and push passengers onto trains while hoping that the train doors will close.  Presumptions have been made about capacity in terms of other transport providers.  The capacity simply does not exist and it will take several years before it is sufficient to deal with existing demands, let alone future demands.<\/p> <p>  The loss of permeability within communities is a matter that will definitely arise as part of the public consultation aspect, and it should do so.  I wonder about online consultation.  That presupposes that people are comfortable going online and filling out forms and questionnaires.  The success of the consultation process also depends on the type of questions that are asked.  I will give some examples.  Would I like to be able to connect with other areas?  Of course, I would.  Would I like orbital services?  Of course, I would like orbital services.  When I analyse the detail of the questions, however, I discover that they mean something very different.  I have real concerns about some of the synopses that have been conducted, as per the NBRU's opening statement, on the loss of some of the routes and changes to some of the routes.  There are positives because other options have been put in that will bring balance.<\/p> <p>  Today we heard that there would be no privatisation.  A person who works for the company called Go-Ahead is not working for Dublin Bus and it is not his or her employer.  Let us have an honest engagement when we discuss these matters.  We will have to return to this matter in the autumn because it may well be seen as a bit of a Trojan horse as well.  If this project happens then it must take place and all of the stakeholders must understand what is involved rather than discover something halfway through the project that is at variance with what we expect.<\/p> <p>  I know that the people who live in Celbridge and Lucan require bus connections for their children to reach second level schools in Leixlip.  Such transport will happen in other areas due to capacity being available but, unfortunately, there is no capacity in the other two areas.  When we look for buses for schoolchildren, for example, we are told that a business plan is required.  Schoolchildren do not make for a good business plan as there is less money in the business for the public transport provider.  We could find ourselves in a situation where categories are not adequately considered in terms of their transport need.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about another matter.  A person leaving town may well end up in a situation where the buses that are going directly to the farther places are occupied by people who are not going as far and there could be delays on the way back.  The biggest problems are with areas on the periphery and with the services in existing communities closer to the city being lost.  They are the two areas that I am most concerned about.  The idea that the witnesses would be available for part of the public consultation process would be very useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#FF00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531911600,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time.  I will commence with the questions asked by Deputy Catherine Murphy as she has said that she must rush off.<\/p> <p>  I will start by replying to the last point that she raised.  I live near Clonee in west Dublin, and the other night people asked me about this matter because they read about it and know who I am.  I made the point that there was a negative response from me and my submission reflected same.   The people pointed out to me that they bought their houses very recently.  Almost 7,000 houses will have been built where I live between last year and the end of this year.  Some of those people found their way to the local pub and had these conversations.  They said that they bought their houses because the 39A, 39 and 38 buses were available and frequent.  Let us not forget that some people only have one car now but years ago people had two cars.  The good bus service in the area means that people can commute to the city for work and their children can attend various schools, which are very important issues.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Murphy asked the NTA about some of the peak services that go beyond Lucan.  The NTA indicated that some services will travel directly to the city at peak times.  Yes, but not as much as they are now and that is a fact.  Some of the services that the NTA thinks go beyond Lucan will go to Adamstown.  Of course, the NTA did not tell the Deputy that fact.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the public consultation, the NBRU will be involved.  The Deputy made a very good point that elderly people do not engage online and have no notion of ever engaging online.<\/p><p>It is okay to say there are public meetings.  I have a slight reservation about Dublin Bus.  It is positive that it is involved from one perspective, but from my experience I fear that Dublin Bus is in a type of Stockholm syndrome where it is beholden to the NTA and the NTA is the master of all it surveys.  That said, it is involved and we will take the positive from that for now.  We on the union side will keep an eye on its contribution to ensure it is not going to be negative.<\/p><p> There is a high level of change in buses.  The population increase in Deputy Murphy's area is going to be significant.  There is no extra capacity in Irish Rail.  My understanding, and I am open to correction on this, is that the next time there will be an increase in the Irish Rail fleet will probably be 2021 or 2022.  There is little point in having a BusConnects plan kicking in during December 2019 and January 2020 that pushes people towards trains if they are already full.  That is contradictory.<\/p><p> With regard to the privatisation debate that took place, I have covered some of that.  Deputy Troy put the same question.  Obviously, there was much uneasiness in these chairs when that question was being asked.  People can call it franchising, tendering or whatever they wish, but for us in the working community and the trade union family, it is privatisation.  My colleagues represent people in the private sphere and, of course, they will endeavour to improve those conditions.  That is what trade unions do.  Dublin Bus's tender for the 10% it lost was 5% cheaper.  That is on the public record.  Given its actions, it shows the NTA is determined, and the ideology demands, that it will move further if it is let go further.  As Deputy Troy said, this committee should have a role to play in how it moves forward in 2019.<\/p><p> Regarding the public consultation, the unions will make themselves available.  Who knows the industry better than us?  People should not lose sight of what we said in our submission.  In the middle of all the negatives, we did not go near industrial relations issues.  There might well be industrial relations issues following this in time, but we do not know.  At this juncture, however, we are getting involved with the communities we serve and looking out for them.  The people who drive buses are in the community, and we could not deliver the service without the people who work in maintenance depots and the offices.<\/p><p> On Deputy Troy's other question, there is a concern about the potential commercialisation of Dublin Bus.  We fear that is what will happen, and what better way is there to create an environment where private operators will step in than to create a mess or come up with a plan such as BusConnects?  It creates corridors directly into the city from places such as Celbridge, Balbriggan, Greystones, Bray and Blessington by creating a new service called BusConnects and creates that gap.  There is a fear that commercialisation is at play here.<\/p><p> I will make a last point before letting my colleague speak.  It is about the bus design, and Deputy Troy took up this point.  My two colleagues have sat on that committee from time to time over the years.  Without labouring the point it is an absolute disgrace that people with disabilities, who use the service and need it more than most, were not consulted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#FF00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531911600,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I will not go over every point Mr. O'Leary addressed but I wish to comment on a few important issues raised by Deputies Troy and Murphy.  We have said that we regard the consultation as key.  SIPTU and the trade union movement generally have been calling for significant investment in public transport and all public services for years.  We welcome anything that will invest money in public transport.  It is a service.  It is not a for-profit service but a service for the public, so there should be investment from the Government.  I welcome the fact that the NTA has indicated it is willing to consider extending the consultation process.  August is probably the least favourable month one could pick to carry out this consultation.  Even in Dublin Bus there are reduced schedules agreed for the summer weeks, which shows there is a reduced number of passengers and reduced usage.  If the NTA is going to consult people in the various shopping centres and elsewhere, it will only get certain answers if people are not there.  It has to consult when there is peak usage and peak passenger numbers.<\/p> <p>  In fairness, Dublin Bus has advised us it will be part of the consultation and it will consult drivers and workers in the various locations.  Most of the people who use these services do not identify with the NTA.  They do not know what the NTA is.  They are not going to be people going online, using social media and commenting on proposed changes or network redesign.  They will bring their frustrations out on the drivers they meet each day, so if that is the position, at least the drivers can give feedback.  Perhaps consideration could be given to some type of access on the current services for people to be part of the consultation through a mechanism for that on the bus, such as a survey that could be filled out.  As Deputy Murphy said, the questions are important.  One can ask questions to get the answers one wants so there must be ample opportunity to give an opinion and not just answer questions.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Murphy said there appeared to be a contrast between our submission and that of the NBRU.  There is a contrast in certain respects.  I will not say we do not want investment in public services because we do.  I will not say that we do not want to remove congestion and improve the environment and climate through changes in the city centre because we do.  I will not say that we do not want better fare systems and interconnectivity of transport because we do.  However, it must be done right.  That is the reason our main issue is the consultation, the protection of people depending on the services and the protection of the workers delivering them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#GG00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531911600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Mr. Gaston said he wanted the new inner orbital O service to be a jump on, jump off service.  We had that back in the 1990s.  It was the hail and ride yellow and red imp buses.  The slogan on the back of those buses referred to Dublin Bus serving the entire community.  We are now going to do the same thing except this time we will not be serving the entire community.  I will outline what is indicative of the plan.  There is a garage in north County Dublin at Harristown which provides many bus services at present.  Under this proposal, not one bus will serve it so bus drivers will have to use their car to get to the bus garage.  There are many similar issues throughout the plan.  It has not been thought through.  Howth is a big tourist attraction but the direct bus, the No. 31, will be taken away.  It will be local services.  In the case of the national children's hospital, a direct bus will be gone from many of the estates.  I could spend an hour going through the plan and dealing with little details such as those.  I do not believe proper thought has been put into it and the impact it will have on people.<\/p> <p>  I am a bus driver and have been driving for 20 years.  I drive the No. 1 bus.

It is still on the back of the double deckers in Dublin.  I remember the imp buses very well too.  The witness referred to the national children's hospital - I live in its shadow - and how it will be impacted.  There are stops on the Luas red line in Rialto and in St. James's Hospital.  The hospital is packed with cars probably because the buses have been removed from it.  They are being removed further with this and it is ignoring the interconnectivity with the Luas in the city.<\/p> <p>  There are also to be interconnective hubs and it refers to places such as Blanchardstown and Liffey Valley, which are busy areas.  I expect it will try, as did the national children's hospital, to use the Red Cow for staff who had to travel when a car park was removed.  Every morning we are told by the \"Morning Ireland\" programme to avoid the Red Cow, so how will that work given the overflow and chaos that occur there?<\/p><p>I am delighted that the representatives continually refer to a public service and a social service within that.  This is very important.  It is a disgrace and it is unacceptable to not have this infrastructure designed in from the get-go and that persons with a disability, such as the guy mentioned by the bus driver, are unable to access the bus.  As an able-bodied person I can jump on and off the bus but a person with a disability will find it absolutely impossible.  This could lead to more isolation.  There are swathes of areas, especially in the inner city and in housing estates, where bus stops have been removed.  We are told that the distance from a housing estate to the nearest bus stop is now nearly 400 m.  An older person or a person in a wheelchair must now travel nearly half a kilometre to access public transport, never mind trying to get onto it if a person is disabled.  It is an awful long way to go and people will just stay in their homes.<\/p><p> I am not a permanent member of this committee.  I am standing in for Deputy Munster but a suggestion for this committee would be to do a press release with all of this information.  The most important thing to do is not let the NTA away with the short timeframe allowed for the public consultation.  We attended the meeting at the Royal Hibernian Academy and the deadline was extended to 28 September.  It is completely unacceptable.  Dublin is empty in August and we need to ask for it to be extended.  A press release might be a way to give the NTA a bit more of jolt into respecting that.<\/p><p> By 2040, the population of Dublin will be almost 2 million.  We need to do something about our transport, 69% of which is private car use, compared with 4% public transport.  Compare and contrast this with other European countries.  The population of Dublin will reach 2 million and we have to plan for a lot more capacity.  As a councillor, I was on the Dublin Bus forum for a long time.  The threat of cherry-picking of routes for privatisation was an issue that came up constantly.  I am not sure of the figures but the people are putting billions of euro into our public services and by God, it will not be privatised.  It is ours.  It is a gem and we need to make it more accessible to everybody and get this city moving.<\/p><p> I thank the representatives for their presentation because it sheds a better light on it.

I am concerned that is has been presented as a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.  Jarrett Walker has already said that anything more than a 15% change to this plan would render it unworkable.  They are trying to contain the potential changes.<\/p><p>That the plan tries to push so many people onto the seven spines rings alarm bells with me.  In September we will have to push the whole question of the legislation around the public service obligation, PSO, and what it means.  If a person, for example, wanted to use the 123 bus to get to St. James's Hospital from Walkinstown, and if the route changes and goes in a different direction of Suir Road Bridge, the person is then forced into one of these proposed spines.  This prepares the ground for a very lucrative route for a private company in 2019 or 2020.  I am very suspicious of the trajectory of the NTA and what it pushes, no matter what it says.  This is the way of the world now and what it wants.  Big business wants access to our public services.  This is what I am wary about but I feel the plan is a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.<\/p><p>We will get into the public consultation aspect of this and there will be public meetings informing people about what is going on.  If an older lady from Galtymore Road cannot access a bus until she goes out onto the Crumlin Road to get a bus on one of the spines, it will cause huge problems for people with issues around disability access and for people with younger children.  These issues were raised nearly five years ago also and we managed to keep those inner estate routes in the estates to a certain degree.  We must raise these points again.  It raises a suspicion in my mind around how genuine is the consultation process.<\/p><p>I live beside the Blackhorse Luas stop.  It is packed in the mornings and one needs to cram to get onto the Luas.  If there are any difficulties or stoppages on the Luas line it always stops at the Blackhorse stop and all the passengers must get off the Luas to go to the bus stop on the nearby Tyrconnell Road.  One can see up to 200 people getting off the Luas and trying to wait for a bus.  They must wait for a 63 bus, which comes every hour.  The proposed plan would be a disaster from that perspective.<\/p><p>I question the genuineness of the consultation, whether or not it is a <i>fait accompli <\/i>and if the NTA is going to just railroad the plan through.  We had this experience with the 19a route in Inchicore.  The NTA wanted to change this route and get rid of it.  We launched a big campaign in the community and a lot of people got involved with petitions.  The concession we got was an extra three 68 buses in the mornings to cater for the schoolchildren going to Synge Street and now those extra buses have been taken out of the estate.  There are huge questions around this.<\/p><p>We have done a lot of our own work in the area and have linked in with the unions, that is, the NBRU and SIPTU, as well as with drivers in this regard.  This consultation has to go beyond September.  It has to go into October and there must be serious negotiations and discussion with Age Action, with the student unions and other groups that have an interest in getting from A to B and to and, for example, from UCD on the 17 and 18 routes.  The plan is a fundamental game changer for Dublin Bus but it has taken &quot;public&quot; out of public transport.  It moves the public transport away from the hearts of the communities.  I understand that Ireland subvents the least amount of money to public transport of any country in Europe.  It needs investment, absolutely, but this is a sneaky way to try it.  The plan is, as Deputy Catherine Murphy has described it, a Trojan Horse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#HH00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531911600,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I will start where Deputy Joan Collins finished.  The plan is, of course, the biggest change.  In 2009 we had a big change with a major network review when Dublin Bus went from 180 routes down to 111 routes.  This is approximately the current number of routes.  The biggest change before that was, dare I say it, the disappearance of the tram.  Again, there is a connection.  In my submission I referred to us pushing Dublin out.  We can talk about successive Governments, but Dublin has been pushed out and unfortunately an urban sprawl has been created.  Linked to that, a situation has been created where it is commonplace for frequent services to be pulled out.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Joan Collins spoke of the plan being a <i>fait accompli. <\/i>I put it to every elected representative - and I meet lots of them, be they in this room or outside - that it is only a  <i>fait accompli <\/i>if people believe it has become a <i>fait accompli <\/i>.  I do not want to stretch too far outside the subject matter, but people power has worked before in this State on lots of occasions and for different reasons.  It is up to people themselves and community leaders.  Jarrett Walker said the plan should be substantial enough to win over elected officials and other community leaders.  I suggest that Jarrett Walker does not know the Irish political system and how engaged people are with politics.  I hope I am right when I say this.<br\/><br\/>The members' suspicions about the PSO have come through every contribution so far.  There are major suspicions in this regard.

Conversations can take place and hopefully we will contribute in a major way.<br\/><br\/>Senator Devine spoke of cherry-picking, which also comes through in every contribution today.<\/p><p>Sometimes people do not believe me when I say that there is no compulsion on the NTA to privatise, franchise or tender.  There is no law in Europe that says it has to do it.  Despite what people might say, there is no EU directive or regulation that says the Irish Government or any of the 28 EU member states must privatise or franchise any service.  The Irish Government and Irish legislation dictate that the NTA has a choice.  Senator Devine is right that this amounts to cherry-picking of a public service.<br\/><br\/>The Luas red line is packed at peak times.  Taking out bus services and putting them up against the red line in the hope that the bus services will take people will not work.  Deputy Joan Collins mentioned working-class areas, which I mentioned in my submission also.  The 63 bus only comes once an hour now.  She mentioned Crumlin, Drimnagh and Inchicore and services are being stripped out of all those areas, as they are in Rialto.  The public representatives and ourselves will have to ensure that this is not a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.

The Senator is right that we have a fear about the cherry-picking of services.  If the example of Bus &Eacute;ireann and the services it has been providing for a long number of years is considered, its obligation to provide services whereby they must stop in the smaller towns and villages, which the private operators do not service was partially to blame for the near-extinction of Bus &Eacute;ireann in the past 18 months.  The company simply could not compete with the private operators and we do not want to see Dublin Bus being used as a last provider for public and social obligations.  That cannot happen and the NTA need to accept that.  The NTA come in here talking about what it must do on tendering.  At times the NTA states quite clearly that it can, if it chooses, fully award a direct model to whoever it chooses and that needs to happen.  The one thing the NTA cannot get away from is that under legislation, it is tasked with providing services which are uneconomical but socially viable.  That needs to continue and that is what the consultation is about.<\/p> <p>  I read the article to which Deputy Joan Collins referred on Jarrett Walker's comments to the effect that were more than a 10% to 15% change made in respect of the public consultation, then the system would collapse.  If the proposed system is not suitable, however, then it should collapse and if the system that is needed for Dublin and its citizens is not something with which Jarrett Walker can assist, then we need to get the right people.  Figures of up to &euro;2.5 billion have been touted for investment and that needs to be kept in place for public transport.  We have an opportunity, the population of Dublin is growing, there is urban sprawl and the city is going outwards.  These people have to be serviced and have a right to be serviced, whether they are commuting to work, seeking community access or seeking access to health services or education.  We need to grow and expand the network in the right way and in consultation with the people who need the service.<\/p> <p>  On disability, I cannot say for sure if it is still there but at one stage, Dublin Bus had disability assistants who were employed and placed to help people where there was recognised need for assistance.

Some of our fears were raised by Deputies in isolation from us, despite what people may think.  There are fears about commercialisation and the withdrawal of services.  I can tell the Deputy about Dublin South-West, for example.  As I had prepared a description for Deputy Rock in case he had been present as well, it is not exclusive to Deputy Lahart.  In Blessington, Ballymore Eustace and Ballyknockan, there will be no direct service under this proposal over route 244E.  I am aware that Deputy Lahart has done some study himself on this proposal and I have been following what he is saying online.  Killinarden Heights would have no direct bus to the city but only the local bus route 240.  Routes 65B and 77A would be gone.  Tymon North, Seskin View and Tymon Castle would have no direct bus to the city.  I know some of these routes myself.<\/p> <p>  There will be no direct bus from Killininny Road to the city.  Route 65B would be gone, with only the 58 orbital to D&uacute;n Laoghaire left.  Ballyboden and Whitechurch would have no direct bus to the city and route 61 would be gone.  Route 69 would be gone in Rathcoole and Saggart with no direct bus to the city, only the 242 local service.  Ballinteer is interesting in terms of the 16 bus that is used by people going to the airport from inside of those housing estates.  They will have no direct access to the city any more and only a local route.  The 16 is one of the iconic routes.  Access to Ringsend Road and Pearse Street for Tallaght buses would be gone.  Lots of customers use the 77A, the 56A and the 15B from Dublin South-West to access Google, Amazon, Facebook and construction jobs and those routes would be gone at the stroke of a pen.  There would be no direct access from Killinarden to Citywest shopping centre, which is currently serviced by routes 77A and 65B.  The main bus route from Templeogue is now an airport bus, which is good for connectivity but without the 15B, 65B and 65 bus routes, there would be capacity issues as are currently experienced on the 16 bus at present and this would impact railway commuters.<\/p><p>There is no direct rail link to the children's hospital.  The people of Tallaght have a children's hospital on their doorstep, but they have no connectivity to access the children's hospital at St. James's Hospital.  There will be no direct bus link to the city from Monastery Road and a new local service, the 255 bus, will replace the 68 and 69 buses.  That is only one constituency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#JJ01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I appreciate the work the NBRU has done on this issue.  In spite of what Mr. O'Leary said about public representatives, I am the only public representative from my constituency present.  Let us consider some of the positives before going into the negative because I agree with much of what Mr O'Leary said.  When we enter the public consultation process, people will need to see both sides.  I will address some of the points made by him.<\/p> <p>  I think Mr O'Leary took me up wrong when I said the 15 bus route would be the A spine.  If I catch it from Knocklyon and get off on Rathgar Road and all of the buses on the route carrt an \"A\", I will know that they will all take me to approximately the same destination.  We do not need BusConnects to do that, but it has come up with that suggestion which is positive.  The 15 bus service was rerouted because of the Luas cross-city line.  The closest I can get to Leinster House is the Bleeding Horse.  With the proposed introduction of the 90 minute Leap card, I could get off at the Bleeding Horse and get on board the Luas to Dawson Street.  There was not that connection before this plan. <\/p> <p>  I do not see how this proposal can work within the existing infrastructure.  If the bus corridors are not built outwards and there are regular bus spines, a place like Terenure village will clog up.  The cart cannot be put before the horse.  Work on infrastructure has to be undertaken.  There may be alternatives such as the Stillorgan dual carriageway, on which there are dedicated bus corridors all the way into town which can carry more buses. <\/p> <p>  There is, undoubtedly, a penalty for connecting.  The stereotypical senior citizen boards the 15A bus at Limekiln to travel directly to the city.  He or she will have to connect at Crumlin to travel to the city.  They might be first on the bus at Limekiln and last off at Crumlin.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, states it does not matter whether he or she is first on or last off as there will be multiple buses every five minutes.  There is, however, something undemocratic about it.  <\/p> <p>  One of the weaknesses in the Jarrett Walker design is that he describes it as a metro style system, but on a metro or a Luas tram many doors open at one time and there is equality of access.  Even if the bendy buses are introduced, there will be a maximum of two doors opening at any one time and on regular double-decker buses only one door opens.  That issue has to examined.  <\/p> <p>  My party has proposed a transport police force for public transport.  That issue needs to be factored into the plan.  Deputy John Curran raised it in the case of the service from Rathcoole into the city.  The Rathcoole bus service runs on the hour to the Red Cow from where there is a bus every five minutes.  It is great going if someone is travelling into the city, but in coming out where will a person wait if they miss the hourly bus service?  Some of the interchanges will have to have accommodation, perhaps even somewhere someone can get a cup of coffee but certainly somewhere someone will be secure and have shelter.  Even in the shopping centres such as Blanchardstown and The Square, the existing infrastructure is not adequate.  If people are expected to connect, they need to be able to shelter, particularly single people at night who need to know they are secure and in a lit up place.  That is definitely a factor.  There is a Dublin Bus&ndash;Luas forum that meets once a month and in which I acknowledge its role. <\/p> <p>  Everybody has said the public consultation process is critical.  I trust Dublin Bus to run it.  It has run consultation processes in my time as a public representative and I trust it.  In a constituency such as mine where there are several centres, Tallaght, Templeogue, Knocklyon, Rathfarnham and Greenhills, two venues will not be enough.  It will have to sweat the maximum out of the number of venues.  The NTA is to write to Deputies seeking suggestions for the location of venues.  <\/p> <p>  From places on the periphery such as Ballymoreustace and Blessington, people will not have a direct route to the city.  They will connect at Tallaght.  We need to hear what they have to say about this.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien talks about everything connecting into Swords and has said there are a couple of direct routes into the city.  That opens the opportunity for a private operator.  My party is committed to public transport and Dublin Bus, on which we could not have been clearer, particularly in the past six or eight months.  I am a strong champion and supporter of Dublin Bus.  It is a terrific company which has turned itself around in the past ten years.  I hope the delegates are reassured that there are legislators here who, if necessary, will curb the powers and enthusiasm of the NTA for privatising, contracting and franchising out routes. <\/p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne was concerned about the direct services from Dunboyne through Ongar.  That issue was addressed recently.  It was also mentioned by Senator John Dolan, which is why I mentioned the Dublin Bus forum.  I know about the bus services provided for the summer camps in Killinarden and Jobstown.  Dublin Bus provides outreach services for the community, even in the event of incidents.  Its staff go into schools to lets kids or teenagers who are causing problems know that their mothers and grandparents will suffer if a bus has to be withdrawn.<\/p> <p>  Senator John Dolan has made the point that the livery was designed after consultation with people with disabilities and special needs, particularly young people with a visual impairment, in order that it could not be missed.  He specifically adverted to the training provided for people with disabilities on how to access a bus.<\/p> <p>  I disagree with Mr. O'Leary on decongesting.  He said it could lead to more congestion, but it will not if it is built outwards right.  The basic principle of BusConnects is to encourage people to leave their cars behind and opt to  use public transport.  The only way to do this - it is the chicken and the egg - is for the infrastructure to provide a seamless and unobstructed route.  The second way is to provide enough buses to persuade and give people confidence that if they choose to leave the car at home, there will be a regular bus service, that it will be efficient and that it will take them on an unimpeded and I hope segregated route to their destination.  One cannot work without the other, but this does not address the mum or dad who may have a school run to make in the morning to different schools.  The bus service does not offer that flexibility. <\/p> <p>  The NBRU has given us a lot of food for thought and done a lot of work on this issue.<\/p><p>However, there is not one positive thing about it.  Mr. O'Leary is asking me, as a public representative, to take this on board.  I will do so and it will influence the kind of questions I ask.  I ask the NBRU to leave the National Transport Authority, NTA, out of it and look at some of the ideas in the report by Jarrett Walker &amp;amp; Associates and see that there are some positives and wins in this.  However, there are issues that need to be addressed and it is our job to ensure the public is informed about what is being lost.  We must point out that this cannot happen and that tweaks are necessary.  The NBRU is an influential voice and stakeholder in the matter, and reading Mr. O'Leary's presentation it is clear that this is a no-no.  The Services Industrial Professional And Technical Union, SIPTU, is saying it embraces the concept.  I embrace the concept, but I take on board Mr. O'Leary's point that this must be tweaked.  I have to listen to what I am told by the men and women who use the bus service every day.  Is there nothing in this report that the NBRU would recommend to the public?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#KK00200","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531911600,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I could say easily answer \"No\" to the Deputy's last question.  However, that would be unfair given the effort he made to provide context for the question.  The NBRU disagrees fundamentally with the concept of BusConnects, where people have to get off one bus and get on another.  Furthermore, the public consultation should be named for what it is.  We have to get down and dirty on this.  If I go to Ballymore Eustace and, without saying who I am, tell a person who uses the bus that the service is to be reduced significantly and that he or she will have to get a bus to Tallaght and get off again, I know what answer I will get when I ask what that person thinks of that.  If I ask someone else what he or she thinks of a plan to increase the frequency of a service from every ten minutes to every five minutes, I will be told it is fantastic.  We can carry out the public consultation from here.<\/p> <p>  Regardless of whether Deputy Lahart agrees with me on addressing congestion, many submissions have been made by the NBRU, colleagues and other organisations to the NTA and the Department over several decades.  One of the central planks of the submissions about a reduction in congestion was to build park and ride hubs, north, south, east and west in this city.  Some day, someone will listen to me and others who have made similar submissions.  People have to get into bus rapid transit, BRT, and use it.  I will not mention the metro plan because I do not know how many iterations of it we have seen at this stage.  I have no doubt we will see another such plan in my lifetime.  BRT would reduce congestion.  We have done significant work on this already, but we have to do much more work on it.  We will not do this for the sake of it.  The Deputy and I are both in the business of representing people.  I represent those working in the industry and those who are using the industry.  My colleagues here do the same thing, under different banners.  <\/p> <p>  This committee has to ask what the problem is with the current system.  Our submission was not entirely negative.  Senator Devine picked up on one line in our submission which suggested that we put the new orbital routes on top of the existing service.  What is wrong with the current service?  The bus lanes do not go far enough.  Those that are built are blocked by traffic and no sanctions are applied to those who block them.  Infrastructure has to be created to facilitate the current network.  I do not understand the current approach and I certainly do not accept it.  The NTA has decided that it will change the current network because it is not working.  Can it show me what is not working?  The infrastructure is not working but that is a different debate altogether.  The services that exist, their frequency, and the fact that they go to housing estates in working class areas and peripheral towns such as Ballymore Eustace, Balbriggan, Greystones, Skerries and Malahide, are all to be welcomed.  Why are those places different from a place that has a regular service every five minutes?  People are not different because of where they live.<\/p> <p>  If the mistakes caused by decades of bad planning are to be corrected, houses cannot be knocked down in order to build them higher, even though that is what should be done in Dublin, and that is something that Dublin will have to grapple with at some stage.  Jarrett Walker stated that if 15% of this plan is changed, it will all unravel.  My colleague, Mr. John Murphy, picked up on that point.  How dare Mr. Walker come to our city and tell us that if we do not agree with his plan, or remove 15% of it, everything will collapse?  What gives him the right to say that?  That is wrong and it is also wrong that we are beholden to people who have no responsibility, for example, the National Transport Authority.  I am sorry for getting emotional about this, but I represent people working in the industry and people who use the industry.  How dare we tell an old person or a person in a wheelchair to get off a bus and cross the road to get another?  Who are we to do that?  <\/p> <p>  I am sorry for using Deputy Lahart as a battering ram, but I fundamentally disagree with BusConnects because it is based on people being discommoded.  That is not what public service is about.  It is about helping people get from A to B conveniently, not running and racing around.  Dublin is not London or Tokyo.  Someone mentioned white gloves.  People have to work and commute, but we should not insist that they get off the bus in all kinds of weather.  The reference to building facilities is a joke.  Bus drivers are here.  Bottles are being thrown into bins full of you-know-what.  There is nothing wrong with the current network; the problem is the infrastructure.  We should fix that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#LL00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I share much Mr. O'Leary's passion about this issue.

I now have tell people at public meetings that there is no silver bullet now and no outer ring road that could be built.  Even if it could be built, it would take 20 years to deliver it.  We need a solution that is deliverable in a much faster timeframe, and public transport is the only way to do that.  Mr. O'Leary and I have the same view on that issue and I am a strong advocate for public transport.

We did not come here today to get into that detail.  The NTA will not accept an argument just because SIPTU makes it.  We have tried that tack numerous times in the past when engaging with the authority.  When we meet a roadblock, the NTA hides behind legislation, obligations and the Department.  The NTA will not engage with us on specific routes and how they will be serviced or how social factors will be addressed to ensure people can use the bus service to meet their needs.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Jarret Walker stated that if 15% of the plan is removed, the entire plan will collapse.  If BusConnects needs to collapse, it should collapse.  The money needs to be provided and we cannot accept the NTA deciding to take the ball and go home because the rest of the players would not accept its game.  These are the conversations we need to have.  We are in favour of looking at the whole network and properly funding and protecting public transport.<\/p> <p>  As I said to the Chair earlier, I got no comfort from the NTA's view on privatisation or franchising out.  I do not want to see a scenario where Bus &Eacute;ireann was driven into the ground by some of the decisions and the policy made by the NTA.  We are trying to get the company back on an even keel and the position is improving but there is a lot of work to be done.  That should not happen to Dublin Bus, which is an iconic company.  I would put it on a par with the red buses of London.  People have become used to Dublin Bus serving communities.  Its services have links in the communities and need to be protected.  We need, however, to have the conversation on investment and how best to use that.<\/p> <p>  People with disabilities, pensioners and others who depend on bus services will not like the idea of having to reconnect from one bus or mode of transport to another.  Many others, including young people in the workforce, colleges and education, will not have an issue with this.  The social aspect needs to be protected and built on but we should not be afraid of the conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018071800002#MM01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1531911600,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I am very much aware of the issue of discommoding commuters on existing routes.

A few months ago, we heard of plans to take people's gardens.  If too many things are thrown into the mix - I will be generous and say I am not arguing that this is being done deliberately to confuse people - something will give somewhere.  It goes back to the fundamental point that we are not protecting the infrastructure we have, namely, bus lanes, and we are not building extra infrastructure, namely, more bus lanes and park-and-ride hubs.  The answer as far as I am concerned is to get people out of their cars and into public transport and to do that we need to build infrastructure.<\/p> <p> If the whole plan is to come together, the investment required will amount to roughly &euro;2 billion.  We could build an awful lot of park-and-ride facilities and do a considerable amount of work on bus rapid transit, BRT, with &euro;2 billion.
