They also involve a range of different stakeholders and are influenced by a number of different factors such as those which impact on the overall value of pension funds.\u00a0There is also a historical context to the position of these schemes many of which have faced financial challenges over many years.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to take the opportunity to briefly outline the background to some of these\u00a0 issues before highlighting the key factors to be considered in the development of proposals for discretionary pension increases as well as the process by which these proposals are brought forward.<\/p>  <p>  As you now, many of the pension schemes for the Commercial Semi State Bodies experienced a deterioration of their overall financial position during the financial crisis. Difficult measures had to be taken in some cases to ensure their survival. A large number of the schemes are still in deficit.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This means that along with relevant policy considerations, the extent of precedents and consistency with scheme rules, the overall funding position of the relevant pension scheme is one of the most important\u00a0factors in considering any pension scheme proposals. Any measure which has the potential to negatively impact on the financial health of a pension scheme must be carefully evaluated.<\/p>  <p>  This also applies to proposals for discretionary pension increases. Many of the pension schemes in the Commercial Semi State sector have not had pension increases for this reason. As a result, the understandable desire of retired scheme members for pension increases must be balanced with the overall protection of\u00a0pension benefits for all members of a pension scheme and with the long term survival of schemes.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, if pension increases are not affordable, it can lead to a failure to meet the statutory funding standard, which in turn can\u00a0trigger the need for more difficult measures to restore the financial position of a pension scheme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the key stakeholders involved in considering these proposals, the parent Department along with the\u00a0relevant scheme trustees\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0the scheme employer all\u00a0play an important role in ensuring that the full\u00a0impact of pension increases on the sustainability of the pension funds is carefully assessed along with all the other policy considerations before proposals are finalised<\/p>  <p>  The normal process by which these requests are advanced involves the parent Government Department under whose aegis responsibility for individual Commercial Semi State Bodies falls considering and approving any changes to pension scheme rules or\u00a0discretionary benefits.<\/p>  <p>  My Department then considers these proposals when a fully\u00a0completed set of business case and technical assessment documents are submitted in line with the standard governance requirements. This includes the advice from NewEra. This process applies to all proposals including the RT&Eacute; pension scheme before they are brought forward for my consent.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In relation to\u00a0your other parliamentary question, the full set of documents have not yet been received by this Department in relation to both the RT&Eacute; scheme and the Dublin Port scheme proposals.

Under the European Union Procurement Directives, cost may be calculated using Life-Cycle Costing (LCC), which takes into account costs at end-of-life, such as those associated with disposal, as well as operational costs, such as energy use, and purchase price and associated costs, such as delivery. LCC may also include the cost of externalities, such as greenhouse gas emissions. The Directives allow inclusion of criteria relating to any stage in a product&rsquo;s life-cycle, including production and end-of-life. Such criteria must be defined, quantifiable, verifiable, and measurable.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, my Department published Circular 20\/2019: Promoting the use of Environmental and Social Considerations in Public Procurement. This instructs Departments to consider using green criteria in their procurements. In 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published updated and expanded &lsquo;Green Public Procurement &ndash; Guidance for the Public Sector&rsquo;, accompanied by 10 sets of green criteria. These are mostly modelled on EU Green Public Procurement (GPP) criteria, which were developed using Life-Cycle Assessment i.e. considering environmental impacts throughout the entire life-cycle. The EPA, Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC), and the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) have all actively promoted use of these criteria and the guidance. The guidance includes a section specifically on GPP and the Circular Economy.

Cork.<\/p>  <p>  The gardens at Annes Grove are of international significance, primarily because of their famous plant collection which contains an outstanding range of rhododendron species. The Grove Annesley family nurtured and developed a unique landscape over multiple generations until they generously donated the Estate to the Irish people in 2015. The majority of the gardens today dates from the early 20th century which was developed under the stewardship of Richard Grove Annesley. He was an avid plant collector and supported several plant hunting expeditions during the first half of the 20th   century, notably the expeditions of Frank Kingdon-Ward. The great history of plant collecting in Ireland across the centuries is to some extent, not widely understood or appreciated and so the renovation of Annes Grove House and Gardens offers a unique opportunity to explore this aspect of our great historic gardens which are part of our national heritage.<\/p>  <p>  Annes Grove is also an exemplar Robinsonian-style garden in Ireland, situated adjacent to the river Awbeg. The Robinsonian method was developed by William Robinson, from Co. Waterford, who championed a naturalistic approach to garden design and promoted the concept of the &lsquo;wild garden&rsquo;. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2015, The Office of Public Works (OPW) has managed and conserved the Estate on behalf of the people of Ireland. The Estate consists of 190 acres, encompassing the Demesne, gardens, parkland, 18th century house and outbuildings. This first phase of capital works is coming to a close in quarter one of 2022, with a total investment of &euro;2,162,935.19 to date, by the OPW. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Phase 1 identified areas for immediate attention, such as, commencing the restoration of the gardens, and of outbuildings in very poor repair and in danger of subsequent collapse. Throughout 2016 &ndash; 2019, good progress was made on repairing\/rebuilding estate walls, roads, paths and car parking facilities. Windows and plasterwork were restored to the front of the house and new roofs installed on some of the 18th century farm yard buildings. Many overgrown areas were cut back and replanting works commenced.<\/p>  <p>  I understand from my officials that, in 2019, the OPW commissioned a Conservation Management Plan (CMP) of Annes Grove House &amp;amp; Gardens to describe the history and significance of the site, identify issues and threats and to outline conservation and design strategies. This document will inform future decisions regarding the management of the Estate. From 2020 &ndash; 2021, the OPW completed emergency repair works to the roof of the stable buildings in the north courtyard to prevent them from collapse and provided urgent repairs to paths, steps and ancillary works to the gardens to facilitate a 2022 opening to the public. <\/p>  <p>  The OPW is currently scoping and planning a second phase of capital works for Annes Grove. In 2019, the OPW was successful in seeking funding under the Rural Regeneration Development Fund and was awarded &euro;375,000 in grant funding to appoint an Integrated Design Team, led by Howley Hayes Cooney Architects to bring this Phase 2 scheme to planning application stage in 2022. This planning application will seek permission for the refurbishment and development of visitor facilities on site, such as, ticket office, caf&eacute;, exhibition spaces, and conservation of the main House for interpretation of the history of Annes Grove and its unique plant collection. <\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that Annes Grove Gardens will become a strong destination for visitors, particularly international visitors with an interest in gardens. With its close proximity to Doneraile Court and Estate which is just ten kilometres away, the OPW plans to market both heritage attractions as a package of designed landscapes and gardens in north Cork, managed and operated by the OPW.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW is committed to working with local stakeholders to ensure the re-opening of Annes Grove provides a sustainable, economic and social benefit to the local community, and that it will support tourism in the local area. My officials are working closely with the Grove Annesley family who have preserved and cared for the Estate throughout the generations, Ballyhoura Development, Avondhu Blackwater Partnership, Cork County Council and members of the public and local community interest groups to ensure the future success of Annes Grove as a new visitor destination in North Cork.<\/p>  <p>  The scale of ambition for Annes Grove is substantial and is subject to available funding and resources. As a result, the OPW plans to open the site on a phased basis, beginning in 2022 with an initial offering where visitors access the extensive garden and riverside walks and enjoy a catering offering on site. The gardens will be accessible by paid guided tour only which will concentrate on the gardens and the internationally significant plant collection. Visitors will also have opportunities to explore some areas of the restored courtyards. <\/p>  <p>  I look forward to joining the Deputy and other local stakeholders in mid-late April of this year as we celebrate the opening of Annes Grove gardens to the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100071#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Management","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100071#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[11044\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100071#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the steps being taken to alleviate constrictions to the flow of water in the Shannon Callows between Athlone and Meelick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[11045\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100071#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the progress to date on the &euro;7 million investment in the removal of the pinch points on the River Shannon which will address the scale of summer flooding in the Shannon Callows; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":95,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 100 together.<\/p>  <p>The Government has noted the study by the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group that supports a programme of strategic maintenance to help mitigate flooding along the River Shannon and a further study on the removal of a series of constrictions or &lsquo;pinch points&rsquo; through the Shannon Callows that can help to delay flooding in\u00a0the area.

137 and 138 together.<\/p><p>The employment permits system is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and\/or labour shortages, in circumstances where there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one. \u00a0The system is managed through the use of lists designating highly skilled and ineligible occupations.<\/p><p>Since March 2020, the Department has implemented Covid-19 contingency arrangements moving employment permit operations seamlessly to a totally remote working environment.\u00a0 Indeed, Ireland was one of the few countries which managed to keep their employment permit system fully operational throughout the crisis.<\/p><p>From the outset of the crisis, in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to, and to assist with, the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all medical employment permits are expedited with immediate effect.<\/p><p>The Department has experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year, impacting on processing times.\u00a0 From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Department issued 16,275 employment permits in 2021, and processed a total of 17,968 applications which represents a significant volume of activity.\u00a0 The impact of this has resulted in a significant backlog, which has increased from 1,000 in April 2021 to approximately c. 10,500 at the end of January 2022.<\/p><p>In addition, the extension of categories of employment permits, following the latest Review of the Occupational Lists, that I announced at the end of October has increased the availability of employment permits for these roles.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also because of the HSE cyber-attack,\u00a0when employment permit applications associated with the July Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other nonstandard methods.\u00a0<\/p><p>Cognisant of the significant impact the pandemic has had on the Hospitality Sector, when the sector reopened in July, the Department committed to prioritise the processing of chef employment permit applications received in the processing queue at that time, in order to support the sector.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Department recognises the impact of current delays on the processing times for work permits has for businesses and their workers and has developed a plan of action to bring down the processing backlog built up over the pandemic.\u00a0 The plan includes both additional staffing and systemic changes.\u00a0 Staffing actions include recruitment of additional permanent and temporary staff.\u00a0 In late November 2021 approval was granted to increase our permanent processing capacity by 69% and to increase overall capacity to 125% when temporary staff are included.\u00a0 On 2 February 2022 further additional approval was granted to increase permanent processing capacity by 125% and increase overall capacity by 225% from the original early base in early November. \u00a0When all recruitment is completed, the team will be three and a quarter times the size it was in early November.\u00a0 There has also been an increase in overtime and the temporary reassignment of staff from other areas of the Department with relevant skills.<\/p><p>As the plan of action is fully implemented it is expected that there will be positive progress achieved in reducing the backlog by the end of Q1 with it substantially reduced by the end of Q2 2022.\u00a0 This should see a return to more normal processing timeframes.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In addition, further systemic changes have also been introduced. \u00a0The Department has worked with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Justice to streamline and extend the time period for General Employment Permits (GEP) issued to doctors. \u00a0A new two-year multi-site GEP for Medical Doctors in Public hospitals and Public health facilities was introduced in respect of the January 2022 Doctors rotation. \u00a0This will result in significant benefits for applicants, as well as major efficiencies for the Employment Permits Section, by eliminating the necessity to apply for additional employment permits when moving to a different Public hospital or Public health facility within this two year period.<\/p><p>The Employment Permits Section of my Department are currently processing standard applications received on 4 October 2021 and Trusted Partner applications received on 11 November 2021.<\/p><p>Applicants can keep track of Employment Permit applications current processing dates at\u00a0<\/p><p>My Department engages directly with key stakeholders including the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, AmCham, IBEC, representative groups

Both I and my colleague, Minister of State Hildegarde Naughton will be participating in this event.<\/p><p><b>Public Transport Services<\/b><\/p><p>Transport is often seen as gender-neutral, providing benefit to all equally. However, a growing body of international research highlights that this is not the case. Women and men can have different needs, constraints, and expectations for using transport. In 2020, Transport Infrastructure Ireland carried out a women in travel survey &ndash; &lsquo;Travelling in a Woman&rsquo;s Shoes&rsquo;. The report sheds light on the disparities and realities that women face every day in order to understand the different mobility patterns and needs of both women and men.<\/p><p>Capturing gender information in transport surveys is key to understanding the needs of everyone and ensuring everyone feels safe while travelling. The department has utilised CSO and Census data to analyse the age and gender of public transport users in the development of its Sustainability Mobility Policy, which is due to be launched shortly.<\/p><p>Accessible public transport provides greater opportunities for all members of society, and especially those who may be in vulnerable situations - women, persons with disabilities, older people - to access essential services, such as employment, education, training, and health services.<\/p><p>My department delivers its commitments towards making public transport accessible for all via its Accessibility Work Programme which provides the framework for prioritising projects and programmes to progressively make public transport accessible.\u00a0 The department&rsquo;s Accessibility Consultative Committee (ACC) monitors progress on the Work Programme. The ACC gender balance is currently 75% female and 25% male.<\/p><p>In addition to the above, the Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility plan, which is a major national public transport initiative developed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) to increase public transport connectivity, particularly for people living outside the major cities and towns, will significantly increase both the number of routes and the frequency of existing services right across the country.\u00a0<\/p><p>In the context of services to rural areas, Local Link public transport services prioritise the reduction of social exclusion across all demographics. As well as combatting rural isolation, the vast majority of Local Link services are door-to-door community type services, which enable women in rural areas to access work, education and training services.<\/p><p><b>Cycling<\/b><\/p><p>In 2019, a Bike Life Dublin Metropolitan Area report was produced by Sustrans in partnership with the National Transport Authority (NTA) with gender being a key part of the data collected and presented in the report. There is evidence from the census that there is a significant gender-gap with regard to those cycling, with only one in every 250 girls cycling to school in the country.\u00a0 The Green Schools initiative funded by the NTA, working with teenage girls, has developed\u00a0#andshecyclescampaign\u00a0to look at addressing this issue.<\/p><p><b>Employment Equality in the Transport Sector<\/b><\/p><p>The need to increase the number of women employed in the transport sector is something that my department and its agencies are very aware of.

The Programme for Government 2020 outlined a commitment to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 (a 51% reduction over the decade) and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The need to make significant emissions reductions in the transport sector is fundamental to Ireland&rsquo;s policy around Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) and Motor Tax; the systems are designed to facilitate the uptake of EVs and to address the increasingly harmful environmental and public health effects of vehicle emissions. <\/p>  <p>  Vehicles registered after July 2008 are charged motor tax according to their emissions profile; the rate for EVs is &euro;120 and scales up to &euro;2400 for the most pollutant vehicles. The VRT system has been modified in recent Budgets to strengthen the environmental rationale of the regime, and is structured to provide a reduced rate for EVs of 7% of open-market selling price (OMSP), while vehicles falling into the highest emissions band are liable to a rate of 41%. The &euro;5,000 VRT relief for electric cars and vans were due to end on 31st December 2021 but was extended for two years in Finance Act 2021 to end in 2023. As the rate of VRT charged for EVs is already very low, many purchased in the next two years will pay no VRT at all. <\/p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019 I legislated for a CO2-based benefit-in-kind (BIK) regime for company cars from 1\/1\/2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars.<\/p>  <p>  The current &euro;50,000 BIK exemption was\u00a0extended in Finance Act 2021 with a tapering mechanism that represents a value for money consideration.\u00a0 This forms part of a broader series of generous measures including the preferential rates of VRT and Motor Tax, the VRT relief, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this Government continues to provide a generous set of supports to encourage the transition to low and zero emission vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100078#WRK02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":511,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100078#WRK02700"},{"type":"question","counter":512,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[10848\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100078#WRK02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the plans he has to bridge the disparity between the EU emissions trading scheme carbon price and the Irish carbon tax of &euro;41 set out in Budget 2023; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":513,"content":"<p>The EU ETS operates in all EU countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (EEA-EFTA states) and covers approximately 10,000 installations in the power sector and manufacturing industry, as well as airlines operating between these countries.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The EU ETS works on the 'cap and trade' principle.

As the Deputy will be aware, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Programme for Government recognises the need for a continued focus on insurance reform in order to tackle the issue of costs, including of public liability insurance. This focus is being driven by the Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, through the Action Plan for Insurance Reform.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key achievements of this whole-of-Government reform agenda has been the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines, which have significantly lowered award levels of many common injuries. The Guidelines should also help to bring more certainty to claimants and insurers, thereby reinforcing the benefits of using the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) to settle claims, which in turn should further reduce the costs of claims, particularly legal fees.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that the benefit of the suite of reforms being pursued, including the Guidelines, are passed onto customers. In this regard, Minister of State Fleming has held two\u00a0rounds of meetings with the CEOs of the major insurance providers in the Irish market, to discuss their response to the Action Plan, and we will both maintain a proactive engagement process throughout 2022 in order to hold industry to account in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Sub-Group has a number of key areas of focus for 2022, including actions relevant to public liability insurance, such as reforming the duty of care legislation. Rebalancing the duty of care should help to address the issue of slips, trips and falls, which are particularly prevalent in footfall-intensive areas, and should contribute to easing the insurance difficulties facing artists and performers. I will continue working with the Minister for Justice, who is leading on this action, and with colleagues across Government, in order to ensure that the overall implementation of the Action Plan leads to improved affordability of insurance for all sectors of the economy, including the arts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100078#WRK05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":543,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100079#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":544,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[11001\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100079#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the circumstances or regulations that allow other European Union member states (details supplied) to apply a reduced or super reduced VAT rate or VAT exemption to the supply of services by writers, composers and performing artists or to the royalties due to them as is permitted under section 9 of Annex III of Directive 2006\/112\/EC but prohibits this State from implementing a similar reduced or super reduced VAT rate or VAT exemption to the same services by writers, composers and performers here; if Ireland has the right to implement such a reduced or super reduced VAT rate or VAT exemption for the same services but chooses not to implement same; and if she discussed or will discuss with the Minister for Minister for Finance the way such options regarding VAT which are permissible under European Union law could support Irish artists and performers in Ireland.","asker":"1485","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":545,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[12023\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100079#WRL00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if Ireland has the right to implement a reduced or super reduced VAT rate or VAT exemption for the supply of services by writers, composers and performing artists or to the royalties due to them, but chooses not to implement same; and if he discussed or will discuss the way such options regarding VAT which are permissible under European Union law could support Irish artists and performers in Ireland.","asker":"1485","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":546,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 252 and 267 together.<\/p>  <p>I am advised by Revenue that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.

I am satisfied that that continues to be the position<\/p>  <p>  When section 865 was introduced, Revenue&rsquo;s general right to raise assessments or make enquiries in relation to taxpayer returns was also reduced to four years, although in certain circumstances, for example where fraud or neglect is suspected or in the context of the application of general anti-avoidance rules, Revenue's right to raise assessments or make enquiries is not time limited. \u00a0Previously, the general time limit on the raising of assessments by Revenue had been ten years. The provision of a four-year time limit for Revenue raising assessments and making enquiries and for taxpayers to claim a repayment of tax creates parity between both positions.\u00a0 An increase in one limit would have to be considered in the context of corresponding increases in other time limits in order to preserve that parity.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans at this time to amend the four-year limit in section 865.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100079#WRL02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates","counter":567,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100079#WRL02600"},{"type":"question","counter":568,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[11317\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100079#WRL02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will approve a primary medical certificate for a person (details supplied).","asker":"1596","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":569,"content":"<p>The Disabled Drivers &amp;amp; Disabled Passengers Scheme provides relief from VRT and VAT on the purchase and use of an adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons who also meet the below medical criteria, as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations.

This will build on reforms introduced over the last number of years, including Performance Budgeting and Equality Budgeting, which seek to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary framework and ensure that expenditure is managed in an efficient and effective way and are focussed on providing the evidence base to support the efficient and effective delivery of services that have a positive impact on people's lives.  This work is being further enhanced with the development of the Wellbeing Framework for Ireland that can inform efforts to improve the impact of public policy.<\/p>  <p>  The &lsquo;whole-of-year&rsquo; budgetary framework introduced means an ongoing consideration of budgetary priorities throughout the year, rather than focusing budget discussions only around Budget Day and seeks to support enhanced transparency and engagement in relation to budgetary issues. An important element of this is the publication at key points in the year of a range of documents including the Public Service Performance Report, the Summer Economic Statement, the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, and the Spending Review papers.   <\/p>  <p>  Given the significant level of resources to be provided under the medium term expenditure strategy, an ongoing and enhanced focus on value for money is required to ensure the benefit to the Exchequer and citizens. It is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister to manage expenditure within their respective allocations and careful monitoring of spending against profile and of progress on programmes and projects is required. My Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices regarding this.  Spending figures are compiled monthly and published in the Fiscal Monitor to report on spend against profile for all Ministerial Vote Groups and the main spending Departments will continue to report to Government quarterly in 2022 on spending within their areas.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has had a significant impact on the public finances. Some &euro;30 billion in direct expenditure supports has been made available across 2020 and 2021 with provision for up to &euro;7 billion in Covid-19 related spending under Budget 2022.  This funding allowed Government to introduce a wide range of support schemes and measures in response to the impacts of the pandemic and extend these as necessary. Budget 2022 was prepared in line with the fiscal framework set out in the Summer Economic Statement, which allows us to meet core objectives set out in the Programme for Government of investing in our economy and society to deliver improvements in infrastructure and public services, while reducing the deficit in order to underpin the sustainability of the public finances as we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100080#WRM02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":622,"content":"<p>Question No. 280 answered with Question No. 279.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":623,"content":"<p>Question No. 281 answered with Question No. 279.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":625,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[11619\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100080#WRM02900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the degree to which reforms throughout the public sector remain in place to ensure accountability, collective responsibility and good value for money; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":626,"content":"<p>The ongoing reform of\u00a0our public services has\u00a0been an integral\u00a0part\u00a0of my Department's function since\u00a0its establishment in 2011.\u00a0In view of the\u00a0significant and pervasive impacts experienced as a consequence of the Covid19 crisis, the Government's programme of reform and modernisation is particularly relevant\u00a0as we seek to return\u00a0our economy and society to full recovery.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with my Department's\u00a0Statement of Strategy,\u00a0officials are\u00a0currently\u00a0preparing the next phase of\u00a0public service reform\u00a0(to succeed Our Public Service 2020) which will incorporate priorities that were articulated in the recently published Public Service Innovation Strategy, Making Innovation Real in addition to aligning with ambitions set out in the programme of renewal for the Civil Service (CSR 2030 and its recently published three year Action Plan (CSR2024), as they\u00a0relate to the wider Public Service.

The OGP established the Strategic Procurement Advisory Group, bringing together officials from policy Departments with procurement practitioners to share best practice in relevant fields and to facilitate the process of incorporating social and environmental considerations into public procurement. <\/p>  <p>  Circular 20\/2019 requires public bodies to incorporate relevant green procurement measures into their planning and reporting cycles. Defined, quantifiable, verifiable, and measurable criteria for a number of products and services have been developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 2021, for the first time, government departments reported to the EPA on the proportion of their procurement spend in 2020 that was green. The EPA is analysing this information and will report later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The appropriateness of including environmental, economic and social considerations is a decision for each contracting authority and should be examined on a contract-by-contract basis. Each contract should be effectively managed and monitored by the individual contracting authority. The National Public Procurement Guidelines provide public bodies with steps to follow when managing contracts. In addition, the OGP has been promoting the use of strategic procurement to be applied in line with each organisation&rsquo;s own strategic goals and wider government objectives. Through its Information Note on the subject, the OGP has advocated for the completion of a corporate procurement plan (CPP). CPPs can assist contracting authorities to align their procurement functions with wider environmental, economic and social considerations. The OGP recommends that public bodies consider the incorporation of wider strategic considerations from the outset and have flagged the planning phase as the most critical stage. <\/p>  <p>  The OGP and its partner central purchasing bodies (CPBs) have been reviewing all central purchasing arrangements to identify opportunities to include green considerations. 165 central arrangements had been updated to include specific green criteria by the end of 2021. A further 41 arrangements will be updated to include green criteria this year and next.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, my officials present at a range of public sector events and seminars to promote green and social public procurement and will continue to promote utilising the State&rsquo;s purchasing power to deliver on our commitments to sustainable development and social inclusion. Environmental, economic and social procurement considerations are also discussed with business representative bodies at the SME Advisory Group meeting which is chaired by my colleague, Minister of State Ossian Smyth. Following consultation with SME representatives, the OGP developed a suite of policy measures aimed at assisting SMEs to access public procurement opportunities (implemented through Circular 10\/2014). <\/p>  <p>  Together with Minister Smyth and the OGP, I will continue to monitor and enhance the significant measures and strategies in place to support the inclusion of environmental, economic and social considerations in public procurement opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100080#WRM04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":647,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100080#WRM05100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":646,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100080#WRM05000"},{"type":"question","counter":647,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[10849\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100080#WRM05100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will provide an update on a matter (details supplied); when the next round of sports capital grant will be open for applications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":648,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of\u00a0sports\u00a0and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal\u00a0sports\u00a0equipment throughout the country.\u00a0 Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1.1 billion.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0Programme\u00a0for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising investment in disadvantaged areas.<\/p>  <p>  Details of all allocations made under the SCEP since 2002 are published at\u00a0gov.ie\/en\/collection\/471ed5-sports-capital-allocations\/.\u00a0Regarding the club referenced by the Deputy, my Department&rsquo;s records show that this club has not applied for nor received Sports Capital and Equipment Programme funding since the 2002 round. <\/p>  <p>  The latest set of allocations under the Programme\u00a0with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022.\u00a0All unsuccessful applicants will have the opportunity to appeal the Department's decision and full details of the appeals procedure will issue to these organisations shortly.

After a period of extensive research and consultation, the National Cultural Institutions purchased 422 works by 70 artists, of whom 45 were female. This addition of new works, 64% of which were by women, is an important step in establishing a greater gender balance in our National Collections.\u00a0 8 of our National Cultural Institutions are led by women.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding those outcomes in the area of sport, a fundamental aim of the Government&rsquo;s National Sports Policy 2018-2027 is to increase the levels of participation in sport and physical activity across the population, with a specific focus on less represented groups including women and girls and to eliminate the gender participation gap in sport entirely by 2027. \u00a0One of my priorities in 2021 was to eliminate the funding gap that existed in grant funding for male and female Gaelic players. \u00a0 This aim have been achieved, ensuring that we have now parity in terms of grant funding.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Last year, Sport Ireland announced an investment of &euro;4m in the Women in Sport Programme for the two years 2021 and 2022. 45 NGBs will receive funding under this investment. \u00a0 A further &euro;265,000 was invested last year in the Local Sports Partnerships under the Programme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A gender gap is beginning to re-emerge as COVID 19 restrictions are lifted.\u00a0 To this end, many National Governing Bodies are delivering Women in Sport and Dormant Accounts Funded Programmes this winter which will actively target populations that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic including females, economically and socially disadvantaged communities, people with a disability and ethnic minorities.<\/p>  <p>  Addressing women&rsquo;s participation at all levels in sport is an important element of the National Sports Policy.\u00a0 That includes women in leadership positions, such as board members of National Governing Bodies.\u00a0 The National Sports Policy had originally set a target of 30% of either gender on the Boards of funded bodies by 2027.\u00a0 In the new Action Plan for Sport 2021-2023, which was published in November 2021, we have set a revised target for all NGBs to achieve 40% gender representation on their boards by the end of 2023. \u00a0\u00a0 It is a priority to enable women to take more leadership positions in sport and the 40% target reflects this prioritisation.<\/p>  <p>  I would refer the Deputy to the detailed reply on the progress of our work as outlined by my colleague Minister of State Jack Chambers TD, in his reply to\u00a0D&aacute;il Question No. 50 of Thursday 24 February.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore,\u00a0 there are twenty-one varied and diverse State Boards under the remit of the Department.\u00a0 At the end of 2021, there was an average of 50% female representation on these boards of these bodies.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I trust that this information is of assistance\u00a0 to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100082#WRO01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":727,"content":"<p>Question No. 317 answered with Question No. 312.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":728,"content":"<p>Question No. 318 answered with Question No. 310.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Policy","counter":729,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100082#WRO01400"},{"type":"question","counter":730,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[11119\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100082#WRO01500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will engage with an organisation (details supplied) regarding the delays in the live performance support schemes live venue collective.

Kerry. This route is part of EuroVelo - the European cycle route network\u00a0&ndash; comprising 17 long distance cycle routes passing through 42 countries including Ireland. \u00a0EuroVelo is intended to encourage European citizens to cycle and so to promote a shift to healthy and sustainable travel for daily trips, recreation and cycling tourism. <\/p>  <p>  There are two such routes in the State. EuroVelo 1, the Atlantic Coast route, and EuroVelo 2, the Capitals route. EuroVelo 1 travels around the coast from Rosslare Harbour in Co. Wexford to Bridge End in Co. Donegal covering over 2300km. From Bridge End it continues across the border into Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The route has been developed through a partnership approach involving Sport Ireland, acting as National EuroVelo Coordinator, working with each of the relevant local authorities to identify a suitable route meeting the criteria for EuroVelo as defined by the European Cyclists Federation (ECF). The ECF is the co-ordinating body for EuroVelo at a European level. The full route in Ireland was assessed using a methodology defined by the ECF.<\/p>  <p>  The guidance for the development of EuroVelo is that routes should be relatively straightforward without too many detours, should not include spurs off the route and should be one continuous line. In this context it is not intended that the route would detour to visit every village along its 2300km length. EuroVelo routes are intended to form a backbone from which cyclists can explore locations on either side of the main route. <\/p>  <p>  It is intended that promotional material for the route will be used to inform cyclists about any points of interest on or adjacent to the route.

The EAG considered that only the Sligo application had sufficiently demonstrated Outstanding Universal Value (OUV), i.e. was able to show that the site was so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries. UNESCO's World Heritage requirements in respect of OUV are\u00a0critical\u00a0in determining what sites should be included on the Tentative List.\u00a0The EAG determined that there was more work to be done by the other applicants to see if they could sufficiently demonstrate OUV.\u00a0 In addition, the EAG also considered that the full implications of being a World Heritage Property in terms of long-term management, protection and conservation, alongside capacity building and the resources needed to progress any future World Heritage nomination dossier required further consideration by all applicants.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Given the issues raised by the EAG, and having engaged further with all the applicants over recent weeks, my Department has reconvened the EAG to offer further detailed technical advice and support to all applicants, so they may attempt to address issues raised in terms of the EAG recommendations, and to offer further specific advice and guidance in terms of the future management of a World Heritage Property.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I anticipate that this current support process will be concluded around June 2022 and I would intend to make an announcement then on the composition of a new Tentative List. It is important to reiterate that only those sites whose applications - by the conclusion of this new support phase of engagement - clearly demonstrate OUV will be included on the new Tentative List.\u00a0If by the conclusion of this current process, any applications require yet further work to determine eligibility in terms of OUV we will continue to offer our support.<\/p>  <p>  It should be stressed that if any application does not demonstrate OUV for UNESCO World Heritage process purposes, this does not in any way lessen the significance of the site in terms of its heritage and meaning to those communities who care passionately about them; in such a case we would continue to offer our support in whatever way we can to ensure that this ambition for our wonderful heritage is recognised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100084#WRQ04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":873,"content":"<p>Question No. 369 answered with Question No. 362.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Derelict Sites","counter":874,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100084#WRQ04800"},{"type":"question","counter":875,"qnumday":370,"qnumall":"[11464\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100084#WRQ04900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if each local authority is required to maintain a publicly accessible list of all derelict and abandoned properties within its area of responsibility.","asker":"1525","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":876,"content":"<p>The Derelict Sites Act 1990 imposes a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.

Cork City Council deployed a crew of whole-time firefighters to Ballincollig as a temporary measure, but I understand that arrangement has now ceased and that fire risk in the area is being managed by an appropriate arrangement of fire cover response from the network of fire stations in the region, together with statutory and community fire safety measures.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the non-availability of any particular fire station does not mean that fire risk management, including fire service response, is diminished. The systemic approach to fire risk management, which has been the policy in use in this country for a more than a decade, has seen a welcome and steady downward trend in fire losses in Ireland. While each fire death is one too many, the fire death rate per million of population, averaged over three years, stands at 4.2, a figure which is one third of what it was 10 years ago. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Provision of a retained fire service in Ballincollig remains the objective of the City Council, and a new recruitment campaign is underway for retained firefighters in Ballincollig.

No target is set specifically for virtual inspections and local authorities have the discretion to use whichever inspection type they deem most appropriate to a situation.<\/p><p>Pandemic restrictions greatly impacted on inspection activity since March 2020. The County and City Management Association&rsquo;s (CCMA) Local Authority Services Frameworks for Future Covid-19 Pandemic Response did not permit on-site rental inspections for long periods in 2020 and 2021. This was in order to protect tenants, landlords and inspectors. Even when restrictions were relaxed there was still a reluctance on the part of some tenants to allow authorised inspectors access their homes. Inspections have been and continue to be frustrated by some tenants needing to self-isolate due to having Covid-19 or being a close contact.<\/p><p>In response some local authorities piloted virtual inspections which my Department supported with Exchequer funding. Dublin City Council led this initiative and commenced virtual inspections in May 2020. My Department incorporated and standardised the approach taken countrywide into a pilot programme, requesting business cases from participating local authorities to ensure that processes are suitably robust and comprehensive.<\/p><p>The Department deems a virtual inspection to have been carried out when a decision is made on whether or not a dwelling is compliant with the Regulations, based on a review of the:<\/p><p>- landlord&rsquo;s completed self-assessment checklist <\/p><p>- photographic\/video evidence provided <\/p><p>- local authority&rsquo;s engagement with the tenant in respect of any non-compliance issues they may be aware of and whether or not they can confirm if the landlord&rsquo;s checklist answers are correct.<\/p><p>It is a key component of the virtual inspection model that local authorities reserve the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection when it is safe to do so and landlords were advised accordingly. Many rented dwellings have been subsequently re-inspected physically, since pandemic restrictions have eased.<\/p><p>As set down in Housing for All \u00a0I believe that the potential offered by a\u00a0virtual inspection approach needs to be fully explored.\u00a0This is being done through an ongoing process of evaluation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100085#WRR03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":920,"content":"<p>Question No. 385 answered with Question No. 384.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":921,"content":"<p>Question No. 386 answered with Question No. 384.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":923,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[11763\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100085#WRR04000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the actions that he has taken to stop sex for rent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":924,"content":"<p>I\u00a0condemn in the strongest terms any instances where properties are offered for rent in return for sexual acts. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is totally committed to preventing and addressing sexual abuse and gender-based violence in all its forms.

The importance of the Emigrant Support Programme in this regard was underscored in our reponse to the Covid-19 pandemic with the creation of a dedicated Covid Response Fund of nearly &euro;2 million tailored to help Irish communities abroad work collectively to protect our most vulnerable emigrants.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides significant funding to a number of organisations based in Ireland, including Crosscare and Safe Home, to support returning emigrants in crisis situations.\u00a0 We recently expanded our support to the Samaritans, to provide 24-hour Freephone access to their helpline in Ireland for Irish people abroad.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the continued development of these projects to provide advice and assistance for the Irish abroad who are in distress, struggling to cope or who are in need of emotional support.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's new Diaspora Strategy recognises that the well-being of our Diaspora is dependent on having strong and active community engagement.\u00a0 To this end we also support projects which preserve and build that sense of community, promoting vibrant networks and a sense of Irishness.\u00a0 In this regard, substantial support is provided to sporting, cultural and heritage organisations such as the GAA and\u00a0Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann for the important role they play in keeping our communities abroad connected to each other and to Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The 2022 Emigrant Support Programme funding round was launched in January.\u00a0 It prioritises outreach to those who are less connected to our existing networks, or who may have disengaged or been unable to access supports during the pandemic.\u00a0 It recognises the need to heal the relationship with our emigrants who left Ireland in crisis, as a result of discrimination or as victims of institutional abuse, with a particular focus on initiatives to support those survivors living abroad.

The Order\u00a0blocks certain property of DAB and requires it to be transferred into a consolidated account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\u00a0The ultimate fate of the frozen funds remains as yet unclear, due both to various legal cases in the US courts and to the likely delay of several months to finalise modalities relating to the Executive Order. The US Administration has said that they will consult widely with international partners during that time.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0am extremely concerned by the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, which now has the highest number of people in emergency food insecurity in the world. In response, Ireland through its Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme, Irish Aid, has provided over &euro;4 million in humanitarian support for the people of Afghanistan since mid-August.\u00a0This funding has been allocated to the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) and UNICEF respectively. These emergency response programmes are addressing the urgent needs of the population, including providing food aid, treatment for severe acute malnutrition in children, and other essential services.\u00a0As Ireland&rsquo;s aid has been allocated directly to UN agencies, it is not impacted by measures taken by the US in relation to freezing or unfreezing assets of the Central Bank of Afghanistan.<\/p>  <p>  I and my officials have been active in discussions on addressing the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan at EU level and especially at the UN Security Council, prioritising a continued core role for the UN in the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to the millions who need it. In an effort to further alleviate the dire humanitarian situation, Ireland strongly advocated for UN Security Council Resolution 2615 on humanitarian exemptions from UN sanctions against members of the Taliban. Agreed unanimously in December 2021, these exemptions will ensure that humanitarian activity is not impeded by UN sanctions and will assist in meeting the basic needs of the Afghan people.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent Security Council meeting on Afghanistan took place on 26 January, and Ireland highlighted the urgent need for the international community to work collectively to address the dire humanitarian situation while noting that the crisis is of such a magnitude that it requires a broader and more sustained response. We will again emphasise the need for urgent action on the humanitarian situation when the UN Security Council meets to discuss UNAMA (the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan) later this week.

Over recent years, my Department has taken a proactive and strategic approach to advancing gender equality and wider diversity and inclusion issues. In 2012, a Management Board Sub-Committee focusing on diversity and inclusion issues, including Gender Equality was established, which brings together key stakeholders across the Department to provide leadership and strategic direction. <\/p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s Human Resources Strategy 2019-2022, a number of initiatives and policies have been advanced to improve gender, equality, diversity and inclusion. In 2019, a dedicated Lead Officer for Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion was appointed who co-ordinates work in this area across the Department. Through the Human Resources Strategy 2019-2022, as part of a wider Gender Equality Action Plan, my Department has published a Maternity Leave Cover Policy;  a Guide to Supports for Maternity, Adoptive and Parental Leave; and is finalising the adoption of a Menopause Policy, which is expected to be launched in Q2 2022.\u00a0<\/p><p>Since 2019, my Department has published three reports on the Gender Pay Gap within DFA and in 2021 developed a Gender Pay Gap Action Plan. The Department of Foreign Affairs has reduced its Gender Pay Gap from over 30% in 2013 to 16.48% in 2020, and has made determined efforts to work towards a better gender balance at HQ and overseas positions. The next Departmental Gender Pay Gap report will be published in line with regulations to be introduced under the Gender Pay Gap Information Act, 2021.<\/p><p>Efforts towards ensuring greater gender balance at more senior levels is a key priority in the\u00a0 Department.\u00a0 As the end of 2021, the percentage of women at Principal Officer level and higher was 40 percent. In addition, of the 22 Ambassadorial and senior-level Head of Mission nominations for 2022, 11 are women and 11 are men. Including Consuls General appointed, 18 women will take up Head of Mission roles in 2022 out of a total of 31. Once all these appointments to bilateral and multilateral missions are in place in 2022, the percentage of female Heads of Missions will be 46%, up from 36% one year ago. As part of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the Gender Pay Gap, it led on the establishment of an inter-departmental working group on the Gender Pay Gap, which acts as an informal means of sharing best practice in the area of reducing the Gender Pay Gap and promoting Gender Equality.<\/p><p>More broadly, my Department is working to embed a culture of diversity and inclusion across the Department. In October 2020 and November 2021 the Department launched two surveys to gather the views of staff on how we can make further progress in this area. Combined, the results of these surveys will be used to develop a bespoke Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan and Training Programme, which will be both be finalised by the end of Q2 2022.\u00a0<\/p><p>Gender Equality and the empowerment of women and girls is a key priority for Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. A Better World, Ireland&rsquo;s international development policy, establishes gender equality as one of four core policy priorities. We are committed to integrating gender equality across all our interventions and in our wider foreign policy; and to increasing allocations to interventions directly dedicated to achieving gender equality. Ireland has a longstanding reputation as a leader on gender equality on the international stage. In 2018 and 2019, Ireland successfully chaired the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. Ireland is consistently ranked by the OECD DAC as among the OECD member countries with the highest gender equality focus in official development assistance (ODA). Gender features as a theme of the 2020 Irish Aid Annual report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100086#WRS04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":985,"content":"<p>Question No. 405 answered with Question No. 395.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Birth Registration","counter":986,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100086#WRS04700"},{"type":"question","counter":987,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[11142\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100086#WRS04800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of a foreign birth registration application by a person (details supplied);; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1484","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":988,"content":"<p>My Department is responsible for citizenship by descent through the Foreign Births Register under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.<\/p>  <p>  The processing of Foreign Birth Registration has resumed and will be gradually scaling up in line with the recruitment of additional resources.

The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. In terms of fishery protection, the Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the EEZ. The Naval Service also carry out a number of other non-fishery related tasks in tandem with maritime surveillance, and as such any Naval Service patrol should be viewed as a multifaceted activity. <\/p><p>The number of Fishery Patrol and Non-Fishery Patrol days completed from 2016 to 2021 are detailed below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>Fishery patrol days<\/th>       <th>Non-Fishery patrol days<\/th>       <th>Total Patrol days<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016<\/td>       <td>1068<\/td>       <td>308<\/td>       <td>1376<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017<\/td>       <td>1091<\/td>       <td>317<\/td>       <td>1408<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018<\/td>       <td>1076<\/td>       <td>221<\/td>       <td>1297<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019<\/td>       <td>1036<\/td>       <td>25<\/td>       <td>1061<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020<\/td>       <td>781<\/td>       <td>226<\/td>       <td>1007<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021<\/td>       <td>766<\/td>       <td>66<\/td>       <td>832<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> Scheduled patrol days can be impacted by a range of factors including adverse weather conditions and unscheduled maintenance, as well as staffing issues.  <\/p><p>At any one time the Naval Service can have a number of ships that are on active operations around the Irish EEZ whilst a number of others are undergoing routine resupply, maintenance and down time for ships companies. The high level of non-fisheries patrol days 2016-2018 can largely be attributed to the Naval Service's participation in Operations Pontus and Sophia in the Mediterranean during these years. <\/p><p>In July 2019, the Naval Service reduced its operational flotilla to six ships, placing two ships on operational pause, while a third ship entered a mid-life re-fit programme. The L&Eacute; Rois&iacute;n came back into operation last year following her mid-life re-fit, while the L&Eacute; Niamh has begun her mid-life re-fit following the fire on board in October 2020.  The reduction in overall Patrol Days 2020-2021 is mainly due to issues relating to Covid 19 as one of the ships, L&Eacute; Ciara, could not go to sea given its inability, due to its size, to implement safely the necessary Covid 19 'clean ship' precautions.  The fire on board the L&Eacute; Niamh also contributed to the reduction in scheduled Patrol Days in 2020. A shortage of suitably qualified and experienced personnel during the period in question was also a factor. I acknowledge these challenges have had an impact on overall planned Patrol Days. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding some mechanical and staffing issues being experienced, the Naval Service continues to carry out the roles assigned by Government, including fishery protection and maritime security operations.

The new assessment arrangements under the Framework for Junior Cycle on the other hand require all students to engage in an assessment of their oral skills through Classroom Based Assessment.\u00a0 This gives a greater opportunity for <b>all<\/b>students to develop and enhance their oral language proficiency skills over the three years of Junior Cycle and to foster their ability to use the Irish language. <\/p><p>With effect since 2017, as part of the Framework for Junior Cycle, Junior Cycle provision for Irish in post-primary schools and settings comprises two new specifications. The L1 (Language 1, in Irish, Teanga 1) specification is targeted at students in Irish-medium schools and students in English-medium schools who learn one or more subjects (apart from Irish) through the medium of Irish. The L2 (Language 2, Teanga 2) specification is targeted at other students in English-medium schools.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The new specifications (both L1 and L2) have a strong emphasis on oral language.\u00a0 This is particularly highlighted in the main strand of the specifications &ndash; Communicative Competence. This strand places an enhanced emphasis on Irish as the language of learning and communication in classrooms as well as an emphasis on the skills required to communicate effectively with other users of the language. Communication, opportunities for use and interaction are central to classroom tasks.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The assessment of these skills forms an integral component of the overall language learning experience and occurs in a number of ways. As well as the completion of tasks where students use and demonstrate their oral language skills to achieve specific learning outcomes, their oral language skills are also formally assessed through the two new Classroom-Based Assessments (CBAs). The second Classroom-Based Assessment in particular is entirely based on students&rsquo; oral language competence. The CBA is linked to ongoing classroom exchanges and represents a more authentic reflection of students&rsquo; interests and competence levels in Irish. Importantly, the oral skills of all students are now assessed in classroom-based assessments and formally reported upon in each students&rsquo; Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement.\u00a0 Unlike the previous reporting format in which candidates receive one overall grade based on their achievement in Irish in the Junior Certificate, whether they undertake the optional oral or not, the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement allows students&rsquo; achievement in the CBAs to be recorded independently of the result in the state-certified examination.<\/p><p>These new arrangements provide a greater opportunity for students to develop their oral language proficiency skills.\u00a0 <\/p><p>My Department remains committed to encouraging the use of spoken Irish.\u00a0 The development of the new curriculum specifications for Irish at Junior Cycle was informed by research and extensive consultation with the education partners including practising teachers and students. Extensive continuing professional development (CPD) provided to teachers is complemented by a range of other supports. The new approach gives better recognition to the development of students&rsquo; oral competence, including their ability to speak Irish, over the three years of Junior Cycle.<\/p><p>As is the case with all of the specifications developed under the Junior Cycle Framework, an early enactment review of Junior Cycle Gaeilge is being conducted. The purpose of the review is to capture feedback from teachers, students and stakeholders on the early enactment of the Junior Cycle Irish L1 Specification and Junior Cycle Irish L2 Specification. The review addresses, among other issues, questions on how well the specifications get to the heart of the learning aspired to within Junior Cycle Irish, L1 and L2 and more broadly within the Framework for Junior Cycle. The review is estimated to be completed in the third quarter of this year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100089#WRV00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Equipment","counter":1110,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100089#WRV00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1111,"qnumday":454,"qnumall":"[10894\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100089#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps she is taking to replace the current HEA net broadband connection to a school (details supplied) in County Tipperary; when the school will be able to avail of fibre broadband; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1112,"content":"<p>The delivery of high quality internet connectivity for all schools is a key objective of my Department.

It is expected that the enrolment pressures in these, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. <\/p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the area in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website. <\/p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) can also be found on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is also updated regularly.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically, in East Cork, there are a number of significant school building projects providing additional capacity at post primary level:<\/p>  <p>  - Carrigtwohill Community\u00a0College (76333G) is a co-educational post primary school with an enrolment\u00a0of\u00a0535 for the 2021\/2022 school year. \u00a0A project to provide a permanent\u00a0school building for 1,000 pupils is currently at Stage 3. <\/p>  <p>  - St Aloysius College,\u00a0Carrigtwohill, (62140P) is an all girls post primary school with an\u00a0enrolment of 792 for the 2021\/2022 \u00a0school year. A project to facilitate\u00a0its expansion to cater for 1,000 pupils has been devolved to the school\u00a0authority for delivery.<\/p>  <p>  - Christian Brothers\u00a0Secondary School Midleton (62360G) is an all-boys post primary school with an enrolment of\u00a0907 pupils for the 2021\/22 school year. \u00a0A project to facilitate its\u00a0expansion to cater for 1,000 pupils has been devolved to the school\u00a0 authority for delivery.<\/p>  <p>  - St Mary&rsquo;s High School,\u00a0Midleton (62380M) is an all girls&rsquo; post primary school with an enrolment of 758 pupils for the 2021\/2022 school year. Temporary accommodation to allow the school to cater for 750 pupils has recently been approved and\u00a0 this Department continues to engage with the school patrons in respect of\u00a0a project for a new school building for St. Mary&rsquo;s High school to later for 1,000 pupils.<\/p>  <p>  - Pobailscoil na Trion&oacute;ide,\u00a0Youghal, (91513S) is a co-educational post primary school with an enrolment of\u00a01005 pupils for the 2021\/2022 school year. A project to\u00a0facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,200 pupils has been devolved to\u00a0the school authority for delivery.<\/p>  <p>  - Col&aacute;iste Mhuire, Cobh\u00a0 (62180E) is a co-educational school which had an enrolment of\u00a0702 pupils\u00a0 for the 2021\/2022 school year. A devolved grant has been approved to the\u00a0school to facilitate its expansion to cater for 700 pupils.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work to advance these and other projects in East Cork and to ensure sufficient mainstream and SEN school places at both primary and post primary level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100089#WRV01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Training","counter":1122,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100089#WRV01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1123,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[10954\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100089#WRV01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will extend the allowance for student teachers to provide substitute services beyond the February 2022 mid-term break; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1124,"content":"<p>At the outset, I want to acknowledge the key role played by student teachers in supporting our schools throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in providing substitution cover.

The Plan aims to ensure women and men are assigned an equal share of high visibility positions across the Department. \u00a0It also develops initiatives to support middle managers to ensure a strong female leadership pipeline for the future. It provides for unconscious bias training and ensures the organisational culture is supportive of work-life balance. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At the most senior levels, my Department has achieved gender balance on the Management Board with a 50\/50 female: male composition. \u00a054% of principal officers in my Department are female.

Three of the boards had over 60% female representation and two had less than 40% female representation.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Within the national curriculum across all levels, a core value is inclusivity and diversity.

A Report &lsquo;Review of Literature to Identify a Set of Effective Interventions for Addressing Gender Balance in STEM in Early Years, Primary and Post-Primary Education Settings&rsquo; was published in November 2020.\u00a0 This report sets out what is known about critical barriers to girls&rsquo; participation in STEM education and STEM learning, while also highlighting effective interventions to increase participation of girls in STEM.

and is fully committed to supporting carers in that role.\u00a0 This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The key role of the Department of Social Protection is to provide income support where an income need arises because of a particular contingency &ndash; be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.\u00a0 My Department provides a comprehensive package of carers&rsquo; income supports including\u00a0Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.\u00a0 Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2022 is\u00a0estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the main scheme by which my Department provides income support to carers in the community.\u00a0 Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means tested payment social assistance payment awarded to those carers who are caring for certain people whose disability is such that they require full-time care and attention. \u00a0The projected expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2022 is\u00a0approximately &euro;990 million.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the\u00a0case of a full-time carer who is caring for two or more people who require full-time care, the full rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance may be payable along with an increase of 50% of the full rate.\u00a0 Carers may\u00a0also, subject to certain conditions, qualify for\u00a0the Household Benefits Package and a Free Travel Pass.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In terms of other forms of financial assistance available to carers to assist with additional expenses, the\u00a0annual Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is available to family carers providing full-time care regardless of means.\u00a0 The name was changed to better reflect the use of the grant and\u00a0it can be used for a variety of purposes, including to pay for respite for the care recipient, to meeting heating costs, other household bills and travel expenses.\u00a0 This grant is paid automatically to those in receipt of carer income supports, including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, and will be paid on the first Thursday of June.\u00a0 This grant is not available for any other group nor is there an equivalent payment for carers in any other country in Europe.\u00a0 Despite the extra financial demands due to the Covid-19 crisis, in Budget 2021, I increased the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant by &euro;150 to its current rate of &euro;1,850.\u00a0 This is the highest rate since its introduction.\u00a0 The estimated spend on this grant in 2022 is over &euro;262 million. <\/p>  <p>  In the situation the Deputy outlines - that of a person who is providing full-time care for multiple\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 persons - it should be noted that in addition to the Carer's Allowance as outlined above, a full Carer's Support Grant is paid in respect of each person being cared for.\u00a0 This is\u00a0to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers.<\/p>  <p>  For those in financial difficulty,\u00a0the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA)\u00a0is also available.\u00a0 This is a means-tested payment available through the Department's Intreo Centres.\u00a0 The SWA scheme is considered the \"safety net\" within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.\u00a0 Under the SWA scheme, the Department may award a supplement to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and which are deemed to be necessary. <\/p>  <p>  I have also\u00a0introduced a number of measures\u00a0as part of Budget 2022\u00a0in relation to the income supports provided by my Department.\u00a0 These include the following changes to the\u00a0Carer's Allowance\u00a0means test which will take effect in June: <\/p>  <p>  - An increase in the Capital\/Savings disregard\u00a0for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. <\/p>  <p>  - An increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 a week for single carers and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse\/partner.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the following changes also benefitting carers were announced\u00a0and came into effect\u00a0in January:<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;5 increase in maximum rate of all core weekly payments, with effect from January.<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;3 increase for qualified child dependants aged 12 and over and &euro;2 for those up to age 12, in all core weekly payment.<\/p>  <p>  I expect that these measures will go some way\u00a0in improving the\u00a0income supports to family carers, whose earning capacity is significantly constrained as a consequence of their caring responsibilities.\u00a0 However, any further changes to the carers payments as they are currently configured would have to considered in an overall policy and Budgetary context. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, other supports for carers and people with disabilities, such as respite services and assistance with transport to and from appointments, are a matter for the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE).\u00a0 The HSE provides these services directly and also funds voluntary organisations to provide supports and services to individuals and their carers.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the

(SWA) scheme is the safety net within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents.\u00a0 Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment,\u00a0a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses,\u00a0as well as single exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs).\u00a0<\/p><p>The basic supplementary welfare allowance\u00a0provides immediate\u00a0assistance for those in need who are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment or do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.\u00a0<\/p><p>Rent supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.\u00a0 The scheme ensures that for those who were renting, but whose circumstances have changed due to temporary loss of employment, can continue to meet their rental commitments.<\/p><p>The original purpose of the mortgage interest supplement scheme (MIS) was to provide short-term support to eligible people who were unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which was their sole place of residence, due to temporary unemployment or loss of earnings.\u00a0 <\/p><p>It should be noted that the mortgage interest supplement scheme was discontinued\u00a0for new entrants from 1 January 2014. <\/p><p>Under the SWA scheme,\u00a0a\u00a0supplement can be awarded to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.\u00a0 In addition,\u00a0officers can make a single exceptional needs payment\u00a0(ENP)\u00a0to help meet essential, once-off expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.\u00a0 Decisions on ENPs and SWA supplements are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. <\/p><p>Statistics are maintained\u00a0on\u00a0the number of applications awarded\u00a0under the SWA scheme.\u00a0 They have not been maintained on the number of applications refused over the period 2016-2021.<\/p><p>Table 1 shows the number of Basic SWA and supplement recipients by county, at year end 2016.<\/p><p>Table 2 shows the number of Basic SWA and supplement recipients by county, at year end 2017.<\/p><p>Table 3 shows the number of Basic SWA and supplement recipients by county, at year end 2018.<\/p><p>Table 4 shows the number of Basic SWA and supplement recipients by county, at year end 2019.<\/p><p>Table 5 shows the number of Basic SWA and supplement recipients by county, at year end 2020.<\/p><p>Table 6 shows the number of ENPs and UNPs paid by county for 2016-2020.<\/p><p>Table 7 shows the number of ENPs and UNPs paid by category for 2016-2020.<\/p><p>Table 8 shows the expenditure by SWA scheme for 2016-2020.\u00a0 A breakdown by county in not available.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>Table 1 - Basic SWA\u00a0and Supplement recipients by county at

This brings the total number of posts awarded under SALI to 30.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Last May, I announced &euro;23 million in funding for a programme for post-doctoral researchers to become research leaders. The investment, which is a joint initiative between Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and the Irish Research Council (IRC), will see some 40 early career researchers, across all disciplines, supported to develop cutting-edge projects through awards of up to &euro;550,000 over a four-year period. The focus will be promoting women researchers in academia, in support of equality, diversity and inclusion across the higher education sector.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>The STEM Education Policy Statement was published in 2017 and seeks to raise awareness and interest in STEM and focuses on increasing the uptake of STEM related subjects for learners of all backgrounds, ability and gender.\u00a0The strategy targets a 40% increase in the number of females taking STEM subjects for Leaving Certificate. On 18th   May 2021,\u00a0Minister Foley and I announced a new partnership to support education and public engagement in STEM. This partnership contributes funding to projects under the Science Foundation Ireland Discover Programme. This programme aims to support effective interventions in early STEM education, help students engage with science subjects at an early age and foster interest in STEM careers especially among young women. This is an area that I have prioritised, including through support for initiatives including the National Gender Equality Dashboard for Higher Education Institutions; the Athena SWAN Charter and the Senior Academic Leadership Initiative which is increasing the number of women involved in decision making roles in higher education.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Tackling sexual violence and harassment in our tertiary education system is and will remain, a key policy focus for me and my Department. I really want to thank students and staff across the country who took the time to engage with two surveys in 2021 on Sexual Violence and Harassment within Higher Education Institutions and share their experiences with us.\u00a0A total of 11,417 responses were analysed (7,901 students and 3,516 staff) and inform the findings.<\/p>  <p>  The survey findings point to some positive developments in the higher education institutions that can be built upon in areas such as awareness raising and education. But there are also some deeply troubling findings, such as the levels of sexual harassment experienced by staff and students that responded to the survey and particularly the female students that reported that they had experienced sexual violence. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion in the HEA, the higher education sector and the HEA Advisory Group on Ending Sexual Violence and Harassment in Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) to implement the recommendations in these reports.<\/p>  <p>  Data from annual HEI progress updates to the HEA on implementation of the Framework for Consent in HEIs and the findings of the survey reports will provide an evidence base for any funding and priority areas identified in the reports&rsquo; recommendations. My intention is to develop an implementation plan to consolidate the advances that have been made in this area since the publication of the Framework for Consent in HEIs in April 2019. The HEA Advisory Group will act as the implementation oversight group, working alongside the HEA's\u00a0Centre for Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion and my Department. <\/p>  <p>  I am also working with Cabinet colleagues to deliver on a number of Programme for Government commitments relating to gender equality.

As an employer, the Department is guided by the Civil Service Diversity Policy and its obligations under equality legislation, particularly the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015, which outlaw discrimination in a wide range of employment and employment-related areas, including recruitment and promotion; equal pay; working conditions; learning opportunities; dismissal and harassment including sexual harassment.<\/p><p>I am pleased to inform the\u00a0Deputy that my Department's Gender Pay Gap Report will be launched next\u00a0Tuesday, March 8,\u00a0at a special\u00a0staff event\u00a0to mark\u00a0International Women's Day 2022. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 places a positive duty on public sector bodies to have regard for the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality, and protect the human rights of employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by their policies and plans. This is known as our &lsquo;Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty&rsquo;. My Department established a dedicated Equality, Diversity, Inclusion and Public Sector Duty Committee to oversee our adherence to the public sector duty and to devise, oversee and promote equality, diversity and inclusion for my Department. <\/p><p>Through its day to day work, my Department continues to value and promote equality and human rights, whether in delivering key public services, developing policy and legislation in an inclusive human rights compliant manner, or in doing our work in an efficient, fair manner with integrity and respect for human dignity. <\/p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Strategy is due to be published this month and will be central to our mission of working for a safe, fair, inclusive Ireland, and to fulfilling our public sector duty obligations.<\/p><p>The development of the Strategy involved broad consultation with our internal stakeholders as well as engagement with external stakeholders with an expertise in human rights and equality issues. \u00a0The objectives of our EDI Strategy will focus on: achieving better policy outcomes and improving the accessibility and quality of our services; supporting the development of a skilled and diverse workforce and building and embedding a workplace culture which facilitates &amp;amp; encourages contributions from all. <\/p><p>My Department is leading the development across Government of the Third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV), with valued input from victims and survivors as well as those working in the frontline.\u00a0 The new Strategy recognises that while both men and women can be victims\/survivors, women and girls are affected disproportionately as a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women. As a result, there is an emphasis within the Strategy on meeting the needs of women and girls.<\/p><p>The Strategy will be underpinned by clear actions, timelines, effective governance and accountability mechanisms. It will be resourced as it should be, and its goal is clear: zero tolerance in Irish society for domestic, sexual and gender based violence.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, I intend to publish a Bill before Easter which will create new criminal offences for stalking and for non-fatal strangulation. A new Hate Crime Bill which will introduce new, specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics, including gender, will be published in the summer. \u00a0This will mean that certain types of crimes can be prosecuted as hate crimes where they are motivated by misogyny.<\/p><p>I am continuing to drive forward the implementation of Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, which is a detailed action plan for delivering all of the 52 recommendations made in the O&rsquo;Malley report. This will make our criminal justice system one that better protects and supports vulnerable victims.

The Constitution obliges the State to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend themselves in person or through legal assistance of their own choosing, or if they have insufficient means to pay for legal assistance to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.<\/p>  <p>  The overriding concern is to ensure that due process is followed and that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of a person\u00a0charged with a criminal offence before the courts.<\/p>  <p>  The assignment of lawyers or the granting of aid are matters for the Court and as such are handled by the judiciary on the applicant's appearance in court. Criminal prosecutions originate in the District Court and if satisfied it is so warranted, the District Court Judge presiding will grant a criminal legal aid certificate.<\/p>  <p>  There is no limit to the number of times that a person can be granted legal aid under the scheme.\u00a0Whether or not an applicant has received legal aid previously is not a consideration in determining eligibility for legal aid and this\u00a0information is not recorded by the Courts Service. An applicant's previous convictions are also not a criterion for the granting of criminal legal aid under the Act.<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme of legislation to amend and update the law in respect of criminal legal aid is being prepared and I intend to publish it later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The key purpose of the General Scheme will be to transfer the administration of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme to the Legal Aid Board and consultation with relevant stakeholders will be undertaken once work on the draft General Scheme is completed.<\/p>  <p>  The new Scheme will involve a transfer of accountability for Criminal Legal Aid expenditure to the Legal Aid Board. Among other things, the Scheme will also provide for better oversight and improved accountability for expenditure, management and control in line with Audit requirements. It will also provide for the implementation of a simple and transparent application system for Criminal Legal Aid and provide for a comprehensive body of regulations to support the administration of the amended Scheme.

The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021.\u00a0The transfer of responsibility for training to the ICGP, completed last year, will result in further increases in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100098#WREE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care of the Elderly","counter":1642,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100098#WREE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1643,"qnumday":634,"qnumall":"[10913\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100098#WREE00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he intends introducing personalised budgets for older people;

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults.\u00a0In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in their first year of secondary school.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys,\u00a0my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school. HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.\u00a0 A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys. This started in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. As part of the HTA to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys, it also examined the potential for a catch-up programme for boys up to sixth year in school. It concluded that such a programme would not be cost effective, and it was not introduced at that time. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p>  <p>  In July 2018, NIAC recommended the HPV vaccine for people living with HIV up to and including 26 years of age and for all gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM), including gbMSM living with HIV, up to and including 45 years of age.\u00a0 A policy decision was made to implement this recommendation and the vaccine is available through many STI and HIV clinics.<\/p>  <p>  As you will be aware, my Department has asked NIAC to consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:<\/p>  <p>  - girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and<\/p>  <p>  - women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.<\/p>  <p>  If NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.<\/p>  <p>  Once this work has been completed, my Department will consider the recommendations made by NIAC and HIQA following which my Department will make future policy decisions in this area.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  On the issue of NIAC recommendations more generally, I can advise that currently, there have been no decisions made to extend the HPV national immunisation programme to include those receiving treatment for CIN2+ lesions on foot of the NIAC recommendation.\u00a0 My Department will, of course, continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence in the future.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to HPV vaccine uptake rates, the National Immunisation Office have advised that the latest available figures show a 76% uptake for dose 1 and 65% uptake for dose 2 in the 2020\/2021 academic year.\u00a0 It should be noted that some areas are yet to input some, or all, of their data for both dose 1 and 2 so these figures are expected to increase.<\/p>  <p>  The World Health Organisation has a HPV uptake rate target in place of 90% to eliminate cervical cancer. I can confirm that Ireland is committed to achieving this objective of a 90% uptake rate.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100098#WREE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1653,"content":"<p>Question No. 637 answered with Question No. 636.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1654,"content":"<p>Question No. 638 answered with Question No. 636.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Strategies","counter":1655,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100098#WREE01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1656,"qnumday":639,"qnumall":"[10922\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100098#WREE01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide details on the partnership led by the National Screening Service that will allow Ireland to set a target date for the elimination of cervical cancer;

There are many reasons for such shortages including shortages of raw materials, manufacturing difficulties, logistical\/transport issues or product recalls due to potential quality defects. <\/p>  <p>  Medicines shortages can therefore originate at any point in the supply chain and can involve and impact on many different stakeholders. Accordingly, medicines shortages require a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health. Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicines shortages framework in place, coordinated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur. <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA is aware of the current challenges regarding the intermittent supply of some hormone replacement therapies (HRT), notably transdermal patches. The HPRA has had regular and ongoing engagement with suppliers in this regard. The companies that place the products on the market have indicated that the current supply difficulties are due to a significantly increased demand for these medicines in Ireland in recent years. To illustrate, the supply of one range of HRT products, Estradot, has increased by between 77% and 117% for, for the three most-used strengths, compared to 2020. In addition, based on demand in recent months, the company expects a similar increase in the demand for all strengths during 2022. This would mean that the usage of Estradot in Ireland would be approximately 4.5-7.5 times higher in 2022 (depending on the strength) compared to 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The suppliers have confirmed that they have increased supply of HRT patches to Ireland during 2022 in response to this increased demand. In the case of one brand (Evorel\/Evorel Conti), the supply of HRT patches has resumed. For another brand (Estradot), some strengths are available currently and, based on manufacturing availability, the re-supply of the full range is expected to be in July. In the interim, the companies have indicated that they are working to find solutions to the immediate supply issues. <\/p>  <p>  The current supply situation has arisen due to significant increases in demand for HRT medicines and is not linked to regulatory matters. However, the HPRA continues to review available options within our regulatory remit to facilitate increased supply where at all possible. In particular, the HPRA has advised the companies that we are open to providing accelerated regulatory approval to supply a product originally intended for other markets if available. We are awaiting further information from the companies in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and reduce their impact on patients. The information relating to shortages on the HPRA website is dynamic and changes depending on the current information the HPRA has to hand, including removal from the list when a shortage has been resolved. <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA will continue to liaise with suppliers of HRT medicines over the coming weeks with a view to securing updates and commitments regarding the restoration of normal supplies for patients as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030100100#WRGG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability
