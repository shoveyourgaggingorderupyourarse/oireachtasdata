Apologies have been received from Deputy Colm Burke.  If attending from within the committee room or precincts of Leinster House, attendees are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others against the risk of contracting Covid-19.  It is still with us, unfortunately.  Members attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of the Parliament.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is accompanied this morning by Mr. Mark Brady, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  This morning, in our first engagement of the new D&aacute;il term, we are meeting Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, to examine its 2020 financial statements.  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from HRI: Ms Suzanne Eade, chief executive; Mr. Roger Casey, chief financial officer; Mr. Jason Morris, director of racing and strategic projects; and Ms Claire Rudd, head of risk and compliance.  We are also joined by the following officials from the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB: Mr. Darragh O&rsquo;Loughlin, chief executive, and Mr. Donal O&rsquo;Shea, head of finance.  Finally, we are joined by the following officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine: Mr. Martin Blake, assistant secretary, and Ms Caroline Ball, principal officer.<\/p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference attendees may make to other persons in their evidence.  As witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee. This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such directions.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I call the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#B00100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663835400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>As members are aware, Horse Racing Ireland was established to provide a statutory basis for the control, regulation and development of the horse racing industry in Ireland.  In addition to its regulatory, funding and development activities, HRI operates a number of racecourses and runs a totaliser betting system.  Organisationally, HRI&rsquo;s activities are delivered through a group structure involving the statutory body and eight subsidiary companies.  In addition, HRI has around a one-third shareholding in an associate company called Curragh Racecourse Limited.<\/p> <p>  HRI received State funding of &euro;67.2 million in 2020 from the Vote for agriculture, food and the marine.  This accounted for 71% of HRI&rsquo;s income in the year.  Its other main sources of income were contributions from horse owners and sponsors towards racing prize money totalling &euro;16.3 million, sales of media rights to the value of &euro;5 million, registration fee income of &euro;2.2 million and thoroughbred industry contributions of &euro;202,000.<\/p> <p>  HRI incurred a net loss of &euro;904,000 from racing activities in 2020, on turnover of just under &euro;59 million.  This outcome was a reversal from the small surplus of &euro;294,000 in 2019, on turnover of just under &euro;73 million.  The decline in turnover and the loss incurred reflect the net impact of Covid-19 restrictions on racing and race attendance, and of Covid financial supports provided.<\/p> <p>  HRI had exceptional income of &euro;9.3 million in 2020, mainly arising from the profit on a sale of land in Ballyogan, Dublin, to the Department of Education.  The group accounts include a charge of &euro;1 million in relation to a special dividend payment made by HRI to the Exchequer from the sales proceeds, on the instructions of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  <\/p> <p>  On the expenditure side in 2020, HRI incurred costs totalling &euro;86.7 million, including &euro;51.6 million paid out in prize money.  Expenditure of &euro;11.9 million was incurred on integrity and racecourse services, mainly comprising grants to the Irish Horse Racing Regulatory Board.  Overall, the HRI group recorded a retained surplus of &euro;13.8 million for 2020.  The 2020 financial statements received a clear audit opinion.  However, without qualifying that opinion, my report drew attention to two matters related to HRI&rsquo;s activity in the year.<\/p> <p>  First, I drew attention to a loss of &euro;1.8 million incurred in 2020 related to HRI&rsquo;s investment in Curragh Racecourse Limited.  This followed a loss on the same investment of just over &euro;2 million in 2019.  HRI&rsquo;s cumulative loss to end 2020 arising from the investment was &euro;6.4 million, representing almost 28% of the amount invested by HRI in the associate company.  HRI recognised an impairment charge of &euro;6.4 million on its investment in the HRI statement of financial position for 2020. <\/p> <p>  Curragh Racecourse Limited is a company established to provide for the redevelopment and management of the Curragh racecourse.  The redevelopment involved the construction of a new stand and other racing facilities, which opened in mid-2019.  Ownership of the company is split between HRI, the private-membership Turf Club and a consortium of private investors.<\/p> <p>  Notes 37 and 39 of the group financial statements explain that HRI had contributed funding to Curragh Racecourse Limited totalling over &euro;36 million up to the end of 2019.  This comprised an investment of &euro;23 million in return for a 35.29% economic interest in the company, grant funding of &euro;12.5 million towards the cost of the construction project, the upfront payment of &euro;500,000 for the right to use a hospitality suite at the racecourse for 30 years and a loan of &euro;500,000 given during 2019 to fund additional works on the racecourse&rsquo;s parade ring.<\/p> <p>  Note 39 to the financial statements further discloses that Horse Racing Ireland entered into an agreement in 2020 to provide a convertible loan of up to &euro;9 million to Curragh Racecourse Limited.  By 31 December 2020, &euro;6.9 million of the loan facility had been transferred to the company.  Under the terms of the loan agreement, any outstanding liability to Horse Racing Ireland on 31 January 2024 will automatically convert to shares in the associate company.<\/p> <p>  The second matter to which I drew attention is the disclosure in Note 15 (i) to the financial statements that HRI booked a loss of &euro;105,000 on the disposal of around seven acres of land through a land swap deal undertaken by its subsidiary, the Tipperary Race Company plc.  HRI acquired around 12 acres of land adjoining Tipperary racecourse in 2019 at a cost of &euro;25,000 per acre.  Part of the land acquired was swapped with a neighbouring landholder, but was now valued at &euro;10,000 an acre.  The result was a write-down of around &euro;15,000 an acre in the carrying value for the land disposed of.<\/p> <p>  Certification of HRI&rsquo;s 2020 group financial statements was delayed as we awaited further information from HRI on the valuation of the investment in Curragh Racecourse Limited.  HRI&rsquo;s group financial statements were certified by me on 28 April 2022 and we are currently engaged with HRI in the process of final clearance of the financial statements for 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1663835400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I am the chief executive of HRI.  I am joined by HRI&rsquo;s chief financial officer, Mr. Roger Casey, director of racing and strategic projects, Mr. Jason Morris, and head of risk and compliance, Ms Claire Rudd.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, HRI is a commercial semi-State body responsible to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, having been established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  HRI is responsible for the overall administration, governance, development and promotion of the Irish horse racing industry on an all-island basis.  HRI operates a corporate structure that comprises the main body and nine subsidiaries, one of which is dormant.  HRI&rsquo;s functions are set out in legislation.  The HRI board comprises a chair and 13 ordinary members who are a mixture of industry and ministerial nominees.  HRI&rsquo;s audit and risk committee is a statutory sub-committee of the board established to assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities.  The audit and risk committee has its own charter, which outlines its purpose and key responsibilities.  This committee meets at least four times annually to fulfil its duties to the board.<\/p> <p>  I apologise to the committee for the delay in the submission of HRI&rsquo;s 2020 financial statements, which was driven by some additional technical clarifications required by the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to the Curragh.  This required both external advice and a full sign-off of the Curragh Racecourse 2020 financial statements in advance of clearing the HRI accounts.  HRI&rsquo;s group financial statements for 2021 will be submitted post approval at HRI&rsquo;s board meeting on 10 October, subject to Comptroller and Auditor General clearance.  We have provided the committee with briefing material in relation to the Curragh Racecourse Limited, but we will be happy to address questions members may have on any other matters related to the 2020 accounts or any other aspects of our finances.<\/p> <p>  The horse racing and breeding industries are significant across all of Ireland, producing more than &euro;2 billion in total expenditure annually and supporting approximately 29,000 direct and indirect jobs.  Supportive Government policy and legislation have put structures in place that have not only protected this vital industry but have allowed Ireland to compete at the highest level on the world stage, while enabling vital and sustainable rural-based employment throughout the country.  HRI and the entire horse racing and breeding industries are very grateful to the Oireachtas for its continued support through the horse and greyhound fund.  It means that HRI can promote an industry in which new entrants can thrive, and since 2020 we have seen many new faces.  It is heartening to see 52 new trainers having their first winner since 2020 as well as hundreds of new racehorse owners every year.  New owners and trainers typically mean more horses in training and our industry figures would back that up.  Given the labour-intensive nature of the racing industry and the care horses need, that also means many more racing jobs in rural Ireland.  This ensures that breeders all over the country can have a vibrant market for their young horses and only a competitive domestic racing environment, underpinned by appropriate prize money, can ensure that those who have invested at sales to prepare, train and improve young horses will see their investment and skills rewarded.<\/p> <p>  Like many other industries, Covid brought serious challenges to our industry, with racing staged behind closed doors, or with significantly reduced capacities, during 2020 and 2021.  However, racecourses weathered the storm supported through Government and HRI schemes and strong media rights income.  Together with the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, HRI provided a solution for point-to-point racing in the spring of 2021, allowing it to continue on the racecourse for a period and ensuring that the trade that trickles down to store sales and national hunt breeders continued to flow.<\/p> <p>  The industry statistics published in August for the first half of 2022 point to a resilient industry.  The number of horses in training is up more than 15% on the last comparable year of 2019.  This is a key figure when it comes to assessing total rural employment in the industry.  In tandem with that, thousands of people are involved in horse ownership in Ireland, be it on their own or, indeed, the many who enjoy a low-cost racing ownership experience through syndicates or racing clubs.  Attendances in the first half of 2022 were down 9%.  We must view this dip in attendances through the prism of people being slow to attend crowded events post Covid, as well the current cost-of-living crisis, which has impacted every leisure and sporting arena in the world.  That said, racing continues to deliver superb sporting occasions showcasing the best of our industry and sport.  Despite these headwinds, a strong racing product here in Ireland continues to be consumed in growing numbers on television and on mobile devices, and there remains strong domestic and international confidence in the Irish thoroughbred, with bloodstock sales through public auction up 31% on 2019.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the appointment of Ms Anne Marie Caulfied as the new CEO designate of the gambling regulatory authority of Ireland.  HRI, through its industry education and training department, Equuip, has long supported the funding of addiction services and the setting up of a gambling regulator in Ireland is very welcome.  I look forward to working with the authority once it is fully operational.<\/p> <p>  Away from the racetrack, HRI has a number of strategic priorities, including equine welfare and sustainability.  HRI has been instrumental in creating a business environment centred on the pre-eminent Irish-bred horse.  The headlines of successes worldwide are underpinned by vigilance around care from people who are in contact with the horses on a daily basis and prioritise their care and welfare.  The daily care of horses is the cornerstone of our horse welfare strategy of verifiable high standards of care for our population of horses.  Included in these are improved traceability systems, such as the electronic passport issued to the 2021 foal crop and all subsequent crops, the welfare standards checklist published recently and safety nets supported by HRI, including the Treo Eile platform for retired racehorses.<\/p> <p>  We are very conscious of our responsibility under the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan and we are very well advanced on a sustainability strategy for the organisation and for the wider breeding and racing industry.  Over the past couple of months, we have engaged with our stakeholders and held focus groups with industry organisations and can report a huge sustainability ambition within racing and breeding.  Our role is to lead by example as an advocate and champion of sustainability and to help the breeding and racing industry to increase its understanding of our responsibilities in this area, through education, increased awareness and financial supports.<\/p> <p>  I thank members for the invitation to discuss HRI&rsquo;s 2020 accounts.  We look forward to taking their questions on any other matters concerning the racing and breeding industry in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Eade"},{"type":"speech","time":1663835400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Eade.

At the onset, we knew that part of the process would require us to do a swap of some of that land to get the land that would allow us to widen the track.  For us, this is of real strategic value.  Also, when we went to do the swap, it was not really of high interest to the seller to do anything in particular in relation to the swap.  We wanted that land for our overall development and it is of strategic high value to us to get that land.  What happened was there was a book loss of &euro;105,000 in relation to that project, in relation to the land itself, but there was no cash loss to HRI.  That land is more important to us than it was.  Where we probably got the oversight wrong is that we looked at the project as a swap and we did not look at it as a disposal and an acquisition.  That is where we got it wrong.

Our minimum value is &euro;10,000, so we are conscious that our strap line is \"Growing the grass roots, Winning the world over\".  That is the dual objective of our prize money strategy.

Our vets are there to check the welfare of the horses before the race starts.  They watch the race and they check the horses again after the race.  Horses are trotted up and down to ensure they are not running lame.  Even our equine anti-doping regime is designed with the welfare of the horse in mind.  We are looking for prohibited substances at all times but we are also looking for the inappropriate use of other medication because no horse should be medicated, other than entirely appropriately and by a veterinary surgeon who is involved in the care and treatment of that horse.<\/p> <p>  When we receive concerns, as we sometimes do, about the condition of a particular horse or group of horses in a location, such as on a premises or in a field, if that information comes into us, as it frequently does, our veterinary officers treat that as the highest priority on the day.  They drop what they are doing and go out and check on the horses.  If the concerns prove to be justified, and unfortunately they sometimes are, we make immediate contact with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We have officers who are authorised under the Animal Remedies Act 1993 and under animal welfare legislation.  The Department then comes in and assists and participates closely if there are prosecutions to be brought in respect of the treatment of animals and it takes care of same.

All Wexford land is probably worth approximately &euro;30,000 per acre.  I still think, however, that there has to be a better system.  This could be a complete disaster.  It could be cost a lot more money.  From previous experience, in purchases by different entities, for instance, in the education sector, we all recommended that there should be more than one valuation.  That is something to bear in mind going forward.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Loughlin is new to IHRB and I will have a certain level of forgiveness for him, but I have to agree with my colleague.  I come from a county where and horse sport epitomises rural Ireland.  It is the biggest part of it.  The integrity of the sector is what drives it.  I acknowledge that the tender process is a slow process, but we are approximately five years behind.  This has all been said, but I expect that this time next year the 25 racecourses will be up and running with cameras.  I do not want to have another scandal reported in the sector because the IHRB has not carried out its function.  I will put that on Mr. O'Loughlin for next year.  That is the timeline he is getting from me as a member of the Committee on Public Accounts.  There should not be only two racecourses done.  The last time we heard from the IHRB, there were still two, if not one.  That is still not progress.  I appreciate that while the first fix may be done, I want the final fix to be done in 12 months because that is value for money for the sector.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I want to raise I have raised previously.  This sector is suffering greatly in respect of insurance costs.  I asked Ms Eade's predecessor, who told me that he had made representations to different Departments regarding the insurance difficulties.  Whilst this may not be the remit of HRI, I believe that it should be.  If the sector does not survive, HRI will have no function.  At the moment the industry is under such serious pressure securing insurance cover, particularly for point-to-point meetings.  I want proof that there have been representations from HRI.  I want to see who it is has written to, what the response was and the efforts it is making so that that sector survives and so that HRI's funding is worthwhile.  It is paramount to the continuation of the sector, particularly in rural Ireland.  A stakeholder group should be set up within HRI to look after these issues.  I say this because it is not getting better, but worse.  The sector is not functioning correctly without it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#M01200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1663835400,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I have some questions for Ms Eade regarding Tipperary and the location of the land.

However, one of the stronger points for racecourses during that period was the strength of the media rights, particularly streaming.

They really went after that in the past year or two.<\/p> <p>  What concerns me for the Curragh and all racecourses going into the future is the cost of living and the cost of putting on the lights, heating and all that stuff.  That will be a big drain as we approach 2023.  The big hit for the Curragh at the moment is the depreciation, which is more than &euro;4 million annually.  They will have to get much more income other than racecourse attendances to fill that gap.  This year they made a cash profit.  Depending, again, on the fuel crisis for the remainder of the year, I would expect that they will hit their committed budget in 2022.

Different bodies within racing look after each aspect of it, but there is a collective need to seriously examine that problem.  I am getting many calls from point-to-point committees, not only from within my constituency.  There is a long affinity with racing in Cork East.  In fact, the steeplechase originated in Doneraile in my constituency.  What the committees are telling me is a huge concern.  Many of them are worried about folding.  Point-to-point committees have been impacted already.  That has a knock-on impact for small breeders in particular.  Racing is a valuable industry with many major players who have a lot of money.  However, for smaller breeders involved in racing, of which there are hundreds of in my constituency, that is a huge concern.  They want to put horses into training with local trainers.  It keeps an ecosystem going.  I know I am preaching almost to the converted.  However, there is an aspect of concern when it comes to insurance that they have been left out on a limb and that has to be conveyed.

The season is significantly longer now than it was a couple of years ago, with a finite number of fixtures and ,therefore, the decision taken by the national hunt stewards was that the season should conclude at the end of May because to drag it out any longer would mean stretching the season and the people involved.  Without the additional fixtures, there was not much extra benefit.  Unfortunately, the bank holiday weekend in June falls after the end of May and, by definition, outside of the season as it is defined.  My understanding, however, is that the organisers of that event in Kinsale were offered weekends in May when those races could be held and would be supported.  Unfortunately, every sport has an end date on its season.  We have even seen the GAA shortening the football and hurling seasons.  Once a season has ended, no more fixtures can take place.

The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is B, which is correspondence from accounting officers and their Minister of the committee.  A number of items were held over from last week for this week&rsquo;s meeting, because the member who had raised it was not present etc.  The first three items relate to the closure of the Benefacts database.  I propose that we take them together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Item R1378 is from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is dated 26 July 2022 and it provides information that had been requested by the committee regarding the public funding of Benefacts.  The second item of correspondence is R1403 and is from Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton, director general of the CSO, dated 26 July and also regarding Benefacts.  It says to provide a substitute for the database Benefacts provided to the CSO the director general tentatively estimates a cost of &euro;500,000 per year for staff plus technology investment in the first one or two years of approximately &euro;200,000 to &euro;250,000 with ongoing hardware and software costs.  However, the director general states that such investment is not likely given that there are other initiatives in train, although those initiatives will not provide all the data that the CSO will require to meet EU legislation.  That data that had been available on Benefacts, is obviously lost.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has stated that it has engaged with a number of Departments regarding the data provided by Benefacts.  It is not clear if it engaged with the CSO, which appears to have relied heavily on the data and information from the Benefacts research, and we can see this in their document.

That is pretty much my recollection of it.<\/p> <p>  The CSO's response shows that there is a sizeable cost in replicating what had been available in Benefacts.  It would involve setting it up again where there was something already there.  I do not know if we will send that to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform of if it is aware of it.  If we had not sent it to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform already, I think we should do that.  The Department is saying in correspondence 1378 that, \"As the Committee will be aware, most of the relevant data published by Benefacts is available to public bodies as open data from other official bodies.\"  However, the whole idea of Benefacts that was it actually amalgamated that data.  That is where the real benefits of Benefacts was.  It is infuriating to read that and to know that the likes of the CSO are likely to have to duplicate the work.  The other issue highlighted in the  CSO&rsquo;s response is that, \"Work planned by the Department of Community and Rural Affairs on social enterprises data collection could be a partial replacement data source, as would data held by the Charities Regulator.  However, these data sources would not cover all of the detail\".  That is the point.  We are here to talk about value for money.  Something was working, it was closed down, it now has to be replicated and there will be a cost across a range of different Departments.  That seems to me to be the very opposite of value for money.  In relation to correspondence R1367, I have requested consideration of documents from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and I am asking the committee to seek those documents from the Department that I have referenced.  It is in the context of this same range of issues.  That is my ask in that piece of correspondence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#DD01300","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1663835400,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for that.  I was looking at the correspondence from the CSO last night, which raises a number of issues.  It states clearly that a significant source of information and data for the national accounts and statistics had greatly improved the quality of information on the non-profit sector that had been included in these results.  It goes on to say that, in general, compilers of official statistics have always found this sector difficult to measure, given its diversity.  Yet, Benefacts was doing that.<\/p><p>Going further, we reach the point the Deputy alluded to.  The letter says: <\/p><blockquote>\tWork planned by the Department of Community and Rural Affairs on social enterprises data collection could be a partial replacement data source, as would data held by the Charities Regulator.  However, these data sources would not cover all of the detail (i.e. the variables\/ items of information about each entity) available in Benefacts. <\/blockquote><p>From my memory of previous correspondence on this issue - and members of the committee might correct me on this - there was a figure of &euro;6 million over six years.  Funding for this was less than &euro;1 million a year.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, which is the gold-standard body for dealing with these matters, very much depended on this for some information.  I am at a loss as to what happened here with Benefacts.  It is deeply concerning.  Is there something we do not know?

For the CSO to find this to be of such value really reinforces the need for it.  A partial replacement is not enough.  We should have an actual replacement or we should reconsider bringing it back.

The university is saying that a tender solution is being examined.  We should write back and say that this needs to be a tendered process.  Going down through these non-compliant payments, it can be seen that, in respect of the second one, there are no repeat purchases planned and that the awards are now being tendered for.  That is fine.  The fourth relates to consultancy.  No repeat purchase is planned.  I have flagged another in respect of pensions.  Some &euro;434,941 was spent on pension administration fees.  The expenditure was not assessed due to the designation of overall pensions spend as exempt.  The contract is now tendered.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General wish to explain that?  I take it to mean that the university is saying, because the overall pension spend is exempt from procurement, the contract does not have to be tendered for.  Is that correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#FF02000","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663835400,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I do not have the detail in respect of that specific item.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#FF02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1663835400,"counter":737,"content":"<p>That seemed to be an unusual explanation.  Do any members wish to come in on any of that?  I ask for the agreement of the committee to correspond with Mr. Reynolds and to explain that the committee wishes to have a tendered solution for the taxation advice to support overseas offices.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  There is an issue with education and training boards, ETBs, and non-compliant procurement.  We may wish to consider this and address other issues that are arising.  A number of the items of correspondence on today's list provide explanations for non-compliant procurement.  Seven of those are from ETBs and there are a number of recurring themes within them.  Members will have seen this over recent years.  The first reason being given for why individual ETBs are not able to properly carry out procurement is that there are difficulties in securing staff for procurement-specific roles.  Another is aggregate spend leading to breaches.  A number of ETBs state that this happens on local sites within an ETB area.  These procure separately but, when the spend is added up for the ETB, it can lead to breaches of the national threshold of &euro;25,000.  By way of example, it is noted that Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB has over 90 sites.  If each reached the &euro;25,000 mark, the overall spend would reach &euro;2.3 million.  I calculated that figure quickly this morning.  Contract roll-over is another recurring theme and inadequate financial systems are also mentioned. <\/p> <p>  No. R1437 from the City of Dublin ETB gives a good overview of some of the issues.  We will note and publish the rest.   I am open to suggestions but it might also be worth bringing these items of correspondence to the attention of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Office of Government Procurement, although you would hope they are actively working on them.  There is an issue with regard to the threshold and calculating costs over different sites.  Each site can go up to that figure.  I know that Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB is the biggest with 90 sites.  A lot of non-compliant procurement could accumulate across these.  Is it agreed that we bring this to the attention of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Office of Government Procurement?  Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#FF02200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1663835400,"counter":738,"content":"<p>There is an overall body for ETBs.

The document goes on to state that the alternative scenario is reduced ambitions in agriculture, resulting in a higher total economy cost.  I just thought that the figures were very high.  I know that there is private sector investment and, obviously, public investment, but the document really sets out the challenge economically in meeting this.  It does, however, go on to outline that there are some positive signs as to what is happening in other countries in that maybe they are a bit ahead of us in terms of the cost of solar decreasing, for example, and other developments happening there.

Agreed.<\/p><p>I have flagged this item.  There are some explanations, as Members will see in the correspondence, of some of the reasons given to us in respect of specialised services and tenders having been undertaken in other cases for technical services and projects.  On medical and surgical consumables there was expenditure of &euro;281,000.  It is stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe underlying products and supplies are of a specialized and patient specific nature.  CHI continues to work itself and also closely with the HSE in an effort to ensure that all such supplies may be secured in a compliant manner. <\/blockquote> <p>There is an awful lot of stuff in the correspondence.  I suppose that with medical matters we can understand that some of that will be specialised and that there may be only the one company supplying it, but this is one we need to keep an eye on because there are significant examples here of tendering not happening for various reasons and of commitments being given.  It is important we monitor that to ensure that there is tendering in the future.<\/p><p>The next item is No. 1449B, from Cl&iacute;odhna Guy, head of licensing, legal and compliance at the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board.

I know there are all sorts of speculation as to the cost it will reach and so on but, as I keep saying, a contract goes both ways.  I asked very specifically what the triggers were whereby the State or the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board could counter-claim.  I asked if there were other triggers and was told there were no other triggers.  Then one of our requests back to the board was that it review the transcripts of the meeting of 16 June and confirm that it is satisfied that the information provided to the committee is entirely accurate.  I will pick at just a few things in the response.  Mr. Gunning said we should have drawn the committee's attention to a penalty clause on subsection completion.  It goes on to state further down, regarding penalty clauses on subsection completion, \"The NPHDB is currently reviewing all options that may or may not be taken in relation to liquidated damages...\"<\/p><p>It goes on.  The issue here was that they appear to have withheld moneys at one point but, because they did not go through the correct process, there was difficulty.  Essentially, they are telling us that they have to go through due process before they can seek to deduct moneys that would otherwise be due to the contractor.  I would have wished to engage with them on exactly the details and fallout of that and what due process they had to go through.  However, when I asked if there were other triggers, they immediately answered \"No\".  I moved on because I thought that was the case.<\/p><p> It is much less satisfactory to deal with this, in this kind of way, in retrospect.  We were not given correct information and that was what very much annoyed me.  They are now telling us that this is another trigger with regard to the process.  However, I am not sure about the quantum of what could be challenged on this.  We can evaluate the number of claims made by the contractor.  We can be told there are 25 claims, how much they amount to and the amount of the biggest claim.  However, we do not have a similar overview of this side of things.

A table of overdue correspondence items has been circulated.  It should come up on the members' screens.  Approximately 20 items are outstanding.  I ask members to take a moment to review them.

Following agreement last week regarding meetings, availability has been confirmed for the following engagements - the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications on 13 October; the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 20 October; the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on 27 October; Greyhound Racing Ireland on 10 November; and the Department of Finance on 17 November.

Agreed.<\/p> <p>  A swap was done for meetings on 20 and 27 October between the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to facilitate the committee, which people are happy enough with.  It is agreed to move ahead on that basis.  I remind members that if there are specific areas on which they wish to focus the day departmental officials are in, to flag it with the clerk and he will bring it to their attention.<\/p> <p>  As discussed last week, I am reluctant to plan much further than that at this point.  As members will be aware, the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2021 will be available to us from the end of September and we might want to prioritise further areas for examination once we have sight of it.  We may want to do that in a very timely manner.  Are there any other matters that members wish to raise on the work programme?  I take it they are happy.  That concludes our consideration of the work programme for today.<\/p> <p>  The last item on the agenda is any other business.  Are there any other issues members wish to raise?  Okay.
