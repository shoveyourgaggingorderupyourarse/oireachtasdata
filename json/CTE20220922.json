Apologies have been received from Deputy Colm Burke.  If attending from within the committee room or precincts of Leinster House, attendees are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others against the risk of contracting Covid-19.  It is still with us, unfortunately.  Members attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of the Parliament.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is accompanied this morning by Mr. Mark Brady, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  This morning, in our first engagement of the new D&aacute;il term, we are meeting Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, to examine its 2020 financial statements.  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from HRI: Ms Suzanne Eade, chief executive; Mr. Roger Casey, chief financial officer; Mr. Jason Morris, director of racing and strategic projects; and Ms Claire Rudd, head of risk and compliance.  We are also joined by the following officials from the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB: Mr. Darragh O&rsquo;Loughlin, chief executive, and Mr. Donal O&rsquo;Shea, head of finance.  Finally, we are joined by the following officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine: Mr. Martin Blake, assistant secretary, and Ms Caroline Ball, principal officer.<\/p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference attendees may make to other persons in their evidence.  As witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee. This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such directions.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I call the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#B00100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663835400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>As members are aware, Horse Racing Ireland was established to provide a statutory basis for the control, regulation and development of the horse racing industry in Ireland.  In addition to its regulatory, funding and development activities, HRI operates a number of racecourses and runs a totaliser betting system.  Organisationally, HRI&rsquo;s activities are delivered through a group structure involving the statutory body and eight subsidiary companies.  In addition, HRI has around a one-third shareholding in an associate company called Curragh Racecourse Limited.<\/p> <p>  HRI received State funding of &euro;67.2 million in 2020 from the Vote for agriculture, food and the marine.  This accounted for 71% of HRI&rsquo;s income in the year.  Its other main sources of income were contributions from horse owners and sponsors towards racing prize money totalling &euro;16.3 million, sales of media rights to the value of &euro;5 million, registration fee income of &euro;2.2 million and thoroughbred industry contributions of &euro;202,000.<\/p> <p>  HRI incurred a net loss of &euro;904,000 from racing activities in 2020, on turnover of just under &euro;59 million.  This outcome was a reversal from the small surplus of &euro;294,000 in 2019, on turnover of just under &euro;73 million.  The decline in turnover and the loss incurred reflect the net impact of Covid-19 restrictions on racing and race attendance, and of Covid financial supports provided.<\/p> <p>  HRI had exceptional income of &euro;9.3 million in 2020, mainly arising from the profit on a sale of land in Ballyogan, Dublin, to the Department of Education.  The group accounts include a charge of &euro;1 million in relation to a special dividend payment made by HRI to the Exchequer from the sales proceeds, on the instructions of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  <\/p> <p>  On the expenditure side in 2020, HRI incurred costs totalling &euro;86.7 million, including &euro;51.6 million paid out in prize money.  Expenditure of &euro;11.9 million was incurred on integrity and racecourse services, mainly comprising grants to the Irish Horse Racing Regulatory Board.  Overall, the HRI group recorded a retained surplus of &euro;13.8 million for 2020.  The 2020 financial statements received a clear audit opinion.  However, without qualifying that opinion, my report drew attention to two matters related to HRI&rsquo;s activity in the year.<\/p> <p>  First, I drew attention to a loss of &euro;1.8 million incurred in 2020 related to HRI&rsquo;s investment in Curragh Racecourse Limited.  This followed a loss on the same investment of just over &euro;2 million in 2019.  HRI&rsquo;s cumulative loss to end 2020 arising from the investment was &euro;6.4 million, representing almost 28% of the amount invested by HRI in the associate company.  HRI recognised an impairment charge of &euro;6.4 million on its investment in the HRI statement of financial position for 2020. <\/p> <p>  Curragh Racecourse Limited is a company established to provide for the redevelopment and management of the Curragh racecourse.  The redevelopment involved the construction of a new stand and other racing facilities, which opened in mid-2019.  Ownership of the company is split between HRI, the private-membership Turf Club and a consortium of private investors.<\/p> <p>  Notes 37 and 39 of the group financial statements explain that HRI had contributed funding to Curragh Racecourse Limited totalling over &euro;36 million up to the end of 2019.  This comprised an investment of &euro;23 million in return for a 35.29% economic interest in the company, grant funding of &euro;12.5 million towards the cost of the construction project, the upfront payment of &euro;500,000 for the right to use a hospitality suite at the racecourse for 30 years and a loan of &euro;500,000 given during 2019 to fund additional works on the racecourse&rsquo;s parade ring.<\/p> <p>  Note 39 to the financial statements further discloses that Horse Racing Ireland entered into an agreement in 2020 to provide a convertible loan of up to &euro;9 million to Curragh Racecourse Limited.  By 31 December 2020, &euro;6.9 million of the loan facility had been transferred to the company.  Under the terms of the loan agreement, any outstanding liability to Horse Racing Ireland on 31 January 2024 will automatically convert to shares in the associate company.<\/p> <p>  The second matter to which I drew attention is the disclosure in Note 15 (i) to the financial statements that HRI booked a loss of &euro;105,000 on the disposal of around seven acres of land through a land swap deal undertaken by its subsidiary, the Tipperary Race Company plc.  HRI acquired around 12 acres of land adjoining Tipperary racecourse in 2019 at a cost of &euro;25,000 per acre.  Part of the land acquired was swapped with a neighbouring landholder, but was now valued at &euro;10,000 an acre.  The result was a write-down of around &euro;15,000 an acre in the carrying value for the land disposed of.<\/p> <p>  Certification of HRI&rsquo;s 2020 group financial statements was delayed as we awaited further information from HRI on the valuation of the investment in Curragh Racecourse Limited.  HRI&rsquo;s group financial statements were certified by me on 28 April 2022 and we are currently engaged with HRI in the process of final clearance of the financial statements for 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1663835400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I am the chief executive of HRI.  I am joined by HRI&rsquo;s chief financial officer, Mr. Roger Casey, director of racing and strategic projects, Mr. Jason Morris, and head of risk and compliance, Ms Claire Rudd.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, HRI is a commercial semi-State body responsible to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, having been established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  HRI is responsible for the overall administration, governance, development and promotion of the Irish horse racing industry on an all-island basis.  HRI operates a corporate structure that comprises the main body and nine subsidiaries, one of which is dormant.  HRI&rsquo;s functions are set out in legislation.  The HRI board comprises a chair and 13 ordinary members who are a mixture of industry and ministerial nominees.  HRI&rsquo;s audit and risk committee is a statutory sub-committee of the board established to assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities.  The audit and risk committee has its own charter, which outlines its purpose and key responsibilities.  This committee meets at least four times annually to fulfil its duties to the board.<\/p> <p>  I apologise to the committee for the delay in the submission of HRI&rsquo;s 2020 financial statements, which was driven by some additional technical clarifications required by the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to the Curragh.  This required both external advice and a full sign-off of the Curragh Racecourse 2020 financial statements in advance of clearing the HRI accounts.  HRI&rsquo;s group financial statements for 2021 will be submitted post approval at HRI&rsquo;s board meeting on 10 October, subject to Comptroller and Auditor General clearance.  We have provided the committee with briefing material in relation to the Curragh Racecourse Limited, but we will be happy to address questions members may have on any other matters related to the 2020 accounts or any other aspects of our finances.<\/p> <p>  The horse racing and breeding industries are significant across all of Ireland, producing more than &euro;2 billion in total expenditure annually and supporting approximately 29,000 direct and indirect jobs.  Supportive Government policy and legislation have put structures in place that have not only protected this vital industry but have allowed Ireland to compete at the highest level on the world stage, while enabling vital and sustainable rural-based employment throughout the country.  HRI and the entire horse racing and breeding industries are very grateful to the Oireachtas for its continued support through the horse and greyhound fund.  It means that HRI can promote an industry in which new entrants can thrive, and since 2020 we have seen many new faces.  It is heartening to see 52 new trainers having their first winner since 2020 as well as hundreds of new racehorse owners every year.  New owners and trainers typically mean more horses in training and our industry figures would back that up.  Given the labour-intensive nature of the racing industry and the care horses need, that also means many more racing jobs in rural Ireland.  This ensures that breeders all over the country can have a vibrant market for their young horses and only a competitive domestic racing environment, underpinned by appropriate prize money, can ensure that those who have invested at sales to prepare, train and improve young horses will see their investment and skills rewarded.<\/p> <p>  Like many other industries, Covid brought serious challenges to our industry, with racing staged behind closed doors, or with significantly reduced capacities, during 2020 and 2021.  However, racecourses weathered the storm supported through Government and HRI schemes and strong media rights income.  Together with the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, HRI provided a solution for point-to-point racing in the spring of 2021, allowing it to continue on the racecourse for a period and ensuring that the trade that trickles down to store sales and national hunt breeders continued to flow.<\/p> <p>  The industry statistics published in August for the first half of 2022 point to a resilient industry.  The number of horses in training is up more than 15% on the last comparable year of 2019.  This is a key figure when it comes to assessing total rural employment in the industry.  In tandem with that, thousands of people are involved in horse ownership in Ireland, be it on their own or, indeed, the many who enjoy a low-cost racing ownership experience through syndicates or racing clubs.  Attendances in the first half of 2022 were down 9%.  We must view this dip in attendances through the prism of people being slow to attend crowded events post Covid, as well the current cost-of-living crisis, which has impacted every leisure and sporting arena in the world.  That said, racing continues to deliver superb sporting occasions showcasing the best of our industry and sport.  Despite these headwinds, a strong racing product here in Ireland continues to be consumed in growing numbers on television and on mobile devices, and there remains strong domestic and international confidence in the Irish thoroughbred, with bloodstock sales through public auction up 31% on 2019.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the appointment of Ms Anne Marie Caulfied as the new CEO designate of the gambling regulatory authority of Ireland.  HRI, through its industry education and training department, Equuip, has long supported the funding of addiction services and the setting up of a gambling regulator in Ireland is very welcome.  I look forward to working with the authority once it is fully operational.<\/p> <p>  Away from the racetrack, HRI has a number of strategic priorities, including equine welfare and sustainability.  HRI has been instrumental in creating a business environment centred on the pre-eminent Irish-bred horse.  The headlines of successes worldwide are underpinned by vigilance around care from people who are in contact with the horses on a daily basis and prioritise their care and welfare.  The daily care of horses is the cornerstone of our horse welfare strategy of verifiable high standards of care for our population of horses.  Included in these are improved traceability systems, such as the electronic passport issued to the 2021 foal crop and all subsequent crops, the welfare standards checklist published recently and safety nets supported by HRI, including the Treo Eile platform for retired racehorses.<\/p> <p>  We are very conscious of our responsibility under the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan and we are very well advanced on a sustainability strategy for the organisation and for the wider breeding and racing industry.  Over the past couple of months, we have engaged with our stakeholders and held focus groups with industry organisations and can report a huge sustainability ambition within racing and breeding.  Our role is to lead by example as an advocate and champion of sustainability and to help the breeding and racing industry to increase its understanding of our responsibilities in this area, through education, increased awareness and financial supports.<\/p> <p>  I thank members for the invitation to discuss HRI&rsquo;s 2020 accounts.  We look forward to taking their questions on any other matters concerning the racing and breeding industry in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Eade"},{"type":"speech","time":1663835400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Eade.

At the onset, we knew that part of the process would require us to do a swap of some of that land to get the land that would allow us to widen the track.  For us, this is of real strategic value.  Also, when we went to do the swap, it was not really of high interest to the seller to do anything in particular in relation to the swap.  We wanted that land for our overall development and it is of strategic high value to us to get that land.  What happened was there was a book loss of &euro;105,000 in relation to that project, in relation to the land itself, but there was no cash loss to HRI.  That land is more important to us than it was.  Where we probably got the oversight wrong is that we looked at the project as a swap and we did not look at it as a disposal and an acquisition.  That is where we got it wrong.

Our minimum value is &euro;10,000, so we are conscious that our strap line is \"Growing the grass roots, Winning the world over\".  That is the dual objective of our prize money strategy.

Our vets are there to check the welfare of the horses before the race starts.  They watch the race and they check the horses again after the race.  Horses are trotted up and down to ensure they are not running lame.  Even our equine anti-doping regime is designed with the welfare of the horse in mind.  We are looking for prohibited substances at all times but we are also looking for the inappropriate use of other medication because no horse should be medicated, other than entirely appropriately and by a veterinary surgeon who is involved in the care and treatment of that horse.<\/p> <p>  When we receive concerns, as we sometimes do, about the condition of a particular horse or group of horses in a location, such as on a premises or in a field, if that information comes into us, as it frequently does, our veterinary officers treat that as the highest priority on the day.  They drop what they are doing and go out and check on the horses.  If the concerns prove to be justified, and unfortunately they sometimes are, we make immediate contact with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We have officers who are authorised under the Animal Remedies Act 1993 and under animal welfare legislation.  The Department then comes in and assists and participates closely if there are prosecutions to be brought in respect of the treatment of animals and it takes care of same.

All Wexford land is probably worth approximately &euro;30,000 per acre.  I still think, however, that there has to be a better system.  This could be a complete disaster.  It could be cost a lot more money.  From previous experience, in purchases by different entities, for instance, in the education sector, we all recommended that there should be more than one valuation.  That is something to bear in mind going forward.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Loughlin is new to IHRB and I will have a certain level of forgiveness for him, but I have to agree with my colleague.  I come from a county where and horse sport epitomises rural Ireland.  It is the biggest part of it.  The integrity of the sector is what drives it.  I acknowledge that the tender process is a slow process, but we are approximately five years behind.  This has all been said, but I expect that this time next year the 25 racecourses will be up and running with cameras.  I do not want to have another scandal reported in the sector because the IHRB has not carried out its function.  I will put that on Mr. O'Loughlin for next year.  That is the timeline he is getting from me as a member of the Committee on Public Accounts.  There should not be only two racecourses done.  The last time we heard from the IHRB, there were still two, if not one.  That is still not progress.  I appreciate that while the first fix may be done, I want the final fix to be done in 12 months because that is value for money for the sector.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I want to raise I have raised previously.  This sector is suffering greatly in respect of insurance costs.  I asked Ms Eade's predecessor, who told me that he had made representations to different Departments regarding the insurance difficulties.  Whilst this may not be the remit of HRI, I believe that it should be.  If the sector does not survive, HRI will have no function.  At the moment the industry is under such serious pressure securing insurance cover, particularly for point-to-point meetings.  I want proof that there have been representations from HRI.  I want to see who it is has written to, what the response was and the efforts it is making so that that sector survives and so that HRI's funding is worthwhile.  It is paramount to the continuation of the sector, particularly in rural Ireland.  A stakeholder group should be set up within HRI to look after these issues.  I say this because it is not getting better, but worse.  The sector is not functioning correctly without it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#M01200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1663835400,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I have some questions for Ms Eade regarding Tipperary and the location of the land.

However, one of the stronger points for racecourses during that period was the strength of the media rights, particularly streaming.

They really went after that in the past year or two.<\/p> <p>  What concerns me for the Curragh and all racecourses going into the future is the cost of living and the cost of putting on the lights, heating and all that stuff.  That will be a big drain as we approach 2023.  The big hit for the Curragh at the moment is the depreciation, which is more than &euro;4 million annually.  They will have to get much more income other than racecourse attendances to fill that gap.  This year they made a cash profit.  Depending, again, on the fuel crisis for the remainder of the year, I would expect that they will hit their committed budget in 2022.

Different bodies within racing look after each aspect of it, but there is a collective need to seriously examine that problem.  I am getting many calls from point-to-point committees, not only from within my constituency.  There is a long affinity with racing in Cork East.  In fact, the steeplechase originated in Doneraile in my constituency.  What the committees are telling me is a huge concern.  Many of them are worried about folding.  Point-to-point committees have been impacted already.  That has a knock-on impact for small breeders in particular.  Racing is a valuable industry with many major players who have a lot of money.  However, for smaller breeders involved in racing, of which there are hundreds of in my constituency, that is a huge concern.  They want to put horses into training with local trainers.  It keeps an ecosystem going.  I know I am preaching almost to the converted.  However, there is an aspect of concern when it comes to insurance that they have been left out on a limb and that has to be conveyed.

The season is significantly longer now than it was a couple of years ago, with a finite number of fixtures and ,therefore, the decision taken by the national hunt stewards was that the season should conclude at the end of May because to drag it out any longer would mean stretching the season and the people involved.  Without the additional fixtures, there was not much extra benefit.  Unfortunately, the bank holiday weekend in June falls after the end of May and, by definition, outside of the season as it is defined.  My understanding, however, is that the organisers of that event in Kinsale were offered weekends in May when those races could be held and would be supported.  Unfortunately, every sport has an end date on its season.  We have even seen the GAA shortening the football and hurling seasons.  Once a season has ended, no more fixtures can take place.

The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is B, which is correspondence from accounting officers and their Minister of the committee.  A number of items were held over from last week for this week&rsquo;s meeting, because the member who had raised it was not present etc.  The first three items relate to the closure of the Benefacts database.  I propose that we take them together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Item R1378 is from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is dated 26 July 2022 and it provides information that had been requested by the committee regarding the public funding of Benefacts.  The second item of correspondence is R1403 and is from Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton, director general of the CSO, dated 26 July and also regarding Benefacts.  It says to provide a substitute for the database Benefacts provided to the CSO the director general tentatively estimates a cost of &euro;500,000 per year for staff plus technology investment in the first one or two years of approximately &euro;200,000 to &euro;250,000 with ongoing hardware and software costs.  However, the director general states that such investment is not likely given that there are other initiatives in train, although those initiatives will not provide all the data that the CSO will require to meet EU legislation.  That data that had been available on Benefacts, is obviously lost.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has stated that it has engaged with a number of Departments regarding the data provided by Benefacts.  It is not clear if it engaged with the CSO, which appears to have relied heavily on the data and information from the Benefacts research, and we can see this in their document.

That is pretty much my recollection of it.<\/p> <p>  The CSO's response shows that there is a sizeable cost in replicating what had been available in Benefacts.  It would involve setting it up again where there was something already there.  I do not know if we will send that to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform of if it is aware of it.  If we had not sent it to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform already, I think we should do that.  The Department is saying in correspondence 1378 that, \"As the Committee will be aware, most of the relevant data published by Benefacts is available to public bodies as open data from other official bodies.\"  However, the whole idea of Benefacts that was it actually amalgamated that data.  That is where the real benefits of Benefacts was.  It is infuriating to read that and to know that the likes of the CSO are likely to have to duplicate the work.  The other issue highlighted in the  CSO&rsquo;s response is that, \"Work planned by the Department of Community and Rural Affairs on social enterprises data collection could be a partial replacement data source, as would data held by the Charities Regulator.  However, these data sources would not cover all of the detail\".  That is the point.  We are here to talk about value for money.  Something was working, it was closed down, it now has to be replicated and there will be a cost across a range of different Departments.  That seems to me to be the very opposite of value for money.  In relation to correspondence R1367, I have requested consideration of documents from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and I am asking the committee to seek those documents from the Department that I have referenced.  It is in the context of this same range of issues.  That is my ask in that piece of correspondence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#DD01300","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1663835400,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for that.  I was looking at the correspondence from the CSO last night, which raises a number of issues.  It states clearly that a significant source of information and data for the national accounts and statistics had greatly improved the quality of information on the non-profit sector that had been included in these results.  It goes on to say that, in general, compilers of official statistics have always found this sector difficult to measure, given its diversity.  Yet, Benefacts was doing that.<\/p><p>Going further, we reach the point the Deputy alluded to.  The letter says: <\/p><blockquote>\tWork planned by the Department of Community and Rural Affairs on social enterprises data collection could be a partial replacement data source, as would data held by the Charities Regulator.  However, these data sources would not cover all of the detail (i.e. the variables\/ items of information about each entity) available in Benefacts. <\/blockquote><p>From my memory of previous correspondence on this issue - and members of the committee might correct me on this - there was a figure of &euro;6 million over six years.  Funding for this was less than &euro;1 million a year.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, which is the gold-standard body for dealing with these matters, very much depended on this for some information.  I am at a loss as to what happened here with Benefacts.  It is deeply concerning.  Is there something we do not know?

For the CSO to find this to be of such value really reinforces the need for it.  A partial replacement is not enough.  We should have an actual replacement or we should reconsider bringing it back.

The university is saying that a tender solution is being examined.  We should write back and say that this needs to be a tendered process.  Going down through these non-compliant payments, it can be seen that, in respect of the second one, there are no repeat purchases planned and that the awards are now being tendered for.  That is fine.  The fourth relates to consultancy.  No repeat purchase is planned.  I have flagged another in respect of pensions.  Some &euro;434,941 was spent on pension administration fees.  The expenditure was not assessed due to the designation of overall pensions spend as exempt.  The contract is now tendered.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General wish to explain that?  I take it to mean that the university is saying, because the overall pension spend is exempt from procurement, the contract does not have to be tendered for.  Is that correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#FF02000","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663835400,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I do not have the detail in respect of that specific item.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#FF02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1663835400,"counter":737,"content":"<p>That seemed to be an unusual explanation.  Do any members wish to come in on any of that?  I ask for the agreement of the committee to correspond with Mr. Reynolds and to explain that the committee wishes to have a tendered solution for the taxation advice to support overseas offices.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  There is an issue with education and training boards, ETBs, and non-compliant procurement.  We may wish to consider this and address other issues that are arising.  A number of the items of correspondence on today's list provide explanations for non-compliant procurement.  Seven of those are from ETBs and there are a number of recurring themes within them.  Members will have seen this over recent years.  The first reason being given for why individual ETBs are not able to properly carry out procurement is that there are difficulties in securing staff for procurement-specific roles.  Another is aggregate spend leading to breaches.  A number of ETBs state that this happens on local sites within an ETB area.  These procure separately but, when the spend is added up for the ETB, it can lead to breaches of the national threshold of &euro;25,000.  By way of example, it is noted that Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB has over 90 sites.  If each reached the &euro;25,000 mark, the overall spend would reach &euro;2.3 million.  I calculated that figure quickly this morning.  Contract roll-over is another recurring theme and inadequate financial systems are also mentioned. <\/p> <p>  No. R1437 from the City of Dublin ETB gives a good overview of some of the issues.  We will note and publish the rest.   I am open to suggestions but it might also be worth bringing these items of correspondence to the attention of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Office of Government Procurement, although you would hope they are actively working on them.  There is an issue with regard to the threshold and calculating costs over different sites.  Each site can go up to that figure.  I know that Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB is the biggest with 90 sites.  A lot of non-compliant procurement could accumulate across these.  Is it agreed that we bring this to the attention of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Office of Government Procurement?  Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022092200002#FF02200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1663835400,"counter":738,"content":"<p>There is an overall body for ETBs.

The document goes on to state that the alternative scenario is reduced ambitions in agriculture, resulting in a higher total economy cost.  I just thought that the figures were very high.  I know that there is private sector investment and, obviously, public investment, but the document really sets out the challenge economically in meeting this.  It does, however, go on to outline that there are some positive signs as to what is happening in other countries in that maybe they are a bit ahead of us in terms of the cost of solar decreasing, for example, and other developments happening there.

Agreed.<\/p><p>I have flagged this item.  There are some explanations, as Members will see in the correspondence, of some of the reasons given to us in respect of specialised services and tenders having been undertaken in other cases for technical services and projects.  On medical and surgical consumables there was expenditure of &euro;281,000.  It is stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe underlying products and supplies are of a specialized and patient specific nature.  CHI continues to work itself and also closely with the HSE in an effort to ensure that all such supplies may be secured in a compliant manner. <\/blockquote> <p>There is an awful lot of stuff in the correspondence.  I suppose that with medical matters we can understand that some of that will be specialised and that there may be only the one company supplying it, but this is one we need to keep an eye on because there are significant examples here of tendering not happening for various reasons and of commitments being given.  It is important we monitor that to ensure that there is tendering in the future.<\/p><p>The next item is No. 1449B, from Cl&iacute;odhna Guy, head of licensing, legal and compliance at the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board.

I know there are all sorts of speculation as to the cost it will reach and so on but, as I keep saying, a contract goes both ways.  I asked very specifically what the triggers were whereby the State or the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board could counter-claim.  I asked if there were other triggers and was told there were no other triggers.  Then one of our requests back to the board was that it review the transcripts of the meeting of 16 June and confirm that it is satisfied that the information provided to the committee is entirely accurate.  I will pick at just a few things in the response.  Mr. Gunning said we should have drawn the committee's attention to a penalty clause on subsection completion.  It goes on to state further down, regarding penalty clauses on subsection completion, \"The NPHDB is currently reviewing all options that may or may not be taken in relation to liquidated damages...\"<\/p><p>It goes on.  The issue here was that they appear to have withheld moneys at one point but, because they did not go through the correct process, there was difficulty.  Essentially, they are telling us that they have to go through due process before they can seek to deduct moneys that would otherwise be due to the contractor.  I would have wished to engage with them on exactly the details and fallout of that and what due process they had to go through.  However, when I asked if there were other triggers, they immediately answered \"No\".  I moved on because I thought that was the case.<\/p><p> It is much less satisfactory to deal with this, in this kind of way, in retrospect.  We were not given correct information and that was what very much annoyed me.  They are now telling us that this is another trigger with regard to the process.  However, I am not sure about the quantum of what could be challenged on this.  We can evaluate the number of claims made by the contractor.  We can be told there are 25 claims, how much they amount to and the amount of the biggest claim.  However, we do not have a similar overview of this side of things.

We really appreciate that.  We also appreciate their being here early because we were ready to start early.  That is how efficient the committee's business is.  We really appreciate their co-operation and their facilitation of that.<\/p> <p>  Before I ask the witnesses to make their opening statement, I must read out an important notice regarding parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I will now invite Dr. Bambrick and Mr. Joyce to make their opening statement before opening the floor to members for questions and answers.  As I always say, this is a time-limited special committee.  We were set up last December to explore the 45 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality, which we regard as presenting us with a blueprint for change on gender equality.  Our view throughout our public hearings has been that we are looking at the practical implementation of those recommendations.  We have asked all our witnesses to address that.  I thank today's witnesses for having been so focused, in their fuller submission to the committee and in the opening statement we have been given, on how we achieve implementation of the recommendations.  We have invited them to address in particular recommendations 32 to 36, on pay and workplace conditions, but we are conscious that in their fuller submission they have addressed a number of other recommendations that would have relevance for ICTU.  We may well wish to explore some of those in the questions and answers.  I thank the witnesses again.  I invite them to make their opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#C00100","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":825,"content":"<p>I will deliver on our behalf the opening statement, and then we are both happy to chip in in the discussion.  On behalf of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, I thank the members of the committee for the invitation to input into its considerations of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Dr. Laura Bambrick, as the Chair said.  As requested, we are limiting our opening remarks to the recommendations on pay and workplace conditions, that is, recommendations 32 to 36, but, as the Chair said, if time allows we are happy to stray into other areas covered in our original submission.<\/p> <p>  On recommendations 32 and 33, relating to the gender pay gap, I will not read them out because I think we are all familiar with them and for the sake of time.  Currently, the most up-to-date EUROSTAT figure for Ireland's gender pay gap is 11.3%, based on 2018 data, below the EU average of 13%.  We recognise the significant issues surrounding how the pay gap is calculated and measured.  That was outlined by the Nevin Economic Research Institute in its submission to the committee.  The Gender Pay Gap Information Act also acknowledges this and, in turn, requires employers to report using a range of indicators, which we welcome.  We are very pleased that gender pay gap audits are currently under way in employments of more than 250 employees.  Next week we will publish a guide for trade union workplace representatives participating in the process, to be launched by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  We have long called for the introduction of this type of reporting, and we await with interest the publication of these reports by employers in December.  I acknowledge the role of the Chair in this area because she was the first person to publish a Bill of this type in the Oireachtas.  We had wanted and hoped that the process would require employers to discuss any gap identified with workers and their representatives and to agree a joint approach to tackling the gap.  That was not to be, but unions will be knocking on employers' doors from December seeking discussions and agreement as to how any gaps identified will be addressed in a timely and effective manner.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to the recommendation on the living wage, No. 34, we welcome the programme for Government commitment to eradicate hourly low pay from the Irish economy, which comes on foot of new EU rules on moving to adequate minimum wages.  The European Commission, in its impact assessment of the directive, notes that women workers throughout the EU are almost twice as likely to be earning the minimum wage than men.  Some 60% of all workers on minimum pay are women, including in Ireland, and the proportion is up to 70% in some member states.  Addressing the inadequacy of our minimum wage, which is currently at 80% of the at-risk-of-poverty threshold, will positively contribute to gender equality, narrow the gender pay and pension gaps and lift large numbers of women out of in-work poverty.  Specifically, the EU impact assessment estimates that Ireland's gender pay gap will decline by almost 10% when Ireland increases its minimum wage to 60% of the hourly median wage.  Some member states are taking swift action to raise their wage floors towards more adequate levels.  Earlier this year the German Government and Parliament took the decision to increase the minimum wage from &euro;9.60 an hour in December 2021 to &euro;12 by October 2022, a rise of 25%, which is approximately 60% of Germany's median hourly wage.  In our submissions to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment consultation on the phase-in of the living wage and to the Low Pay Commission on the hourly rate of the minimum wage in 2023, we too recommended swift action and that the minimum wage becomes the living wage.<\/p><p>Congress reiterates this recommendation to the committee today.  While we do not dispute that certain sectors will face a larger potential increase in their wage bill compared to the estimated 1% overall wage bill increase, we draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the European Commission&rsquo;s impact assessment finding that the negative impacts on SMEs are expected to be limited.<\/p><p> A third area is collective bargaining and recommendation No. 35.  From our point of view, this is a really important recommendation from the citizens' assembly.  Collective bargaining is a key means whereby employers and trade unions can establish fair wages and working conditions and provide the basis for sound labour relations.  Collective bargaining agendas have broadened over time to address issues such as workplace discrimination and sexual harassment, equal pay and opportunities, the care responsibilities of workers and the impact of domestic violence in the workplace.  All workers should have the right to influence and shape the conditions under which they work, yet today in Ireland many workers are denied this fundamental right.  Its importance is illustrated by the recent pay deal in the early years sector, which came into effect just last week.  Some 70% of the 27,000 workers, predominantly women, in that sector received a pay increase after that pay deal.<\/p><p>A couple of processes are under way that have the potential to address this serious decent work deficit.  The EU directive on minimum wages will strengthen and extend the coverage of collective bargaining by obliging member states with fewer than 80% of workers covered by these agreements to take active steps to promote this tool.  This directive has the potential to positively transform the landscape for collective bargaining in Ireland.  On foot of this requirement, work is very advanced on a high level group established through the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF.  If we are to achieve goal 8 of the sustainable development goals and provide decent work for all, we must grasp these opportunities to finally introduce a mature industrial relations system.<\/p><p> Increased resourcing of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, is an important recommendation.  The WRC is currently operating with around 50 labour inspectors.  There is an urgent need to increase this number.  It was agreed as part of the previous social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, to increase the number of inspectors to at least 90.  In the meantime, the workforce has grown to an all-time high of more than 2.5 million people.<\/p><p> On the statutory right to reasonable access to flexible working, Congress led the campaign for a statutory right to request remote working.  As unions, we see daily the huge benefits remote working is having for workers and their families, businesses, communities and the environment.  We welcome the commitment from the T&aacute;naiste to introduce workers&rsquo; rights on how employers handle requests for remote working arrangements and we are working with the officials in his Department to amend his Bill to make it fit for purpose. <\/p><p> However, unions are concerned by the emergence of a work-life balance privilege gap between workers in jobs that can be done remotely and workers in jobs requiring a physical presence.  To reduce the potential for a two-tier workforce between the remote working haves and have-nots, ICTU has been calling for workers&rsquo; rights in requesting all types of flexible working arrangements, not just remote, that is, arrangements such as flexi-time, part-time, job shares, split shifts, compressed hours, etc.  This is already a long-established workers' right in the UK and in EU peer countries.  We raised this in our evidence to the citizen&rsquo;s assembly and we are delighted it made the introduction of a statutory right to request flexible working one of its recommendations. <\/p><p> A 2019 EU directive on work-life balance gives carers and parents of young children a right to request flexible work.  It is our view that limiting this right is a lost opportunity and the right to request flexible working arrangements should be available to all workers.  Earlier this year, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, published the heads of a Bill to give effect to the directive.

In our discussions around sick leave, the argument was made that workers needed to provide sick certificates from doctors because if employers were going to pay, they had the right to request proof of illness or that the employee was unfit to work.  If we follow that argument in relation to employers paying for time off for domestic violence leave, should they require proof?  However, it is being reported that while employers will pay for domestic violence leave days, a clawback will be put in place and the Government will reimburse the employer.  The reason employers will be asked to pay initially is that the employee receives the payment in the next payroll and that does not become a barrier to a person taking the leave.  If there is no actual out-of-pocket cost to the employer, this is further reason that it be based on an honour system whereby people approach their employer and state they need to exercise their right to domestic leave.  Whether it is for a half day to see a solicitor or to look for accommodation, it should be an honour system and a person should be taken at her or his word.  Systems will be put in place by this Bill to look back after a year to see how it has worked.  There will be an opportunity to re-evaluate.  However, in the first instance, especially where no out-of-pocket expenses are incurred by employers, we should move forward and start with an honour system.  We can look back after a year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Bambrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":841,"content":"<p>Can I ask one supplementary question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#E00600","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":842,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Bambrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":843,"content":"<p>Did ICTU get involved with the public consultation?

It is the first of what I hope are few to come.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on two specific areas.  The first is the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  We now have the lowest level of unemployment, essentially, since records began.  The WRC is a vital component of workers' rights sitting in tandem with those going to work.  In the ICTU submission, it was recommended that the resources for more effective enforcement of current employment law be increased and that the number of labour inspectors needed to be increased from the current 50.  Under the last social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, a number of 90 was agreed.  I ask this question because we now have more people in employment and by default, a corresponding increase is needed in those reconciliation and conciliation processes.  However, at the same time, this entity is charged with examining and enforcing housing discrimination.  How can 50 labour inspectors under the WRC possibly be in a position to meet the needs of all those additional employees?<\/p> <p>  Why has that number not increased?  It is a very specific number.  It is almost double the current number of inspectors.  Why has that not happened?<\/p> <p>  Making a complaint is an onerous experience and is not something I have seen an employee do on a whim.  It is very stressful.  It can be a daunting experience.  From the witnesses' experience, what is the average time from the complaint being made to the conclusion, including the initial waiting period?  What other resources does the WRC need to expedite cases, outside of labour inspectors?  <\/p> <p>  New processes are in place.  We have an increase in employment.  We have equality complaints.  These are all new since that Towards 2016 target was put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#E01500","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":851,"content":"<p>Why has it not happened and what do they need to make it happen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#E01600","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":852,"content":"<p>I will begin and Dr. Bambrick can chip in.  Towards 2016 was the title of the last social partnership agreement which was agreed in 2008 or 2009.  I do not remember exactly, but it was a number of years ago.  Of course, it was never fully implemented because we had the financial crisis and all that transpired from there.  Therefore the agreement fell into abeyance but it is the only target on the public record.  We hope that there will be movement towards it.  The Deputy is correct that 50 labour inspectors in completely inadequate for the size of our labour market now.  It has long been recognised that an increase is needed.  Getting to 90 would be a start and then we will see where we go from there.<\/p> <p>  I do not have the figure to hand of the average times of complaints.  I do know that serious efforts were made to improve the system through the overhaul of those bodies.  However, the Deputy is right that a body charged with hearing cases right across the employment field but also in equal status cases etc. needs huge resources.  It is a challenging environment for people to take any case into and of course justice delayed is justice denied.  <\/p> <p>  Obviously we work to try and ensure that cases do not reach that stage.  We try to solve issues in workplaces through negotiation and representations etc.  However, for people who decide that they have reached the end of that possibility, the WRC should be a place they can go to ensure their rights are vindicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#E01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Joyce"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":853,"content":"<p>And in a timely manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#E01800","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":854,"content":"<p>Yes.

The report outlines the types of cases brought before the WRC and the timeline.  As I said, it not an area in which I work, but in other fora I encounter colleagues who do work in this area and at every opportunity, they make the case for increasing the number of labour inspectors proportionate to the massive growth in the size of the workforce.  It is not just that unemployment has decreased.  We have more people than ever before at work and the number of labour inspectors should be proportionate.

In the scenario where the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, is under resourced, there is the employee from among the general public who is not getting being heard in a timely manner but on the other side there are the employees of the WRC who are under an immense amount of pressure.

I have been before the WRC as part of my professional role and it does excellent work.  The inspectors do absolutely excellent work in putting the workers front and centre.

As I said, we fought to get inclusion of that in the convention.  I draw Senator O'Reilly's attention to recommendation 206 which accompanies the convention and goes into more detail in terms of providing advice to governments on the steps they might take on implementing the convention.  As well as leave for victims of domestic violence, it references things like flexible work arrangements; protection for victims of domestic violence; temporary protection against dismissal for victims of domestic violence as appropriate; the inclusion of domestic violence in workplace risk assessments; a referral system to public mitigation measures for domestic violence where they exist; and awareness raising about the effects of domestic violence.  There are areas there that could also inform how we address this issue.<\/p> <p>  Senator Pauline O'Reilly and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, have done great work in getting this on the agenda.

He has to work on including the transposition of the work-life balance directive.  He has taken action to ensure the gender pay gap reporting system that is now in place.<\/p> <p>  On childcare, Senator Pauline O'Reilly touched on an important point in her intervention that the pay deal and the introduction of core funding went hand in hand.  Without the increased levels of core funding, the pay deal could not have happened.

The vast majority of providers have opted in to the core funding and to pay that deal.  The Senator is right that it is the first step.

Progress is being made but there is still an awful lot more to do.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting that the citizens' assembly recommendations were around gender-neutral recruitment.  I am conscious of industries where there is a low number of people of one gender.  To be very stereotypical, we might take the construction sector which has low female participation or some of the caring professions where there is low male participation.  Does ICTU have any specific recommendations organisations could take on about gender-neutral recruitment?<\/p> <p>  On dispute resolution, does ICTU have any anecdotal evidence of whether those in the minority gender in a given field experience the dispute resolution procedures differently than their colleagues?  I imagine there is discrimination at all levels but I am thinking about the understanding of how gender might play into the nature of any dispute, be it constructive dismissal, a Payment of Wages Act claim or whatever?  Do the witnesses have any comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#G00300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":867,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's second point, I am not aware of any research that has been undertaken on multiple discrimination, such as grounds of race and gender, but we would expect to see it higher.  It would emphasise the point that it is important we get migrant workers into trade unions and get them aware of their rights, especially if they are newly arrived or are coming in on employment permits and might not be aware of their rights in an Irish context.  We say your union is your best protection for that.  Am I aware of any hard facts and evidence percentages that it is more likely for a person?  I am not aware that has been taking place.  I imagine the UK has better evidence and usually that is a good indication of where we are.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's other point was about a better gender mix and being gender-blind in reporting.  The best way to attract men into predominantly female sectors is to improve wages because once a particular sector becomes feminised, the wages and conditions tend to be diluted; they go hand-in-hand.  Attracting men into what is now a heavily female sector is about improving wages and conditions.  In the reverse situations, some good work is being done through the apprentice system.  Though more men go into apprenticeships, there has been massive improvement in recent years and we are seeing more women going into apprenticeships, though I do not have the figures to hand.  That is partly because the range of apprenticeships has been broadened.  If you are going to have a hairdressing apprenticeship and a healthcare one you are more likely to see women in them.  There is much work being done by State agencies on getting women to come in and do their apprenticeships for bus driving and mechanical engineering because they are good jobs.  If we can get young women, some of whom are early school leavers or have done the leaving certificate but are not interested in college, into apprenticeships or trades that is a family wage, so if their circumstances-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Bambrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":868,"content":"<p>I imagine though that pay alone is not the only tool we need to improve the gender balance in some sectors.

I accept her point that if pay is improved, that will improve attractiveness but if the reverse was true, we would have more women in high-paying positions and that is not the case and, therefore, I imagine we need to have those apprenticeship and entry supports on both sides.  Teaching, for example, is something that does not attract as many men as we would like to see.  During the periods when there was very high unemployment especially, many men considered caring professions for the first time out of economic necessity but they found them hugely rewarding and found a real niche for themselves in that space because there were so few men there.  Where personal care is required, often a man-on-man scenario was more comfortable than a female care assistant bathing a man or whatever.  I found that really awakening because out of economic necessity they were applying for jobs they had never thought about before but if they had been supported and encouraged many of them would have seriously considered it.

Lots of people would like to see a more publicly-provided model and great early childcare providers, especially in disadvantaged communities, are publicly provided.  The difficulty is how we phase out a system where people are employed by private operators.  Often these people are doing it because they love it and they are small providers.

I thank the Senator.  The way we calculate a living wage can fall into two areas.  I am sure the committee is aware of this.  Do we go for the basket of goods and see what are the goods and services a person needs to be able to live an adequate and decent life, how much does that cost and how much does that work out at an hourly limit, or do we do it in a way that we tack it to a certain percentage of all wages in the economy?  ICTU has come on for the fixed threshold approach, which is the percentage approach.  We feel that going for the basket of goods approach is open and very subjective.  It would be based on focus groups deciding what the low-income worker should buy.  It would not be responsive enough.  When we consider the cost-of-living crisis we are in now, one would have to gather together a lot of focus groups, get them to agree what should be in the basket of goods and price it up, and then calculate it.  Whereas, if we peg it to what is happening to wages in the economy it is much easier and it is much more responsive.  It gives better certainty to employers and employees.  ICTU's recommendation would be that instead of it being 60% it would be 66%.  Why do we say that?  It is because 60% of the median wage is just the poverty line, whereas 66% is the low-income line.  If a person is earning below two thirds of the median wage then he or she is considered, by all of the research and statistician agencies both national and international, to be a low-income worker.  If our goal is to eradicate low pay from the economy, the living wage should be at 60% median wage.  The benefit of this is that at 66% of median wage it is very close to what the level is for the basket of goods.  We would be getting the best of both worlds.  We would be pegging it to a fixed threshold approach, but we know at that level it would be high enough to eradicate low pay from the Irish economy and, in turn, the EU.  We know that it would also be sufficient to provide that minimum essential standard of living, that minimum essential standard of living approach basket of goods.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Bambrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":880,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt, but I hope the committee will hear that loud and clear.

With the minimum wage legislation, if an employer can prove that it would be detrimental to their business to pay the wage floor, they can go to the Labour Court with that evidence. To date, no employer has ever gone to the Labour Court.  The main thing is that this is not a national policy.  We are policy takers in this regard.  The EU rules are telling us that this is the direction of travel, and that we must ensure our minimum wages are adequate.  As mentioned in our opening statement, Ireland's minimum wage is currently only at 80%.  It is 20% under the poverty line.  Ireland is not alone in that, with 19 of the 21 EU countries having minimum wages set below the poverty line.<\/p><p>That is why the EU had to step in and give firm guidelines on how to set our minimum wage at an adequate level.

They may have been working slightly fewer hours but they received the same or greater pay than previously.

It is time we moved past the anecdotal narrative about what might happen and instead pointed out that we have a mechanism for these exceptions and that the rule needs to be adequate.<\/p> <p>  I do not want the meeting to get lost in this question but I have a concern around the median approach.  A great mistake was made by the Low Pay Commission when it was established.  I was on the National Women's Council of Ireland at the time and we pushed to get the word \"adequacy\" included in the terms of reference.  We did not succeed in having \"adequacy\" made a consideration of the commission when deciding the minimum wage.  The effect of that would be seen later.  I will be very concerned if we end up with living wage legislation that does not view adequacy as being how people can live well, especially when we talk about pinning the living wage to the median wage.  I always highlight the median wage because it tells us half of the population earn below that level.  Usually, especially when it comes to tax policies, we only hear about the average wage, which is usually much higher because it is pushed up by those on much higher incomes.  It is interesting that when it comes to pinning something to a percentage that is determined by the median rather than average wage, the median wage suddenly makes an appearance.<\/p> <p>  My concern is that a percentage of the median wage does not work well in circumstances where over half the population sinks into poverty wages, which we can unfortunately see happen in different parts of the world.  Even in Ireland at times, 50% of the population has been at risk of poverty.  I am concerned about using a blunt market figure as the determinant of the living wage.  We need a belt-and-braces approach of looking at that but also checking it against adequacy measures, such as minimum essential standards of living.<\/p> <p>  The living wage legislation is in the programme for Government but not in the priority legislation for autumn.  I ask the witnesses to give their sense of when that legislation is likely to come through.  It will need further discussion and I am interested to make sure it gets over the line.  While the T&aacute;naiste said it would take four years, the citizens' assembly said it should be done by 2025, so it clearly expects it to be done in the next three years.  The cost-of-living crunch pushes it further up the line.  The minimal essential standards of living are an important tool in tackling the cost of living because they allow us to look at collective and public services that can address some of those costs.<\/p> <p>  We may have gone too deep into this so I will pull back and ask two or three specific questions on gender issues.  On collective bargaining, the witnesses mentioned the EU directive.  Will they comment on the importance of ensuring a right to collective bargaining is enshrined in national law?  That has been sought for a long time and it is important.  On a related issue, the tax relief for trade union contributions was removed, while members of a business and professional body still get tax relief.  I ask for comment on enshrining the right to membership of a trade union in law and supporting it as a public good that leads to better outcomes for society.<\/p> <p>  We had a discussion with the ESRI about the importance of collective action in sectors with a large number of women, which are often areas of low wages.  It is not just about individual rights but also collective thresholds.  The sectoral order on childcare was mentioned but I am concerned that this  only came about because the funding to the sector comes from the State.  Will the witnesses comment on the joint labour committees, which were important but have been pushed back, and the need for something similar in areas like hospitality, which have a high proportion of women workers and are low paid?  It is not a matter of State subsidy in this area; we just need to look at the hard measures for bringing a sectoral pay scale up.  In childcare, the State is the largest customer so we have a particular lever.  In other areas, we may need legislative measures.<\/p> <p>  The pensions issue is related to the pay gap.  The pay gap knocks on and becomes part of a wider pension gap.  A number of the citizens' assembly recommendations were around pensions.  The ESRI noted that we are seeing a great deal in the media about the PRSI fund running out.  The Commission on Pensions gave no consideration to the large amount of money spent every year - I think it is &euro;2.9 billion - on private pension tax relief.  Will the witnesses comment on that relief and the need to factor it into our public spending on pensions?  What do they think is key to ensuring gender equality in terms of the pensions pay gap?  The ESRI acknowledged that the private pension tax relief as currently constructed is regressive and predominantly benefits men.  How can we ensure we route that money into what the citizens called for, namely, a universal State pension?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#J00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":891,"content":"<p>There is a lot there so perhaps the witnesses will divide up the questions for answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#J00500","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":892,"content":"<p>I can kick off on collective bargaining.

They got a reduced-rate State contributory pension.  We know that previous changes moved things backwards for many women and led to many cuts for women in the actual pensions they received every year.  I would really like to know what ICTU proposes and what it thinks on the proposals for pensions with regard to ensuring gender equality.  It is one of the key demands, and one of the key areas in respect of which we have recommendations.  It is one on which ICTU will have a very important voice.  What does ICTU propose in terms of gender equality in pensions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#K00600","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":899,"content":"<p>For the occupational pension, we support the recommendation that we move to an exempt-exempt tax model.

I have some questions, so I will take up the next slot.  I thank the witnesses for the broad array of issues they have covered in response to the queries of colleagues.  We can see the high level of engagement we have among the membership of the committee, notwithstanding that many of them are also on other committees with parallel hearings today, including the Committee of Public Accounts and the British-Irish forum.  I apologise to the witnesses that members have not been able to attend.<\/p> <p>  I want to raise a number of issues, one of which is the gender pay gap.  As Mr. Joyce said it is an area in which I have a real interest.  The Bill I produced had a different mechanism in it.  I am very interested in the Act that will be coming into effect.  Like Mr. Joyce, I am disappointed that we still do not have quite a sufficient level of detail as to how it will be implemented.  I want to follow up on the more detailed recommendations about the gender pay gap and how gender pay gap audit systems would evolve.<\/p><p>Are there good models elsewhere as to how we can audit progress?  How can we ensure action will be taken on foot of disclosures of the gender pay gap?  I have looked at models elsewhere, in Australia, Britain and so on, to see how it is done.  It is crucial to ensuring the legislation will be effective.  How can we build on the legislation to make progress on narrowing the gap?<\/p><p> One of the issues relates to the living wage and one of ICTU's comments, which was helpful, concerned how the gender pay gap will decline when Ireland increases its minimum wage to 60% of the hourly median, which is a helpful approach in itself.<\/p><p> I was taken by our guests' submission on the work-life balance privilege gap, that is, the vast gap between those who can work remotely and those who cannot, which was very important earlier during Covid.  How can we best address that?  I am looking at the citizens' assembly recommendation No. 36, concerning a statutory right to reasonable access to flexible working.  Our guests pointed out that in our peer countries in the EU, there is a recognition that flexible working does not just mean remote and there are flexi-time and part-time job shares, split shifts and so on.  How can we ensure that is done?  The assembly is looking for a statutory right; how can we build that into legislation most effectively?<\/p><p> Colleagues have talked about the domestic violence leave provision.  While this is not specifically referred to in the assembly recommendations, it could be encompassed under the domestic and sexual and gender-based violence recommendations.  I also have a Private Member's Bill before the Seanad on reproductive health-related leave, which, like the domestic violence Private Member's Bill, builds on the Organisation of Working Time Act and has a similar provision regarding the right to time off work for early miscarriage and for reproductive health-related treatments.  The Bill was prompted by Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, work, with Alison Gilliland and her INTO colleagues surveying members to find that this was badly needed, not least in a highly feminised sector such as primary teaching.  Our guests might comment on that.<\/p><p> Finally, there was a recommendation that parental and maternity leave, and family benefits in general, be paid as a percentage of earnings, and I am very interested in that.  It is not covered specifically in the assembly recommendations but I am interested by our guests&rsquo; suggestion that that would be the most effective way of encouraging stronger take-up, by men and women, of family leave provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#K01400","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":908,"content":"<p>On the gender pay gap, we will learn a lot over the coming months.

There are also plans for an online reporting system in 2023, as I understand.<\/p> <p>  This is a new area for us and we have not been involved in it before.  We looked to the experience in other countries, such as the UK and elsewhere, where similar legislation is in place.

The figures are very nitty-gritty and our guide, which we will publish on Monday, goes into some detail on how they are all calculated and what is involved, so I will not go into all that here.  The figures will be accompanied by a narrative whereby the employer will have to indicate what it intends to do to address any gaps that are identified, and that is the key.<\/p> <p>  Disappointingly from our point of view, the regulations talk about a statement setting out, in the employer's opinion, what this is and how it might be addressed.

We do not claim to have all the answers in this area but, likewise, employers do not have them either, so if we combine our efforts and discuss any gaps and what might be done to address them, that would be important.  While the regulations do not require that, most good employers would recognise it would be important to discuss the findings of any audit with workers and their representatives.

In the case of other countries throughout Europe, including Britain and Northern Ireland, that have rights to request flexible working, they are built in as part of a flexible working Bill.  When we met and gave our evidence to the citizens' assembly, it was before the T&aacute;naiste's commitment to legislating.  We had assumed that the vehicle for giving a right to request remote working would be about extending the EU directive that gives the parents of children up to the age of eight - the Minister is going to extend that to parents of children up to the age of 12 - and people with a caring responsibility this right for flexible working.<\/p> <p>  ICTU argued it should be given to all workers, who would then have the right to work remotely but it would also mean workers in jobs where remote working is not practical or cannot be facilitated would be able to have the work-life balance premium that those of us who are lucky enough to be able to work remotely can have, whether that is about working term-time hours when children are in school or taking off time when the worker does not work part time.  Of course, this has to be done hand in glove with the employer making sure that can be facilitated.  We are going to have legislation on a statutory right to flexible working.  Our only difficulty with that is that it will apply to a narrow group of workers.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of earnings-related parental and paternity leave, the take-up of these new leave options, important as they have been, has been disappointingly low among new fathers.  Where we see better take-up is where the employer tops up the &euro;250 allowance.  Having a new baby is one of the most expensive times in a family's lifetime, and having two parents out of work on a flat &euro;250 is just not practical.  If the mother is in a job that does not provide a top-up, the father will not be able to take leave.  We believe that both maternity and paternity leave should be income paid as a percentage of the parent's wage, exactly as it done throughout Europe.  We spent a lot of time talking about the tax recommendations of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, but it has made some really good welfare recommendations, one of which related to the fact that if we are to introduce pay-related jobseeker's benefit, that should extended to family leave, which we very much welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Bambrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":910,"content":"<p>That is very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#L00400","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":911,"content":"<p>I very much agree with Dr. Bambrick's last point.

The EU directive on adequate minimum wage and collective bargaining rights will come into operation the next few months.  It will then have to be transposed into Irish legislation.  Is Irish domestic legislation adequate?  Will the ICTU representatives comment on that?  Collective bargaining is such a gender issue.  I was contacted recently by a young woman.  She had started a job five months earlier and was on a six-month probation.  She moved department in the same company and was told that her probation would be extended.  I asked if there is a union, and there is not.  There is no right to collective bargaining where she works.  If the right was there and there was a union representative in the company, and someone could go to a shop steward or union rep, in many cases the employer might not chance doing something like that.  There was no change to her job and she was still in the same company; she had literally just moved desks and has the same manager.

It guarantees a right to collective bargaining and protection for those who engage or who wish to engage in collective bargaining too.  Any country with coverage of less than 80% in terms of collective bargaining agreements will also have to take a number of actions, including the development of a national action plan to promote collective bargaining.  The work that is going on in LEEF is to consider how some of those issues might be addressed locally here in Ireland.

It is no surprise that our colleagues in F&oacute;rsa have been central to and leading on the Four Day Week Ireland campaign.  It is doing that with a range of civic society groups including the National Women's Council of Ireland, recognising as the Senator said, the need for more care time with family and other caring responsibilities.  There are also the environmental benefits if we do not have to travel.  As we were discussing, not everyone will have the benefit of remote working.  It is important, and very important for those with caring responsibilities, but we should be careful not to create a hierarchy of workers that are more deserving of flexibility, such as people who have children or aged and dependent parents.  Workers should have the right to as much free time as is possible and to get the benefits from technological advances so that we are working smarter and we are all getting that free time and that the amount of time spent in work is reduced but not the amount of work output.  That should not be just for those that have caring responsibilities.  It should be there for whatever way people chose to spend their free time whether it is sea swimming, baking banana bread or whatever.  The more flexibility we get into the workforce the more it will benefit, especially in keeping women in those caring years in work.<br\/><br\/>While the Minister is introducing the flexibility directive for carers and parents of young children, we think it is really important that the first move should go to workers aged 55 years because that is often when women come under a great deal of pressure.  They may have an older spouse that needs care and then parents are living longer.  They are being forced out of work, and forced to retire, earlier than they would have chosen.  If they had a right to flexibility they could have a right to request part-time hours or maybe flexitime, so start later in the day or end earlier so that they can check in on the aged parents and things like that.  We think that if we have to do this as a step-change it should be to give flexibility to those over 55 years of age because that is where the workers start to drop out of the workforce.  People might not be able to do nine to five, five days a week but they could do a shorter working week, whether that is a four day working week or shorter days.

We know that the right to request remote work Bill has gone through pre-legislative scrutiny.  I agree with the principle that we do not want to have a two-tier approach on flexibility.  The citizens' assembly recommended flexible working in the wider sense and not solely remote working.  Should we try to enhance the right to request remote work Bill and deal with some of the issues there or should we bring forward other legislation and put that in train as early as possible?  Do the witnesses have further comments as to the instruments that would give effect to this?  The flexibility directive was mentioned, which was useful.  Can we tackle some of these points through the right to request remote work Bill?<\/p> <p>  As a follow-up to the pensions piece, I have read the total contributions submission.  I was on the social protection committee when we produced our report on those issues.  I am looking for a short follow-up note on the gender analysis, the issues of gender equality and the recommendations.  There is a valuable perspective to be added on that.<\/p> <p>  We talked about the question of addressing the gender division in terms of professions and who is employed in what sectors.  When we talked about terms and conditions, it was mainly about flexibility.  What perspective does the ICTU have around the measures on progressions, which came up throughout the citizens' assembly recommendations?  This was mentioned in respect of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation figures.  It is not just around ensuring women or men can access areas of employment.  It is about ensuring that progression opportunities are built in, in order that people get equal chances to move up the ladder and that the situation does not arise whereby women are pooled at one level of a sector, facing additional obstacles in moving up.  We look leadership and entry roles but that mid-level piece is often left out.  The witnesses' perspectives on that would be valuable to gain.<\/p> <p>  While it is great that we might come up with a big action plan on enhancing union membership, it is something everybody should be looking at.  Part of a good democracy is the encouragement of union membership.  A measure that we should not have to wait for a new task force to come up with is the tax credit for union membership, which was previously in place but was removed as a cost-cutting measure.  It was cut as part of an bord snip and the general recessionary cost-cutting measures.  Membership of a professional body is still a tax relief one can access.  I have been pushing for this for years.  We are now at another budget.  Would it not be a positive step in the right direction to restore the tax relief for union memberships?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#N00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":924,"content":"<p>Many of us have been calling for that.

Two items of legislation are making their way through the Oireachtas, namely, the legislation to transpose the directive, the work life balance Bill, and the T&aacute;naiste's right to request remote work Bill.  As I mentioned, we were quite surprised that the Minister went with a stand-alone Bill on remote working.  All other countries that have the provision for the right to request remote working have it as part of their flexible working rights.  In our meetings with the Ministers and officials in both Departments, we have stressed that there should be no difference in the way workers access remote working, be it through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's legislation or the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth's legislation.  The requirements should be the same on in both Bills.  However, it seems very inefficient to have two items of legislation that could be done in one.  In order to provide for remote working in the flexible arrangements, they would have to give the right to flexible working to all workers which, of course, we want.  That would also be the most efficient way to do it and the way we would welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Bambrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":926,"content":"<p>Again, that is clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022092200002#N00500","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":927,"content":"<p>Will anyone comment on the progression piece?

I am chief commissioner of IHREC, Ireland's independent national human rights institution and national equality body.  I am joined by Ms Kilpatrick and Ms McGahey.  When the three of us appear together, I feel like we hit the record for the number of times a person can say the word \"commission\" in five minutes.<\/p> <p>  The Belfast Good Friday Agreement is really and truly foundational to the rights and equality framework for the island of Ireland.<\/p><p>The agreement instigated the establishment of the two Northern Ireland commissions, and one of IHREC's legacy bodies, which is the former Irish Human Rights Commission.<\/p><p> The agreement also specified the establishment of a joint committee of the two human rights commissions.  That joint committee serves as a forum to discuss and address rights and equality issues that affect the island of Ireland.  It took on an additional fervour following the 2016 UK referendum decision as we carried out significant work to identify and address the human rights and equality implications of Brexit.  This work saw us engage directly and frequently with parties in London, Brussels, Dublin and Belfast.<\/p><p> Joined now by our colleagues in the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, our three institutions continue this work today in our efforts to oversee and report on the implications of Brexit for rights and equality for everybody on the island.  As members will know, the EU-UK withdrawal agreement contains a protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which aims to address the unique circumstances on this island in terms of Brexit.<\/p><p> In Article 2, the UK Government commits explicitly to ensuring that no diminution of certain rights, safeguards or equality of opportunity, as set out in the relevant chapter of the Good Friday Agreement, results from its withdrawal from the EU, including in the area of protection against discrimination as enshrined in EU law.  Article 2 specifies that this commitment be implemented through dedicated mechanisms.  It commits the UK Government to facilitating the work of the two Northern Ireland commissions, as well as the joint committee of IHREC and the NIHRC.  Additional statutory powers have been conferred on the two commissions to act as such dedicated mechanisms.<\/p><p> Article 2 also sets all three commissions to work on providing oversight of, and to report on, rights and equality issues that have an island-of-Ireland dimension.  To co-ordinate our efforts we have built a framework to govern our Article 2 work and established a joint working group to drive it.  Last November, we also met as three full commissions to review and plan our work.<\/p><p> Building on this framework, the focus of the two dedicated mechanism units in the NIHRC and the ECNI is now on understanding and engaging with the very significant issues we are seeing following the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU.  The rights and equality issues are multiple, as is evident in research by the commissions in areas such as human trafficking and divergence of rights on the island.  My colleagues in the two commissions will say more to these concerns.<\/p><p> In addition to parliamentary engagement to raise awareness and understanding of Article 2 and our commissions&rsquo; roles therein, which has included regular appearances before the Northern Ireland Assembly Committee for the Executive Office, an appearance before the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU last year and proactive engagement with North-South civil society.  For example, we held a Rights After Brexit event with the Centre for Cross Border Studies in May 2021, and an event in Derry with a focus on minority ethnic groups, migrant people and Border communities in March of this year.  These events have been invaluable opportunities for our organisations to connect with civil society, and to learn from the experience of rights holders who are most impacted by Brexit, particularly the communities on both sides of the Border whose day-to-day lives are hugely affected.<\/p><p> Finally, I want to mention our engagement on policy issues.  The one I want to highlight here concerns the UK Nationality and Borders Act. As members will know, the Act provides a basis for the UK to introduce an electronic travel authorisation or ETA regime.  ETAs would essentially require everyone wishing to travel to the UK, bar British and Irish citizens, to seek permission in advance of travel.  This provision would affect a significant number of individuals who do not hold a recognised UK immigration status despite the current system allowing them free travel across the Border to shop, work, access services or visit family.  This gives rise to serious equality and rights concerns, about which we jointly wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, specifically on how ETAs may affect the right to private and family life of people in Border communities; may undermine the protocol commitment to avoiding a hard border, and related checks and controls; and may create the potential for racial profiling to result from associated checks.  The potential for racial profiling is particularly concerning given reports of selective passport checks happening on buses that cross the Ireland-Northern Ireland Border.  We, in IHREC, have engaged about this matter with the Policing Authority and the Garda Commissioner's office.  The Policing Authority has raised this matter in its meetings with the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p> I have given a quick overview of our framework and a few examples of some of our joint activity, which we will detail in a full joint activity report that we will publish in the coming months.  Ms Kilpatrick and Ms McGahey will go into more programmatic detail of the rights and equality issues that they are scoping and addressing.<\/p><p> As I hope members can see, we have a very positive working relationship.  Our institutions share a collective commitment to protect and promote rights and equality for everyone on this island.  Our joint work is more important now than ever given, for example, the new UK Prime Minister&rsquo;s stated willingness to withdraw the UK from the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR.  The ECHR is an essential part of the Good Friday Agreement.  We cannot allow the equality and human rights framework that underpins peace on this island to be a matter of interpretation when it is already set out in an international agreement.  It was positive to see the Taoiseach&rsquo;s early engagement with the new Prime Minister this week in London.  Such engagement needs to be sustained and direct with the Prime Minister to ensure that human rights and equality see no diminution and indeed, see protections grow as the UK and Ireland&rsquo;s continuing relationship post Brexit is forged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022092200002#B00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":947,"content":"<p>I thank the chief commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022092200002#C00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":948,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee on behalf of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.  I am very sorry that I am unable to join the meeting in person and I am sure I am missing out by not being there.<\/p> <p>  Ms Gibney has outlined the contours of Article 2 of the protocol very well and I will not repeat any of that.  As members already know, the protocol was hard won and provides valuable protection against the extremes of Brexit.  However, the protocol is neither comprehensive nor foolproof in how it defends humans rights.  As our time is short, and I have many examples that we may get to later, I will restrict my opening remarks to outlining a few of the most pressing risks to the Good Friday Agreement human rights commitments but bearing in mind the interests of this committee.  I must start by mentioning the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill.  While we welcome the UK Government's stated commitment that the no-diminution provision in the protocol is \"non-controversial\", the Bill itself undermines the strengths and reliability of that commitment, which obviously gives us some grave concerns. <\/p> <p>  The Bill offers a degree of protection, whereby Ministers may not classify protocol Article 2 as an excluded provision.  In other words, the Bill purports to prevent a departure from Article 2 but the actual provisions of the Bill go on to weaken that very protection in quite a considerable way.  For example, the Bill states that UK courts will no longer be bound by decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  That is a difficulty when it is the UK Government's duty to keep pace with the six equality directives in Annex 1 to the protocol, so that is a directly contrary undertaking compared with the protocol commitment.  The most immediate impact on the Good Friday Agreement is an undermining of the application and enforcement of rights.  I am sure that I do not need to remind members that these rights are central to that agreement.<\/p> <p>  Next, and probably the most obvious, is the risk posed to the Bill of Rights legislation, which has been mentioned and I am sure that we will hear more about today.  It is a repeal of the Human Rights Act and this is much more than technical amendments to \"rebalance rights\".  The Bill changes, and I would say that it critically weakens, the substance, application and enforcement of rights.  Consequently, rather than bringing rights home, as the Human Rights Act was meant to do and as we were told at the time, the Bill has sent many of them packing along with those who claim these rights.  While I accept there has been a reprieve, depending on whom one reads, by the parking or shelving of this Bill, the UK Government has not resiled from the policy objectives reflected in the Bill so we cannot assume that it is not going to be reimposed.  If the Bill is returned to, or a different approach is taken but with a similar intention, the commission is deeply concerned about the effect on fundamental rights in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Consequently, despite the shelving of the Bill, I will take a brief moment to share a few words on it now.<\/p><p>Perhaps I can reflect our concerns better by saying there will be real consequences to this Bill, whether in part or piecemeal, in that there will be a hierarchy of rights and rights holders - it is clear to me that is partly the intention of the Bill - which is the very thing human rights is meant to protect us all from.  By way of deliberate provision, people will be made unequal.  Human rights will no longer be universally applied.  We have to remember the creation of a system in which rights are universally enjoyed was the signal purpose of the universal declaration and everything else that it follows.  This is very significant.  It is easy to over-quote \"existential survival\" but it really is that.  Human rights value everybody equally, even if others do not.  This Bill threatens that very value.<\/p><p> Added to that, this Bill, or policy intention, limits people's access to court to complain about the breaches, which in themselves are probably limited.  That is another bedrock of democracy and human rights that will be severely limited.  That needs to be remembered in the context of the general mood and direction of travel, which I am sure McGahey will also discuss this afternoon.  If a victim eventually makes it to court, and that prospect is much more unlikely, with a complaint about a breach, that court will no longer have to follow European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, Strasbourg case law in the way it previously did.  We, as the dedicated mechanism, considered very specifically whether that would result in an actionable breach of protocol Article 2.  In those deliberations and in the advice we received, we did not identify a direct actionable breach on the face of the Bill, but we noted and have communicated our concern about the downgrading of Strasbourg case law and the likely consequences of that.  In my view, that will lead to a diminishing in standards without more.  That in itself is significant enough to be taken very seriously.<\/p><p> The standards are already at a minimum.  They are not high.  Members will recall that the Good Friday Agreement provided for a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  That was to be ECHR plus, where the circumstances of Northern Ireland required it.  Instead, this Bill indicates not only that a Northern Ireland Bill of rights is unlikely but it removes the closest thing anyone has to an actual Bill of rights, which is the Human Rights Act.  Protocol Article 2 provides a degree of certainty and stability at a difficult time in Northern Ireland and must be retained.  It is, however, insufficient alone.  It is simply no substitute for the Human Rights Act and certainly not an alternative to the bill of rights for Northern Ireland. <\/p><p> I am speeding through and will speed up even more.  I will mention the Nationality and Borders Act.  The three commissions have flagged many concerns about it.  I will restate our very grave concerns regarding the impact on the protection of trafficked persons.  It is our joint assessment that the trafficking directive is within the scope of protocol Article 2, which means the no diminution commitment in the protocol should apply.  We have identified several ways in which the Nationality and Borders Act may breach minimum standards laid out in that directive and therefore potentially breach protocol Article 2.  I cannot tell members what we will do about it but we are carefully considering what our next steps will be.  Ms Gibney mentioned the three commissions' concern about provision for electronic traveller authorisations in the Act.  We reiterate that.  We are very concerned about the impact on the enjoyment of rights to family and private life, especially, but not only, those in Border communities.  We will keep a very close watching brief on this.<\/p><p> That brings me to my last, though it is still only an initial, concern, namely, the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill.  I am sure the committee is aware of our grave concerns about this Bill from a human rights perspective.  There are a number of potential breaches that are very obvious.  In short, what is intended by the Bill will not comply with Articles 2 and 3 of the European convention, which are the fundamental rights to life and freedom from torture or ill-treatment.  The reason this is so serious and relevant to everything else we will discuss is that it prevents by design independent and effective investigations of grave human rights abuses, including murder, torture and kidnap.  It does precisely the opposite to what the European convention requires.  It closes down effective, independent investigations.  That should not be a political consideration; it is purely a legal one.  The job we have as a human rights commission, certainly as the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, is to assess the compliance of this Bill with human rights standards.  We have done that and we have attempted to assist, but we have concluded that it fails to comply to such an extent that we cannot offer recommendations to make it compliant.  What may be of interest to the committee today although I cannot say a great deal more, technically, about it, is that in addition to the convention breaches we are also concerned the Bill may diminish the rights of victims in direct breach of the UK's obligations under protocol Article 2 because it fails to comply with standards set out in the EU victims directive, which we conclude and have advised comes within the scope of Article 2.<\/p><p> I echo what Ms Gibney said, and what I hope Ms McGahey will say, in that we are working closely together.  We have made great progress in our work, on the dedicated mechanism in particular, through engagement, research and publications.  I am enormously grateful to my fellow commissioners.  I am the youngest of them by a little way.  I do not mean in calendar age but in terms of service.  I have been assisted greatly by both of them and their staff.  I wanted to recognise that in this evidence session, in addition to my fellow commissioners in Northern Ireland, and the teams who have prepared all three of us and put so much into managing what at the start, certainly for me, seemed too vast and difficult a task.  Somehow, we have pulled this together.  We now know where we are with it and we look forward to being able to actually deliver some results.  I look forward to members' questions.  I will hand over to Ms McGahey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022092200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Alyson Kilpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":950,"content":"<p>I also thank the committee for the opportunity to brief it on the work we are doing, particularly regarding our joint oversight work on protocol Article 2.  I will highlight a key piece of work the three commissions have been working on collaboratively over the past year.  It relates to our work on tracking and monitoring the divergence of equality and human rights on the island of Ireland post Brexit.  This is a significant issue that is not only of importance to the commissions but is of interest and relevance, I am sure, to the work of this committee.<\/p> <p>  The commissions consider that, in the long term, North-South equivalence of rights is important.  Protocol Article 2 requires Northern Ireland to keep pace with any changes to the six equality directives in annex 1 of the protocol that strengthen protections.  However, there is real potential for equality and human rights on the island of Ireland to diverge post Brexit.  We will shortly publish this research.  Emerging findings reveal areas of EU law where divergences in equality and human rights protections between Ireland and Northern Ireland are likely, including in the areas of work-life balance, age discrimination in access to goods, facilities and services, and pay transparency reporting.  The report will also highlight a range of recent Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, decisions that continue to have implications for rights and protections under Northern Ireland equality and human rights law.  Once the research is published, we will issue recommendations to address any potential divergence of rights.  We will be very happy to brief the committee further on this, should it be of interest and assistance. <\/p> <p>  I will also highlight our first annual report on protocol Article 2, which we published in July 2022.  There was a link to it in the documents submitted in advance and a couple of hard copies are available, if members want to have a look at it.  This report, jointly produced by the ECNI and NIHRC, sets out our key policy recommendations for the UK Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, with respect to the implementation of protocol Article 2 and issues arising as a result of Brexit more generally.  It sets out our concerns across a range of areas, including Bills that were progressing through the UK Parliament, for example, the Elections Bill, which removed the voting rights of certain EU citizens in Northern Ireland and has since become law.<\/p> <p>  A number of policy recommendations in our annual report were informed by the research we completed.  For example, ECNI commissioned expert research on ensuring effective legislative scrutiny for protocol Article 2.  Building on that research we have made recommendations to Government on steps it can take to embed compliance with protocol Article 2 at the earliest stages of policy and legislative developments.<\/p><p>These include recommending that the explanatory memoranda on draft UK and NI legislative proposals set out how conformity with Article 2 of the protocol has been considered.<\/p><p> Further, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission have proactively been undertaking joint work to clarify the scope of protocol Article 2.  We have prepared a joint working paper which sets out what we consider to be the scope of the Article 2 commitment, while we also recognise that this will ultimately be subject to judicial determination.<\/p><p> We also have been mapping out EU laws and obligations that we consider fall within scope of protocol Article 2.  We hope to publish this work in the autumn.  We consider this work to be particularly important in the context of the planned UK review of retained EU law.  Our work will help make clear the extent of EU derived rights in Northern Ireland that we consider the UK Government cannot roll back on.  During the past year, both the ECNI and Ms Kilpatrick's colleagues have been tracking and monitoring draft UK and NI legislation to ensure that it is compliant with the UK Government&rsquo;s commitments under Article 2.  We have also been engaging proactively with relevant parliamentary committees as part of that scrutiny role.  In addition to parliamentary committees, we have been jointly engaging with our equality and human rights stakeholders and commissioning research to better understand the impact of Brexit on equality groups, including minority ethnic and migrant people in NI.<\/p><p> One issue which is of great concern to us is the loss of EU funding.  We have already published research and policy recommendations which highlighted the impact of the loss of EU funding on equality groups in Northern Ireland.  Our recommendations included the designation for the purposes of section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act of the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.  Although this research primarily focused on the loss of European Social Fund funding, we recommended that the Northern Ireland Executive provides bridging arrangements to ensure there is no gap in funding between the end of the PEACE IV programme and the commencement of the PEACE PLUS programme.<\/p><p> The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has also recently published research on Brexit, health and its potential impact on Article 2 of the protocol, as well as human trafficking and Article 2.  One important aspect of our work is what we have done in raising awareness of Article 2, including with the public via media campaigns and through the publication of our short guide.  I believe there is a hyperlink to that in the papers we have furnished to members.  Of interest to the committee will be the results of a recent independent public awareness survey we conducted which showed high levels of public support in NI for the UK Government&rsquo;s commitment in respect of Article 2 of the protocol, with nearly three quarters of respondents indicating that this commitment was important to them.  Of interest in that is that many respondents, 42%, felt that their equality and human rights had already been reduced due to Brexit.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I reaffirm, as the others have said, that the three commissions have been working well together and in close partnership.  We have been tasked with a challenging and critical role, particularly at this time of concern about wider risks to human rights and equality protections in Northern Ireland.  Working together, we will build on the considerable achievements to date and on the work already progressed.  We have a great deal more in our pipeline and on our work programmes and we look forward to keeping the committee briefed.

These issues have also been outlined in the submissions.  There are common denominators across all of the witnesses we have spoken to around what is happening at the moment in respect of the erosion of basic human rights, the impact of Brexit and the legislation that is being tried to put through, whether that is the protocol legislation or the legacy legislation.<\/p> <p>  I was looking back at the report produced by the joint committee of the commissions of 2011 and my first question pertains to how the Good Friday Agreement and the Joint Declaration set out to establish a charter of rights for the island of Ireland.  The joint committee of the commissions examined that in its report of 2011 and it outlined some very constructive next steps to be taken to finalise the context of a charter of rights for the island of Ireland.  My first question is to ask where that is at, at that moment, and what roles do the Irish Government and British Government still have to play in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022092200002#E00300","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":954,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Conway-Walsh very much for that question.

Obviously, that is historically just before our term of office.  As the Deputy has said, the charter of rights was set out in the Good Friday Agreement as something that the joint committee would pursue and at the time there have been what I would describe as a couple of bursts of activity towards that.  Although that was set out as something that could be pursued in the 2011 report, the focus since then, and between 2016 and 2020, has been very much around the implications of Brexit.  This charter of rights proposal has not progressed in any meaningful way is my direct answer to the Deputy on that.  There is a point in time in which this could always be reviewed and looked at again.  I must say that the priority is and should right now be the dedicated mechanisms and the work of those units.  This is certainly something that we can explore.  I might suggest to the Deputy that the team might follow up with her to document exactly where that work that has happened, and more than that, within the intervening 11 years since the issuing of that report.  As I say, this proposal has not advanced in any meaningful way.

If everything had been implemented, this probably would not have any potential to pass through.  She asked about the charter of rights for the island of Ireland.  That, of course, is different from the bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  We would say the bill of rights is still an unfulfilled commitment in Northern Ireland and has its own very specific place and purpose.  That was agreed by the special committee set up to look at it but it just could not be agreed in its content.<\/p> <p>  The legacy Bill is troubling in all its parts.  The temptation to try to fix it bit by bit to make it approach something that is acceptable in human rights terms is very tempting but is simply not possible.  I am not being asked as a politician and a representative of any group or society generally.  I am being asked as chief commissioner of the NIHRC whether this is compatible with human rights standards as they exist at the moment.  My very clear and strong advice and that of my colleagues in Northern Ireland is that it is not and, therefore, it is not really for us to say it could be made compliant because we do not see simple fixes to this.  By starting to offer amendments, we get into the territory of making it even more messy.  It is so fundamentally different from the state's obligation under the European convention that I cannot really take it any further.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked specifically about an interstate case.  That is not really for me to comment on or try to influence.  Clearly, that is a possibility that is available.  It may be the most obvious course.  I certainly agree with her in that I do not think the Bill is compatible and, therefore, other people must decide what they do about that.  The commission can also take its own motion cases but for a number of reasons, with which I will not trouble the committee now, that is probably not as effective and certainly not as speedy a response.  An interstate case would be much faster.

It will affect people who work on one side of the Border and live on the other, people going shopping and tourism.  It is simply ludicrous and could effectively create a hard border on the island of Ireland.  Ms Gibney pointed to the potential for racial profiling on buses crossing the Border, which is particularly concerning.  Does she have figures or research on the prevalence of these checks and how they have been selective along racial lines?  If so, could she share them with the committee?

I do not know if the other two commissions have.  We engaged with the Policing Authority and the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris and raised these concerns.  Other witnesses appearing before the committee also spoke about this issue.  The Commission on the Administration of Justice did so in February 2022.  As yet, that is the evidence we have.  It is anecdotal through our civil society representatives such as the commission and the ICCL.  The reports we are getting are through them so we do not have any data or evidence.  We first engaged with the Policing Authority given that it is the body that holds An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to account and it did so in public meetings.  We then followed up with the Garda Commissioner to get more detail on it.  According to the letter we received in response, where a vehicle is stopped for the purpose of an immigration check, all passengers are checked for identification sufficient to establish their identity and nationality.  The letter stated that in cases where a passenger is identified to be Irish, UK or other EU national, no further action is taken.  That is the set policy we have received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This speaks to our broader concerns around the potential for racial profiling from our police service and the lack of disaggregated data gathered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which would allow us to identify that this does not exist.  In today's world where we know racial profiling is a symptom of well-meaning police services and police forces across the globe, we should start from the point that there is potential for racial profiling and gather evidence to disprove it.  This is only one of the areas in which this is an issue where we engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the potential for racial profiling.  I would add that most of the population has huge respect for our police service, which offers us a great service, particularly through these Covid years, but my direct engagement particularly with ethnic minority groups is that this is not shared with everybody.  Some communities feel over-policed and some communities feel they are subject to racial profiling so we need to see better engagement on this and that is my concern.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the comments about the ETA and the potential for what feels to many like a hard border in everything but name, that is certainly what we heard when we had direct engagement with those Border communities.  It was a real eye-opener hearing directly from an excellent speaker from one of the women's networks who talked about how when you are on a border, you already feel pushed towards the margins and anything that really hardens that is going to be hugely impactful on those communities.  The Deputy gave us an example there, which is exactly the type of example about which we are concerned, where somebody who at the moment has daily access across the Border will have that access brought into question if every time he or she wishes to cross, he or she would have to fill in an application form to do so.  A total of 30,000 journeys are made across the Border every day.  It involves things like services, employment, education and simply family visits.  At the moment, we have a situation we all enjoy, which means that those communities are not affected by the Border, and we want to ensure as per the commitment in the protocol that this be maintained.  I will see if anyone else wants to jump in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022092200002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":965,"content":"<p>We at the ECNI have in the past assisted some cases where there were allegations of racial profiling and discrimination and successfully took cases against the Home Office.

We raised that in the context not just of Article 2 and the electronic travel authorisation but also in terms of the common travel area and the guidance that has been issued.  We have received correspondence from the Home Office that as it currently sees it, there is no immigration control on the Border.  That is the position it holds but it is something we are continuing to keep under observation, particularly as the regulations relating to the Nationality and Borders Act are being developed.

It is obvious that a great deal of work is being undertaken by the three commissions.  Importantly, it was stated that there is a framework for co-operation.  It has often been a concern for us when there are different commissions whose work may run in parallel that there might be duplication and a lesser return overall as a result.  I am glad to see there is a good framework of co-operation and collaboration because that is how the best results can be achieved for the people who need these services and supports.  In this context, it is also important that there is an all-Ireland dimension to the work of the three commissions.  I say that because these issues do not stop at the Border.<\/p><p>The Good Friday Agreement was a huge achievement and so many people contributed to bringing it about.  It was about parity of esteem and ensuring people were treated equally regardless of their religious or political beliefs.  It is disappointing, to say the least, that we are now back at a stage where we are concerned about the diminution of rights.  It is not acceptable.  It is disappointing we have come to this day with different legislative measures being proposed by the British Government.<\/p><p>On the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill, we have discussed our outright opposition to those proposals on many occasions with different groups.  It is not every day of the week that all the political parties in Northern Ireland, all the victims' groups and all the advocates for people are speaking in unison on an issue in this way, as are the political voices in this State too.  It is deplorable that the British Government has brought forward these proposals that allow people to give themselves immunity from prosecution.  People who committed murder can enter into the process being proposed through this legislation and practically give themselves immunity.  That is not acceptable in any democracy.  I heard representatives from other groups speak about General Pinochet's regime, and others.  Talk about tinpot regimes.  We would be talking about the deplorable activities of regimes elsewhere if something like this happened in South America.  We do not expect that type of activity on a neighbouring island, in Europe or in what we generally refer to as the western world.  I sincerely hope the new British Government will take a different approach.  <\/p><p>All of us as public representatives, and the witnesses will know this through their work, have dealt with families who have been campaigning for decades to try to get to the truth of what happened to their loved ones and family members.  We cannot emphasise often enough that those people have campaigned with great grace and dignity.  They are not out for vengeance but just to get the truth.  To tell those families, individuals, neighbours, friends and communities that have campaigned to try to get to the truth about what happened to loved ones or community members that all that work has been in vain and can just be washed away with legislation is not good enough and is unacceptable.  It cannot be accepted in any form, and I sincerely hope the new British Prime Minister and new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will revisit this issue in a practical way.<\/p><p>As we all know, a process was put in place in 2014 to deal with legacy issues.  It was a hard-won agreement to secure the creation of those structures and this is what should be implemented.  Those necessary mechanisms should be properly resourced so people can get to the truth of what happened.  We have all met people in this situation.  For decades now, I have worked alongside families who have lost loved ones and who have never got the truth.  To try to tell those people that all their work has been in vain and all they have done has been pointless would be a deplorable act in any democratic system.<\/p><p>I applaud the work of the witnesses.  All three commissioners mentioned other work in progress.  They should keep us informed when there are findings regarding those issues because they will be important for our work as well.  We have the WAVE Trauma Centre in Belfast, Derry and elsewhere and other good advocacy groups.  We must commend their outstanding work and the support they give to families and victims while working in what must be exceptionally difficult circumstances.  We must applaud their work and support them in every way possible.<\/p><p>On the British Nationality and Borders Act 2022, Deputies Tully and Conway-Walsh asked whether information is available on the numbers of people who have been stopped.  Do we have any concrete evidence in this regard?  Apart from people being checked, there is also the environment now in which some people are uncertain and afraid they might be stopped.  Ms Gibney referred to there being 30,000 cross-Border movements daily.  That is great to see.  These are people crossing over the Border to go to work, attend education, access health services, visit family and go about social activities.  Any of us who visits a school, hospital or building site will be able to see the registration of the cars parked in these places of work.  If that is in Northern Ireland, we will see Southern-registered cars, while here in this State we will see Northern-registered cars.  This demonstrates that people are travelling and providing worthwhile services.  I am thinking of people in my neighbouring area of County Fermanagh who work in Cavan daily, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  For people without British or Irish citizenship, however, there is a concern at the back of their minds about whether they will be stopped.  I take the opportunity to commend the work of the North West Migrants Forum, NWMF.  I met representatives of the group some time ago.  It is a great group, which advocates on behalf of people who feel vulnerable.  We must bear in mind their concerns at all times.  <\/p><p>I think it was Ms McGahey who referred to the loss of EU funding and how that can impact on the work of the three commissions.  I presume IHREC is funded directly by the Government.  If there is no direct State funding for the other two commissions, are they dependent on EU or other programmes, for funding?  I would have thought the work of the three commissions should be funded directly by the relevant line Department in each State, instead of having to depend on EU programmes that do not last for more than five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022092200002#G00200","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":967,"content":"<p>Taking the last point regarding funding first, our concern regarding the loss of EU funding relates to the impact it is going to have on the provision of services to the voluntary and community sector and those who are disabled.

Coming back to the ETA scheme and the racial profiling issue in this regard, I think he is correct about the chilling effect.

It is almost something of a red herring because it does not matter if the UK Border Force is appalled at the notion of racial profiling.  What happens with these provisions is that people are immediately fearful that it will be racial profiling.  That includes people who are entitled to cross the Border without documentation and those who are not.  That includes Irish and British people as well.  Some are telling us they are carrying - I am not sure if that noise is coming from here or not - passports just in case.

The importance of it is that peace on this island is supported and bolstered by the fact that we have this equivalence of rights.  That is why it was enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement.  The idea is that it should be a similar experience for everybody living on the island, in terms of how they can realise their rights and what they can expect to enjoy in terms of non-discrimination and equality.  It has been a really positive force over the past 20 odd years in driving, particularly on this side of the Border, our equality and rights standards up to a really positive level, and we are at a relatively equivalent level.<\/p> <p>  As commissions, we all operate in the jurisdiction we are in.  We engage, obviously, as the three commissions here, but also with other equivalent commissions and jurisdictions across Europe and across the world.  We have no problem in understanding that there might be different laws in place, different Acts, etc., that inform those rights and equality issues within the jurisdiction we are in.  Then there are some that govern across regions, as we have thus far enjoyed within the EU.  None of us expected, obviously, that the UK would ultimately withdraw from the EU and much of those frameworks were built on the assumption of that continued UK membership.<\/p> <p> We will continue to work together as we always have.  The joint committee did an excellent job in the four years from the 2016 referendum right up to actual withdrawal.  During that time we published a series of six different publications which I urge the Senator to read because they go back to those fundamental elements around justice arrangements, citizenship, and the common travel area which is really problematic, shaky as it is and something that we have all said should be enshrined in legislation.<\/p> <p>  We have always worked together in those contexts and that we are in different jurisdictions does not stop us collaborating.  Obviously, there is a very special arrangement in terms of the joint committee because we are established in a treaty, as the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, NIHRC, and Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, as being members of that but also within the equality commission and the dedicated mechanism framework.  We use those frameworks that are available to us to work together.<\/p><p>In our appearances in front of the executive committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly, there were some voices saying the UK will perhaps advance rights to appoint further.  I welcome that.  If that is the case, it is great, but our biggest concern is that equivalence is maintained and that we see that balance.  We will support our colleagues from both commissions in Northern Ireland in making sure that, specifically, the six directives committed to will continue to be respected.  We all have to monitor that, and we will do whatever we can to help with that monitoring.  Also, more broadly, we must ensure that rights and equality standards, even though they might be set through different legislative measures, maintain parity, because that is crucial for peace on this island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022092200002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":980,"content":"<p>To give us a sense of the equivalence at a practical level, what are the six directives?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022092200002#J00200","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":981,"content":"<p>The racial equality directive, the employment equality framework directive, the gendered goods and services directive, the gender equality employment directive, the self-employment equality directive, and the gender equality and social security directive are the six.<\/p> <p>  When I referred to the work we are doing on the scope of Article 2, I was alluding to the fact that these are the very things we are examining.  Each of the directives, while Northern Ireland is required to keep pace with developments in the EU, results in a much wider underpinning in terms of the legislative framework within which we operate within Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  This is why we are saying the scope of Article 2 is very far-reaching, perhaps much further reaching than government is prepared to accept or acknowledge at this stage.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, the scope of Article 2 will be determined through the courts.  The paper we are publishing in the autumn was developed based on very comprehensive research and stakeholder engagement.  We are more than happy to come back to the committee to talk to the members about that and the recommendations emerging from it.<\/p> <p>  Let me go back to a point made on the three commissions working together.  The work between the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and Ms Gibney's organisation is underpinned by statute.  The Northern Ireland Act gives a statutory basis to the associated joint committee.  The amendments to the Northern Ireland Act following the introduction of the withdrawal agreement formed the dedicated mechanism whereby the three commissions now work together on a statutory basis to consider the all-island dimension.  Therefore, there is a statutory basis behind the work we do.  This is part of the reason we believe it is really important that Article 2 be taken into account whenever the likes of a review of the Human Rights Act is being undertaken.  The Good Friday Agreement set out and enshrined a number of rights.  The problem is that it did not give a definition in a legalistic way, and it is open to interpretation.  When you start looking back and peeling off the layers of the onion, you find you can make an argument that Article 2 underpins this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022092200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine McGahey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":982,"content":"<p>I did not want to miss the opportunity to make two brief comments.  It is really important in the context of this discussion to remember that the Joint Committee on Human Rights is a very different base from the dedicated mechanism in which the three commissions work together.  The joint committee goes way beyond the dedicated mechanism in the protocol.  Bearing in mind that we were talking about legacy earlier, that might be a good example to use.  Potentially, if the legacy Bill is successful, a person in Northern Ireland &ndash; say, a relative of somebody murdered in Northern Ireland &ndash; will not have a right to take a judicial review or make a civil claim in the courts in Northern Ireland.  However, somebody whose loved one was murdered in Dundalk will have the right.<\/p> <p>  I do not need to tell any of the members about the cross-Border nature of some of the violence and the different identities of different actors moving back and forth across the island.  You admittedly have a very different framework of rights in substance.  Even if we were all signatories to the convention enforcing those rights, enforcing them in Dundalk would be very different from enforcing them anywhere in Northern Ireland.  That is a real worry for the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.  Given that the stated intention of the Bill is to make sure that, for example, veterans are not inconvenienced by the state's Article 2 obligations, it suggests to me that the rights will be diminished this side rather than the other.  I do not know what to do about it, but it must be recognised how serious that is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022092200002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Alyson Kilpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":983,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

This Bill is even worse than what I describe.  The individual may be very independently minded but will not be independent of the state.  Given how the Bill is set up, it necessarily requires the Secretary of State to be involved in making most of the really critical decisions.  Most people are not even going to get near the independent mechanism.  This is one of the really difficult issues with this Bill.  Most people will be cut off before they even get near the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery.  Even where there is a very independent person sitting in an investigative capacity, most people will not get anywhere near him or her.  The Secretary of State will essentially decide those who will and will not get to do so.  Even if there are really good people &ndash; I am sure there are some really fantastic independent people who would be able to do this &ndash; they will simply not be independent enough to comply with Article 2 if the framework is not in place for them to act independently and if it can be overridden by, for example, the Secretary of State.  That is the way I look at it.

It is not the policy of the transport provider to stop and invite the inspectors on, whoever they might be.  Whether it is the PSNI, the Garda or border control, the transport provider must stop because that is where the power lies.  It is a matter for the policy of those organisations as to who they would seek evidence from to prove where they are from.<\/p> <p>  Asylum seekers in Northern Ireland gave the equality commission some serious concern.  We are receiving a lot of correspondence about the dreadful circumstances in which asylum seekers are being accommodated in respect of their dietary requirements, medical care, schooling, etc.  The commission is powerless to do anything.  Discrimination legislation does not restrict the ability of the immigration services to discriminate against someone in the asylum and refugee programme.  It is exempt from the anti-discrimination legislation in respect of race or anything else.  Work needs to be done in that regard.

To date, the Irish Government has not asked us for any advice on the legacy Bill.  I earlier mentioned that we have not dealt with this matter at commission level.  We have a clear remit to protect and promote human rights and equality in Ireland.  We have powers to comment on legislation and provide advice on it as it progresses through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We do not have that same power to apply to other jurisdictions so it is not within our remit.  However, Ms Kilpatrick has already mentioned the joint committee, which is probably the forum at which we will progress this issue.  As Ms Kilpatrick has ably pointed out, Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and people's right to an independent investigation, concerns us most.  That is where we will be advancing it.  Of course, if the Irish Government were to ask us for specific human rights and equality advice on UK legislation, we would take that request under consideration, as we would with any request from the Government.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hanna also asked about asylum seekers and refugees.  I will contextualise those issues in today's discussion.  We know that approximately 9,000 people have applied so far this year for international protection in Ireland.  That is far above last year's level.  There were approximately 2,500 such applications in the whole of last year.  We are seeing unprecedented numbers coming through.  There is some speculation that some of that is related to more stringent UK policy, such as the Rwanda policy.  To my knowledge, and I would love to hear any comments anybody else has to make, there is no hard evidence for that.  There are other potential factors to explain the increase, which include, for example, the lag from the pandemic.  There are other reasons why we might be seeing such a glut arising.  Our biggest concern at the moment is the emerging two-tier system.  The treatment of those refugees who have come here from Ukraine has been positive and heartening.  I applaud the different groups that are working to provide that response.  Unfortunately, however, those people in the direct provision system in Ireland continue to experience human rights violations within their international protection experience.  That is what we most want to see addressed.  We want direct provision to be abolished, as was outlined in the Government White Paper.  While I fully appreciate that we have unprecedented numbers - this is an unprecedented situation and we can all expect delays - that commitment must be honoured and we must see tangible actions to honour it.  Our biggest concern is about that two-tier response.<\/p> <p>  I do not think there is anything else I wish to say in response to Ms Hanna's comments.

Without going over old ground, I ask for views in respect of the current situation in terms of discussions between the UK and Irish Governments around some possible solutions.  Our understanding from the Home Office is that there is some engagement with the Irish Government but only on residents in Ireland, not the tourist angle.  The words used have become slightly more concerning in terms of the way that engagement has been phrased since it was first mooted in March or April last.  It was notable that when the UK immigration plan was published in July, there was no reference to the Irish context in any shape or form, either positive or negative, in terms of any outcomes or progress.  Since then, there does not seem to be much progress as such.  Following from that, are there any particular views on solutions for human rights or equality implications that may arise from that?  One of the things I picked up was that people may be required to have a driving licence in their possession or some other form or paperwork that proves residence.  It could almost be the case that while people will not have to travel with their passport, they will have to travel with their electric bill.  How would that impact on people who do not pay the bills, including younger people?  What are the witnesses&rsquo; thoughts on that particular angle?<\/p> <p>  On the asylum issue and refugees more generally, I concur with the concerns expressed in responses to earlier questions.  With reference to the common travel area, are any of our witnesses picking up any potential tensions on the UK Government side as the UK increasingly diverges from good immigration practice and given that Ireland has a more generous policy?  How does that cut across with the UK&rsquo;s approach, in particular, for those who have come from Ukraine into southern Ireland and then moved into Northern Ireland informally or people who have perhaps diverted and, rather than crossing the English Channel, have come through Ireland to relocate to the UK?  Are there any tensions around that?<\/p> <p>  I have a question largely for Ms Kilpatrick.  To go back to any potential human rights legislation unpicking commitments to the European Convention on Human Rights and the domestic Human Rights Act, will she comment on the potential implications for the criminal justice policing reform in Northern Ireland, given that the particular aspects that came out from the Good Friday Agreement were heavily predicated on human rights considerations?  Many of the practitioners, including senior police officers, talk about the importance of human rights and that they are now so integral to policing in Northern Ireland that anything that would undermine that would be of concern.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Ms McGahey from the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland.  Earlier today, some of the Northern Ireland census figures were published.  One of the big takeaways from those is that religion is becoming an increasingly less reliable indicator of other identities or political persuasions.  To what extent do we need to reconsider the approach being taken to issues such as fair employment monitoring?  That is another aspect of public policy which is often constructed around two traditions or two communities.  Can we still base our statistical analysis of equality considerations around public policy access based on a two-communities model, in particular in light of today&rsquo;s census figures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022092200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":1008,"content":"<p>I will let my two colleagues lead because they probably have the most to add.

We have a growing ethnic minority community that needs to be accounted for in terms of data collection and monitoring for the public sector generally.  If we are going to develop policy that is good for everyone in Northern Ireland and can deliver against the objectives of equality for all and good relations, we then need to change our way of looking at communities.  The commission is currently looking at how we might develop some recommendations in relation to the amendment of the fair employment and treatment order.  We are loath to go into it in too much detail because it is fairly important to the Good Friday Agreement, etc.  We think it is now coming to the time where we should be looking at how the finer detail of that looks at the monitoring of communities.

It states that intelligence-led operational activity is used to tackle to known abuse of the common travel area and is only undertaken away from the land Border.

They are not very difficult.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about older people.  In the Republic of Ireland, in the first four months of the pandemic, something like 1,500 people passed away.  Some 65% of them were living in nursing home accommodation, while in the UK the proportion was 43% and in Sweden it was 47%.  Who vindicates the rights of older people, in the witnesses' view?  Is that their role in the context of the quality of care delivered?  I know it is not part of the discussion for today, but this matter concerns me greatly.  In some nursing homes - and I know that different jurisdictions are represented here - there are serious issues around human rights and whether residents were appropriately or properly treated and their rights vindicated.<\/p> <p>  The second issue I wish to raise is about refugees, particularly those from Ukrainian.  In my constituency, I have had a complaint in recent weeks, regrettably and sadly, that they feel intimidated and bullied and they have been shouted at and threatened with deportation back to Ukraine.  They have been treated very badly.  I have been in contact with the Department.  I have not got an appropriate answer from it yet as to who will deal with these issues and vindicate the rights these people intrinsically have.  Today, somewhere in the midlands, Ukrainians were moved with two days' notice, which is appalling.  There are issues like that.  This may not be the correct issue for the witnesses today.  Perhaps they could respond to my comments later.  Those are the issues that concern me right now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022092200002#M00700","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>I will give the Chairman some answers, and perhaps if he wishes to engage with the commission-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022092200002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":1029,"content":"<p>I can do so later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022092200002#M00900","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663801200,"counter":1030,"content":"<p>Yes, exactly, on a sidebar.  I can give the Chairman certainty that the rights of older people are absolutely within our remit.  Indeed, they are a priority for us in the strategic cycle, particularly in the post-Covid world, as the Chairman said.  What we want to see is better scrutiny and better equality-proofing and human rights-proofing of policy and legislation.  Unfortunately, that did not happen well enough during the pandemic.  What I have heard directly from older people is that they felt infantilised and treated as a homogenous group when we know that they are a very diverse group.  We all enjoy living longer and living healthier longer, so those rights absolutely are a priority for us.  I would be more than happy to continue to engage with the Chairman on that.<\/p> <p>  As for the issues for refugees, I agree with the Chairman.  Regardless of the numbers and of how unprecedented this situation is, and regardless of where a refugee comes from, Ireland has international and domestic human rights obligations and standards that it must meet.  We are not meeting those right now as a State.  There is the very basic element of vulnerability assessments in order that, for example, as we see the increase in tented accommodation, which, I understand, is where we are at, we make sure that at least those most vulnerable within that population are not placed in such a setting and that regulatory inspections are carried out.  Those situations are dangerous places for human rights infringements and violations.

The Human Rights Act came in shortly after the Good Friday Agreement, and all the work the policing board does is built on monitoring compliance of that Act.  It enabled police reform to such a degree - and I had an up-close look at this for a number of years - that successive chief constables said there should be greater human rights protection, not less, and argued for more codification, not discretion without a framework of principles.<\/p> <p>  The commission has jurisdiction in respect of older people.  Of course, the fact that they are older does not mean they are not human beings for the purposes of the Human Rights Act.  That is the beauty of human rights.  They apply regardless of age or any other status.  We are looking at the inquiry into the response to Covid and the use of care homes, etc.  The older persons' commissioner has a particular remit, but we can bring cases based on discrimination or based simply on breach of human rights.  An older person, even without the capacity to live independently, still has human rights, the same way as an 18-year-old or 19-year-old fit young man or woman has.  That is how we approach it.  The same point is made about refugees.  They are simply human beings who happen to be in the jurisdiction of somewhere that is bound by the convention, so they are entitled equally as everybody else.  That is the nature of human rights and why it is so important, going back to the very start of this, that human rights are respected as universal, not as a hierarchy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022092200002#M01900","nonspeaker":"Ms Alyson Kilpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":1040,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Conway-Walsh have Mr. Brady's questions?

I welcome Deputy Denise Mitchell, who is substituting for Deputy O'Broin, and Senator Maria Byrne, who is substituting for Senator Cummins.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and his officials to the committee.  An opening statement, a briefing and the general scheme of the Bill have been circulated to members.<\/p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  For those attending remotely within the confines of Leinster House complex they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meetings.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I will now invite the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, to make his opening statement and I thank him for being here this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022092200002#A00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":1054,"content":"<p>I thank the members for affording us the time to come to the committee in relation to this pre-legislative scrutiny.  I also thank the committee for the expeditious way it has dealt with this issue, notwithstanding how busy it is.<\/p> <p>  My opening statement has circulated and I will outline a few points contained therein.  A key priority of mine when I was appointed as Minister of State was to get the Moorhead report enacted, and second one of the key issues that had significant urgency attached to it was maternity leave for our elected representatives.  We have seen in public discourse how frustrated women have been in terms of not having that right enshrined in legislation as they go about discharging their functions as elected representatives.  At that juncture, I took action in April 2021, when we established a sub-group comprising women from all political parties and none, who essentially adjudicated on what the framework or proposal should be for maternity leave and what would suit their needs, because obviously everyone has very different and varying needs.  We gave women the option to frame the proposal that they would like, and this is the genesis of what they asked for.<\/p> <p>  We also consulted with the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, Women for Election, the National Women's Council of Ireland, and See Her Elected to ensure that we were covering every area in relation to this support.  What really jarred with me was that women had to get a resolution from the local authority under section 18 for absences of more than six months.  Essentially that meant women facing into maternity leave caring for a young infant would have to go into the council chamber seeking a resolution from a potentially male-dominated local authority to gain permission to take maternity leave.  In a modern democracy that is totally unacceptable.  That is why this piece of reform took priority at that juncture.<\/p> <p>  We will also be putting forward a policy framework around paternity leave and adoptive leave.  However, I would point out to members that in relation to each of those areas for parental leave of 26 weeks and adoptive leave of 24 weeks, councillors can take those under the current rules and do not require an extension under section 18.  We will hopefully put a policy framework forward around that in the coming months, but as I said the urgency was to ensure that the lacuna in the law for maternity leave was rectified urgently.<\/p> <p>  I also want to point out the work we are doing through our women's caucus network which we have established right around the country, which is a huge support for women in an apolitical way.  Furthermore, through working with See Her Elected, we took first in Europe in the European innovation in politics awards with an incredible initiative it has supporting women, which was a very proud day for that organisation.  I am privileged to work with it.<\/p> <p>  In other reforms, we have remote working now for our local authorities which gives them additional flexibility, so we have done our best to hive out all of those opportunities the global pandemic presented, and to keep the best of those opportunities to ensure local authority members are supported into the future.  Obviously, we really appreciate the work the committee is doing and we will continue apace, hopefully, to have our legislation finalised on foot of the committee's report, which we eagerly await.  As it is a small piece of legislation, it is doing exactly what it says on the tin and we would appreciate if the committee continued in the fashion that it has done in expeditiously bringing forward its report.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022092200002#A00300","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":1055,"content":"<p>I take the opportunity to compliment the Minister of State and his team on the widespread consultation that was involved in bringing this general scheme to us, and the participation of those groups he mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022092200002#A00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":1056,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and all of his team for bringing forward this legislation.  It is very important.  I speak as a former local authority member who, when pregnant, was in the chamber, and when I was in the labour ward over in the Rotunda Hospital, my absence was noted and reported.  It is an unfair pressure that is put on local authority members.  They feel torn between the duties and the responsibilities they have fought for and value and other calls on them such as what we are discussing.  It is very important.  Local authority members are the backbone of our democracy in their local communities.  They are people who come forward and stand up for others. They speak for their immediate local community but also for their wider local authority area and they contribute to national and international developments and debates.  They provide an incredibly important role and they are ordinary people, men and women, from whatever their background, be it professional, a teacher, a nurse or carer, who come forward and contribute.  The contribution they make to our democracy and to the delivery of government at a local level is invaluable.  It is only right they would enjoy the basic rights of other workers, in this instance specifically, maternity leave.<\/p> <p>  It is also very important this legislation accommodates the need that can arise in exceptional circumstances for a temporary substitution.  It has not been in place before and it is not fair either on the individual to feel compromised and torn between their different demands and responsibilities.  It is also not fair on the local area they represent if their place goes unfilled or if their local representative is, for whatever extraneous reasons, unable to attend.<\/p> <p>  I commend the Minister of State and support this legislation.

Prior to us engaging in drafting a general scheme, there was discourse around changing to a six-month period as then maternity leave would be there for women.  However, as the Senator rightly points out, if for argument's sake, a council is going through a material contravention, needs a two thirds majority and the vote is very tight in their respective communities, a woman on maternity leave without that legislative framework underpinning that absence or without the option of a substitute could feel under pressure to attend the chamber.

It is incremental change but in the course of the year I heard so many concerns from women in respect of this issue and it potentially being a barrier for women.  It is a chief concern.

I particularly thank the subgroup, on which Councillor Lorraine Hall was the Fine Gael representative.  I know she put an awful lot of work into it.  It is to be hoped that it will have results from which she and many other women will benefit.<\/p> <p>  It is an important step forward.  The Minister of State described it as a cultural change and that is what we absolutely need when it comes to politics.  We know that women are underrepresented in politics across the board.  Three out of four councillors are men.  I was at the ploughing championships yesterday, where I chatted with members of See Her Elected.  It is doing incredible work in supporting women who are interested in standing in local elections.  The statistics, experiences and stories it has and shares are utterly depressing, however.  There is a local authority with only one female councillor.  We have to focus on changing that.  One of the most important things we can do is to make sure that council chambers are welcoming spaces for women.  Right now, young women thinking about starting a family do not fit in there because they would not have access to maternity leave which, as the Minister described, is a basic human right.  This legislation is critical because it rectifies that.  It is progressive and positive.  In today's world, it should not be progressive, but it is.  I say \"Well done\" to the Minister of State on taking that progressive step.<\/p> <p>  I am very glad to hear about the &euro;230 a week that will go towards administrative support for women on maternity leave.  Is the same allowance also extended to those on illness leave?  It is really positive that illness leave is included in the Bill.  Unfortunately, illness leave is something that many of us will require from time to time.  At the moment, different local authorities treat councillors who need to take time off due to illness differently.  That is not fair and there is no equity in it.  This Bill will change that.  It will deliver equity and fairness and standardise that situation.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions on the logistics of the substitute.  Head 8 states that the substitution comes to an end when the maternity leave ends.  I welcome that because there is no ambiguity and there will be no disagreement in respect of people staying on in the role.  Is it the same situation when it comes to illness benefit?  How will that work?<\/p> <p>  Will the co-option process be the same as the current situation, which is that in the case of a councillor standing down for whatever reason, the name of the person the councillor or his or her party is nominating as a replacement goes to the full local authority for ratification?  Ultimately, there is a vote.  Local authority chambers operate in the same way as the D&aacute;il Chamber.  It is local democracy.  There are ruling groups there as well.  How will that work?  Is that addressed in the legislation to ensure that no issues arise and to prevent councillors deciding not to allow the substitute in?  When the substitution ends, is the original elected member automatically returned to the chamber?  Does the person have to be co-opted onto the seat he or she won?  I hope that is not the case.  It does not seem that it will be the case, judging by the legislation, but it would be great to get clarity on it.  I would not be comfortable with the idea that a person would effectively be removed from a role to which he or she was democratically elected.  The legislation is written in such way that the nomination is made by the political party, and I plead with all political parties to respect the wishes of the woman taking maternity leave.  If she is being replaced by a direct competitor, that will not make her maternity leave a less stressful time.  I ask political parties across the board to consider the wishes of the woman going on maternity leave in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Those are my questions on illness leave in particular, and how the substitution process formally works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022092200002#C00700","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

As I stated, I have encountered a few of the very difficult cases where that does, unfortunately, happen to local authority members.<\/p> <p>  As regards the duration for a person who is ill, it is 18 months.  Essentially, the seat or vacancy would then terminate and the person would be deemed to have resigned after the 18 months.<\/p> <p>  As regards maternity leave, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, it is 26 weeks plus 16 additional weeks.  The casual vacancy ends at that juncture and the councillor is automatically reappointed to the local authority.

There is a problem in politics and political discourse whereby public representatives are often dehumanised.  The expectations of them are very high, and do not recognise their humanity and that they have the same needs as other people.  It is very important that their humanity and needs are recognised to encourage and facilitate more women, and indeed, more parents with young children, into politics.  It is important that practice in public life reflects good practice elsewhere.  I welcome that the heads of Bill do that.  The issue does not affect all local authorities, but I have heard some real horror stories from some local authorities, particularly where women have been very underrepresented, where there has been what can only be described as outright sexism and the bullying of some female councillors when they have first been elected.  The legislation will send a signal in that direction and will break that culture.  That is most welcome. <\/p> <p>  I want to ask the Minister of State a few questions.

That is why, when we were trying to put officeholders into the shoes of employees for the purposes of maternity leave only, without having to make any constitutional change, and to do it quickly, we felt that the best mechanism to take the stress and pressure off women on maternity leave would be to give them an option of having a substitute if they wanted to take that clean break, and to navigate though section 50.   It is very hard to draw the line if we say that women can do some work but claim maternity benefit, when the law explicitly states that they cannot.

However, from talking to local authority members around the country, I am confident that 99% of councillors are very good and genuine people.  I do not foresee a situation whereby they would obstruct a woman, or her wishes to have a substitute when on maternity leave, by stopping her from joining various committees.  I genuinely feel that way, from the engagement I have had with local authority members.  Our hope and aspirations for local authorities and, indeed, the culture change that we are discussing, wold be severely damaged if that were to happen.  We will do our best to act if it does happen, but I do not see it happening.  I have good faith in our local authority members.  I genuinely do think that they will embrace this change.

In the first instance, this is a right that will be set down in primary legislation.  It is not the case that there will be any adjudication of a woman's right to go on maternity leave.  That is very clear under the law.  It will be specifically prescribed, under the legislation, that an officeholder will step into the shoes of an employee and will have the same rights as an employee in the specific area of maternity leave.  I hope that is a fairly black-and-white issue.<\/p> <p>  Second, we want to widen the scope significantly under the regulations.  Indeed, we have done do over the past number of months in terms of supporting councillors in what they can claim through their vouched scheme, like our colleagues in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, which is 100% transparent and out in the open and of which a certain percentage is audited every year.<\/p><p>That scheme will cover, with 100% accuracy and clarity, the invoices of a woman who is employing someone or working with someone as a temporary measure.  I do not see any concerns in that regard.  Culture is a bigger challenge, as the Senator has alluded to.  That is probably the biggest challenge when women make up 24% of councillors.  This is especially stark in rural areas.  I was down at the ploughing match yesterday and I had a look at See Her Elected's map of the country.  Outside of the cities, the lack of female representation is very acute.  That is where we have a lot of work to do.  In some local authorities around the county, there are only one or two female councillors.  Cultural change is the bigger thing.  It is hard to institute a redress mechanism for that.  We are going to be very clear that this will be a primary legislative right for women.  It will be triggered upon a woman going on maternity leave.

It is about the subtle loss of opportunity, the subtleties in how this performed and that cultural piece.  If we were to see a lack of any cultural move on the part of a local authority at some time further down the road, there would need to be some sort of penalty built in because the relationship between members of a local authority and that authority and its employees can be almost adversarial.  There are subtleties to that which are evident in some of the stories I have heard around the country.  I would like us to be sure to have a review mechanism as to how this is operating built in because there is no automatic recourse to employment equality legislation.  In straightforward employer-employee situations, the area of maternity is where most litigation related to discrimination arises.  Without that straightforwardness, a review of the cultural change will be needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022092200002#E00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":1110,"content":"<p>I am happy to take those comments on board.

We can swap around.  I welcome the legislation.  It is interesting that, in the room next door, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality is meeting to discuss the implementation of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  In the context of those efforts to improve the rights of women through that process, it is remarkable that there was still a category of women who were not eligible for maternity leave.  Putting that to rights is a really important step.<\/p> <p>  The role of the local authorities is very interesting.  We have changed it, including in the last 12 months, but for many of us in this room it was effectively a job with a salary of &euro;16,000 a year.  When the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts were implemented, I remember asking the chief executive's office what the equivalent cut was for other staff members in the local authority who were on the same rate.  At the time, councillors were paid at a quarter of the rate for Senators.  The chief executive's office told me that the authority had no employees who were paid as little as councillors.  The porters in the office who greeted us at the front door were paid more and had a better pension scheme than many of the councillors who were coming in and out of City Hall.  That is not meant to in any way denigrate the rights of the porters but it demonstrates where the councillor was in the scheme of things.  We have made great strides in improving the salaries of local authority members.  If the media covers that, it is always about politicians getting more pay but, of course, we all know that is not the case.  When you give people more pay, it means they can provide more of their time.  It is not that people are part-time.  I have never agreed with councillors being referred to as part-time because they always end up juggling something else.  Improvements to pay and conditions for councillors are really important for our local democracy because, in their absence, unelected officials would be left making decisions.  If councillors are not sufficiently resourced to have the time and space to hold those officials to account, you will not get the democracy that is needed.  There are a number of unusual provisions in this Bill, including the idea of being able to substitute another into your place.  People might think that is a bit undemocratic but it gives the maximum flexibility to the member who is taking the leave.  <\/p> <p>  Are there any restrictions regarding the party issuing a certificate for a replacement such as there are in the case of co-option?  In the case of a co-option, a party must issue a certificate to say that a given person is the party candidate.  The council no longer votes on this although there was a time when it had to.  In the case of Independent members passing away, in some local authorities it is possible to name a nominator.  How would it differ for an Independent member?  Is it entirely within the control of the councillor in question?  While I agree with a party mandate for co-option, in this case the individual councillor must be given the exclusive ability to nominate a successor because that replacement is for such a short period of time and because such strong working relationships will be required.  That might be worth clarifying.<\/p> <p>  I am always happy to speak on behalf of councillors so I will use this opportunity to encourage the Minister of State to go further.  Local authority members have a local authority members gratuity scheme.  Many members find themselves listed in the newspaper as having received a lump sum of a certain amount when they turn a certain age but if you go to the market with &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 and try to get a pension scheme, you will probably get a pension of approximately &euro;8 or &euro;9 a month.  We could go further.  We could make local authority members eligible for the occupational pension schemes of their authorities.  They may also be members of occupational pension schemes through other employment.  That is something each member can decide on.  I can think of plenty of councillors including Councillor Christy Burke, an independent member on Dublin City Council, who have given decades of service.  It seems wrong that Councillor Burke is not able to join the occupational pension scheme of an organisation he has dedicated so much of his working life to.  I apologise for naming Councillor Burke as an individual but he commands a lot of respect across the spectrum.  There are many councillors in that position and who could easily join the occupational pension scheme if some changes were made.  There is an argument to be made in this regard.  The local authority deducts USC from councillor's payments.  The Pensions Authority states that, where a body deducts USC and other taxes from a salary, that body is deemed to be an employer and therefore has pension responsibilities.  It is one further step the Minister of State could take.  I only mention it given that he has been so progressive in extending other rights to councillors.  It would be one further step.  I apologise for leaving the Minister of State so little time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022092200002#E00500","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":1113,"content":"<p>We are going to stick to the legislation before us but the Minister of State may want to comment on Deputy McAuliffe's contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022092200002#E00600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":1114,"content":"<p>It is always worth encouraging the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022092200002#E00700","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":1115,"content":"<p>I hear what the Deputy is saying.

I was very honest with them because the Moorhead report recommended setting up a committee to look at pension rights and entitlements of councillors into the future.  That is what we have done.  The Moorhead report also noted that a benefit of gratuity can be triggered from the age of 50 in terms of not paying into a pension scheme.

We are going to work through it with the AILG and the councillor bodies and we will see what we can come up with at the end of that process.  I wanted to be very honest with people that I do not see that happening in the immediate term.  I wanted to be very clear on that.

It is a first for me since becoming a Deputy.  On a serious note, I hear what the Minister of State is saying about all political parties and none coming together.  This has been a huge gap and women have been discriminated against for so long.  I welcome this Bill.  It is a big step forward and I know the Minister of State plans on going further again.  We will engage with him and the Department to bring in the best legislation and the best regulations we can.<\/p> <p>  One of our councillors on Cork City Council, Fiona Kerins, recently went on maternity leave and had to return early.  She felt she had no other choice because of the position she was in.  We do not want that.  I listened to the Minister of State outline the position.  He has taken that on board and I welcome that.  He also spoke about sick leave.  A very good friend of mine, the late Dave McCarthy, was an Independent councillor.  He was sick with cancer.  To be fair, every councillor and the officials in the council did everything they could but because of the regulations, they were limited in what they could do.  That is another part of this that I welcome.  We have the maternity part of it but we also have the sick leave part.  It just shows how far behind we were.  We will look forward now and we will try to be constructive.<\/p> <p>  In 2014 I was looking for a running mate in the local elections.  I spent a year looking and I could not get someone.  I spoke to women within the party and women outside it who were involved in community groups or sporting organisations.  These were women who were well able to speak and attend meetings as they had done it in their own different groups but when they looked at politics they made a point about the amount it was going to take for them to get involved.  A lot of them were not willing to give that commitment, especially if they had young families or were planning on having a family.  This is an opportunity to get more women involved.  My political party is looking to the next local and European elections.  At the moment we are trying to encourage more and more females to get involved in the party and to consider putting their names forward.  Even though we have very strong female representation as a political party, we still have more work to do.  We recognise that.  That is why this Bill is another step forward in trying to encourage more women to get involved in politics.<\/p> <p>  One of the concerns I have about this legislation is that it will allow each local authority to have its own skew on it.  Deputy McAuliffe referred to people passing away or stepping down from the council.  Different councils have different regulations for that.  I was recently dealing with a homeless family.  I had to bring the case to the Minister's attention.  The big local authorities, the more urban ones, tend to have one set of regulations for homeless people while the rural ones have different regulations.  Cork City Council had one set of regulations to deal with people in homelessness but Cork County Council had adopted a different type.  Cork County Council was not the only council that adopted the alternative approach.  Different councils had different approaches, which I do not think is right.  If we are bringing in rules and regulations around maternity leave and sick leave and the procedures we need to put in place, they should be set across all 31 local authorities.  It is not a criticism but maybe it is something the Minister of State and the Department will look at.  I am not saying the councillors will do it for the wrong reasons but the Minister of State made a point there about trying to change the culture of an organisation.  Different local authorities will be in different positions.  That is something I would like to see more certainty on.<\/p> <p>  Looking forward, the Minister of State will be bringing forward more regulations.  Is it fair to assume that when he has these new regulations he will come in here and present them to the members so we can go through them with him, discuss and scrutinise them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022092200002#F00800","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":1124,"content":"<p>We are happy to attend any time to seek the committee's advice on the changes we are bringing through.  We look forward to the report on pre-legislative scrutiny of this current Bill but as we go through other significant changes for reforming the way local authority members go about their business, we will be happy to keep the committee informed and seek its views at every juncture along the way.  It is amazing.  The Moorhead report is one of those reports that has been hanging around so long.  One thing that shocked me was that this is so universally accepted among our citizens.  A lot of people were worried that a slant would be put on it that this is a pay rise for politicians.  People were shocked when they saw how lowly paid councillors were in society versus the amount of work they do and the number of committees they are on.  They are the closest arm of local government to communities.<\/p> <p>  Schedule 10 of the Local Government Act 2001 sets the casual vacancy process.  The Deputy may have a point on this matter.  I will have to have a look at it.  As I said at the outset, from engaging with political parties and our 949 local authority members, I do not see an issue whereby councillors will conspire against or try to stand in the way of a woman being nominated.  However, I have seen different standing orders in other local authority areas around Independent candidates putting forward a replacement if they resign.  That is something we are having a look at as part of a wider piece of work in the Department because it was brought to our attention in a case during the summer.  I would be happy to look at the example of the homeless family the Deputy raised to see how we can better frame or advise local authorities on their standing orders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022092200002#F00900","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":1125,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming before the committee to discuss this all-important issue this morning.  I compliment him and his team, especially Laura Mannion, on their level of engagement with councillors, and I have been hearing about this from councillors throughout the country.  I served for 17 years on a local authority, and when I first started off there, were three females out of 21.  Currently, in our local authority, there are six females out of 40.  In that respect, there are four of them from the city and two from the rural areas.  That certainly is in line with the Minister of State's statement.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of maternity leave, using our local authority in Limerick as example, we have four young females and the two other females have been there for a considerable length of time and their families are grown up.  This is a template to encourage more participation by females in terms of local authorities.  I have seen that even at training courses we have run ourselves and through our engagement with young potential candidates.  It was a stumbling block.  In terms of the temporary replacement, I know it will be up to the person who is taking the maternity leave, their party or whatever, to appoint the temporary person, but would it be preferred that it would be another female?  Can that be suggested?<\/p> <p>  Second, that councillors will qualify for and get a payment is very important, because for so long they did not qualify for anything.  I thank the Minister of State for all he did to bring councillors into the scheme and that their PRSI now means something for them, because for a long time people were not aware there was no benefit from the class K.<\/p> <p>  On the temporary substitute, is there any limit on the length of time for which the person can take the leave of absence or is it open-ended?  I am afraid that I have to go to another committee for a quorum so I will have to listen back to the answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022092200002#G00200","speaker":"1695"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":1126,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Maria Byrne.  It is 26 and 16 weeks for maternity leave and it is 18 months for illness if somebody is very sick and needs that support.  We are happy to work with the Senator on any suggestions she has.  For the individual who is going on maternity leave, it should be their choice.  That is how we are framing this policy piece around this legislative change.  It would be their choice as to who would represent them on the local authority, because it is a very personal thing to go on maternity leave.  Someone needs to trust the person they will seek to discharge their duties for their community.  If that trust were to be taken away from women, that would be a regressive step.  Women tell me that when they are making this choice, they may decide to carry on, and many are pushing for the administrative supports, which are given.  They may decide to carry on doing their functions but with a slightly lighter workload by having that support.  That is why that piece is so important.<\/p> <p>  As I said, if we see any stress points or this mechanism being in any way thwarted at a local authority level, we will stand ready to take action.  We will rely on all our Deputies, councillors and Senators to keep us informed on that, because it is apolitical.

I will not say too much about this circular and statement, other than that I very much welcome it.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's enormous and progressive work to support councils across the board.  I like that emphasis he has put on collaboration across those in parties and those who are not, which is where local government is at its best.  There is great collaboration across local government in Ireland by groups which may have more geographical connection than political connection, which is important.  Anything that supports councillors in their work in local government is important.  This is only one aspect of the jigsaw in terms of supporting councillors.  The Minister of State has dealt with pay and conditions and there are ongoing issues there.<\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of mental health.  There are there are many reasons people have to step down.  Yesterday, I looked at the number of councillors who have stood down.  There is a much higher proportion of women than men, which is another interesting indicator, who have left since the elections in 2000.  I take a personal interest in ringing them up, particularly if I know them, and asking them why.  I spoke to a woman the other day who said it was because of the physical stress of it.  There is the issue of social media and there were many challenges around local government.  They thought, &ldquo;Do I really need this?\", given they might have a family and other things to be doing and that they could be doing a part-time job and getting twice the amount of money.  There are many reasons people have to take a break from a job.  It occurs in teaching and in all professions, and this is no different.  We need always to bear that in mind.  However, I genuinely thank the Minister of State, who was a councillor for many years and became embedded and steeped in local government in that time.  He can see the issues and brings that to this Bill.  The Association of Irish Local Government, AILG speaks well and strongly of the Minister of State and his proactive engagement with it, and I acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  My parting words are to say this is great, but sometime in the near future, it is to be hoped, this committee, the Minister of State, his Department and his officials will start to focus on how we can devolve more powers, not fewer, to local authorities, our city and county councils.  We are taking powers away from them regularly.  For example, yesterday in the Oireachtas through the Higher Education Authority Bill, we took sitting city and county councillors off the education authorities.  Their veto was blocked in terms of disposing their properties to the Land Development Agency.  There may be good reasons for that, some of which are logistical or long term, but if we are talking about supporting local government and local councils, we need to start talking now about devolving more powers from central government to local authorities.  Commensurate with those additional powers come responsibilities, and I acknowledge that, too.  I know the Minister of State is keen, and he has constantly emphasised, that if we are going to give more powers to local councillors, responsibilities will come with those, as will supports and further training so that they can become better councillors and better practitioners in advocating real democracy and real engagement on the ground within local communities.<\/p> <p>  I will finish on that.  I thank the Chair for his indulgence as I went off on a strand.  Ministers come and go but we are indebted to a committed, professional core personnel within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  There have been big changes there in recent years.  I acknowledge those who have moved on and those who are moving up because this committee has a good, strong relationship with the Custom House.  I have been a member of this committee for a good number of years and I think it is a good relationship and one we need to continue.  Well done to all involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022092200002#G00500","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1663801200,"counter":1128,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his kind words.  He is dead right that there is a huge issue with retention throughout the country.  I have seen some very good local authority members who, unfortunately, have left the field.  We are at a loss without their service, which was very important, and I saw that my own local authority area.  In terms of mental health, the Local Authority Members Association,LAMA, is doing significant work in providing counselling.  I was amazed and delighted to see the AILG partnering up with UCC for degree programmes to upskill councillors.  They are at the cutting edge, arming them with what they need to discharge their duties as local authority representatives.<\/p> <p>  We have got into a much better space in local government, but we all can do better, including me, in terms of how we talk to one another in public discourse.  We see, especially for women councillors, that some of the stuff that is put up on social media is horrific.  When we talk to one another in committees, the Chamber or wherever, we have to be mindful of that.  Again, 99.9% of those who are in politics, whether they are in national or local politics, are in it to do their very best for their community.  We all may have different views, but how we articulate those views is important in a modern democracy, in discourse and in how that is reflected on social media.  I know the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is weaving its way through the Oireachtas, but there is so much more we can do in that space.  It will be a significant challenge.  From having spoken to women going for seats in election and from many engagements over recent months, sometimes they do not have that extra confidence to go forward and put a name on the ballot paper because they are afraid of that extra scrutiny or that they will not know everything from A to Z.<\/p><p>One lady, quoting another individual who recently spoke, said that many mediocre men have been involved in politics through the years and to please give her the chance to vote for mediocre women.  I thought that was a good line.  We need to give women confidence.  It is hard to be in politics but supports exist and are getting better.  We need to encourage more women to get involved in politics.

Ageism is alive and well in politics.  I spoke to a woman before the summer who is a teacher and just retired as the principal of a primary school.  She is steeped in her own community and as a former principal of a national school for 30 years.  She is involved in the GAA.  She did major fundraising for the hospice.  She ticks all the boxes.  Ask a busy person to do something and that person will do it.  She told me that she could not run and asked who would want her.  With all the skills, knowledge, networking and contacts that she had, she did not feel there was a place for her to run for local government.  She said she was 65 or 66.  I said there was no age bar on it.  We often hear about bringing new people and new women into politics.  I am all for bringing new men, women and diverse people and cultures into politics.  Let us not forget that there are older people who rightly, understandably feel they have a lot to offer.  We need to support them.  I do not want to hear that language used.  I do not see the pictures.  One has to see it to believe it.  I do not see the marketing.  Having been a councillor for 30 years does not mean one has to give up at the next local elections.<\/p> <p>  There is much emphasis on the newness, but let us also remember and value experienced people.  Let us remember that people who have had a full life in the community have much to offer to local councils.  We sometimes lose that in our discussions when we talk about the new local elections, the new way and the new people.  We always want new people, but we want experienced people too.  We want loads of new people to come into politics at 65 or 70.  Why not?  It is to be representative of our communities and the diversity within them.  That would really strengthen local government.

I am not sure if other people would be able to do that.  I remember my wife writing speeches or press releases for me when sitting in the kitchen with a cup of tea after the kids went to bad.  There are probably many councillors who have good relationships and support from family and friends, as well as their parties.  I could pick up the phone to Mick Nugent and others, tell them I was thinking of doing something, and ask what they thought of it.  Many people do not have that support.  The Minister of State talked about bringing forward administration support.  Should the Minister of State look at that?  Trying to encourage more people to get involved in local politics is a challenge.  The local elections are coming up fast.  Some people will go forward, but are they the right people?

I had an employer who was willing to give me a little slack to go to the council chamber, but, being honest, not every employer is willing to do so.  Deputy Gould is right that social media has added a new dimension.  I remember when social media was starting to come to prominence at the current scale in 2009.  I remember that Twitter was used a fair bit.  We have seen a significant change and penetration into communities.  It is a useful tool to spread information, but regulating negativity is a significant challenge for society.  How we talk to one another on social media is another issue.
