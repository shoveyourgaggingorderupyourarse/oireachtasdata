I tabled this matter looking for the Minister of State with responsibility for disability to make a statement on the lack of access and supports for personalised transportation for disability drivers.  This scheme was effectively abandoned in 2013, but it is a very worthwhile scheme that gave great access to people with disabilities.  It is a big issue that we need to revisit.<\/p> <p>The discontinuation of the scheme has been highlighted by many people.  I received a phone call from a former Senator, John O'Mahony, about it last week.  He was campaigning on it the past few years and said it needs to be raised again.  I have a 34-year-old constituent with motor neurone disease.  His wife is his full-time carer, he has two young kids and he is living in a rural part.  He is abandoned and has no ability to go anywhere.  The only scheme that is applicable to him to get transportation because of his disease is this scheme, which has been discontinued since 2013.  When it was discontinued, it was stated that a new scheme, the transportation support scheme, would be introduced in its place.  It is nine years later and that scheme still has not emerged.  We have been waiting nine years for the Government to bring forward a scheme in order that people with disabilities will have the opportunity to have some kind of quality of life.  At the moment, this man is effectively trapped in his own house with no ability to go anywhere, seven days a week.  That is unfortunate and it is an issue for us as a society.  <\/p> <p>The Ombudsman made a critical and damning complaint in this regard in the past few weeks.  He published a report on the issue, which stated that since 2016, 335 complaints have been received by the Ombudsman on this issue alone.  In the recommendations he said that the lack of personalised transportation for people with disabilities is unfair and entirely unacceptable.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those are strong words from the Ombudsman on this issue.<\/p><p>For the last nine years we have talked about this issue but there has been no movement by the Department of Health and we need movement now.

An urgent scheme must be brought forward in the near future and in the next few months otherwise the people for whom I advocate, such as the 34-year-old man in Bandon who has motor neurone disease, will literally be prisoners in their homes.

That was on foot of the reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding the legal status of both schemes in the context of the Equal Status Acts.  The Government also decided to continue payment of the monthly mobility allowance on an interim basis to the 4,700 people who were in receipt of a mobility allowance at the time the scheme closed.<\/p> <p>I would like to make this House aware of other transport supports available to people with disabilities.  The Revenue Commissioners operate the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concession scheme that provides relief from vehicle registration tax and value added tax on the purchase and use of an adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant.  The scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations.  In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must satisfy certain medical criteria and hold a primary medical certificate issued by the relevant HSE senior area medical officer or hold a board medical certificate issued by the disabled drivers medical board of appeal.  <\/p> <p>The Minister for Finance has given a commitment to undertake a comprehensive review of this scheme to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities.  Other transport supports available to people with disabilities include the free travel scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection and measures funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development, under the Ceantair Laga &Aacute;rd-Riachtanais, CL&Aacute;R programme, to provide grants to voluntary organisations that provide transport for people with significant mobility issues.<\/p> <p>Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017 to 2021, the Department of Transport has responsibility for the continued development of the availability of accessible public transport.  The Department is committed to this in recognition of the importance of such services to the lives of people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>I would like to inform the House that work is ongoing on the policy proposals for the provision of transport services for people with disabilities.  There have been a number of recent developments that may impact on these policy proposals including: the Department of Transport's review of active travel and public transport policy, including accessible public transport; the Department of Social Protection has commissioned a cost of disability study, which will inform policy direction on the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including transport costs; and <\/p> <p>under the national disability inclusion strategy, a working group was established to lead a review of all Government-funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>I can assure the House of the Government's continued commitment to find a long-term equitable solution, which meets the transport needs of those people with disabilities with the most significant challenges. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#B00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

However, I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is before an Oireachtas committee because she phoned me yesterday.<\/p><p>My Commencement matter concerns the provision of winter beds and permanent beds for Galway.  Yesterday, at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health we discussed the winter plan with Mr. Paul Reid, chief executive officer, and his senior officials in the HSE.  I pointed out that we need a plan for each hospital so in this case University Hospital Galway or at least for the Saolta University Hospital Care Group.  The national plan contains a promise or commitment to provide 205 acute beds over the period of this winter, also community beds, extra resources for GPs and the like.  I asked a question based on the fact that the one in eight people who have been on trolleys over the last eight weeks were on trolleys in University Hospital Galway.  I asked how many of the 205 acute beds that are proposed to be provided as part of the winter plan will be located in Galway and the answer I was given was zero.  I find it unbelievable that no beds will be given to the hospital that has had the highest rate of people on trolleys over the last eight weeks.  How does that make sense to anybody?  The reason given was that there is no capacity to put beds in place, no wards have been closed and there is no space without major construction.  They said they are considering community beds and private care.  Obviously there is no capacity in other hospitals.  Certainly I would not advocate that patients from Galway would be transferred elsewhere for care.  They want and deserve to be looked after within their home area and within University Hospital Galway.  The hospital is at breaking point and there is no capacity within the hospital or within Merlin Park.<\/p><p>The resourcing of GPs is an important area and I have previously raised the issue of Westdoc, which is an out-of-hours service in my region.  Westdoc does not cover some parts of County Galway and it does not cover my own area of Moycullen, Rosscahill and Oughterard, which is close to Galway city.  If one has an out-of-hours patient that cannot avail of Westdoc then where must he or she go?  Such people must go to the emergency department.  Yesterday at the committee meeting, Ms Anne O'Connor of the HSE said that the HSE would look at resourcing Westdoc to provide extra provision as part of the winter plan because there are resources available.  I welcome that and urge the HSE to consider the matter.<\/p><p>In the meantime, the winter plan does not provide acute beds to Galway and we do not know what will happen long term.  We have proposals from an elective hospital, which is likely to be Merlin Park, and an announcement is due to be made.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There were commitments and promises regarding acute beds, but it now seems that none will be provided or the matter is still under discussion.<\/p><p>That is the situation in Galway.

That is the situation in the largest city in the west and the centre of excellence for hospital care in the west.  It is a sorry state of affairs.  There are many plans and a great deal of talk, yet the situation on the ground is dire.

She sends her apologies.<\/p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the issue of additional beds in Galway university hospitals, GUH, raised by Senator Kyne.  While additional beds are an important part of the solution to emergency department overcrowding and waiting lists at GUH, it is also important to acknowledge that our response must not be solely based on the provision of extra beds but also on the provision of alternative pathways of care outside the acute sector in line with Sl&aacute;intecare's right care, right place, right time philosophy.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the scale of the challenge facing our acute hospitals as we head into what is expected to be a difficult winter with increasing levels of Covid-19.  The Government is taking action to mitigate the challenges presented.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, published the 2021-22 winter plan on 15 November.  The plan centres on three core objectives - emergency department avoidance, patient flow and hospital egress - to mitigate the expected challenges in providing emergency care this winter while also continuing to respond to Covid-19.  This year's winter plan recognises that a whole-of-system response is required and outlines how the HSE proposes to manage winter challenges across primary, community and acute care, including measures to allow the public system to access private healthcare capacity.<\/p> <p>GUH provides regional services for a wide range of specialties and is also a designated centre for cancer and cardiac services.  It has a total of 712 inpatient beds across the specialties - 639 in University Hospital Galway, UHG, and 73 in Merlin Park University Hospital - and approximately 3,500 whole-time equivalent staff.<\/p> <p>We continue to invest in UHG to improve services to patients.  Six additional critical care beds have recently been opened in GUH.  The number of beds open on any particular day is subject to fluctuation as a result of variety of factors.  Building works have commenced on the cardiothoracic ward in UHG to provide 12 cardiothoracic beds and are scheduled for completion in the second quarter of 2022.  The new radiation oncology unit is under way and is scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter of 2022.  GUH also has access to additional beds in the private hospitals in Galway under the safety net arrangements.  Work is progressing to complete a temporary extension to the emergency department to provide additional accommodation.  The phased handover is scheduled for the end of April 2022.  Merlin Park saw the commencement of building work to deliver two orthopaedic theatres with ancillary accommodation for the provision of elective procedures, which are expected to become operational in January 2022.  Finally, the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021-2023, approved in May, commits to progressing an elective-only hospital in Galway.  The Department of Health is engaged in the preparatory work necessary to seek Government approval to proceed with this project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#C00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response on behalf of the Department.

They should be part of the solution, but they are not in Galway, given that none will be provided despite the fact that it is top of the list in terms of the number of people on trolleys over the past eight weeks.  Clearly, the Minister of State's speech should have read, \"They are not part of the solution for GUH and we have to look at private care\".  That is the only solution based on what I heard yesterday from HSE officials at the Joint Committee on Health and today from the Minister of State.  We must look to private hospitals in Galway.  Thankfully, they are there because they were built and financed, but it is not good enough that there is no physical space to put anything due to bad planning by the HSE and the Saolta University Health Care Group, which have a diversity of opinions about the UHG campus and Merlin Park.  Some want to move everything to Merlin Park, some want to move parts to Merlin Park.  We are caught in a situation where there are on both sides of the city medium-term, long-term and grandiose plans of &euro;3 billion to &euro;4 billion but there are no medium-term plans to provide extra beds for an area that the national planning framework has identified will see a population increase over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#C00300","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The safety net arrangements are being used to utilise capacity within the private hospitals in Galway and a number of other beds are in train for next year.  The health service capacity review was clear on the need for major investment in additional capacity in acute and community hospitals combined with a widescale reform of the manner and location of where health services were provided.  The current winter plan builds on significant investment in last year's plan, which committed to delivering 1,146 additional beds over the number at the start of 2020.  Of those additional beds, 800 are now in place and a further 50 are expected to be delivered by the end of December.

The Senator accepts and understands that it is not all about beds.  Reducing pressure on acute hospitals also requires providing egress arrangements such as additional nursing home places, step-down care and, as he mentioned, providing pathways for people to avoid going into emergency departments because that is their only choice.  The Senator stated that Westdoc was under pressure.  If people cannot access primary care and their only option is to attend the emergency department and wait for hours, that is not something that they want to do or that the health service wants to happen.

While it is not yet known whether we will find a way to live with the virus or will finally kick it, there is one threat that winter will always bring, and that is the cold.  We are touching the bottom of the thermometer in some places in the country and snow is on the way for others.  In the face of the winter chill, our houses must be up to scratch, doubly so as energy prices rise.  The energy efficiency of people's homes is as much a climate issue as it is a comfort one and a health one.  That is why schemes such as the better energy warmer homes scheme are of such important, but a scheme can only be as good as its administration.  That is why I have raised this Commencement matter.<\/p> <p>Last week, I received some information from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.

These figures do not reflect a significant backlog on account of the health measures, which is positive, but the Minister of State will appreciate that the 26 months from application date to works being completed has entailed an additional two winters in homes of subpar energy efficiency.  Combined with talk of power outages over the coming winter, this paints a bleak picture.<\/p> <p>I understand that funding for the scheme has increased significantly this year, with &euro;100 million allocated to it, and that the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme is to be expanded.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->How will this funding lead to a reduction in waiting times for families on the waiting list?

These targets represent a very significant increase in the volume and depth of retrofit activity in Ireland.  The recently published national retrofit plan sets out how we will achieve these targets and identifies an unprecedented &euro;8 billion up to 2030, to support homeowners to retrofit their homes.  <\/p> <p>My Department funds a number of grant schemes to support homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their properties.  These are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Since 2000, more than 450,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes, representing almost one in four homes across the country.  This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier to heat and light.  <\/p> <p>The programme for Government committed to ensuring that the retrofit programme is socially progressive, with a focus on low-income households and the better energy warmer homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low-income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  Energy poverty is influenced by a person's income, the energy efficiency of his or her home and the cost of the energy used in the home.  The scheme is currently available to households in receipt of either fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme, jobseeker's allowance for more than six months, having children under seven, family income supplement, one-parent family payment, domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance where the applicant lives with the person being cared for.  To date, more than143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme.  <\/p> <p>Funding for the SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased significantly to over &euro;109 million in 2021, with &euro;100 million allocated to the warmer homes scheme.  This is an increase of &euro;47 million on last year's allocation and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget is available to support people vulnerable to energy poverty.  The funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades, leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level.  I have also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme.  In addition to delivery capacity, supply chain has increased due to a new broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020.  Every effort is being made to maximise outputs in construction activity in the residential sector recommenced earlier this year.  The commitment will not only help in reducing our carbon emissions, it will benefit low-income households in many homes.  Homes will be warmer, easier to heat and more comfortable, supporting improved occupant health and well-being.  Households are also more protected from changes to their income or in the cost of energy.  <\/p> <p>There are currently just over 7,000 homeowners on the warmer homes scheme work programme.  Recent data from the SEAI indicates that for homes completed in the first half of 2021, the average time from application to completion was approximately 26 months countrywide.  It is important to note that the average wait times have increased significantly due to the extensive Covid-19 related restrictions on construction activity during much of 2020, as well as between January and mid-April 2021 when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  Wait times have been also negatively impacted by challenges associated with availability and longer lead times for materials.  The SEAI has advised me that the average wait time should only ever be used as a general guide and that wait times vary based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application, as well as other factors, including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather.  <\/p> <p>Looking to next year, budget 2022 has allocated &euro;202 million for the SEAI residential and community retrofit scheme and a further &euro;10 million for the solar PV scheme.  More than half of this amount, &euro;109 million, will be used to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households that are in or at risk of energy poverty.  It is estimated that over 4,500 upgrades will be provided under SEAI energy poverty schemes in 2022.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#D00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I appreciate the response.

Twenty-six months is a very long time, particularly for those who are on the poverty line.  All of the people who can avail of these grants are on the poverty line.  It is not only for this winter they will not have an upgrade, but next winter and the winter after that.  It is only after that they will get the works done and, as such, it will be three years before people will be able to avail of the warmer homes scheme.<\/p> <p>More must be done.  We must either reduce the VAT rate or apply a zero VAT rate in respect of retrofit works to make houses warmer for those who are not eligible for works under the free scheme.

The Senator will know that there are two parts to the major retrofit scheme, the better energy warmer homes scheme, which is free, and a further scheme for people who are owner-occupiers and outside of that.  To help people to afford it, there are two parts to that, one of which is a grants scheme.  We are bringing in a cheap loans scheme as well to fund the other portion of the investment because we know that many people who are working hard but do not fit within that category will be faced with a large expenditure.  The idea is that the savings made from reduced energy bills would be used to meet the repayments on the loan.  That is important to remember.<\/p> <p>This scheme has changed enormously.  It has moved from a scheme which had only about &euro;20 million in funding per annum to a scheme that is now six times that size.  Every year, it is massively increasing.  The sum of &euro;109 million is provided for this year for the better energy warmer homes scheme.  The funding for next year will be larger in that there will be a capital carryover from unspent money.  For a quarter of this year all construction activity was banned and so works could not be done.  This is not just an excuse.  There is a huge desire to do this.  One of the most important things any Government can do is to keep poorer people warm in their homes in the winter, in particular older people who feel the cold more.  It is an absolute necessity.  In the face of rising energy prices and so on, it is a priority that we manage to do that.  We cannot achieve our climate action goals without doing this.  We need to insulate all these homes in this country.  It is an enormous project, costing &euro;25 billion over ten years and it requires 25,000 staff.  There is huge retraining going on and huge redirection of financial resources.  It is a massive priority for us.

I thank him for taking this Commencement matter, which is about the DEIS, that is, delivering equality of opportunity in schools.  Schools have not been assessed for years for DEIS and, as such, schools cannot get DEIS status.  This has been going on since 2015.  A small number of schools were added in 2017 but no schools have since been added to the DEIS programme.  This is a huge issue.<\/p> <p>A Department of Education report states that schools in higher level of disadvantage are outside of the DEIS programme.  DEIS supports include reduced class size, which means more staff, additional funding, access to literacy and numeracy programmes, the home-school community liaison which is funded through Tusla, the school completion programme to support students in second level to progress to third level, again funded through Tusla, and access to the school meals programme through the Department of Social Protection.  <\/p> <p>I first tabled a Commencement matter on this topic in April this year.  In October, I made statements about the urgency of the DEIS identification model.  I am again raising the issue today.  In welcome the announcement by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, with regard to the roll-out of the hot school meals programme to a further 55,000 students.  That is so welcome but, again, this is for existing DEIS schools.  In the recent budget, the Government made available an additional &euro;18 million for 2022, with &euro;32 million planned for 2023, to extend the DEIS programme to schools with disadvantage.  That is an increase of more than 20% in that budget.  What is the status of the technical group that is putting together the model of DEIS school identification?  This process has been going on for years.

How, therefore, are schools to be evaluated?  Is it going to be based on a census that is not happening until April of next year?  Are we going to have to wait until the census and gathering of data is done?  That is just not good enough.<br\/><br\/>In Ballinasloe we have a DEIS band 1 primary school with additional supports in place for children, though Scoil an Chroi Naofa is still awaiting capital funding for a school building.  However, there are no supports at secondary school level in my town.  Perhaps we are very special in my town and disadvantage disappears at the age of 12.  It is just magically gone - poof, and there is no disadvantage.  That would be absolutely fantastic but in the real world that is not the case.  I repeat the quote from the home school community liaison, HSCL, there who stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe retention of pupils following transfer to secondary school here in Ballinasloe, particularly amongst boys, is challenging.  Children leave sixth class having had huge levels of support in primary with DEIS initiatives such as the breakfast club, school lunches, homework club, HSCL and SCP support, affordable book rental schemes, parenting courses, one-to-one pupil parent support targeted at work and attendance including regular home visits with the HSCL and educational welfare officers and so on.  These supports are not available in non-DEIS secondary schools.  As such, pupils start out in secondary schools at a disadvantage.  They quickly disengage and then ultimately we are faced with school drop-outs. <\/blockquote><p>I have also received a letter from a principal in Gortaganny, Loughglinn, County Roscommon.  Loughglinn is on the county boundary with Mayo.  It is less than 5 km to Ballyhaunis and it is very close to the direct provision centre.  In 2014, the school applied for DEIS status and was unsuccessful.  There are 89 pupils, 23 of whom are from the direct provision centre.  The school reapplied in 2017 and again was unsuccessful.  At the moment, over 62% of the children in the school in Loughglinn are coming from direct provision centres.  These children are at huge disadvantage.  They probably do not even have English as their first language.  They need things like first steps reading recovery and maths recovery.  It would be invaluable.  They need extra support.  The current Miss Ireland, Pamela Uba, is a former pupil of the school and would have resided in the direct provision centre in Ballyhaunis.  It is all about equality and inclusion but there is no equality of opportunity when children and schools in areas of severe disadvantage cannot access supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#D00600","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I am answering on behalf of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue about DEIS schools.  Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools is the main policy initiative of this Government to tackle educational disadvantage at school level.  Budget 2022 has provided for an allocation of &euro;18 million for 2022 and &euro;32 million for 2023 to extend the DEIS programme to further schools with the highest levels of disadvantage.  This represents an increase in funding for the DEIS programme of over one fifth.  This year the Department of Education will spend in the region of &euro;150 million on providing supports for schools in DEIS.  The programme supports 884 schools and over 180,000 learners.  This investment includes providing for over 400 home school community liaison co-ordinators, in the region of &euro;16 million in DEIS grants, additional posts for DEIS band 1 primary schools, curriculum supports, enhanced book grants and access to the school completion programme.  Schools in the DEIS programme can also avail of the school meals programme which is provided by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p> <p>This package follows an extensive body of work which has been undertaken by the DEIS technical group regarding the development of a model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools.  This group contains representatives of the Department of Education's statistics and social inclusion units, the inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre.  This work involved an initial process of consultation by the Department with the education partners on the technical aspects of the model.  The purpose is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and also to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application.<\/p> <p>The DEIS identification process under DEIS plan 2017 is an objective, statistics-based process, based on school enrolment data and Central Statistics Office data from the national census of population as represented in the Pobal HP index for small areas, which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  It is important to note that schools are not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and all schools will be considered under the refined model.  It is also important to note that educational outcomes do not play any part in the identification of schools for inclusion in the DEIS programme at either primary or post-primary level.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government set out a commitment to: \"Complete the new DEIS identification model, ensuring the extension of DEIS status to schools that are identified as being suitable\".  This additional funding under budget 2022 has been provided for the extension of DEIS supports to those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage that are not currently in the programme and will allow for that commitment to be achieved.

These schools and these children are at concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.  The last amount allocated funding under this programme was in 2017.  It is crucial we allow even the smallest of supports.  How can the Department of Social Protection allocate hot meals programmes to schools outside of DEIS?

There are more than 8,000 people homeless today in Ireland and more than 2,300 of them are under 18 years of age.  Housing for All, the Government's action plan, commits to eliminating homelessness by 2030.  It commits to greater targets in Housing First and &euro;20 billion in a State-led provision of 300,000 homes.  Some 90,000 of those homes will be social homes and almost 60,000 of them affordable homes, using State-owned land to reduce the cost of provision of housing.<\/p> <p>Focus Ireland has a radio ad that Members may have heard.  In that ad, a little girl talks about how she is living in a hotel and her little brother cannot stop crying because he wants to go home.  Anybody who has heard that ad has to have been touched.  Far too many children are being born into homelessness.  That is why the Government has made the unprecedented &euro;20 billion commitment to invest in the provision of housing for our people.<\/p> <p>Today, I would like to ask every Member, and in particular those in opposition, to put politics aside and to do the right thing, not just by people who are homeless, but people who are at risk of homelessness and people who desperately want to own their own home.  This week, we saw Dublin City Council finally, after more than 30 years, approve a plan for 850 public homes and social and affordable homes on State-owned land, and it was opposed by Sinn F&eacute;in, the Social Democrats and Labour.  This hypocrisy is morally bankrupt at a time many of our citizens desperately need housing.  When the State is committing &euro;20 billion and State-owned lands are being used and being provided to deliver public housing, it is wrong for any politician of any party or none to oppose the provision of housing, to object to it, to lake legal cases against it or to block it.  I ask them to stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#G00300","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I ask that the Minister for Health be called in as a matter of urgency regarding the winter plan he announced a week ago.  I recall that, last year, it was announced in the second-last week of September and it was a winter plan for October to March, yet this winter plan was only announced a week ago.  That has raised concerns for the public, although it is welcome that there will be an increased number of ICU beds, which have gone from 300 to 350.<\/p> <p>I was looking at the nationwide trolley count this morning.  Some 274 people were on trolleys this morning and even though that sounds a lot, it is actually quite good because, earlier in the month, the figure was above 500.  However, there is always a fear that it will go up again.  To take some examples, Limerick University Hospital this morning has 45 people on trolleys, and that is after an extra 100 beds were put into that hospital.  My colleagues, Senators Maria Byrne and Martin Conway, have brought this up previously, and the acting Leader will also know the situation in Galway.  We need to have a serious discussion with the Minister on the management of hospitals.  If we are bringing 100 beds into a hospital, we should surely see a difference in the trolley count.  To compare that to Tipperary University Hospital in my home town of Clonmel, a 40-bed modular unit was started by the T&aacute;naiste when he was Minister for Health and it was delivered by Deputy Simon Harris, his successor, and opened a number of weeks ago.  Today, it has zero people on trolleys.  It is expected to get an extra 33 beds in the St. Michael's unit, which acts as an overflow for the hospital.  This just shows that, in the management of hospitals, one hospital in Clonmel has zero people on trolleys, or very few, after getting an extra 40 beds, but Limerick University Hospital, after getting an extra 100 beds, still had 45 this morning and last week had 95.  There is a need for the Minister to come to the House to outline his vision for the next number of months.<\/p> <p>A number of people have contacted me about weddings in the next weeks and months, in particular regarding the closing time of hotels.  One of the biggest changes made in recent weeks is that residents' bars are closed at midnight.  While I totally agree with that, I believe there should be an exception for weddings.  If weddings are going to be on in hotels from 1 p.m. or 2 p.m., people are going to be there for eight or nine hours.  What difference does it make if it closes at 12 midnight or 2 a.m.?  Predominantly, residents at weddings are family members - it is a brother, a sister-in-law or people we are with every day.  It does not make a difference.  There is a real frustration for people who have had their weddings delayed three, four or five times in the past two years.  They are now being told they can go ahead but, even though they are with their family every day of the week, they cannot be with them after 12 midnight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#G00400","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>There are a couple of issues I want to raise this morning.

They help each of us in our work and it is important they get a living wage.<br\/><br\/>Several Members spoke yesterday about the continuous use of vaccine passports or extending their use and limiting the number of services the unvaccinated can access.  If we follow the science on this, it is clear that having a Covid certificate does not stop a person carrying the virus, passing on the virus or getting the virus.  New evidence this morning states that the efficacy of the second Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine only lasts 90 days.  We can see what is happening throughout the world where millions of people are protesting on this very issue.  People are being forced to take vaccinations against their will and those who refuse are locked out of society.  We need to wake up.  If people must show papers to move around and to access food, services or travel, that is not freedom or democracy.  I caution those in this House to stop the persecution of the people who for many reasons, including medical reasons, cannot get the vaccination.  Some people may have got their first vaccination and, due to complications, cannot get their second vaccination.  Others simply do not want the vaccination at this early stage.  <i>The Lancet<\/i>, one of the world's most prestigious medical journals, has published an article asserting that people who are not getting vaccinated are being bullied.  The unvaccinated are being stigmatised and that is not justified.<br\/><br\/>Our nation, people and businesses are suffering at the hands of the mismanaged health service.  The people of this nation must, once again, shoulder the cost.  We certainly do not want Senators adding to the fear that drives division in our society.  <br\/><br\/>I will move on to talk about cybercrime in Ireland.  A Grant Thornton report stated there was a 50% increase in the level of cybercrime in 2020.  Furthermore, it is estimated that cybercrime cost the economy &euro;9.6 billion last year, an astronomical increase from the &euro;630 million estimated by Grant Thornton in 2014.  The cyberattack on the HSE, combined with pressures caused by Covid-19, left the healthcare system in anarchy, with an 80% drop in the number of appointments in the days after the attack.  Staff struggled to cope.  The effects have been felt in the months since.  The increases in spam emails, texts and calls to millions of our citizens since the attack must surely be a concern for us all.  I have questions about the HSE.  Has any assessment been carried out on the damage this has caused?  Has there been analysis of what types of data have been leaked, and the level of that leak?  Will those findings be made public?  Perhaps the Minister for Justice could be asked to come to the House to discuss this issue and how it will be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#G00500","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Who ever said Covid certificates stop people getting Covid?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#H00200","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>&quot;Do not be despondent.&quot;  So began a recent email to me from Mr. Fergal Monaghan, project manager of the Hen Harrier Project, which is supported by my Department.

I have not yet had the opportunity to visit but I understand that the hen harrier is held in such a position of pride that the village has changed the sign on its outskirts to include a hen harrier.  The village has a landscaped, hen harrier walk along the river.  There is even a statue of a hen harrier in the village.  Positivity among the people who share a landscape is probably one of the best protections that any species could have, perhaps even better than any number of designations, laws, regulations or new rangers.  We need to harness that.<\/p><p>I witnessed that same positivity clearly last week in County Offaly when I was honoured to be invited to attend St. Brendan's Community School in Birr for its relaunch of the Killaun Bog boardwalk almost 30 years after it was originally launched by former President, Mary Robinson.  This is a heart-lifting story of a community working together and the sense of pride of place that comes with that.  This community was ahead of its time in laying that boardwalk through the stunning Killaun Bog and it was great to have the chance to meet and talk with Mr. Mick Spain, one of the people who laid the original boardwalk all those years ago.  The evening was made extra special because renowned botanist and local man, Mr. John Feehan, was launching his latest book, <i>When the Nightjar Returns<\/i>, which is all about the history of Killaun Bog, its rich habitat and what the future may hold.  &quot;A rainforest on our doorstep&quot; was how Mr. Feehan described it, and he is right.  This is an extraordinary place and exceptional too are the community and the students of St. Brendan's who are so intent on conserving it.<\/p><p>At the end of the day, nature needs our help and the story of Killaun Bog is a shining light for many other communities across the country that are passionate about protecting nature, preserving what is there and, where possible, restoring it to its former glory.  There are some who wish to continue to plunder our natural resources but I want to champion those who wish to protect it, such as the students of St. Brendan's whose understanding and appreciation of nature, climate action and biodiversity is encouraging.  I have no doubt they will be the driving force for a brighter future.  Let us hope that one day the nightjar will indeed make its return to Killaun Bog.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#H00300","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I raise the issue of our secretarial staff, on the back of a very powerful meeting that many of us attended at 10.30 this morning.

I mean this respectfully and not to be confrontational, but that meeting never took place and still has not taken place.  The union has surveyed these workers and presented all the evidence.  From what I can see, the HR department is in agreement with the union.  The blockage is with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, so much so that a union representative told us that it did not even send decision-makers to the most recent talks.  What is being offered to them is 3% over a year.  That is a pay cut.  We have inflation of 5%.

We have a collective responsibility to deliver for these secretarial assistants.  Let us be clear: we have the power, as parliamentary representatives, to do that.  All that is lacking is the political will.

We had domestic violence, rape and other forms of violence against women in this country long before the State was ever set up, but, in particular, we have had them during the pandemic.  We saw a frightening escalation in the number of reports to the Garda last year.  Women's Aid alone received 30,000 calls in 2020.  How many women are present in the Chamber today?  Data from Women's Aid show that one in four women in this country has been she has been abused by a current or former partner.  That is frightening.  Not only is there a personal cost to the women and their families, there is also a societal cost, an economic cost in terms of their jobs and a cost in terms of access to housing among other issues.<\/p> <p>Ireland signed up to the Istanbul Convention, which was ratified in 2019, but we have a long way to go to meet the commitments under it.  One of those commitments relates to the number of refuges in this country.  There are nine counties with no refuge.  Senator Ward has spoken about the lack of a refuge in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Huge credit is due to the refuges in Stepaside and Coolock, which I have had dealings with over the years.

That is the level of skill, input, knowledge and experience that goes into our offices.  Secretarial assistants do a lot, but on a secretarial assistant's wage.  We must bring a similar motion back to the House and agree again on the contents of the motion in light of the make-up of the new Seanad.  It is a disgrace that we have not done anything.

I knew of her many years ago, but I had not heard much about her for years.  She has experienced a huge amount of trauma throughout her lifetime, but I will not go into that on the floor of the House.  In the past eight weeks she was inspired by her own experiences and by the lack of community that exists in many spaces now.  She looked at how she could bring women back together in spaces in working class communities.  She set up what are called Sister Sheds, where women from different walks of life, mainly those from Tallaght, Ballyfermot and Finglas, can meet.  Women are popping up everywhere.  In the space of eight weeks, 1,000 women are engaging with this one woman to try to help her create a safe space in their communities where women can get together and talk.<\/p> <p>The reason I mention this is because it is very difficult for grassroots initiatives that grow organically like that to get support.  We are told that it is necessary to have a company limited by guarantee and that charitable status is required to apply for a small bit of funding to pay for a room.  I have committed to covering the cost of one of the Sister Sheds groups.  If any Dublin representatives in this House or in the Lower House want to support such a group, they could also take on paying the costs of one of those rooms in their constituency where the women can meet once a week and support each other.  Refuge is one answer, but there is a prevention piece that can happen when women come together to support each other.

There are races in Dingle.  Senator Paddy Burke knows about the races in Galway and there are also races in my county of Roscommon and in parts of Meath.  Pony racing is such a part of the community all over the country.  Pony racing has produced the finest jockeys who have become worldwide names.  The sector is struggling and it gets no funding.  Despite Horse Racing Ireland getting a budget of almost &euro;80 million, it claims it can give no funding to pony racing.<\/p> <p>I also wish to deal with another aspect of the matter.  Many a young lad and lassie in the community can go a little bit wild, if I can use that term with respect.  Many of them have been brought on board by people in the horse racing industry and they have turned out to be incredible leaders.  There is no doubt about it.  Apart from the joy of it, the fact is that this has been such a brilliant process for helping people who might be getting into a little bit of bother to get back on track.  I appeal that a small amount of funding, less than &euro;100,000 per annum, could be given to that business in order to ensure that it survives.

Having the same person hold the role of Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and the role of Minister for Transport does not work.  There are too many different issues calling on their time.  The bottom line, from a defence point of view, is that this country is being left defenseless.  Soon, one of the fastest cables in the world is going to land in the Acting Leader&rsquo;s constituency in Galway.  It will come down from Iceland.  We cannot protect that.

It is timely to call for statements on support for refugees.  I do not want to call this a refugee crisis because the implication there is that somehow the refugees, the people themselves, are the crisis.  In an actual fact, the real crisis primarily comprises the political, economic, military, ecological and environmental policies that are driven by so-called developed states, most of which are in the West.  <\/p> <p>We have heard about the problem of smugglers exploiting these people.  That of course is the case, but smugglers exist to exploit a particular situation.  They step in where exploitation is available to them.  When you adopt policies like a \"fortress Europe\" approach, when you vote in the European Parliament to diminish search and rescue operations for refugees fleeing oppression and military occupation or ecological devastation, then of course people will flee.

They say that domestic violence has been the shadow pandemic for the past two years, but gender-based violence was simply more hidden before Covid.  It reached breaking point during Covid and people could take no more.  We must remember that the people and families that were tortured by domestic violence were tortured before Covid as well.  Gender-based violence of every kind is on the rise, for example, sexual harassment and rape.  It is relentless.  It is horrifying to think about what people have to put up with in life.<\/p> <p>It is up to us.  For the next 16 days, I urge all Senators to talk to their friends and colleagues when sitting with them at the bar and to ask themselves how they as human beings can work to support their friends and colleagues if they are going through this at home.

As such, it is good that we have 16 days to highlight it.<\/p> <p>Every Thursday morning, I come to the Chamber and give out about what I have heard at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.  This morning, though, I bring good news.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, appeared before us.  To say that she is impressive and on top of her brief would be putting it mildly.  She is extraordinary.  I asked her about the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, the lead-up to the ratification of the optional protocol by the Government, what work was under way and whether she was driving it.  She is driving an impressive group comprising representatives from all Departments as well as activists and advocacy groups from across the country.  The voices of people with disabilities are being listened to and are at the table.  That is what this is about, namely, nothing about us without us.  To drill down and hear about the implementation of change for people with disabilities has been impressive.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State gave a shout-out to two bodies that I am proud to amplify in the Chamber.  One was the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, under the T&aacute;naiste, who is our party leader, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, in terms of workplace changes.  She also noted the extraordinary work being done across the country by the Office of Public Works, OPW, in particular.  That work provides access to monuments and public buildings, opportunities to get out and about, etc.  The OPW is under the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan.  I wish to pay tribute to all of that and to supply some good news for a change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#L00600","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for sharing that with us this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#L00700","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I commend Into Kildare, the main tourism body in Kildare, which ran a fantastic conference last week in the stunningly beautiful Kilkea Castle.

I am sure that other Senators have spoken about them.  One of the recommendations in the report on a family friendly and inclusive Parliament states that working for a Senator should be a family friendly role.  In other words, someone should be able to perform that role and, maybe, contemplate having a family or even being able to pay rent for a place in the city centre.

It is not just briefing on legislation and committees, they are involved in writing legislation.  These secretarial assistants support us as one half of the legislative process in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The idea that persons who support us in doing work that affects everybody in this State are not being recognised for their work but are being treated as secretarial assistants is a disgrace, especially as we approach our 100th anniversary.

There is a road network in each forest on which timber can be transported.  In some cases there are problems deciding who is responsible for building these roads.  I must take issue with the people who grant felling licences because they say one needs to employ a contractor to prepare the roads.  I believe that should not be the case.  If a road is good enough to take the timber out then that should be adequate.  Also, these issues should be dealt with at the planning permission stage.

It is not my role to tell people what is or is not appropriate in what they are saying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#N01200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":101,"content":"<p>It is dangerous commentary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#N01300","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":102,"content":"<p>It is free speech.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#N01400","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Senator, there is an opportunity to intervene.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#N01500","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>It is rubbish; that is what it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#N01600","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Senator, we are not reopening debates, but there is an opportunity to intervene while the person is making the statement, just so you know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#N01700","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I did, and then you went to someone else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#N01800","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>The Senator did not ask.

There was a number of common themes and I will touch on the two main ones.  Senators Byrne, Dolan, Murphy, McGreehan, Seery Kearney, Ruane, Sherlock, Fitzpatrick and &Oacute; Donnghaile raised a very important issue in regard to this being international week or two weeks or 16 days of campaigning on the elimination of violence against women.  I wish to acknowledge the important work being done in this area both in Government supported initiatives and by the voluntary sector, which plays a pivotal role.  The Minister for Justice, as others have said, has detailed extra funding for areas of the country or categories of victims not currently fully covered by support services for victims.  That big exercise was undertaken to identify gaps in services.  As others have referenced, among 18 organisations, &euro;445,000 is being allocated to Victim Support at Court, Lifeline Inishowen, Longford Women's Link, the Immigrant Council of Ireland and Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  The extra funding is being provided this year, and is separate from budget 2022 in which increased funding was also announced for combating domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and supporting victims of crime.  An additional &euro;2.4 million for specific awareness raising and training programmes on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Some &euro;1.1 million will be used to put in place a legal advice and aid service in court for victims of sexual abuse, &euro;1 million is being provided under the Garda Vote to provide accommodation for divisional protective services units, and &euro;4.9 million is being provided to support the victims of crime.  Others, including Senator Ward, have previously raised issues relating to refuges.  This is hugely important.  Senators raised the issue in Dun Laoghaire, and we will seek a debate with the Minister on that, domestic and gender-based violence and the issue of refuges.<\/p> <p>The second major issue that was raised was the highly important role that our secretarial assistants play.  I received a text message on Sunday from my SA, Anne Flaherty, who reminded me she was ten years working with me that day.  I sent her back a reply commiserating with her for having to put up with me for that period.  We all appreciate the important role that SAs play and the Cathaoirleach has addressed the issue in regard to the commission.  The Cathaoirleach and I and Senators Wall and O'Sullivan have continuously raised and sought a solution to this very important issue.  The proposals from SIPTU date from 2018.  They included reducing the scale that SAs face; all staff would move up an increment; an additional maximum increment for each role be introduced; and the SA role in the Seanad be made into a PA role.  These SIPTU proposals are sensible and fair.  The job description, of course, was drawn up in the 1990s.  Times have changed and moved on compared to the 1990s, not only in the country.  The role of SAs and PAs roles have grown fundamentally.  This is above politics; this is about fair play and decency.  I will, therefore, write to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to ask for an update and for intervention and engagement.  Senators Sherlock, Carrigy, Ruane, Murphy, Gavan, Higgins, Craughwell, Buttimer, &Oacute; Donnghaile, Burke, Martin and Byrne all raised the issue.  I am sure everyone else who did not will support fully the sentiments expressed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senators Fitzpatrick and &Oacute; Donnghaile referred to the tragedy in the English Channel.  I am afraid to say that such incidents are becoming more common and that will continue in the decades ahead.  Nobody can blame a person for trying to seek a better life.  Irish people have done so for many years.  Many Irish people went to the United States.  Originally Irish people were sent to Australia but after that other Irish people tried to get there, as well as to Canada and other places, including, of course, our nearest neighbours in the UK.  I have a sister, uncle and other family in the UK and I have family members in Australia and the United States.  It is an issue that we can understand as Irish people.  The consequences for Europe are significant.  Members are aware of the issues and division that, unfortunately, it causes around the world, as well the consequences in the context of the direct provision system here and the pressures on that system.  I welcome the decision by the Minister to consider a new regime or basis for dealing with refugees and asylum seekers in this country, rather than continuing to deal with them through the direct provision system.  I welcome that.  Perhaps we will seek an update on that and an update from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.<\/p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick also spoke about the Oscar Traynor site.  Obviously, I have not dealt with the issue directly but I have followed on Twitter from time to time the developments in the case.  It seems to be a long-running saga.  It is good news that 850 public and social homes are being provided.  It is to be hoped that will bring finality to that debate and provide much-needed homes in that part of Dublin.<\/p><p>Senator Ahearn spoke about the winter plan, which was recently agreed and published.  It was discussed yesterday at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, should anyone wish to look back at the transcript of the meeting.  The Senator referenced the number of patients on trolleys at University Hospital Limerick.  He referred to the recent investment that added 100 beds in the hospital and 40 beds in Clonmel hospital and highlighted the differences between the hospitals in terms of the numbers of patients on trolleys.  All present appreciate the hard-working staff in all hospitals and the difficult decisions management face in all hospitals.  That is not to say that things cannot be done better or that they are not being done better in some hospitals than in others.  Senators Maria Byrne and Conway have raised this issue previously.  I do not know if there are management issues in Limerick hospital, but if there are, they certainly need to be addressed.  I know that when there were particular problems in the hospital in Galway several years ago - there are still problems there in terms of capacity - a hit team came down from the HSE nationally to look at discharge policy and improve it and ensure there was a better flow of patients once they were ready to be released to community beds and the like.  Perhaps there are issues within Limerick hospital that need to be addressed.<\/p><p>The Senator also raised the issues of weddings.  I see the point he is making.  If one spends all day at a wedding, it does not matter if one is there until 2 a.m. in the morning or 3 a.m. in the morning.  We have all been there in various guises at different times.  I will leave that issue to the Cabinet and to NPHET, which offers advice.  It is a fair point but I will not comment on the rights or wrongs of it.<\/p><p>Senator Keogan spoke again about secretarial pay.  She also raised the issue of vaccine passports and discrimination.  This comes back to the point made by Senator Ahearn.  There are so many unvaccinated people taking up beds in emergency departments and putting pressure on the system.  We need to do everything we can to encourage people who have not received the vaccine to get vaccinated.  I appreciate there are people who may have medical conditions that mean they cannot receive the vaccine.  I accept that.  However, there are other people who are listening to scaremongering on social media.  I will not say they are not aware but it may be the case that some individuals are experiencing language issues or whatever.  I know from the comments of Mr. Paul Reid yesterday at the health committee that the HSE is doing a mountain of work, for example, in providing information in a range of languages and visiting certain hotspots such as meat plants where there is a large foreign national population to ensure they know about the services available and get a jab and, of course, the booster when it is available and offered.  There are many no-shows at booster clinics, which is regrettable. <\/p><p>I refer to cybercrime.  When it happens, it is very serious, but when the issue is solved, it goes into the background until the next time it crops up.  We may be able to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, to come to the House to give an update on State cyber policy and so on.<\/p><p>Senator Hackett spoke about the hen harrier.  Communities have to play to their strengths.  If there are communities that have a particular resource such as a bog, hen harriers, corncrakes on Inisbofin, curlews or whatever and it is intrinsic to and synonymous with that area, they have to grasp that and promote, embrace and encourage it.  It is great to see the young people of St. Brendan's school in particular, as well as the wider community, working to showcase what they have.  I acknowledge that work.<\/p><p>Senator Murphy raised several issues I addressed earlier.  He also raised the issue of pony racing not receiving supports from Horse Racing Ireland.  I am not sure if he was speaking about point-to-point racing.  It might be an issue suitable to be raised as a Commencement matter but I am sure it is a valid point.   There is always debate regarding the horse and greyhound fund and how that money is being spent.  It is an important and valid point.<\/p><p>Senators Carrigy and Maria Byrne spoke about black Friday, which is not a term I particularly like.  Green Friday or green Monday would be more suitable.  The Senators rightly urged people to buy local and, as the Cathaoirleach said, to buy Irish.  I recently attended a meeting with businesses in Galway.  There is concern that some businesses are leaving the high street.  I know Senator Buttimer called for a debate on retail strategy and policy.  It is an issue of concern in terms of the changing face of high streets in cities, urban areas and small towns that more people are moving online.  It is fine if a company can embrace both and have a front-door presence as well as an online presence and encourage people to buy Irish and, indeed, encourage people from abroad to buy their products as well.  I agree that it is an important issue.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell raised several issues.   He spoke about damage to sea cables.  I have encountered examples of that, including damage caused to an ESB cable to the Aran Islands a number of years ago.  The Senator made the point that the Garda does not go to sea, but the Naval Service does.  Although increasing the number of Ministers in the Government would be very popular among politicians, I am not sure how the public would react to that unless there was a very valid and strong case for an additional Minister or two at senior level to deal with a specific issue that was not being addressed.<\/p><p>Senator Cassells spoke about Tara Mines.  I am very familiar with the mine.  I have been down in the depths of it.  I cannot remember how many kilometres underground-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#N02000","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>The lowest point of the mine is 850 m underground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#O00200","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Yes, I remember that.  I was there some years ago in my capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for natural resources.

Of course, there is the Tara Deep project, which is the next scene that will provide a sustainable mine and employment in the area into the future.  I note the concern of the Senator, predominantly for the health and safety of workers, but also for the security of their employment in the run-up to Christmas.  I note that Gunnar Nystorm, the general manager of the mine, stated this morning they have a solution and plan to tackle the water flow and that it is hoped it will stop the flow in the coming days.  Everyone is at work.  He stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tSafety is of course our number one priority.  We have all the risk assessments done. <\/blockquote> <p>He offered workers and their families assurance in respect of job security.  I know the exploration and mining division section of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, which has responsibility for natural resources, and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will be providing assistance on request and I am sure they have already been involved on that issue.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer asked for an apology from Dr. Glynn.  I am sure journalists will be putting questions to NPHET and Dr. Glynn regarding the comments in respect of schools being safe.

She gave a good update about the important matters relating to disability and the good work being done by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  She gave the example of the OPW and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p><p>Senator Martin talked about St. Brigid's Day.  I believe there is a connection to St. Brigid in County Kildare, which claims her.  I hope that next year and in the following years, we will be able to celebrate St. Brigid with St. Brigid's Day as a bank holiday.<\/p><p>Senator Higgins talked about the First Nations peoples in Canada, who are front-line defenders of the environment.  That is a matter for a Commencement debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.<\/p><p>Senator Lombard talked about Airbnb.  The example that he provided and the number of houses available for Airbnb but not for rent in Kinsale is striking.  Perhaps we could write to the County and City Management Association to remind it of the legislation and the requirements.<\/p><p>Senator Burke talked about amateur boxing.  Perhaps we could have a debate on amateur sports at some stage with the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers.  He talked about the road network and felling licences.  I am not familiar with the issue.  Was the Senator referring to roads through the forests where felling will happen?  I imagine that would be part of the application for the felling licence.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Senator Hackett, made statements on that here a couple of weeks ago.  I am not sure if that issue was addressed.  Perhaps Senator Burke could liaise with Senator Hackett about that.<\/p><p>Senator Ward talked about abuse of the Interpol process regarding extradition to China.  I suggest that he table a Commencement matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs because it is quite a specific question.<\/p><p>Senator Dolan referred to important issues regarding assault and violence against women, which I have commented on.<\/p><p>I thank all Senators for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#O00300","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637836200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2021: Motion for Earlier Signature","time":1637836200,"counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#P00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat pursuant to subsection 2&deg; of section 2 of Article 25 of the Constitution, Seanad &Eacute;ireann concurs with the Government in a request to the President to sign the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2021 on a date which is earlier than the fifth day after the date on which the Bill shall have been presented to him. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#P00400","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637836200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637836200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 12.52 p.m. and resumed at 1 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021: Motion","time":1637836200,"counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#Q00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \t&quot;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann resolves that the period of operation of sections 1 to 7 and 9 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 (No. 14 of 2021) be extended for a period of 6 months, beginning on the 1st day of December, 2021 and ending on the 31st day of May, 2022.&quot; <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#Q00200","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I am introducing a resolution to extend the sunset clause in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021.  Members will be aware that section (9)(4) of that Act provides that the Act, other than section 8, shall continue in operation until 30 November 2021 unless a resolution approving its continuation has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before that date.  That section outlines that the period of operation may be extended for such further period or periods, each not extending six months, as is specified in a resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>In light of the ongoing risk from the disease and uncertain future trajectory of Covid-19, I am bringing forward a proposal that the Act shall continue in operation until 31 May 2022.  We are all too aware that these are extraordinary times.  I acknowledge that the public health restrictions that have been in place since the outset of the pandemic have not been easy.  Unfortunately, the recent trend meant the Government last week asked businesses in the night-time economy to close earlier.  This motion underlines the importance of the continuation of this Act to provide clarity for those pubs, bars and clubs who are in a position to provide an outdoor seating area to their customers and members.  The Covid pandemic has seen businesses adapt to public health guidance in this unprecedented time.  The introduction of this Act brought clarity and addressed an uncertainty in the law for those licensed premises offering an outdoor seating area to their customers.  The use of these spaces gave people the opportunity to socialise safely while adhering to public health guidance.  Weather conditions are no longer as they were in the summer when this legislation was introduced, but we want to preserve the use of outdoor spaces for the period ahead.<\/p> <p>The need for the Act became apparent during the summer months, in conjunction with the health measures in place at that time.  However, we still find ourselves in a place where health measures are being applied and are of the utmost importance in light of ongoing public health considerations and the uncertainty of the trajectory of Covid-19.  I am conscious that this is a necessary, temporary solution.  As Senators will be aware, the programme for Government is committed to modernising alcohol licensing.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is committed to delivering this piece of work.  <\/p> <p>While it may be difficult to see past these extraordinary times in which we find ourselves, we will come through this pandemic.  I want to ensure we are making plans for the future and providing a framework for the dynamic and diverse society and economy that we have become.  The Government gave its approval in September for the drafting of the general scheme of the sale of alcohol Bill.  The complexity of the law and the challenges of this matter demonstrate the real impetus for this reform.  The matters being addressed in this Act will be addressed in the legislative reform as part of a permanent solution in a more coherent licensing system.  The Minister will announce a public consultation on the alcohol licensing laws later.  We actively encourage engagement with this consultation.<\/p> <p>The matter before the House is relatively straightforward.  I am simply proposing the continued, but time-limited application of the legislation that was scrutinised and passed by this House before the summer recess.<\/p> <p>I commend the resolution to the House and I thank Senators for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#Q00300","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>None of us wishes to be where we are.  I appreciate what the Minister of State said about the renewal of this legislation.  Necessarily, when we passed this Act into law earlier this year we included a sunset clause because we all hoped that there would be an end to this and it was recognised that there was a certain draconian element to the regulations that needed to be revised.  We now recognise that the numbers are not where we would like them to be.  I understand that the expert advice to Government is that this should be extended.<\/p> <p>Without wishing to be overly melodramatic about it, it is with a heavy heart that we endorse the motion.  We acknowledge that it is necessary, but I want to acknowledge the Minister of State had to say generally about licensing law.  This is a matter I have discussed with the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  I welcome the idea that we would examine reform of our licensing laws because the reality is that they are quite outdated in many respects.  For a long time, I have felt that the more we treat people like children in respect of their use and access and alcohol, the more they are likely to behave like children.  It is important that we revise the systems that are in place.  We should say to people that they are adults and citizens and they have the right to do as they please, but they must also take into account the effects of certain behaviour and, for example, the abuse or overuse of alcohol. <\/p> <p>When it comes to pubs all emptying out onto the streets at the same time, restricted access to the purchase of off-licence alcohol after 10 p.m. and minimum unit alcohol pricing, I recognise the policy basis for these decisions and the reason these rules are in place.  I recognise that there is an academic basis that supports and underpins them, but I do not agree with them.  We need to approach this from a different angle.  We need to say to people that they are adults and citizens and they must take responsibility for their behaviour in the same way as anyone else and that extends to alcohol.  We should start with an education programme from the point at which children are at school before they are legally entitled to drink.  We should teach them the dangers associated with alcohol, the effects of alcohol and the pitfalls that come with its use and consumption.  <\/p> <p>That equally applies to this motion because there is also an element of personal responsibility in people's behaviour in the pandemic regarding the restrictions that none of us want to see in place but that we also recognise are necessary to protect everyone.  It is tremendously important to acknowledge that we have made great progress in vaccination and that we stand very high in the tables of the vaccination programmes across Europe and the world. That can be seen that result in the figures even though they are elevated and, in many respect, inexplicably high.  Those who are in ICU and in our hospitals and those who are, regrettably, unfortunately and tragically dying from Covid, are much more disproportionately in groups that are not or cannot be vaccinated than they are in those who have been vaccinated.  <\/p> <p>The element of personal responsibility must ultimately prevail, but I also recognise the need for Government to renew these regulations.  For that reason, the Fine Gael group will support the motion.  I would like to make one other comment in respect of vaccination because there has been talk in this Chamber and other political chambers about the approach of the Government to vaccination, particularly the use of vaccine certificates.  As elected representatives and people who must have at the heart of their concerns the public good and the safety of the population as a whole, we should send out the message, first and foremost, that the vaccines work.  People do not have to take our word for that because the figures and research show it clearly in terms of the numbers of people who are ill or in hospital.  There is a good policy reason, however difficult or unpalatable it might, why the vaccination certificates are being used.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These regulations need to be renewed.  It is not to penalise any group.  God knows all of us have received emails in a certain tone suggesting there has been segregation.  I have seen words such as \"apartheid\" used.  Such words are totally misplaced and inappropriate.  There is no desire to segregate society but those who choose not to be vaccinated and those who choose not to follow regulations must also accept that consequences flow from that for them personally.<\/p><p>The most difficult category, however, is those who cannot be vaccinated for a medical or other reason.  They are in a very difficult position.  There are others who choose not to be vaccinated and who contact my office and say they cannot eat indoors with their friends because they have decided not to be vaccinated.  I do not recognise the primacy of that choice.  I do not recognise the parity of that choice with those who cannot be vaccinated.  It is important to make that distinction.  It is not an attempt to separate or segregate people; it is an attempt to safeguard everyone.

It was introduced in July 2021 to facilitate the outdoor-only dining and drinking recommendation from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  The legislation is set to lapse at the end of this month and the Government is seeking its extension.  This legislation was instrumental in allowing vintners and publicans, as well as restaurant owners, the ability to make a living when indoor dining was put on hold.  While outdoor dining may not be the most attractive prospect at this time of year, spring will roll around soon enough and there will be a gradual return to it as we enter the summer.<\/p> <p>I wonder if people can remember the circumstances of this law.  The messaging in the lead-up to the reopening at the time was that a full return to hospitality was going to occur.  This was thrown into doubt about a week before the due date and, after a period of uncertainty when no one knew what was going on, NPHET ruled that outdoor-only was the way to go and this legislation was typed overnight to try to facilitate that.  It seems like a long time ago but, in reality, it was all quite recent.  Many issues with the Government's communication around that area were raised in the Lower House at the time.  There needs to be clarity in order that people understand why decisions are made and what is happening.  Last-minute changes of heart do not inspire confidence.  Unfortunately, we are still in a situation where the advice is pertinent.  I feel the ghost of a meaningful Christmas past may spook policymakers in the opposite direction to last year, lest consecutive January spikes are one too many.<\/p> <p>This legislation is perhaps the least offensive of that brought in on the back of Covid-19.  Whereas many laws brought through this House over the past two years have been restrictive in nature, confining people in a location or constraining them in their activity, this sticks out as legislation which actually provided certainty as to the legality of operating an outdoor premises.  We might remember the Government proposed that the thing to do was to allow for drinking outdoors for months without checking to make sure it had the legislation in place.  Here we are now and to enable pub and restaurant owners who wish to operate an outdoor premises to do so, I am happy to support the legislation.<\/p> <p>I would like to see the statistics on the law so far.  Do we have figures from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with regard to the policing of this legislation, including prosecutions under section 3 or closure orders under section 4?  We cannot fall into the habit of passing laws and forgetting about them.  Constant assessment to inform revision must be present.<\/p> <p>To be quite honest, I would support a much longer extension of this legislation.  I think having an outdoor space available for publicans and restaurateurs is something we should look at installing for the long term.  We should not take that space away from them once the pandemic is over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#R00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it ar ais go dt&iacute; an Teach.  The Minister of State is welcome back to the House.  I remember when the difficulty arose with this legislation six months ago when premises were extended to facilitate outdoor dining.  It created a difficulty for the Garda and the business owners because there was a bit of a grey area as to whether the piece they added onto their premises, grounds or whatever was licensed.  That caused some difficulty.  I raised the matter in the Seanad at the time and I was delighted the Government moved swiftly to address that particular anomaly.<\/p> <p>Here we are now.  It is hard to believe it is six months later and we are, unfortunately, extending the legislation again, due to Covid.  It is commonsensical legislation.  None of the legislation taken in by the Government is taken in lightly but we are in the middle of a pandemic.  We are in a war against Covid-19 and that war, unfortunately, continues.  Like many other governments around the world, this Government is forced to react to an ever-changing situation.  It must be on its toes in that regard.  This is commonsensical legislation and I am delighted to support it for another six-month period.  I hope there will be no need to extend it any further when we consider it again in six months.<\/p> <p>This is perhaps an opportune time to review licensing laws and see what comes in.  I look forward to everyone taking part in that review.<\/p> <p>This is a difficult time for businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector.  Even though their doors may be open today, it is unfortunate that the flow of customers coming through that they would normally expect is not there.  With that in mind, I am delighted the Taoiseach and, indeed, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have agreed to meet representatives of the hospitality industry because they are going through a very difficult time.  It has been a difficult time for all businesses but those in the hospitality sector have been hit the hardest.  People who would normally go out for a bite to eat or a pint of beer are not doing so out of fear in this climate.  The hospitality sector will miss out on the revenue it would normally hope to get in at this time of year.  This is a busy time of year and people would normally be organising Christmas parties and what have you.  It is a normally a good time of year for the hospitality sector but, unfortunately, we do not live in normal times.  I hope the Government will listen to the hospitality sector.  Businesses in that sector are constrained in the revenue they can take in.  I hope the Government listens to them and puts measures in place to compensate them at this difficult time so that, when things improve, everyone will be in a position to move on and get back to business as usual, if I can use that term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#R00300","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.

The Minister of State is very welcome to the Seanad.  I apologise for missing his opening remarks.  I was at a meeting of the Seanad Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight.  Because I have come straight from that meeting to the Chamber, I am going to read my notes from my phone.  I do not like doing that.  Excuse me, but I did not have the opportunity to print them off.<\/p> <p>Like other colleagues, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion.  Put simply, it is about trying to live as normal a life as possible in the middle of a pandemic.  It is about trying to ensure businesses that rely on customers survive in the middle of the pandemic.  It is also about achieving both of those objectives sensibly and in a legal context.<\/p> <p>The motion has a particular poignancy, given we are in the middle of another surge of the virus, the implications of which are not yet clear for us all.  In this context, it is a worrying time for the business community, given the expectation that a positive corner was being turned, however slowly, in the plan to return to a normal, or at least more manageable, life.  On my behalf and that of Sinn F&eacute;in, I thank all those who provide a business service and who take personal and financial risks to keep their doors open in the best and most difficult of times.  I commend the workers in the private sector.  Both business owners and staff have been through a lot of difficulty over the past two years and continue to face uncertainty at this time.<\/p> <p>The motion extends for a six-month period the special circumstances arising from the pandemic which legally permit the lawful sale and consumption of alcohol in outdoor seating areas.  It correctly identifies the outdoor seating areas which have been permitted by local authorities on public land or outdoor areas on private land next to licensed premises and why these regulations need to be renewed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Accompanying these designations is the important clause obliging the owners of licensed premises to maintain good order in the areas identified.  Understandably, the special circumstances arising from the pandemic required careful consideration and legal clarity for businesses, local authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This motion provides all three parties with the knowledge and authority to act for the common good and, in doing so, assist the ongoing opening of a vital sector in the economy and the enjoyment and opportunity to relax for those availing of outside socialising.  <\/p><p>The motion also has to have a weather eye on the level of threat from the virus for the general population and I believe it is in keeping with the public health advice on Covid-19.  We are all on a learning curve when it comes to understanding the behaviour of the virus and its ability to adapt and change tack.<\/p><p>I will speak to the population the law serves in its contribution to normalise society while the medical experts advise and protect us.  Flexibility and diligence are required to keep ahead of the virus and the extension for six months of the provisions in the motion we are speaking about will further the objective we all share, namely, the eradication of the virus and the restoration of unrestricted life we had a few short years ago, which I am confident we are steadily making progress towards.<\/p><p>The flexibility in the motion and in the virus must also be seen in the Government's approach to the latest surge.  It is important the various support measures, such as the CRSS and the EWSS are implemented again in full for workers and businesses across the live entertainment, late night sector who are seriously impacted by these  latest restrictions.  Workers in the live entertainment hospitality, nightlife and tourism industry have been left high and dry.  The PUP should be reinstated for those workers who need it.  Restrictions on restaurants, bars and night clubs came as a bitter disappointment for many across the sector.  The Government must continue to resource and support businesses.  Much progress has been made curtailing the pandemic and protecting people's lives but, as we see from the latest surge, it is far from over.  Until it is, those most in need have to be helped out by the Government. <\/p><p>I support the motion to extend and, like other colleagues, I acknowledge, in the midst of all this, the key priority to keep people safe and well, as well as to provide them with the opportunity to avail of the social outlets we all need at times, in the most appropriate, safe and legally compliant way possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#R00400","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their time and contributions.

Under current legislation, these premises have no remedy to amend their licence to include such an area.  In addition, to ensure maximum equity with businesses, it was considered prudent to provide clarity and assurance for licensees who were relying on private property immediately adjacent to their licensed premises to provide outdoors seating areas.  With the extension of this Act, continued certainty is provided to licensees.  This will ensure we do not end up in a position where further emergency measures are required in the coming months to address the gap in licensing legislation in respect of outdoor seating areas. <\/p> <p>Providing clarity to licensed premises, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our local authorities and communities was, and is, of the utmost importance.

What they do is not just attempt to protect tenancies, which I know is the general goal of the legislation, but also to try to ensure the protection of tenancies is not placed at odds with other stated Government priorities, for example, in terms of retrofitting and, of course, in regard to the area which is not touched on as much, that of adaptation under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  These are issues we were discussing just this morning with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  We are at a point where we need a seismic period of new build but we also have a seismic project of retrofitting across the country.  Alongside the urgency we have in regard to climate action and the role retrofitting plays in that, we also have related issues regarding situations where people may need to adapt living spaces because of a disability.<\/p> <p>The fact is many people with a disability are renters, including many of those living in houses and apartments that are currently below the energy ratings and standards that we would wish.  In many cases, there will be a fear that if, for example, a major retrofitting project is to happen in a house, flat or home, a person's security of tenure could be jeopardised.  That is because retrofitting was explicitly excluded.  It is important to mention that it was not part of the principal Act.  Retrofitting was included in a list of renovations which qualify as sufficient major renovations to remove people's Part 4 protection and allow for them to be evicted.  It was included in that list at subsection (5A), which was inserted as an element added to the Bill, although it is not a core element of the Bill.<\/p> <p>Of course, its inclusion at that time was probably trying to cover what are \"substantial renovations\", but we have effectively created a perverse incentive against tenants seeking retrofitting by pressing their landlords to do it.  There is also a jeopardy in regard to the social good of the retrofitting of houses.  We must bear in mind it is important for warmth and in terms of energy poverty, the price of fuel and all of those issues, but it is also ultimately important in terms of reducing the emissions that we produce collectively as a nation towards our target of 1.5&deg;C.  Retrofitting is a great social good yet we are attaching an inequitable or negative outcome to it, which is a jeopardising of tenancies.<\/p> <p>In amendment No. 1, I do it very neatly and specifically by seeking to delete subparagraph (ii).  Again, I am not sure if that will cover adaptation for disability as that may be a separate issue.  However, I should flag to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, that when I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, this morning, I signalled to her that one of the retrofitting options we should have on the table is retrofitting plus adaptation, that is, a retrofitting option which included that, as a home was being retrofitted for energy, it would also be adapted in terms of universal design and disability access.  That is particularly important because we know that persons with a disability, in many cases, are more likely to spend more time in their homes and more likely to suffer from high fuel prices and energy poverty.  There could be a win-win.  I am highlighting this because I think it is a constructive amendment to highlight what could be a very positive measure, which is supporting retrofitting combinations between disability access and energy retrofitting, and also sending a very positive message on just transition and climate justice in terms of ensuring we have equity in how we approach our climate measures.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 1 simply removes retrofitting from the list that was added.  Amendment No. 2 is a little more explicit in that it spells out specifically the measures in regard to improving the building energy rating, BER, or where the dwelling is being adapted to provide for access and use by a person with a disability within the meaning of the Disability Act.  Amendment No. 1 is simply removing the disincentive or the negative element that is there at the moment, whereas amendment No. 2 is a little more proactive.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am seeking to explicitly spell out areas that should not be considered as a renovation creating grounds for the ending of a part 4 tenancy.

I am aware that there are similar motivations behind both.<\/p><p>Having listened to Senator Warfield yesterday and Senator Higgins today, there is probably a little confusion on the subject, so I will try to clarify matters.  Section 19 of the Residential Tenancies Act provides for rent settings at the commencement and during a tenancy.  The amendments proposed by Senators are to provisions dealing with exemptions from the rent pressure zone, RPZ, restrictions and do not relate to grounds for tenancy termination.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 2, as I understand it, proposes that where a landlord provides building energy rating, BER, improvements or disability access works, such provision cannot be used as a ground for terminating a tenancy under paragraph 5 of the table to section 34.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1 provides, on the face of it, for the deletion of one of the criteria for the RPZ rent increase rent exemption to apply on foot of a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation provided under the tenancy, namely, where an improvement of seven BERs is achieved by the works carried out on the rental property.  I think the intention of the amendment is different though, and its purpose relates to the carrying out of such work to not count as a ground for tenancy termination.  It should be noted in the context of an RPZ rent increase restriction exemption that such works would only qualify on a once-off basis in the context of the first rent setting after such works.  Thereafter, the RPZ rent restriction will apply.  On the face of it, the amendment also proposes that to qualify for a RPZ rent increase exemption the following works will not suffice, namely, works that result in BER improvements, adaptations to provide for access and by use of a person with a disability within the meaning of the Disability Act 2005, or both.<\/p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 significantly strengthened the protections relating to the grounds for termination of a tenancy, especially in relation to paragraph 5 where the landlord intends to substantially refurbish or renovate a rental dwelling in a way that requires the dwelling to be vacated for the purpose.  The notice of termination must contain, or be accompanied in writing by, a statement: specifying the nature of the intended works; that in the case where the planning permission has been obtained a copy of the planning permission is attached to the notice of statement; that planning permission is not required and specifying the name of the contractor, if any, employed to carry out intended works and the dates on which the intended works are to be carried out and the proposed duration of the period in which those works are to be carried out; and that the landlord is required to offer to the tenant a tenancy of the dwelling if the contact details requirement is complied with and the dwelling becomes available for reletting by reason of completion of the works or refurbishment or renovation.<\/p><p>The notice must contain or be accompanied by a certificate in writing of a registered professional within the meaning of the Building Control Act 2007 stating:<\/p> <blockquote> \t(I) the proposed refurbishment or renovation works would pose a risk to the health or safety of the occupants of the dwelling concerned and should not proceed whilethe dwelling is occupied, and<br \/><br \/>(II) such a risk is likely to exist for such period as is specified in the certificate which shall not be less than 3 weeks,&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>The substantial changes made in 2019 strengthened enforcement of tenancy termination protections, while respecting landlords&rsquo; constitutional rights regarding their property.  A failure to make an offer of a relet to a former tenant who has provided contact details after the completion of refurbishment or renovation works is improper conduct by a landlord and can be subject to the imposition of a sanction of up to &euro;30,000 by the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.<\/p><p>Accordingly, I think there are significant protections already in place to address the Senators' concerns in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#AA00300","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I welcome the clarity concerning the Disability Act.  The proposals I have been discussing with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for a combination retrofitting and adaptation grant is something I think would be very useful.  We may still need more clarity on that but perhaps it would be covered by this.  However, while I appreciate the placing may not work in that this applies to RPZs, the fundamental point I was talking about is not the matter of a tenant needing to leave for a period.  It has always been the case with Part 4 that a tenant may need to leave but has the right to be offered a relet.  The problem is that the price will change.  As a result, this is about the rental pressures and the price change, and it is still a disincentive because a tenant may be offered a relet but not at the same rate, as I understand it.  If there is an exemption to the limitations on the increase in rent under the rental pressure zone rules that is the problem.  The Minister of State has described the planning permission and the fact it needs to be done by accredited persons.  All of that is fine but it is still an issue if retrofitting or if a major energy rating overhaul of an apartment or house ends up effectively removing the rental protection and the rental rate protections a Part 4 tenant may have acquired or the protections they may have under the RPZ rules with respect to a limitation of potential increases in their rent.  The key concern there is retrofitting as a social good.  There is the named contractor and all of those elements, but it is still an issue if retrofitting creates a situation whereby the sustainability of somebody's tenancy and the price he or she is paying are placed in tension  I urge the Minister of State to consider this, whether or not this placing is correct.<\/p> <p>The RPZ section might be a good section to address this in.  I framed it in terms of eviction where in fact it is not perhaps about eviction but a potential rise in rent to the point of a tenancy becoming unsustainable or unrenewable.  This is an issue to be addressed because we need to have every positive measure towards retrofitting we possibly can.<\/p> <p>With respect to the balancing of issues for landlords, the balance was different when this was inserted because now we are not just balancing the rights of a tenant and the rights of a landlord, we are balancing a social good and, indeed, a social cost if we do not retrofit as well as the rights of the tenant to energy security and home heating against the potential property rights or increased property prices of a landlord.

On amendment No. 3, again, with respect, while the protections are there, they are not working.  I will not go back into the previous area but I really urge that it be examined.  While a tenant may make long-term energy savings, most tenants do not have the upfront money to risk a rent increase.  They may have the future energy savings over a ten-year period but if it means they might end up with a rent increase it is something they are going to be concerned about.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While the landlord has the benefit of an asset that is enhanced, they need to be clear on that.  Sometimes there is a lack of acknowledgement of the benefits for the landlord of having enhanced their own asset.<\/p><p>This piece is an example of protections being in place but not working.  The data of the Residential Tenancies Board show that there has been a 7% annual increase in the rent levels, which was indicated in the rent index for quarter 2 of 2021.  We have rental pressure zones and a theoretical level of the kinds of increases that we expect to see in those zones but evidence shows that there has been a 7% annual increase.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 deal with two halves of that.  I mean two suggestions have been put forward.  I will cite the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV, again.  The IPAV has indicated in newspaper reports that it suspects that landlords of new tenancies in rent pressure zones play a key role in driving up rents.  For example, a landlord, a real estate investment trust, REIT, or a fund that buys a new unit tends to set the starting rent at a very high level.  We have also seen reports of the following in the newspapers whereby they may set the rent very high then they may engage in informal rent reductions for certain clients while keeping the on-the-books rent extremely high.  One of my concerns with this, which flows from a general flaw throughout our housing and property policies, is that we allow property to be treated as a commodity.  For example, for anyone who has a large portfolio and wants his or her properties to change hands or to exchange them, then he or she wants the portfolio to have a high theoretical yield from the portfolio properties that they own even if the properties are vacant.  As I live in the centre of Dublin city, I see the evidence of many apartments with extremely high ticket rent prices that are empty and have been empty throughout the pandemic.  Let me explain the benefit.  A person may have a whole suite of portfolio properties and he or she can say he or she has X number of properties where the rent is &euro;3,000 a month.  That is the product and it is not about the monthly rent.<\/p><p>I recognise that this is a tricky Bill to amend.  I tabled an amendment on Report Stage in an attempt to discover how we can ensure, if we have designated an area a rental pressure zone for a reason, that we do not have such artificial inflation taking place, which also then creates a lot of pressure and incentive on landlords to seek to evict tenants who have rental protection and who may have long-standing tenancies.  I propose that we set a cap on rental increases and a cap on the starting rent for new apartments of equivalent value.  Again, the same formulas that were used for rent pressure zones and to cap increases can be used.  These formulas may need to be reflected in new tenancies.  I have proposed that rent would not be set 2% higher than the median rent.  I do not mean the median rent in the area but the median rent for that type and category of property in the area.  The restriction is reasonable.  I cannot imagine that the Minister of State will be in a position to accept financial measures, and generally he might not be able to, but I hope that he might be able to respond in terms of how the issue will be addressed.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#AA01700","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":153,"content":"<p>While acknowledging the intent of this amendment, I am not in a position to accept it.<\/p><p>The established practice in the residential rental market, in accordance with section 19(1) of the principal Act, is for a landlord to set a rent that is no greater than the prevailing market rent for a particular tenancy.  Section 24 of the principal Act defines market rent in terms of a tenancy of a dwelling to mean:<\/p> <blockquote> \tthe rent which a willing tenant not already in occupation would give and a willing landlord would take for the dwelling, in each case on the basis of vacant possession being given, and having regard to&mdash;  \t(<i>a<\/i>) the other terms of the tenancy, and<br \/><br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) the letting values of dwellings of a similar size, type and character to the dwelling and situated in a comparable area to that in which it is situated.  <\/blockquote> <p>It is a matter for the landlord to ensure that he or she does not exceed market rent.  A tenant can refer a dispute on the amount of the rent set to the Residential Tenancies Board.  In addition, a determination order can be made for the rent to be reduced and damages, to a maximum of &euro;20,000, paid to the tenant.<\/p><p>Section 19(5) of the Residential Tenancies Act provides for an exemption from the RPZ controls only in relation to the first rent setting of a new tenancy where the dwelling is, or is in a protected structure or proposed protected structure within the meaning of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and has not been let in the previous 12 months, or no tenancy in respect of that dwelling subsisted during the period of two years immediately preceding the date on which the tenancy concerned commenced.  These exemptions only apply to the first rent setting under the tenancy in a RPZ.  Thereafter, rent increases are prohibited from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the harmonised index of consumer prices or the proposed 2% cap per annum <i>pro rata<\/i>, whichever is lower.  If accepted, this amendment would negatively impact on the investment in and supply of rental accommodation in the medium to longer term.  I am sure that Senators will agree that this would be a very unwelcome and unintended consequence of the measure.<\/p><p>While affordability remains an issue, the introduction of RPZs in 2016, and their subsequent enhancement in 2019, in July of this year and proposed here in this Bill, have played and will play a key part in moderating rent increases.  RPZs were a considered measure that balanced the needs of tenants with the legal rights of landlords and the imperative to ensure that rental housing supply was not adversely affected.  We need to encourage landlords to provide much needed accommodation in the private rented sector.  This measure would drive away investment from the sector.  A landlord will need to be able to set a rent that he or she considers does not exceed the market rent.<\/p><p>The RTB's quarterly rent index report, that is produced in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, captures the number of bedrooms in an individual rental property.  However, due to the number of tenancies registered each quarter, this information is only reported at regional level.  The RTB has considered providing this information at a county level but there were not a sufficient number of new registrations in each quarter to support this granular analysis.  This matter will be reviewed after annual registration is introduced in quarter 1 of 2022, when the RTB expects to have between 60,000 and 70,000 renewals each quarter that may enable more granular reporting.<\/p><p>On the median rent amount, the quarterly rent index report does not currently include the median rent in an area.  Again, this matter can be reviewed following the roll-out of the requirement for the annual registration of tenancies within the RTB.<\/p><p>The RTB's quarterly rent index report provides the standardised average rent both nationally and at regional levels, including local authority levels.  The standardised average rent refers to the development of an average that is consistent over time to changes in different property types or characteristics of a tenancy that may evolve within the market.  The standardised average rent can, therefore, be compared over time without concern for underlying changes in the data or sample.<\/p><p>I confirm that I cannot accept the amendment.  I encourage any tenant who faces what appears to be an unlawful rent level to refer the dispute to the RTB for determination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#BB00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>There are two fundamental issues there.  First, with absolute respect and this is one of the flaws in much of the enforcement issues, the onus has been put on the tenant.  Either somebody seeks to rent, because the nature of this is that these are new potential properties and new properties that are coming on stream, so one does not have a tenant who complains that the rent is too high because he or she is not in a position to be the tenant.  Moreover, as I have just outlined, these properties remain empty in many cases.<\/p> <p>Second, even if there is a tenant the power imbalance is quite substantial at the moment.  The power imbalance between tenants and landlords is extremely skewed at the moment.  By contrast, the power balance between the Government and landlords could be very different.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It worries me that the Government does not seem to think it has sufficient powers or a willingness to engage or press harder with landlords but it could.  This is a choice made by the Government.<\/p><p>A pattern has emerged, and it is not an individual case or a bad story.  There are cases.  The Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, data shows that there are 7% annual increases in rents.  The Institute for Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV, which actually sells houses, acknowledges this is anomalous and wrong.  It states that the figures are inconsistent with what could be expected in those areas.<\/p><p>The onus should not be on tenants to report this.  The onus is on the State to check that the measures are working properly.  With great respect to the inadvertent consequences, the Government needs to look at the inadvertent consequences of some of its measures.  For example, where a property has not been let in the last 12 months, is that an incentive for a 12-month vacancy period?  Funds can afford that.  If one looks at the difference between a 2% annual increase and a 7% annual increase, it is worth waiting 12 months and leaving the property vacant.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that there will be more information in the next quarter.  We need more information.  I regret that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, did not take more of an opportunity to get more information when the property tax was being rolled out.  There was a clause in that which stated that information on vacancy would only be used statistically.  However, that was an opportunity to have the information on vacancy.  To be honest, the issue that I am trying to tackle here is a vacant property tax.  A vacant property tax that looked into that 12-month period would address this even more effectively.<\/p><p>In the interim, however, we need to address the fact that there are products in the financial markets that are offering portfolios of empty buildings with theoretical rental prices.  I do not mean to put this on the Minister of State but there seems to be a fundamental logic that what investment funds want and the needs of housing are the same thing and that the interests are aligned.  They are not the same interests.  In terms of giving investment funds every single thing they want, they are not running scared; they are very confident.  We have all heard the interviews about how happy they are.  They are not going to run out of the market if we show proper care in the way they deliver on housing.  We cannot continue to treat portfolios of investments the same as housing provision and assume they are going to align.  They have different goals based on market logic.  They have shareholders and boards.  The goal of those boards is to maximise profits.  They will use every single element of our laws to do that.  In fact, if there were good boards of governance, as there often are, we strengthen the hands of those who wish to deliver better practice because they would have that fiduciary duty to maximise their profit while also working within the laws and constraints.  They would want better constraints and better laws, if they were genuine in their commitment to being part of the long-term housing solution in Ireland.  <\/p><p>I know that the Minister of State cannot accept this amendment; I knew he would not be able to do so.  However, I am signalling that the answers he has been given to give me about the tenants and the needs of investors are not adequate in dealing with this problem.  We have flagged this.  There was a 7% increase in the space of a year in areas where there is a desperate need for rental accommodation.  This is not just a flag for tenants, but it is a flag for the State.  I hope that if the Minister of State cannot do it in this Bill, he will take other measures to address it, possibly through a vacant property tax.  That might be one of the most effective measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#BB00300","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Would the Minister of State like to say a final word?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#CC00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I recognise the points, which were well made by the Senator.

I am hopeful that the Minister of State might be able to accept this amendment.  I hope it is possible.  The amendment goes to the fact that while the Residential Tenancies Board has different powers, the investigation and sanctions unit of the Residential Tenancies Board only sanctioned 29 landlords in the last 12 months for breaching the residential pressure zone limits.  We would all have to be extraordinarily naive to believe that only 29 landlords were in breach of the rules in the last 12 months.  If there is a new cap of 2%, which is being brought in, it will need to be enforced.  It will become meaningless if it is not enforced.  Again, part of the problem is the onus placed on the tenant in regard to that process.  That needs to be strengthened.  We need to address patterns that emerge in a much stronger way.  For example, if two, three or four concerns are brought through and a pattern emerges, then a number of landlords should be investigated in that regard.  The other properties that landlord may have should also be investigated.  There needs to be other things that trigger it, rather than placing all of the onus for the imperative of action, or so much of it, on the vulnerable person.  I know that there are other ways that the RTB can act.  Currently, however, the enforcement of protections is very much weighted towards an initiative taken by tenants.  We are looking at 29 landlords who were sanctioned in the last 12 months.  The introduction of the 2% cap is welcome, but the concern is that the previous cap has not been properly enforced.  There are those loopholes.  I mentioned the 12-month vacancy, which is a really concerning loophole.  Is the 12-month vacancy being properly investigated?  Are the situations that I described, for example, where there is an on-the-ticket-book price, but the actual price is different, being investigated?  All of those kinds of patterns of loopholes and anomalies need to be investigated.<\/p> <p>Padraig McGoldrick, who is the current director of the Residential Tenancies Board, has said that the board is aware of a level of non-compliance by landlords with the rent-setting regulations on restricting rent increases.  Pat Davitt of the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers said the inference taken from the headline figure of 7% growth in rents is that large numbers of landlords are defying the RPZ rules.  Both the Residential Tenancies Board and the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers are telling us that there is a failure in compliance.<\/p> <p>This amendment seeks not just to ensure that the powers are there, but that they are enforced.  At the moment, the only obligation in this Bill, with the 2% cap, would be that the Minister would do a once-off review between 12 and 15 months following commencement.  However, what would give meaning and a sense of seriousness and weight to the proposals in the Bill would be if there was reporting on an annual basis on how the protections were being enforced.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That regular reporting would show us if it is being enforced, the pattern and type of enforcement, how many rent increases were deemed to be an offence, how many fines were issued to landlords for rent increases that were deemed to be an offence and what other measures might have been taken in terms of pursuing landlords guilty of rent increases that were an offence under section 19(4) of the Act.  This would track the enforcement.  It would also send a signal of intent in terms of enforcement to landlords.  As a second part, we would have to ensure that the RTB has the appropriate resources to deliver that enforcement.  Crucially, people should not have to issue a freedom of information request in respect of the RTB to get information about what is happening with regard to enforcement; it should be publicly available.  There should be an annual check-in.  It should be a matter of public concern if we are not having enforcement.  <\/p><p>There are really good measures in this Bill, but we need to be sure that they are enforced.

Significantly, the investigation can now be triggered by the RTB in its own right rather than depending on a complaint or a referral for dispute resolution from the tenant.  That is a good measure.  Since then, the RTB has prioritised the investigation of breaches of RPZ rent setting rules under Part 7A on an administrative sanctioning basis rather than pursuing the criminal route.  To date, no offences have been prosecuted by the RTB for a breach of section 19(4) of the Act.  The focus is currently on using the RTB&rsquo;s administrative sanctioning powers to their full extent rather than prosecuting landlords.

The monetary amounts may be large, but that only raises the alarm in terms of the money that has been potentially wrongfully taken from tenants.  If that monetary amount is attached to only 29 cases, there is a really serious concern.  It is good to hear that there are 250 cases in the pipeline.  That is a positive story.  Why not have those figures publicly available?  With respect, as an Oireachtas Member I may have access to the aforementioned channel, but this is about the public.  The public should not have to go through Oireachtas Members to find out this information.  It is public information and it should be publicly available.  It should be publicly published and in that way it can be used.  We all seek to help people, but we do not want a type of clientelist relationship around how you access this or that information.<\/p> <p>If there is an increase in administrative sanction that is a positive story, in particular if there is potential for a tenfold increase next year.  Why not publish this information?  Why not provide it by way of an annual report?  Is it not a good story to tell?  It has the added benefit of sending that signal that the State is taking these issues seriously.  I know the Minister of State cannot accept the amendment, but I would encourage him to consider an annual report in regard to enforcement and its publication.  That could be positive.  It could have a number of positive consequences and help restore confidence in those who may well not wish to challenge a landlord unless they see what is happening, and they may well not reach out to any Member of the Oireachtas.  I propose to press this amendment as I believe it is useful, constructive amendment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#DD00300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637836200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637836200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 5:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 5 is a consequential technical amendment to section 3(3) of the principal Act to ensure that tenancies of unlimited duration fall within the scope of the Act.

Some people rent for their whole life.  For persons who may have been renting for 15 or 20 years and older people there is a particular vulnerability for older people who may be trying to seek housing in a new market and may either have a very limited fixed income in terms of pension or, sometimes, a very insecure employment or partial employment, which can cause real difficulties.  I refer to the classic phrase \"young professionals\" which is often used by landlords.  The amendments seek an increase in the notice periods to increase the protection for persons.  Currently, our schedule taps out at eight years.  I want it to address those who have been renting for ten, 15 or 20 years and to further increase their protections.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, I believe there is an anomaly in my amendment.  Four to seven years is a single category on the current schedule, and in my system of calculations of two-year periods, those with a six-year tenancy might randomly slightly decrease their period of notice, even though everybody in pretty much every other year would benefit.  In that regard, I am minded to withdraw the amendment.  I urge the Minister of State to address the issue of longer tenancies, not just by looking at the eight-year period but by having a longer period of notice for those who have been in very long tenancies and who could, in many cases, be especially vulnerable in re-entering the rental market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#DD01000","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I meant to respond to the Senator's last point regarding the previous amendment.  She made a very good point about making information available, which I acknowledge.<\/p><p>In this case, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 6 or 7, which propose to introduce the concept of a long tenure notice period to provide for an additional 30 days notice for each additional year of duration of a tenancy beyond two years.  Chapter 2 of Part 5 of the Residential Tenancies Act, which deals with tenancy terminations and notice periods and other procedural requirements, sets out the procedures for serving a valid notice of termination.  Chapter 3 provides for the period of notice to be given when serving a notice of termination.  The periods of notice to be given by a landlord, in accordance with table 1 of section 66 of the Principal Act, when serving a notice of termination to a tenant were substantially increased as part of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 to up to 224 days where a tenant has been in occupation for eight years or more.  That was done in consultation with the NGOs from the homeless sector.<\/p><p>Section 16(3) of the 2019 Act provides that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Minister shall-  \t(a) not earlier than 2 years and not later than 3 years after the coming into operation of subsection (1), commence a review of the operation of the amendments of section 66 effected by that subsection, <br \/><br \/>(b) not later than 6 months after the commencement of the review, prepare a report in writing of the findings of the Minister resulting from the review and his or her conclusions drawn from the findings, and <br \/><br \/>(c) cause a copy of the report referred to in <i>paragraph (b)<\/i>to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  <\/blockquote> <p>Section 16 of the 2019 Act was commenced on 4 June 2019.  Accordingly, the Minister is obliged to conduct a review of the extended notice periods before 4 June 2022.  The Senator's proposed amendments will be taken into account in that context.  While I appreciate the intent of these amendments, as currently drafted, they may present difficulties and have unintended consequences.  These increased notice periods could equally apply to tenants as well as landlords.<\/p><p>The amendment does not state what the standard notice period is, but if we were to assume 120 days, as is currently the notice period where a tenant has been in occupation for a period of two years, this would not be fair to landlords.  The requirement for 28 days' notice to be served during the initial six months of a tenancy by both a landlord and a tenant under the Principal Act is in recognition of the fact that the landlord and tenant are generally strangers to each other at the early stage of a tenancy.  Both should be afforded the opportunity to exit a tenancy without undue delay, if that is their wish.  Unfortunately, scenarios can arise at very early stages that make it clear that a long-term tenancy is not in prospect.<\/p><p>Once the six-month period has elapsed and a Part 4 tenancy commences, the notice period applicable to the tenant was increased under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 from 28 days to 90 days.  After one year, 120 days' notice are to be given.  A landlord may have a tenant who pays one month's rent in advance and a deposit equal to one month's rent and thereafter the landlord may not receive any more rent.  We must safeguard against rent arrears.  A shorter termination notice period for tenancies of less than six months' duration is fair and it applies to both landlords and tenants.<\/p><p>We must also remember that some urgency might apply to a landlord's ground for termination.  For example, for financial or personal reasons, he or she might need to sell the property as soon as possible or might need to move into it.  We must recognise that 70% of landlords own just one rental property and 86% own either one or two rental properties.  Landlords' circumstances are likely to change over time and the Principal Act currently provides lengthy termination notice periods, as I have said, up to 224 days.  The 2019 Act substantially extended the notice periods required where a landlord intends to terminate a tenancy.  The aim is to provide greater time for tenants to source alternative accommodation in a market that has limited supply.  The extended notice periods take into account consultation with the six main housing and homelessness NGOs.  There is a commitment that the proposed amendments will be reviewed in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021112500002#EE00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1637836200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I might just flip that around and say that 18% of landlords own a vast amount of rental property.  The Minister of State referred to the majority of landlords only owning one or two properties, but a small number of landlords own huge amounts of property.  This proposal is appropriate.  Such landlords will not be stuck in these circumstances.  Sometimes the small landlord gets pushed out, yet at the same time we are talking about large-scale investment funds and what they want.  They have lobbyists.<\/p> <p>The argument can be a little bit disingenuous.  If separate measures need to be put in place for small landlords, then they should be included, but that scenario should not be used to create protections for very large investment funds that have vast portfolios of property and are also benefiting from interesting tax incentives and other measures from which the small landlord might not benefit.  They get both sets of benefits.  They get all the extra benefits and they also get protection by using smaller landlords as cover.  That is a general point.<\/p> <p>I am happy to withdraw the amendment, but I hope the Minister of State will engage with interested Members of the Oireachtas in respect of the review he mentioned that is coming up to June.  There are measures within it that must be examined for long-term tenants, especially older tenants.  In the city of Dublin, people in their 60s and 70s who are renting could be very insecure in that regard.  That is who I have in mind - those who would have been in bedsits in the past, some of whom are long-term tenants.  They are people who may find themselves far down a housing list if they lose their current tenure, so they need a period of time to give them a chance in that regard.<\/p> <p>I will withdraw the amendment and I will engage constructively with the Department in advance of the review.  Other Senators across this House, for example, Senators Fitzpatrick and Moynihan, have spoken about this matter.  There is a lot of expertise in this House.
