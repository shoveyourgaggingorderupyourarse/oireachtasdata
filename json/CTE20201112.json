I thank the staff of the Department of Social Protection for the comprehensive briefing material which they provided for members of the committee.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and frankly, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.

I circulated, in advance, a copy of my opening statement.  I do not intend to read through it all because it is quite lengthy and I am conscious of the time constraints.  While I put a lot of information in it, because this is a new committee and many members of the committee might not be as familiar with the Department as previous members, I also put some background contextual information in it, so apologies to Deputy MacSharry who has probably heard some of this before but I will try to skim through it.<\/p> <p>  The Department is responsible for the provision of policy advice and the delivery of services across a broad and expanding remit.  The traditional range of cradle to grave welfare services covers employment services, the operation of redundancy and insolvency payments, general registry services, citizens information and advice services, and pensions supervision.  The impact of the Department's work is felt by every person, family and business in the State.  If a single statistic can encapsulate its impact, it is that the schemes and services delivered by the Department reduce the risk of poverty by some 50% compared with what it otherwise would have been.<\/p> <p>  In delivering on this brief, the staff of the Department strive to always deliver an effective and efficient service.  In doing this, they are very mindful of the vulnerability of some of the people who rely on our services.  However, it is inevitable, given our breadth and scale, that failures will occur.  It is equally inevitable that when these failures occur that we hear about them much more quickly than we hear about the normal, routine, high level of service in, for example, processing over 2 million claims and making about 80 million payments across more than 80 different schemes and services every year.  This is not to diminish the cases where we have failed or could do better.  We also have to recognise and learn from these cases.  That is why the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General not only in reviewing our accounts but in examining, every year, specific aspects of our operations is welcome, as is the scrutiny by this committee.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the accounts of the Vote and the social insurance account, the 2019 accounts show that the total expenditure on Vote 37 amounted to &euro;10.65 billion.  This represented a reduction of &euro;79 million, or just under 1%, compared with 2018 and was within 0.5% of the Revised Estimate for the year, taking account of the supplementary provision for the Christmas bonus.  Expenditure on social insurance services amounted to &euro;10.73 billion, an increase of &euro;672 million, or just under 7%, compared with 2018.  Combined expenditure of &euro;21.4 billion represents approximately 10% of the modified gross national income.<\/p> <p>  Looking across both the Social Insurance Fund and Vote, the total increase in gross expenditure from 2018 to 2019 was &euro;592 million, or 2.8%.  There are a number of key drivers of this change.  For example, 2019 budget measures included increases in primary rates of payment across all schemes.  The key driver of note is the demographic effect on pensions.  Pension expenditure increased by &euro;457 million or 6%.  Similarly, illness-invalidity payments, which are also related to demographic changes, increased by &euro;230 million, or 5.4%.<\/p> <p>  These demographic trends are likely to continue with significant implications for expenditure and funding of the social welfare system.  The most recent actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, for example, indicates that social insurance contribution rates would need to double, from a current date, in order to maintain the fund in balance over the next 30 to 50 years.  Stated another way, at present pension payments are equivalent to about 27% of the total combined income tax and PRSI receipts.  The actuarial review projections would see this ratio increase to somewhere between 40% and 50% over the next 30 years or so.<\/p> <p>  One of the challenges faced by the Department is to strike a balance between, on the one hand, designing and managing large-scale service processes that are reliable, efficient and effective for the majority of customers and, on the other, implementing controls and checks to assure payment and service integrity.  However, we are mindful in doing this that our primary purpose is to support people who need support, and that we cannot pursue the elimination of fraud and error at the cost of unreasonably denying entitlement to service or frustrating access to that entitlement.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the report the key table of note is figure 4.3.  This summarises the level of excess payments due to error or fraud as measured across 16 of the Department's schemes representing about 80% of expenditure.  Although the level of excess payments varies by scheme, the overall level of excess payment is estimated at about 3.4%.  This level of excess payment is similar to that measured in peer organisations.  It also compares with rates of bad debt, typically 2% to 5%, and shrinkage, typically 2%, reported in commercial industry.  That is not to say that we cannot do better. <\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and General's report contains several recommendations with regard to the further targeting of reviews, the monitoring and resourcing of review activities, the more timely completion of control survey reports, and the testing of new system implementations.  The Department will take all these recommendations on board in 2021.<\/p> <p>  I understand committee members have expressed an interest in discussing issues related to false self-employment and the operation of the JobPath service.  Both of these topics were the subject of detailed discussions at this committee and other committees in recent years.  In order to assist the committee, we have provided some additional material, which was not available at the time of previous discussions, in the material we provided before this meeting.  We will be happy to take further questions on these topics.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, it is traditional for an Accounting Officer to conclude his or her address to the committee by acknowledging the role of staff in delivering the services for which he or she is accountable.  In a normal year, the Department would typically receive about 200,000 jobseeker claims.  So far, in response to the Covid-19 crisis, the staff of the Department have processed about 1.5 million claims from the people who were laid off due to Covid.  This is equivalent to about 7.5 years' worth of claims.  In the five-week period from 13 March alone, they dealt with more than four years' worth of claims and got them into payment quickly on a new scheme, the pandemic unemployment payment, that was itself designed, developed and implemented on a new IT system in a matter of days.<\/p> <p>  We also introduced a new illness benefit payment, worked with Revenue to develop the temporary wage subsidy scheme, and revised processes for community welfare services.  We set up and staffed new call centres to respond to millions of queries and deployed new online service systems.  Visits to our website of more than 12 million, use of our online services of more than 1.5 million, and calls to our call centres of more than 5 million exceeded those to all other public service organisations combined.  We received an online application on average once every 40 seconds.<\/p> <p>  To facilitate all this, staff worked on emergency legislation to enable us to provide payments, modify redundancy arrangements and operate the civil registration service.  Staff also continued to accept and process claims for all of our other key services, including carers, pensions and disabilities.  None of this could have been achieved unless staff continued to come to work, and work long hours, at a time when the public health advice was to stay at home.  I am proud to work in the same organisation that they do and I thank them for their commitment.  Their demonstration of real public service values has been exemplary and it was not just our staff.  I also wish to acknowledge and thank the staff of other Departments, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Passport Office, the Department of Justice and the National Shared Services Office who came to work with us.  I also wish to acknowledge and thank our colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners who took on the development and administration of the wage subsidy scheme.  Service partners such as An Post and our branch office providers, and our IT partners also contributed greatly.<\/p> <p>  The response of staff in the Department, and the wider public service, to the Covid-19 pandemic while exceptional is not unexpected.  I see every day how the managers and staff of the Department, work hard to deliver services to the communities from which they come and in which they live, conscious that it is their families, friends and neighbours who not only depend on these services but who, through their social insurance contributions and taxes, pay for these services.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, we know, as I said, that we are not perfect and do not always get things right.  This process today plays an important role in reminding us of our purpose, helping us to identify areas for improvement and helping us to learn from our mistakes.  I, and my colleagues, will be pleased to discuss these issues and take any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1605180600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I commend the Secretary General, particularly during the worst part of the pandemic back in late March, April and May, on how quickly his staff responded.

Apologies for the technical problems this morning.  Apologies also if I repeat some of the information that the Secretary General has already imparted to the committee.<\/p> <p>  As the Secretary General said, the Department operates a wide range of income support, welfare and labour activation schemes.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s overall expenditure on scheme payments in 2019 totalled just over &euro;20 billion.  Expenditure on administration of the schemes amounted to a further &euro;639 million.  Expenditure on the schemes is divided between the two accounts, namely, the appropriation account for Vote 37 and the account of the Social Insurance Fund.  An appendix to the appropriation account provides a useful summary of the combined programme expenditure and sets out the expenditure on a scheme-by-scheme basis.<\/p><p> The Vote account is funded mainly through direct Exchequer issues.  In contrast, the Social Insurance Fund is financed mainly from pay-related social insurance contributions.  Receipts into the Social Insurance Fund in 2019 totalled &euro;12.3 billion, including some &euro;708 million in National Training Fund levies collected together with PRSI contributions.  These levy receipts are transferred to the Department of Education, which manages the National Training Fund.<\/p><p> The surplus in the Social Insurance Fund for 2019 was over &euro;1.5 billion.  This left the fund with accumulated reserves of &euro;3.9 billion at the year end.<\/p><p> I gave a clear audit opinion on the accounts of both the Vote and Social Insurance Fund for 2019.  However, I drew attention in my report on both accounts to a material level of irregular payment.  This is explained in the chapter on control over welfare payments which is before the committee this morning.  I also drew attention in my report on the Vote account to a material level of non-compliance with procurement rules, as disclosed by the Department in the statement on internal financial control.<\/p><p> Turning to the chapter, income support is payable when the Department is satisfied that applicants meet the conditions that apply to the relevant schemes.  This typically requires applicants to provide certain information and-or evidence of entitlement, and for that information to be correctly processed by the Department&rsquo;s staff.  Incorrect amounts may be paid where errors are made by claimants or by the Department&rsquo;s staff, or if an applicant misrepresents his or her circumstances, either inadvertently or deliberately.  This may result in a claimant being underpaid or overpaid relative to his or her entitlement.  There is evidence that payments in excess of claimants&rsquo; entitlements occur on a scale that requires me to bring them to the attention of the committee.<\/p><p> The Department applies a range of controls and strategies to prevent incorrect payments.  Chapter 4 presents an overview of the Department&rsquo;s activities and evaluates their effectiveness.  The Department carries out control surveys on individual schemes on a cyclical basis.  This generally involves comprehensively reviewing up to 1,000 randomly selected claims in payment.  The results of the reviews indicate the estimated level of incorrect payment on the scheme.  The control surveys also assist the Department to identify scheme-specific risks and necessary changes to scheme control measures.<\/p><p> Excess payment rates vary between the schemes, as the Secretary General has pointed out, and generally are higher for means-tested schemes funded under the Vote than for Social Insurance Fund schemes where a substantial element of eligibility and entitlement relates to an individual&rsquo;s recorded history of PRSI contributions.  Control surveys may also identify cases where claimants are being paid less than their entitlement but the incidence and value of this is much less than the excess payments that are identified.<\/p><p> The Department also carries out a programme of reviews of individual payment cases, usually selected on a risk assessment basis.  In 2019, some 609,000 such control reviews were carried out.  The results indicate that the targeting of cases for review is relatively effective, generally identifying a higher percentage of cases with overpayment than would be expected if cases were selected randomly.  However, the Department conducted only 80% of the control reviews it had planned for 2019.<\/p><p> The examination also looked at a sample of control reviews the Department had conducted in 2019 and found that in 10% of cases a clear record of the review work undertaken was absent.  This made it difficult to assess what assurance was gained from the control reviews.<\/p><p> Where the Department finds evidence that a welfare recipient has been paid in excess of entitlement in the past, an overpayment may be raised.  Overall, the detected level of overpayments has been relatively consistent in recent years and amounted to &euro;117 million in 2019.  In general, overpayments attributed to suspected fraud have trended down in recent years.<\/p><p> Overpayments detected that resulted from official error were also trending down, but problems arising from a change in the processing of illness benefit payments in August 2018 resulted in a significant spike in overpayments.  The Department transferred the claims processing from an old IT system to its core IT system.  Because of ensuing delays and problems in processing medical certificates, the Department decided to implement an auto-certification process, allowing payments to be made without an updated medical certificate.  The Department did this to ensure that qualified claimants would not be deprived of financial supports.  While the Department recognised that some overpayments would occur as a result, it did not have an estimate of the likely amount.  Subsequently, the Department identified overpayments of illness benefit totalling &euro;12.2 million related to auto-certification.<\/p><p> Separately, due to an error in the processing of a weekly payment run in December 2019, 11,000 claimants of illness benefit received duplicate payments at a cost of &euro;2.5 million.  The Department has made arrangements to recoup the overpayments and has made changes in its procedure that it believes will ensure this does not recur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605180600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I should say how grateful everybody is for the simply extraordinary work carried out by his Department and officials in Intreo offices all around the country and at the end of the phone.  The work that has been done is without parallel and it was a huge commitment.  I am sure every Deputy here has seen the benefit of it.  Where minor issues have arisen here and there, there has been a great responsiveness in sorting them out.  It is a huge measure of public service and an extraordinary amount of work, as Mr. McKeon set out in his statement.  Processing four years of claims in five weeks is an extraordinary amount of work.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to some of the outstanding practicalities before we get to some of the issues for today.  A couple of issues that are important for people's lives are still outstanding.  With regard to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, a person who cannot go back to work in a job that is still there because he or she is in a medically high-risk category is not entitled to the PUP and must go on illness benefit.  I have in mind one particular lady with multiple sclerosis who worked three days per week and rented out a room.  She can no longer rent out the room and cannot go back to work.  She is not eligible for the PUP and is on illness benefit, which is means tested.  She receives &euro;159 per week and is left with &euro;27 per week after bills.  Her income has gone down substantially through no fault of her own.  A number of people are in that sort of category and I am sure Deputies have stories of people experiencing difficulties that persist.  We can move on to the other issues of the day but there are a couple of outstanding anomalies here and there.  I thank Mr. McKeon for the opportunity to bring them to his attention, as he signalled earlier.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. McKeon talk us through the paternity changes the Department is introducing, in particular the timeline for eligibility and when people will be able to claim it?  A couple of procedural issues have arisen so I would be grateful to get an outline from Mr. McKeon in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#C00300","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605180600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Parent's benefit is a payment made to people who are on parent's leave.  As the Deputy will be aware, last year the Government introduced parent's leave of two weeks, which is additional to paternity and maternity leave, with the intention to increase it to nine weeks over a number of years in line with EU obligations.  This year, the Government decided to increase the period of parent's leave by a further three weeks to bring the total to five weeks.  Primary responsibility for this is actually with the Department Children and Youth Affairs which must provide the legislation to oblige an employer to grant the parent's leave in the first instance.  Once that is done, we will then build a process in the IT system to reflect it.  As soon as that is done, people will be eligible.<\/p> <p>  The eligibility is being backdated to November of last year.  Parents of children born since November of last year will, therefore, be eligible.<\/p><p>People will be able to apply for the leave as soon as it is legislated for.  It will take us some time after that to put the IT and processing systems in place.  We estimate that it could be March or April of next year, but from whatever day the Oireachtas enacts the legislation, people will be entitled to the leave and the payment.  We will backdate any payments to that outdate.<\/p><p> There are some complexities involved.  I do not want to talk on behalf of my colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  When one imposes an obligation on employers to grant a person leave, issues arise relating to notice periods, substitution periods and so on, which have to be covered in the legislation.  The advice of the Attorney General is that there has to be consultation with employers before one can do that.  I think the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is hoping to get the matter of leave before the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  Once the legislation is enacted, we will pay people from that date.  We have taken some measures in anticipation and started work on building the systems, but it is quite complex.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605180600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>One matter that arose with the Minister at an early stage related to someone who had a baby in February or March of this year and is returning from maternity leave.

He said that there was &euro;117 million in overpayments in 2019.  That can happen because of errors and because of fraud.  It is not all fraud and there was a downwards trend in fraud.

Of that, &euro;12 million relates to the illness benefit case so if one takes the illness benefit issue out, it is &euro;5.5 million, or about 5%.

There are two matters.  One is classification.  If we have not contacted somebody in the previous three years and asked him or her to update his or her means, we will say that that is a departmental error.  The other is that we have implemented new systems and IT systems to stop fraud from getting in, for example, the public services card and SAFE process.  We have started to do more frequent reviews of some of our schemes based on discussions that were held at this committee in the previous D&aacute;il, to have annual correspondence to remind people that if their circumstances have changed, they need to tell us.  We have taken all of those measures and that is part of it.<\/p> <p>  The other thing that I would say is that fraud sometimes gets a lot of attention.  Other Deputies who have been members of this committee have heard me say this before.  Fraud is a very small part of what we do.  I am always anxious to say to people that the reason we do control is twofold.  The first is to reduce overpayments, whether due to our error, customer error, or fraud.  The other matter is that we want to be able to assure people that there is integrity in the system, because there are sometimes newspapers and so on that run headlines about fraud and such.  It is important, if we are to have social cohesion and confidence in the system, that the public generally sees that we take steps to try to make sure that there is not fraud in the system.  We can report that the level of overpayments due to fraud is quite low.  Some &euro;131 million out of &euro;20 billion is about 0.5%.

I want to acknowledge that.  We made some mistakes.  At the time it happened, I got in touch with the then Chairman of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, John Curran, and I asked to be allowed to appear before the committee so I could explain it.  We appeared before it and we apologised and explained what happened.  There is a record of the notes if the Deputy wants to follow up on this.  I will summarise the position very quickly.  We have more than 80 schemes in the Department and we have been migrating them on a rolling basis to our more up-to-date IT platform.  There are about four schemes left.  We got through nearly all of them with no trouble whatsoever and then ran into a problem with the illness benefit.<\/p> <p>  Regarding testing, we did the full range of standard tests, integration testing, regression testing, system testing and end-user testing.  We did all the usual tests.  In fact, we implemented the system live earlier in 2018 on a subset of illness benefit claims, the partial capacity benefit claims, and it worked fine.  When we went live with the big range of claims at the end, it fell over.  There are a couple of reasons.  One was that we were working on the basis of what we believed was an agreement with the medical profession on the use of a new form of medical certificate.  Many doctors followed through on that but some did not and we ended up getting certificates that we could not put into the new IT system.  That was the major problem that started it all off.  We had people who are probably entitled to the payment but whose doctor sent in the wrong certificate.  We could not get the certificates into the system on time so we had to make a judgment call - it was a bit like the PUP - and bias it towards paying the person rather than processing the certificate.  That is where the problem arose.<\/p> <p>  To be honest, there were also other issues.  We made some design changes in implementing the system that, in retrospect, we should not have made.  We moved from a payment-in-arrears model to a real-time payment model, which we believed was the right thing to do.  What happens in practice, however, is that it can take people a week to get an appointment with their doctor after having been ill for a week, and the certificate is received a week later.  The payment-in-arrears model gave a week or two of a buffer allowing all that to happen whereas a real-time model gave no buffer.  That caused problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#F04000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1605180600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Who approved the changes during the design process?<\/p><p>Was it within the Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#F04100","speaker":"1601","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605180600,"counter":118,"content":"<p>It was within the Department.

Whether we would have the current model of payment by results as strongly is up for question.  We commissioned a report by the Institute for Employment Studies to advise us on this matter and we recently received the report and referred it to the labour market advisory council.  It is suggesting that we still keep the performance-based element, but perhaps rebalance it a little.  There are risks in that.  The performance-based element works for the Exchequer because one only pays for results, whereas when one changes the payment rate so that it is more for the service rather than the results, one has a fixed cost and a smaller variable cost.

I just wanted to put that on record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#J01100","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1605180600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McKeon for his contribution this morning.  I join my colleagues in thanking all the staff in the Department and in its offices for the support they have provided in the last nine months, during what has been a very difficult time for everyone.  The Department responded quickly and delivered very fast, and that must be acknowledged.<\/p> <p>  I want to deal with several issues.  This is not a policy area, from the point of view of Mr. McKeon, but there is one aspect of review that we must look at.  One big problem I am coming across concerns people in their late 50s who have lost their jobs and are unlikely to return to employment.  To qualify for a community employment scheme, people must be unemployed for 12 months.  The people to whom I refer would have got a payment for the last six months and they are now going onto unemployment payments.  Can we look at the rules regarding taking on people under community employment schemes?<\/p> <p>  While I know of many people looking for employment, I also know many people who will not qualify for the community employment scheme because they have not been unemployed for 12 months.  On the other hand, I know of six facilities in my constituency that cannot fill the existing community employment jobs.  These are people who look after the maintenance, opening up and supervision of facilities.  Could we review that scheme?  We have these facilities.  When we open up from the level 5 restrictions, people will want to use these community and sporting facilities immediately, but there will be no one there to open them because many people have completed their time on the community employment schemes.  I know a man who was on a community employment scheme for five years.  Even though he is 59 years old, his time on the scheme will not be extended.  He was there because we got it extended on a number of previous occasions.  Is it possible to look at that issue?<\/p> <p>  The second matter I raise concerns cases of overpayment by the Department.  The Department is entitled to try to recoup that money, whether from the estates of those deceased or from people still alive.  We do not, however, have a mechanism for dealing with a situation where people did not get their full entitlement.  An example is a lady who contacted me recently.  She is 81 years old.  She never applied for the old age pension until recently, however, because she was getting a carer's allowance for looking after her brother, and her father before that.  She worked for 25 years, but did not claim the old age pension when she reached the qualifying criteria.  There is no mechanism which allows such an entitlement to be backdated.<\/p> <p>  It is the same with other cases.  I was contacted by someone who received compensation in the context of hepatitis C because he or she had a medical problem, got blood transfusions for that problem and contracted hepatitis C.  That person was compensated, but has now been told that he or she is not entitled to receive social welfare, whereas I think that he or she is entitled to do so.  That person has a disability allowance and is not able to go back to work.  He or she no longer has hepatitis C, but is physically affected by disability.  It is a genuine situation, where the person cannot return to work.<\/p> <p>  I would also like Mr. McKeon to clarify the situation regarding people who are homeless.  It is a really sad situation.  I walk a straight line from where I stay here in Dublin to the corner of Kildare Street at the Shelbourne Hotel.<\/p><p>Every morning when I walk past there, at least four to five people are sleeping on the street.  One morning recently, I came across 13 people sleeping on the street.  How can people who are homeless and have no permanent base be given support?  How is that structured?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#J01200","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605180600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>On the last one, people who do not have a fixed abode or address are entitled to social welfare and we work with them.  For example, in Dublin we have a dedicated unit, called the homeless persons unit in Gardiner Street, which is very active in working and ensuring that people who are homeless and rough sleepers in particular - it is not a term I particularly like - can access welfare benefits.  Around the country our Intreo centres and community welfare service staff will work with people who are rough sleepers and make sure they get their benefits.  We also fund a lot of community and voluntary groups in terms of food parcels and all these kinds of things through what is called the feed programme.  So, we provide a range of services.<\/p> <p>  On disability and the one the Deputy mentioned, I cannot talk about an individual case, but on the issue of access to disability payments, we never challenge the diagnosis of a person's GP or consultant.  The test is whether that person is capable of performing work with that illness or disability.  That is the test.  We have more than 30 well-qualified occupational medical doctors, including some consultants, who review cases.  They determine and recommend whether a person is capable of work or not.  I do not know about that particular case, but all those cases can also be appealed.  If that person has a difficulty, they can appeal that case.<\/p> <p>  On community employment, there should not be, but I know there always are vacancies in community employment because there are gaps - frictional kinds of vacancies.  We have 68,000 people who are long-term unemployed.  We have 21,000 places on community employment, of which about 20,000 are currently filled.  The level off vacancy of one over 20 is approximately 5%, which is what one gets in any business.  There will generally be 5% vacancies at any point in time.  If there are difficulties in a particular community employment scheme, the Deputy should let me know and we will follow them up because I am sure there are candidates.<\/p> <p>  I will follow up on the pensions issue and come back to the Deputy.

If the Deputy were to measure those on the same outcome of cost per job created, their figures would he higher again than the &euro;11,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#K03900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1605180600,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Chairman-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#K04000","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605180600,"counter":225,"content":"<p>This is about providing a service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#K04100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1605180600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Whatever about Mr. McKeon's understanding of JobPath, the Government propaganda was certainly that this scheme was a job-creation scheme.

Based on answers to parliamentary questions up to July there were 275,000 applicants at a cost of &euro;243 million to the two companies Seetec and Turas Nua.<\/p><p>The number of jobs created at that point was 20,000.  It has already been outlined how if we divide the 20,000 jobs created into the overall sums, we get a figure somewhere north of 11,000.  In this period in the constituency I represent almost 13,500 people went through JobPath referrals.  Of that number a little over 1,000 were in employment, which is approximately one eleventh or 8% or 9%.  This seems low.  The figures from across the State suggest the figure is a little over 7%.<\/p><p> It is a costly scheme.  The Department officials mentioned the fees.  I said in my opening remarks that the Department does great work but the outsourcing to two companies and their performance over the past four and a half or five years is of concern.  The initial referral fee is &euro;311.  There are four payments known as sustainment fees.  After 13 weeks the cost is &euro;613, after 26 weeks the figure is &euro;737, after 39 weeks the figure is &euro;892 and after 52 weeks it is &euro;1,165 in total.  That means a total of &euro;3,718 payable per person who secures employment that is sustained for at least one year.  These are the fees that have been set out for us and I want to ask about them.<\/p><p> The officials mentioned that the contract has been extended.  It has been extended for the second time.  The term of the contract was up in December 2019 and it was extended for a further year.  This is the second extension.<\/p><p> Let us look at it in comparison with the local employment services and what is happening with them.  One of my colleagues carried out a survey and spoke to many people who went through that system and to people who work in it.  I will read from what they have found from speaking to jobseekers.  One said she was currently working part time as an assistant manager in a shop and she absolutely loves it.  She is in a secure job and works three or four days per week.  She ends up with between &euro;30 and &euro;56 of social welfare and casual slips.  She is on a 20-hour contract but works in excess of that which means she is getting less on social welfare.  She has a two year old child and is a working mother.  That person lost her job.  There are two other cases.  A substitute teacher was holding down a position in two schools.  She said substitute teachers are on call so there are weeks when she works full time.  She questions how she is supposed to hold down a job.  She was sent to JobPath while doing two jobs.  She has to keep two employers happy and has to attend JobPath meetings.  During the school term she was on call and took any work she could get.  She got calls from JobPath asking her to attend meetings on days when she was called at short notice to work as a substitute teacher in schools.  There is no concept of how subbing works.  JobPath is a flawed system and has helped to push her out of the teaching profession, something she has worked for.  Another teacher said she only qualified last year but has been tormented by the scheme.  She had to leave her teaching job as a result of the scheme.  She was given no opportunity to interview for teaching jobs.  Her teaching qualifications cost &euro;12,000 and she believes that is now wasted.  I could go on and on.  Another participant said that she felt like a commodity and went on at length about this.  We spoke to many people who came through this system.<\/p><p> We also spoke to people who work in the local employment services.  They said several things to us.  One member of staff who has been a local employment staff member for over ten years said to us that she has seen the major impact JobPath has had on local employment services throughout the country.  LES referral figures from the Department of Social Protection have been drastically reduced, almost from existence in some cases, due to the contractual agreement with JobPath.  This person is a mediator and counsellor.  Her concern is that when clients are referred to her after time in JobPath they are less motivated, more confused and further removed from the workforce.  It has the effect of a wasted year.  A Turas Nua worker in one of the companies said that virtually no initial training was provided to new recruits.  Staff turnover was exceptionally high.  Total training consisted of a briefing to a group of 30 staff in a hotel for a couple of days followed by a couple of days in a JobPath branch.  They gave us other examples.<\/p><p> I have outlined the fees involved.  The initial payment is &euro;311, after 13 weeks it is &euro;630, after 26 weeks it is &euro;737, after 39 weeks it is &euro;892 and after 52 weeks it is &euro;1,165.<\/p><p> A report was done by Indecon on the local employment services.  It found that the services deliver 22 community schemes throughout the country.  This recent research by Indecon looked at participants and the employer experience.  It is important to get a view from employers as well.  Over 75% of local employment service clients reported that they were motivated by the staff.  Some 74% reported positive help with education and training and other development opportunities.  Some 89% of employers reported help received from the services in finding suitable candidates for vacancies while some 83% of employers believed that they were an efficient recruitment service for their companies.  Some 82% have an established and effective working relationship with the local employment service.<\/p><p> The reason I am reading from the report is in the frame of when we look at what is being spent.  The total figure up to July of this year is &euro;243 million and 275,000 have gone through in that period.  We need to consider the cost per individual.  It is a really serious concern that a vast amount of public money is being spent.  Not alone have these contracts been extended from last December to this December but we have contracted again.<\/p><p> I know what I hear anecdotally.  My colleague, Deputy John Brady, opened this up for people to give feedback, including people who worked in the local employment services, those who worked in the two companies which provide the service through JobPath and, importantly, JobPath participants.  We also examined the Indecon report.  The Department should be praised for the work it does but by any standards there is a major flaw in outsourcing this to these two companies.  The Department has probably entered into the contract at this stage.  If it has, it is unfortunate.  Can anything be done at this point to try to address this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#K04300","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605180600,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman, for the examples.  I agree that the local employment service is a good service.  We commissioned the Indecon report - it was commissioned by the Department.  We have maintained expenditure with the local employment services throughout this period.  They have received approximately &euro;100 million during the period.  JobPath got &euro;244 million.  We are increasing the budget for the local employment services for next year and we are expanding the services.  I agree with the comments from the Chairman on the local employment services.<\/p> <p>  I have to say I would encourage people to look at the data on the JobPath service.  As part of the contract management, we commission regular surveys by an external agency of customer experience with JobPath.  We publish the surveys.  The surveys are of 1,000 people randomly selected.  They are statistically valid.  It is not an invite where people come in on a website and let us know their experiences.  The 1,000 people are randomly selected and properly surveyed.  The results are statistically robust.  The results of these surveys are equally as glowing as the reports the Chairman has got on the local employment services.  I am stating this as a fact rather than making any comment one way or the other.  That needs to be taken into account.<\/p> <p>  I would also say that the employment outcomes from JobPath are somewhat higher than the Chairman has indicated.  As I have said, some 64,000 people started jobs out of the 235,000 who were eligible.  That is approximately 27%.  I can tell the committee that the employment progression rate of that group of people is typically 8% or 10% because we are looking at long-term unemployed people.  It is a significant increase.  Deputy Carthy was not here earlier but I can tell the committee that the cost of JobPath is between &euro;800 and &euro;880.<\/p><p>The cost for a local employment service to provide a roughly equivalent service is approximately &euro;1,000 per person.  The cost for our internal staff is approximately &euro;1,200.  Cost parameters indicate it is a good service.  I know there are concerns about it.  Many of the concerns about JobPath may have been based on bad experiences of similar schemes in the United Kingdom.  What I would say about the JobPath providers in Ireland is that one of them is 100% owned by a farmers' co-operative and is not a commercial enterprise.  We have people with similar backgrounds running local employment services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605180600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. McKeon to address the issue of similar methods being used to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#M00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605180600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I will come back to that issue.  The other company is owned by an employee trust.  It is not commercial in that sense.  The employees, including its employees in Ireland, are the owners of the company.  It is 100% owned by the employees.  That needs to be borne in mind as well.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the service the two companies are meant to provide, local employment services should be sitting down with people as well, putting job vacancies in front of them and asking them about pursuing those opportunities.  That is what an employment adviser does and that is what a case officer in my Department is meant to do.  It is what an adviser in a JobPath company does.  They are meant to put jobs in front of people, help them to apply for those jobs, put training courses in front of them and help them to progress in those training courses.  It is the same service.  The difference is whether it is payment by results or payment per cost inputs.  One is a payment by results model; the other is a payment for cost inputs model.  There is a place in every European country at which I have looked for contracted-out employment services.  It is about the core element, which is the local employment services, of which our staff form the core, to deal with the steady-state level of unemployment.  There is then a contracted flexible resource model to burst beyond that.  That is what JobPath is about.  In most places, they are payment by result models..  We are not doing anything different from what has been done in Australia, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.  Some people's attitude to JobPath may be informed by very bad press coverage of the system in the UK for understandable reasons.

I am getting exactly the same kind of feedback as other Deputies are.  I have discussed the matter with Mr. McKeon previously at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts with regard to people having to give up a part-time job to go on JobPath.  They felt that that was the only option available.  The kind of advice people get and the kind of jobs they are being pointed towards, which they could also find on the Internet, may be very different to their experience.  I know what will happen after this meeting.  If there is any media coverage of this issue, Deputies will be contacted by a raft of additional people.  It is unusual for that to happen.  It certainly influences my outlook on the experiences people are having.<\/p> <p>  I question whether people really feel they can be honest in a survey, even if it is separate to JobPath, carried out by the Department.  It is not an equal relationship or, at least, people often do not feel it is an equal relationship.  They feel dependent and do not wish to rock the boat.  I think that is worth considering in terms of proper evaluation.  The Comptroller and Auditor General prepared a report or an outline last week in terms of value for money.  In the context of outcomes for the individuals involved, I would be really concerned if local employment services are saying that people are coming to them demoralised after an experience with JobPath.  That is the opposite to what was sought to be achieved.  I ask Mr. McKeon to look at how this is evaluated.  Deputies are raising these issues as a result of the experiences people are relating to us and for no other reason.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#M01300","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1605180600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I have received negative feedback but I have also received positive feedback.  On the issue of cost, if one considers that the basic unemployment benefit of slightly more than &euro;200 per week is equivalent to &euro;11,000 per annum, the scheme is good value for money.  I worked for more than ten years with a community employment scheme that worked with young people who had dropped out of school and tried to bring them back into the education system.  We carried out a survey that found that five years after leaving us, more than 70% of them were in full-time employment.  That is in circumstances where there were many family difficulties, etc.  An interesting thing about that project, which took place in the 1990s, is that it cost &pound;12,000 per person who went through the facility over a 12-month time period.  If one looks at the cost of the instant scheme, it is not too different.  I think it is good value for money, especially when one considers the significant benefits to the 22,000 people who are getting opportunities and have the facility of training, etc., to go back into employment.  The big problem we will have in the coming two years is that many companies that took on extra staff may reduce staffing levels.

I know of cases, some of which involve very close friends of mine, where relationships did not start or broke up at an early stage because of pressure applied by the Department.

I absolutely take on board the points she makes.  I would not for one second suggest that the representations that she or any other Deputy has made are for any reason other than that they are receiving those representations.  I often get representations as well.  As I stated in my opening remarks, we must be cognisant that very often public representatives and the Department tend to get complaints rather than positive comments.  The Department deals with 18 million payments per year.  If a fraction of a percentage of those payments give rise to complaints, that creates an impression that there are significant problems but actually there are not.<\/p> <p>  We are very conscious of the need to validate and verify the survey information.<\/p><p>For example, the survey of JobPath participants is carried out independently of the Department.  It is not branded by the Department.  This year, it was carried out by the respected research agency, Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes, while in previous years it was carried out by W5.  These were reviewed positively by our chief statistician with regard to the statistical approach and the margin of error.  With regard to concerns about whether people give accurate feedback, in matters such as this one looks at trends over time.  These show a consistently high level of satisfaction with the JobPath service.  If, however, 285,000 have gone through the process and 10% were not happy, that is 28,500 people.  The Deputy and I will hear a lot of complaints as a consequence of that.  It is important, however, not to view these representations as an indicator of an overall problem.  I take on board everything the Deputy has said and we will certainly consider it.  As I said previously, we are looking at redesigning the contract to address the types of issue that are coming up.  <\/p><p> The report we circulated with regard to the econometric evaluation is very robust and has been very well received.  I gather that the OECD is to publish its own paper based on it because it considers it to be of such a high quality.  It shows very positive outcomes for JobPath participants and, again, very high levels of customer satisfaction.  Those data must be taken into account.  I cannot say that it is 100% accurate but neither are the representations we receive.  We have to try to find a balance.  I take on board everything the Deputy has said.<\/p><p> With regard to Deputy Carthy's questions on one-parent families, I am very much aware of recent coverage with regard to the one-parent family payment.  In fact, one of the Deputy's colleagues was among the first people to draw my attention to the matter.  The trade union F&oacute;rsa drew my attention to the latter case because it was very annoyed at some of the coverage in the press, which has been quite inaccurate.  I do not want to get into it but the kind of behaviours instanced in those newspaper articles and in one or two Twitter storms are not behaviours the Department would condone.  If they are happening, it is in a tiny proportion of cases.  <\/p><p> We have 370 inspectors in the Department, most of whom are women and most of whom are over 50 years of age.  They are all highly experienced and trained to deal with people in a sensitive and empathetic manner.  Representatives often ask them to go out to people.  Many of their visits are triggered by representatives asking them to help Mary or John.  That is why the trade union was particularly annoyed at some of this coverage.  As I have said, we contacted some of the news outlets involved and asked whether they could get permission from the people on whom they reported to give my office the details of these cases so that they could be investigated fully.  I have not received any such details yet.  If any Deputy here knows of examples, and if the people involved are scared to come forward because they are afraid there would be some repercussions, they should know there would never be.  If Deputies can get permission to bring these cases to my attention, we will look into them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020111200002#M01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605180600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McKeon for all the information he has provided.

I am going to the first meeting on the national Traveller and Roma integration strategy and want to be there on time.<\/p> <p>  I am very pleased to be here today to discuss my Department&rsquo;s Further Revised Estimate for 2020.  As members will recall, I appeared before the committee on 6 October when I presented the Estimate for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for 2020.  I noted at that stage that additional functions were to be transferred to my Department and that I would appear before the committee with a Further Revised Estimate to include the new departmental functions.<\/p> <p>  The expansion of the Department arose from the discussions on the programme for Government and the establishment of new Departments where it was decided to reallocate a number of functions to this Department.  As part of that, I assumed ministerial responsibility for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and a range of other responsibilities coming from the Department of Justice, including gender equality; disability policy; migrant integration policy; Traveller and Roma inclusion policy; LGBTI+ inclusion policy; work-life balance and supports for working parents and caring responsibility; and the funding streams associated with policy work transferring.<\/p> <p>  The following significant work stream areas transferred into the Department: the Magdalen restorative justice; international protection accommodation services; and international protection procurement services.  The second and third of these are in the area of direct provision.  The following areas transferred out of the Department: the bail supervision scheme; the Greentown project; and the research evidence into practice project.  Approximately &euro;220 million of budget transferred in and &euro;3 million transferred out.  In this regard and taking account of the additional &euro;3 million in further capital funding that has been secured, the allocation for my Department is increasing to &euro;1.837 billion, which is an increase of &euro;221 million from the Estimate approved by this committee in early October.  My Department will be spending &euro;1.796 billion on current expenditure and &euro;41 million in capital expenditure during 2020.<\/p> <p>  At the previous meeting, I outlined the pressures that Covid was placing on the provision of services across my Department, with the early years learning sector and Tusla being particularly affected.  I recognise that Tusla and the early years learning sector are working very hard at this time.  All areas of my Vote have been impacted by Covid as have all areas of society.<\/p> <p>  The area of accommodation for international protection seekers has been particularly impacted.  My officials have been working hard to ensure that users of direct provision centres are properly protected.  This has involved a need to identify specific processes and resources, such as activating separate accommodation to prevent and deal with outbreaks of the virus, reallocating shared accommodation to reduce the number of residents sharing rooms, purchasing PPE and enabling older residents to cocoon as well as deploying staffing resources to meet the increased workload.  I acknowledge the tremendous efforts made across my Department in response to the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  I turn to the Vote.  Members have been provided with a brief on the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  In the brief, I have set out the funding allocations across the different programme areas along with a summary by subhead to include details of the allocation and any changes over 2019.<\/p> <p>  In the select committee meeting at the start of last month, I dealt with the children and youth affairs elements of the Vote.  I spoke in detail about Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and early learning and care.  We then had an extensive discussion on youth services. <\/p> <p>  The key changes in the Further Revised Estimate are the inclusion of the former Department of Justice elements of the Vote to a value of &euro;120 million; the additional &euro;100 million of Exchequer funding for direct provision; the redeployment on a temporary basis of &euro;40 million from early years, with &euro;20 million going to Tusla and &euro;20 million to direct provision; the transfer out of small elements of the youth justice remit to the Department of Justice; and an increase of &euro;3 million in capital funding to Tusla, early years and the youth sector.<\/p> <p>  I propose to briefly address the areas of change before opening the debate up to members.  The areas transferring into the Department encompass equality, disability and integration.  These are very important and challenging areas and with the additional funding being allocated as part of the Further Revised Estimates process amounting to some &euro;220 million of taxpayer investment in services.<\/p> <p>  Part of these funds will continue to focus on reducing inequality.  Programme D, an equal and inclusive society, contains funding streams for areas such as the National Disability Authority, refugee and migrant integration, gender equality, LGBTI+, and Traveller and Roma initiatives.<\/p> <p>  Most of the funding is for the delivery of accommodation under our international protection services.  The allocation to this area is contained in programme E, a fair and efficient system for international protection seekers.  The aim of this programme is to provide accommodation and related services to persons in the international protection process.  A total of &euro;200 million is allocated to subhead E4 which provides funding mainly directed towards the costs of accommodation.  We have seen a significant increase in numbers applying for international protection in recent years.  The increased demand has stretched existing dedicated centres and the Department has increasingly needed to rely on other premises such as hotels and guesthouses to provide accommodation on a short-term basis.<\/p> <p>  The increased demand and use of emergency accommodation have had a significant impact on costs.  In addition, the effects of Covid in 2020 have led to additional costs through the need for social distancing, the opening of self-isolation facilities and the purchasing of PPE.<\/p> <p>  As members know, the programme for Government commits to end direct provision.  Work has begun on the White Paper that will outline the new system of accommodation and how we implement that.  That paper will be published by the end of 2020.<\/p> <p>  These changes to bring us to that new system will take time and, in the meantime, sufficient funding needs to be provided for those in accommodation at the moment.  I am absolutely committed to moving away from the existing system and developing this new model.  I think Deputies and Senators in all parties join us in that.<\/p><p>I am happy to provide any further information Deputies may want on any areas of the Vote as we go through the various subheads.  I thank the Chairman and the members for taking the time to listen to my short introduction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020111200002#A00500","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020111200002#B00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the briefing.  A document was released today by a group of masters students in the Irish Centre for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland Galway.  I believe the Minister has received a copy of the report.  The study is called Direct Provision's Impact on Children: A Human Rights Analysis.  It was undertaken in collaboration with the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, MASI, and as part of the international human rights law clinic under the supervision of Dr. Maeve O'Rourke.  The results of this report are very stark.  It shines a light on the impact on children of living in direct provision and emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  The report argues that the children's rights are being breached in areas where accommodation in isolated areas creates barriers to accessing specialist services, including mental health services and social care, and that a lack of proper food and nutrition in centres where self-catering facilities are unavailable hampers children's health and development.  The prohibitive cost of educational materials also creates barriers to accessing education.  The report lists a range of areas where children are impacted by the conditions we place them in when we put them into direct provision or emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that this is an area the Minister is prioritising, which is very welcome.  I understand that a significant amount of money is being put towards that in the Estimates.  Are there any targeted measures provided in these Estimates that will address the specific issues of children in direct provision and emergency accommodation?<\/p> <p>  The Minister has said that a lot of the money and additional costs this year are because of the need for the emergency accommodation.  Will the Minister outline for the committee the differences in regulation between direct provision accommodation and emergency accommodation?  Quite a number of my constituents are coming to me with concerns on this, particularly around the emergency accommodation provision, where they feel that there is a lack of transparency in how those services are monitored.  It is very difficult to ascertain the kinds of conditions in which people are living in those emergency accommodations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020111200002#B00300","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I have not had a chance to go through that report in detail.  It was sent to me yesterday and I received it this morning.  I welcome the report and I welcome the engagement of academics and NGOs in continuing to highlight what we all know is the absolute unsuitability of direct provision and the need to move to a new system.  I look forward to engaging with them further.  The fact that they are putting a spotlight on the specific issue of children is really important.  This follows on from work that was done by the special rapporteur for children in his report this year, and the very detailed report by the Ombudsman for Children on the impact of direct provision on children.<\/p> <p>  The report sets out a number of issues, some of which are related to the particular problems of emergency accommodation, which the Deputy highlighted in her questions.  We absolutely, in the short term, need to move away from the use of emergency accommodation.  Nobody thinks that is acceptable even as a medium-term solution.<\/p> <p>  The reason the Department increased the use of emergency accommodation over the past year was due to the significant increase in the number of people seeking international protection in 2018 and especially in 2019.  Obviously, the circumstances this year are different.<\/p> <p>  The Department has changed the way in which it now seeks to tender for non-emergency direct provision accommodation, which are the longer-term direct provision centres.  We are hoping to see the benefits of that.  The committee may be aware that we have identified a new direct provision centre, opened in Galway some months ago, which is based on own-door accommodation that we now see as the standard for direct provision in the medium term.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues highlighted by the academics in the NUIG report is Tusla's involvement with children in direct provision.  I am currently undertaking the strategy for Tusla for next year.  The Department and I prepare jointly a strategy for Tusla's priorities for each year.  I specifically asked that they look at the particular issue of Tusla's engagement with children in direct provision.  Tusla would already have significant engagement with children who have gone through the Irish refugee protection programme or those children who have arrived at our ports as unaccompanied minors.  I have asked that Tusla look at its responsibilities with regard to children in direct provision.<\/p> <p>  The education issue is absolutely fundamental and we are working on it in the context of the White Paper.  I was at a senior EU officials group meeting today about the White Paper, including the issue of education, and especially primary and second level education and ensuring that children have access to schools.<\/p> <p>  The Dr. Catherine Day report said that schools need to be resourced for the specific needs of children who are in direct provision.  One of the Deputies in this committee has experience, in a former profession, of teaching children who were in direct provision.  Schools need to be assisted because additional supports are needed.  We have identified that.<\/p> <p>  I will commit to engaging further in my Department on the quality of food in emergency accommodation.  With regard to the differences in the regulations between direct provision and emergency accommodation, the regulations that come into effect in January 2021 and which we will be asking HIQA to monitor do not apply to emergency accommodation.  It is another indiction of why we need to move away from the use of emergency accommodation.  As far as I understand, my officials can still inspect emergency accommodation locations.  If there are issues, our officials can also undertake unannounced inspections as well as the programme of announced inspections.  I hope this addresses the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020111200002#B00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>One of the things that strikes me when looking at the Estimates is the context and impact indicators and some of the key outputs we are trying to measure.  In some areas of the Vote they actually seem to be proper targets and helpful measures, but my concern is that under programme expenditure A, the children and family support programme, a lot of the impact indicators we measure are just totally wrong.  For example, one indicator is the percentage of children across all care settings who have a care plan.  While it is important that the children have a care plan, it is a number that can be massaged very easily.  I have seen cases where a social worker is allocated, does the care plan and then is unallocated, as it were.  The box is being ticked but there is not necessarily any meaningful engagement in care planning.  A plan is all well and good on paper, but this does not necessarily mean it is being implemented.<\/p> <p>  On page 14 we see the number of children in care and the number of referrals.  We do not seem to have any measurement for their outcomes.  There is no link of the outcomes of children in care to the outcomes in the Better Outcomes, Bright Futures policy.  We are not looking at things like children in care who are in education, the number of placement moves or the number of social worker changes.  These are three key indicators that would speak to stability of placement and much better quality outcomes for young people in the care system.  We will not know this.  The more placements the child has and the more changes of social workers, the harder it is for the child to have a decent outcome.  These are the sorts of indicators we should be measuring, even if it is just tying them in with the Better Outcomes, Bright Futures outcomes an measurements.<\/p> <p>  I have a slight frustration in that I asked a parliamentary question on the number of children in care placed outside their local health office, LHO of origin.<\/p><p>I was told by Tusla that it does not have metrics on this, which was quite frustrating for a couple of reasons.  One is that our colleague, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, got those numbers for kids in foster care last year.  Another is that Tusla has that information.  We spent much time, money and effort getting the national childcare information system, NCCIS, right.  As someone who used to labour under the old social work information system, which was rubbish, this is an excellent IT system.  We took a long time to implement it because we meant to get it right.  This database is filled with numbers that can be anonymised and run off as reports and real, detailed research into the flow of children in care, impact indicators and assessments of quality interventions could be done.  For me, the markers in this are wrong.  What is Tusla is doing with this repository of data?  It could be powerful.<\/p><p> I have three more quick questions.  Is there a timeline for the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, BOBF, replacement?  I know it is due to end at the end of 2020.  I do not see anything in the legislative programme about work starting on a replacement.<\/p><p> Is the Minister happy in terms of Brexit and his Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020111200002#B00500","speaker":"1570","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>In fairness, it is the Estimate.

I take Deputy Costello's point and we will have a small piece in the Brexit omnibus Bill about the national childcare scheme and its application for British citizens living here post Brexit.  The Deputy raised this point with me previously and I will come back to him about it if that is okay.<\/p> <p>  At our last meeting, the Deputy raised the point about the indicators.  It is a fair point.  Obviously, it is not something we can change.  These are the figures and metrics that were used for 2019 and 2020.  Going forward, however, I am definitely open to looking at a wider set.  Much of that material is there.  I recently received from Tusla its annual review of the adequacy of childcare and family support services for 2019.  This is an overall statistical and progress-based analysis Tusla must provide to the Minister each year.  It has a nice little infographic setting out various metrics, including one the Deputy noted, which says 75% of 18- to 20-year-olds in receipt of aftercare services were in education or accredited training.  It breaks it down in those steps.  The Deputy is correct and that information is there.  Perhaps, part of what we need to do when we present these figures is to show the wider range of information on progress that has been made.<\/p> <p>  Another detail is that the number of cases requiring social workers, which this committee will have looked at closely in the last Oireachtas, is down significantly.  Some of this might concern the presentation of information but I take the Deputy's point on making sure the outcomes we look at are based on individual impacts and benefits for children and young people.  He is right and we are happy to engage further on what we measure and how we present that material.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the NCCIS.  It is a beneficial system and one we should use to its full potential.  It is still being developed and is substantially complete.  There is, however, still work to be done and some of the significant additional allocation to Tusla this year will go to continuing work on the development of the NCCIS.<\/p> <p>  I do not have a direct timeframe on when the successor strategy to BOBF will be ready but my Department is already beginning the process of work of replacing it.  As I said previously, we will look at it in the context of the issue of child poverty and setting ambitious figures on the reduction of child poverty.  We wanted to wait until the new equality section of the Department joined us and look at it in that context because there are synergies, particularly in areas such as direct provision and looking at some of the groups we address like LGBTI+ and the Traveller and Roma communities.  Having the equality section in my Department will bring about real synergies as regards how we tackle children and young people with particular vulnerabilities in the context of the successor strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020111200002#C00600","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I have a couple of comments and, perhaps, a couple of questions as I go along.  I am from Clondalkin which, as the Minister will be aware, has a big direct provision centre.  While we have advocated and pushed for years to move away from people not having their own door in the area, this still brings up fears within the community in the direct provision centre that because of this policy, they may be moved outside an area into which they have assimilated well.  They are involved in the local schools.  Some of the residents work and are involved in local clubs, including my own local club in Clondalkin.<\/p> <p>  Is there any policy in this regard?  Is there anything to relieve those fears that if they move to an own-door direct provision centre, all efforts will be made to ensure they are kept within the area in which they are comfortable?  They have made a home for themselves and have assimilated well within the community in Clondalkin.<\/p> <p>  I wish to bring up another issue.  I am not sure if it falls into the Minister's remit but it crosses between justice, education and integration.  As the Minister mentioned, one of the biggest aids for people to assimilate and integrate when they first come into the country is to get young people into school as soon as possible.  We are coming up with a blockage.  I only became aware of this yesterday and sent off a couple of parliamentary questions regarding personal public service numbers, PPSN, for new people coming into the country.  There seems to be a delay in the Department giving out PPSNs.  Some of the schools say they are a mandatory requirement for them to process the school application.  It is a blockage.  Will the Minister bring that issue up with the relevant Minister or does he have an answer?  Is there any way we can make this process a little bit easier for people who are coming into the country?<\/p> <p>  I will raise an old issue about people who have gone through the process and received their stamp 4 permission but who are still in direct provision because of the lack of housing.  Will anything within these Estimates provide extra resources for people to move out of direct provision and into their own homes?<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the added pressures of Covid-19 in direct provision, especially around communal living, kitchen, laundry and play spaces and so on.  I thought I would mention that.<\/p> <p>  I will finish by picking up a point raised by Deputy Costello, which I have mentioned previously.  I have worked in care planning and have held managerial positions within the community, especially in the role of addiction when I worked with addiction services.  We were given care planning and logic models to fill out, which were all box-ticking exercises to prove the work we did was necessary in order to get the funding needed to keep the service going.  They ended up as box-ticking exercises.  To follow up on what Deputy Costello said, a care plan is needed and someone needs to be in charge of it.  Real and tangible outcomes are needed at the end of these care plans so they do not end up as just box-ticking exercises.  Those are just a few comments and statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020111200002#C00700","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  There are a couple of points.  Obviously, people are living in direct provision centres at the moment and some have been there for a long time.  We all recognise that is not right.  In living there for a long time, however, they have become involved in their local communities and we welcome that.  One of the goals of the new system is that people will not be waiting such a long time to have their application for international protection decided on.<\/p><p>People are living for maybe two, three, four or more years in direct provision while they are waiting on a decision.  One of the focuses will be that decisions will be made quickly and people will know definitively whether they have asylum here.  I hope we can speed up the process, and that by doing so those who have been living in places like Clondalkin for a long time will be able to get a decision as to whether they have asylum.  If they have asylum, they will have clarity, stability and security and be able to continue to build a new life for themselves in communities.  Obviously, many of them will be moving onto local authority housing lists.  <\/p><p> That ties into Deputy Ward's third question.  He is correct that approximately 800 people in direct provision who have status to remain have not been able to move out because of the wider housing crisis.  A number of points can be made on that issue.  We have been working individually with certain NGOs to support to the movement of people who are in such a situation out of direct provision and into independent living within the community.  De Paul and the McVerry Trust, in particular have been working on the issue with my Department and previously with the Department of Justice.  I wish to recognise the great work being done by those two NGOs.  There is provision in the Estimates for the continuation of that work.  My Department is doing a wider piece of work with local authorities and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to ensure that where people have status to remain, we are in a position to move them out and onto local authority housing lists.  That work is ongoing and I have spoken to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage about the issue.<\/p><p> I agree with the Deputy on the issue of care planning.  He will know that my Department and Tusla have to monitor what is being done on the ground.  There is a balance to strike between getting good, valuable data back from the social workers on the ground about their individual cases that we can feed up to see if our national policies are working with the need to avoid overburdening social workers and social care workers to an extent that they are taken away from front line work and end up just filling out forms.

On the wider issue of work-life balance, there are a number of initiatives that we are looking at, particularly in the context of work and gender.  As the committee is aware, in the previous D&aacute;il the gender pay gap legislation made significant progress, reached Report Stage.  However, when the new D&aacute;il reconvened, it was put back onto the Order Paper and the legislation was not allowed to fall or die, so it only remains for Report and Final Stages to be completed, and work is ongoing in my Department at the moment.  I hope that when I next come before the committee, I can give a more precise update on that.  There is not much work to be done on the Bill so I will push to get it over the line.  It will be significant legislation because it will mean that companies and agencies will have to give information on the gender pay gap among their employees.  That will shine a light on the public and private sectors as regards the differences in pay between male and female employees.  Once we have that information, policymakers can respond and moral pressure can be brought to bear to rectify the still very egregious gender pay gap that we see in large parts of society.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of parental leave, I am working on a memorandum on that today.  We will bring that memo to Cabinet soon.  It will increase the time that each parent of child can claim.  At the moment, each parent can claim two weeks' paid parental leave in addition to maternity leave, and it is paid at a rate of &euro;245 per week.  The legislation will increase that from two weeks' leave to five weeks' leave per parent, thus providing an additional three weeks' leave per parent.  Our goal is to get that measure through the Oireachtas and legislated for early next year, with a view to having it fully operational by April 2021.  We are talking with the Department of Social Protection to investigate the possibility of bringing it forward to March and have it fully operational at that stage.  I am hoping we can get the legislation through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  It is a fairly small Bill and we may have a situation where people can take this leave as soon as the legislation is passed, and maybe claim the payments back from the Department of Social Protection subsequently.  If we need to go that way, we will do so in order that people can be guaranteed the leave even earlier than March 2021.  I hope to bring a memorandum on that point to Cabinet very soon.  I am happy to keep Deputies updated on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2020111200002#D00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I will raise one or two points.

That meant that there was a saving, particularly in the ECCE scheme and the NCS over the course of the year where payments were not being made.  As the committee knows, we brought in the childcare wage subsidy scheme, the wage subsidy scheme and the employee wage subsidy scheme, in which a significant amount of money has been invested over the course of the year.  The vast majority of that was direct Exchequer funding.  As regards the initial allocation in my Department for childcare, a chunk of that was not spent between March and June 2020.  We are using some of those savings from this year to address some of the overspends in Tusla.  The reason is that there was a period of underspend when those schemes shut because of Covid.<\/p><p>As members will be aware, we put significant money into supporting childcare, particularly supporting workers through the wage subsidy schemes.  We will continue to do so until 31 March next year. <\/p><p> As the Chairman noted, we are making a very significant additional investment of &euro;61 million into Tusla next year.  I am currently working on the performance statement, which is a document the Minister sends to the agency every year outlining priorities for the coming year.  In the context of the performance statement, Tusla will outline how much it will spend on the various areas.  The Chairman may be asking about domestic violence services.  Providers in that area are eager to see increases similar to previous years and to ensure that the additional &euro;2 million allocated due to Covid-19 is maintained.  When I spoke to the chief executive of Tusla, Mr. Bernard Gloster, and the chairman, Mr. Pat Rabbitte, at the time of the budget I explicitly said that I wanted significant investment in sexual and gender-based violence services.  I do not have an explicit figure for the committee today but we should have clarity on the expenditure on various services in the next fortnight.  Because of the significant extra investment in Tusla, I have identified areas I want to see Tusla particularly prioritise in 2021 such as residential care and support for unaccompanied minors coming from Greece and other trouble spots.  There are lots of other things going on in the domestic violence sphere.

While this is a technical motion, in many ways it is a very important step because what it will effectively do is seek the start date for Ireland's second only technological university, and the first outside of Dublin.  It is a key priority in the programme for Government to create and progress technological universities.  I am very pleased, therefore, to introduce the following draft order to this committee, the Technological Universities Act 2018 (Section 36) (Appointed Day) Order 2020.  Under the Technological Universities 2018 Act, an appointed day for the establishment of a technological university and its name in both English and Irish, shall be made by order.  The order must be approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the matter today at this committee.<\/p> <p>  I wish to set 1 January 2021 as the appointed day for the establishment of a new technological university, to be known as the Munster Technological University.  The establishment of only the second technological university in the State, the first as I said, outside the capital, is another important milestone for higher education in Ireland and, in particular, for the south-west region.  The merging of the Institute of Technology Tralee and Cork Institute of Technology creates a new step-change institution of sufficient size, capacity and critical mass to maximise its potential and deliver significant additional benefits to the Munster region in particular, but not solely.  We have a very clear ambition to create a series of interlinked higher education institutions of greater capacity and reach across all regions of the country to help deliver on national strategic objectives.<\/p> <p>  We want to ensure that all our regions become vibrant powerhouses of skills creation, research and development potential and, crucially, to provide the components necessary to deliver that potential.  Technological universities, TUs, are a key component in this approach.  They provide increased reach, international recognition, greater research capacity, foreign direct investment, FDI, attraction, skills retention, regional development, enhanced staff and student experiences and advanced socio-economic progress as well.  Uniquely, TUs provide higher education programmes at all levels on the national framework of qualifications from apprenticeships right up to doctoral degrees.<\/p> <p>  From the turn of the year, the new Munster Technological University will start its journey and drive the agenda of higher education access, excellence in teaching and learning, regional development, research-informed educational provision, and strengthened linkages with industry in the region and the community.  The new TU will build on what is best in both of these prestigious institutes of technology, particularly in regard to sectoral strengths in apprenticeships and strong links with industry and employers.  As a unified and cohesive new entity, the Munster Technological University can expand beyond individual hinterlands and become a force to be reckoned with nationally and internationally.  This is a significant step forward and I look forward to having a chance to discuss it with members in more detail when we appear before this committee on technological universities.<\/p> <p>  I record my thanks to all of those who have been involved for many years in driving this agenda, in particular all the staff, students, the project group and the governing authorities and presidents of both the Institute of Technology Tralee and Cork Institute of Technology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111200002#A00300","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I welcome the bipartisan and significant support for the agenda of technological universities.  In and of itself, that sends an important message to all those across our country who are working on trying to get technological universities over the line.  A large amount of work goes into such a project.  It is not just about merging institutions and changing letterheads.  It is more profound than that.  It is about trying to create a powerhouse within one's region in terms of skills, linkages with industry and access to education, whereby someone does not have to trek somewhere else to attend a university.<\/p> <p>  A number of members asked about other technological universities.  TU Dublin was established on 1 January 2019.  It is now the largest higher education institution in the country with more than 28,000 students.  It published its first strategic plan in 2020.  The MTU will open its doors as a new entity on 1 January, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas of that designation date.  In an issue close to the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins' heart, Athlone IT and Limerick IT intend to make a joint application for technological university designation before the end of the year.  It will be an important step.  The Connacht-Ulster Alliance, which Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire asked about, will serve the north west and comprises Galway-Mayo IT, Letterkenny IT and IT Sligo.  It is working on its application, which it expects to submit by the end of this year.  The Chairman and Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh asked about the south east.  The Technological University for the South East, TUSE, consortium has delivered its project plan to me.  I intend to bring it to the Cabinet, probably this month but certainly before Christmas.  It will then be published.  The consortium expects to submit an application for designation to me next April or May.  That work is on track.  Regarding the multi-county campus, I assure the Chairman that my Department's commitment and that of the consortium to ensuring that there will be a Wexford site is clear.  This is not a university that will be owned by any one county.  Having a footprint in each of the counties of the south east is important.  Our commitment to Wexford remains in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire asked about staff.  This is an important issue, given that we are discussing a large workforce whose members have been working and doing a good job in different institutions.  From reading through my notes, there has been considerable engagement with unions, including the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, and the like.  I believe it was in April that the TUI requested the Department to progress a number of issues at national level with it, the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, and TU Dublin.<\/p><p>I understand there is a process targeted at a collective discussion of working through certain issues that arose in the initiation of the MTU consortium situation, but that will equally apply as we continue to roll out TUs.  I give an assurance that that engagement will continue.  On funding, in reply to Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh, I will circulate a table to the committee showing the breakdown regarding the funding being provided in Exchequer allocations to make these projects a reality.  Regarding the Technological University for the South-East Ireland, TUSEI, an allocation of &euro;5.1 million runs from 1 September this year until 31 August next year.  We also have the technological university transformation fund and I remain committed to ensuring that is fully harnessed.<\/p><p> Senator O'Loughlin asked a question about something close to my heart.  I had some good meetings with disability organisations since taking up this role.  It is fair to say that we are making good progress at primary level and second level, and then, frankly, we fall off a cliff.  During my time as Minister for Health, all the questions concerned what would be done for school leavers in respect of day care places, an important issue, but never about what they wanted to do in respect of further and higher education.  <\/p><p> I had a good meeting with the Trinity Centre for People with Intellectual Disabilities, TCPID, which does incredible work.  Why is that only in Trinity, however, and with ten places each year?  I would like to see that model, or something close to it, rolled out across other institutions.  I am meeting with a range of stakeholders on Monday in that regard, and I am happy to keep Senator O'Loughlin and the committee updated.  I think we are also going to have a detailed debate on technological universities in January and I look forward to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111200002#B01100","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111200002#C00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Messages to D\u00e1il and Seanad","time":1605139200,"counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111200002#C00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 101, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has completed its consideration of the following motion:  \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following Order in draft:  <blockquote> \tTechnological Universities Act 2018 (Section 36) (Appointed Day) Order 2020, <\/blockquote>a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 28th October, 2020.  <\/blockquote> <p>In accordance with Standing Order 75, the following message will be sent to the Seanad:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has completed its consideration of the following motion:  \tThat Seanad &Eacute;ireann approves the following Order in draft:  <blockquote> \tTechnological Universities Act 2018 (Section 36) (Appointed Day) Order 2020, <\/blockquote>a copy of which was laid before Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 28th October, 2020.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2020111200002#C00400","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1605139200,"counter":309,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 1.42 p.m. until 1.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 17 November 2020.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Select Committee on Education and Skills","time":1605139200,"counter":310},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Roghchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 11:30<\/p><p>The Select Committee met at 11:30<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Niall Collins (Minister of State at the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science), Rose Conway-Walsh, Alan Farrell, Norma Foley (Minister for Education), Simon Harris (Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science), Josepha Madigan (Minister of State at the Department of Education), Jim O'Callaghan, P\u00e1draig O'Sullivan, Marc \u00d3 Cathasaigh, Donnchadh \u00d3 Laoghaire, Aodh\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in.<\/p><p>Teachta \/ Deputy Paul Kehoe sa Chathaoir \/ in the Chair.<\/p>","time":1605139200,"counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2020<br \/>Vote 26 - Education and Skills (Further Revised)","time":1605139200,"counter":313,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002#A00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":314,"content":"<p>The Minister and Minister of State as <i>ex officio<\/i>members of the select committee shall, for the purposes of dealing with the Estimates, be counted for the quorum.

As the Chairman outlined, I am accompanied by the Minister of State, Deputy Josepha Madigan, who has responsibility for special education and inclusion, and officials from my Department.  I am conscious that I have only five minutes to deliver my opening statement.  I will, therefore, give a very brief overview of the Further Revised Estimates for my Department for 2020.<\/p> <p>  The Further Revised Estimates for 2020 reflect three matters in particular.  They provide for the restructuring of Vote 26 to move subheads and related funding to the new Vote for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  They also include substantial additional funding to meet costs associated with the reopening of schools and sustaining teaching and learning as part of the Covid-19 response.  They also include a provision to meet other expenditure pressures on the Vote.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimates for the entirety of Vote 26 were approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 16 July last.  Since then, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has been established and a range of statutory functions transferred to it from what was the Department of Education and Skills.  As part of the Revised Estimates process, a new Vote is being created for the new Department - Vote 45.  In simple terms, two of the three programmes which comprised Vote 26, namely, programme B, skills Development, and programme C, higher education, are being transferred out of Vote 26 with a total of &euro;2.332 billion in funds being transferred to the Vote of the new Department.  Some functions remain to be transferred to the new Department and, therefore, some funding is being retained in Vote 26 for 2020 pending finalisation of that transfer.  These will be reflected in the 2021 allocations.<\/p> <p>  The Further Revised Estimate for Vote 26 before the committee comprises several elements.  The original allocation of &euro;8.237 billion was to meet the various requirements of the Department in the areas of first level, second level and early years education, including a significant capital allocation of &euro;745 million to support the school building programme.  An additional allocation of &euro;331 million, including an additional capital allocation of &euro;180 million, is to support and sustain the reopening of our schools in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.  A net additional allocation of &euro;142 million is to meet additional costs in areas such as payroll, pensions and temporary school accommodation.  This additional allocation requirement has been offset somewhat by savings arising from the cancellation of the State examinations in 2020.<\/p> <p>  A high level of uncertainty remains over the level of funding required for the remainder of 2020 due to unpredictability, as Deputies will appreciate, of the ongoing health crisis and the impacts it has on the running of our schools.  Therefore, a prudent approach has been taken in estimating the 2020 additional allocations to ensure sufficient financial supports are available for schools, if required.  It is important to note in this context that any unspent contingency funding will be surrendered back to the Exchequer after the year end in the normal manner as part of the annual Estimates process.<\/p> <p>  These Estimates were drawn up in late 2019 as part of the 2020 budget process.  Much has changed since then.  A significant proportion of remaining Vote 26 funds are expended on gross pay and pensions, with sums of almost &euro;6.6 billion included in the Vote for these purposes.  This represented some 81% of the expenditure allocation.  Some 89,000 public servants and 42,000 public servant pensioners are paid out of these funds.  Other significant expenditure areas include capital infrastructure, grants to State agencies, school transport and capitation grants to schools.  The additional allocation in 2020 was aimed at delivering a range of measures in the education system that I outlined as part of the approval of the original 2020 Revised Estimates in July.  Given the time constraints, I do not propose to go through the specific measures.  I will, however, address the issue of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  We are all well aware of the impact that Covid has had on our schools, especially students.  To say it has been a challenging time for all concerned would be an understatement.  I express again my gratitude to all involved in ensuring the safe and sustained reopening of our schools.  As members will be aware, the Government in late July approved a funding package of &euro;437 million as part of the roadmap for the full reopening of schools.  Funding was made available to sustain school reopening and for the replacement of teachers and non-teaching staff unable to attend work due to Covid-19, additional release days for principals and deputy principals and enhanced cleaning regimes and personal protective equipment, PPE, in the current school year.<\/p><p>Funding was also included for the continuation of additional educational psychological services to provide for well-being supports for students and additional Covid-19 supports for the transport of pupils in the school transport scheme.<\/p><p> Some &euro;211 million of the package is included in the 2020 Estimates, with the balance being included in the 2021 Estimates, as announced on budget day.  Members will recall that it was necessary to implement current public health recommendations for reduced capacity on school transport for post-primary students.  These recommendations have led to further additional costs, and an allocation of &euro;15 million is now included in 2020 for this purpose.  <\/p><p> I am particularly pleased that a significant additional capital allocation was provided for as part of the Covid response.  A &euro;75 million allocation was provided for as part of the July stimulus package to assist with the reopening of schools.  It is part of the initial financial supports included in the roadmap for the full reopening of schools.  An additional &euro;105 million of capital has now been allocated.  This &euro;105 million in additional funding consists of &euro;80 million in capital funding announced in budget 2021 as an additional allocation for expenditure in 2020, and now a further &euro;25 million has been allocated for 2020 to provide further financial assistance in sustaining the operation of post-primary schools.<\/p><p> This additional &euro;105 million will facilitate the bringing forward of the ICT grant and minor works grant to primary schools, planned for 2021, and the delivery of projects.  It will also allow for an exceptional minor works grant payment to post-primary schools.<\/p><p> Early payment of the ICT grant is particularly important in the context of supporting schools during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The &euro;50 million in funding can be prioritised to ensure all schools are in a position to support remote learning should it be necessary for a class or group to isolate for a limited period.<\/p><p> The minor works grant funding of &euro;30 million allocated for primary schools and an exceptional minor works grant payment of &euro;25 million for post-primary schools provides good flexibility at local level to assist schools managing in the Covid environment and to put more sustainable arrangements in place.  The payment of the grants at this stage gives schools a good lead-in period to plan and undertake works that support the operation of the school in the current school year and assist in catering for requirements going into the 2021-22 school year.  The minor works grant will be paid automatically to schools in the free scheme and on an application basis to fee-charging schools on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p> I trust that this overview is of assistance to the committee.  I am happy to discuss these issues in more detail, and I commend the further Revised Estimate to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002#A00600","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and Minister of State for attending.  I am not sure Ministers would be happy giving up part of their budgets under normal circumstances but, under the current circumstances, we probably welcome it.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of queries on additional budgets, particularly in respect of the Minister's reference to additional release days for principals and deputy principals, among others.  One concern that has been expressed to me on numerous occasions relates to the amount of support available to principals in the current circumstances, particularly with enhanced cleaning arrangements and the amount of time that must be spent in this regard as opposed to the day-to-day running of their schools.  While the release days are welcome, of course, there are not enough hours in the day.  I wonder about the merit of additional posts of responsibility, perhaps even on a short-term basis.  Might the Minister have a comment on that?  My point also applies to teaching principals, although they are limited in number.  This might also be worthy of comment, however.<\/p> <p>  I have a query on the capital budget for this year.  I appreciate entirely that fair portions of the capital plans being implemented around the country have been affected significantly by Covid but I wonder whether the committee could be made aware of the budgetary allocation versus that which will not be spent in the current year and the projections for the completion of projects.  That is probably quite a broad discussion that we could and should have at a meeting of this committee but if the Minister had any comments on it now, they would be helpful.<\/p> <p>  My final query is on special education.  I obviously welcome the new model for the allocation of special needs assistants, SNAs, in particular, and resource hours.  Has any formal study been completed in the Department on the number of hours lost to students with additional needs?  Are there plans within the Department to address this in some form, be it in the current academic year or as part of a rolling plan for additional supports for the affected students?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002#B00200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>On the capital projects, almost &euro;800 million is available.

It was vital that we ensured immediate replacement of SNAs.  The funding also applies to cleaners, secretaries and caretakers but SNAs do play a pivotal role.  We have been very conscious in the Department that we have increased the number of SNAs incrementally over the years.  Since 2011, there has been a 78% increase, which goes to show our recognition of SNAs.  We have also provided a new SNA training programme, which has just been launched in UCD.<\/p> <p>  With regard to a formal study, the Department continually looks at its data.

I acknowledge that there were good points in the budget, particularly on special education.  However, as I have only four minutes, I will focus on some of the areas about which I have concerns, two in particular.<\/p> <p>  The first area concerns capitation.  I am aware that there was an increase but it primarily related to the allocation at the start of the year to get schools open.  I am speaking to representatives of many schools who are very worried about their financial position, for several reasons.  First, the refuse costs of some schools have increased by a four-figure sum.  Second, given the desire to have some sort of ventilation, the schools' heating costs are going through the roof.  Third, schools are very reliant financially on the voluntary organisations, community organisations, music teachers and so who hire rooms in their buildings.  This income has collapsed.  Many schools are very worried about what their financial position will be at the end of the year.  If there has not been a need for further capitation increases in this school year, there will be.  I want the Minister to respond to that.<\/p> <p>  On a related matter, I saw the tweet of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, yesterday.  I welcome it but it is not acceptable that, according to F&oacute;rsa, one in five SNAs is not being provided with medical-grade face masks.  If there is an issue with funding or any other such matter, will it be resolved?  Can we ensure that all SNAs will have access to medical-grade face masks?  SNAs cannot social-distance so medical-grade face masks are essential.<\/p> <p>  The pupil-teacher ratio was reduced.  It was reduced in urban senior schools in band 1 of Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS.<\/p><p>This meant that the majority of band 1 DEIS schools did not benefit.  Whether that was an oversight or a deliberate decision, it is unacceptable and must be reversed.  I am aware of one DEIS school in Cork city, although not in my constituency, where, because of a combination of a suppressed post due to falling numbers and the failure to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio, the school has had to combine two classes and there are now well over 30 in that class.  That is not acceptable.  Some of the most disadvantaged schools and children in the State missed out on the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio and I call on the Minister to reverse that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002#B00600","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  With regard to the provisions that have been made available to schools this year, we are talking of a package in excess of &euro;437 million, which supports four to six hours of daily additional cleaning within the schools and the purchase of PPE and hand sanitisers.  All of that is covered in the allocation and, indeed, there is a balance of &euro;226 million which will be paid to the schools for the remainder of the academic year, from January next to June.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of urban band 1 DEIS schools.  With regard to the general pupil-teacher ratio, it has been universally welcomed that there has been a reduction of one point from 26:1 to 25:1 and, equally, there has been a reduction of three points in the enrolment requirement for the retention of a teacher.  A very benign attitude was taken this year in particular, given the situation with Covid, in terms of those schools that are in a position to hold onto a teacher this year where they might have fallen short of the number of pupils, and the greatest flexibility possible was applied.  The Deputy is correct that for urban band 1 DEIS schools, the reduction was from 24:1 to 23:1.  There is, of course, the other provision in the junior aspect, where there is a ratio of 20:1 and it is 22:1 ratio in the vertical schools.<\/p> <p>  There is a package of DEIS supports.

What it says is that, in the general course of events, a normal face mask will suffice, unless they are performing a task relating to intimate needs, for example, washing a child.  In that case, they should be provided with medical grade face masks.  In every other circumstance, we follow the public health advice.  It is very clear in the guidelines that were sent to all schools on 9 October that, other than for performing intimate needs, a normal face mask is sufficient.

Within the school building programme, there is obviously scope to provide special educational needs, SEN, classes, which we do.  It is worth noting that, in 2011, there were only 548 special classes whereas, for the year 2019-20, there are a total of 1,618 special classes.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of the fact autism in particular is growing in prevalence, not just in Ireland but internationally.  It is something we are looking at.  I know the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has a forecasting model and a five-year plan so we can ensure every child who has special needs will obtain access to a class.  As the Minister indicated, there are approximately 200 school building projects which will deliver some 116 new SEN rooms across the country.  It is an issue we are extremely aware of.  There are many different reasons for the increase in autism, which we can talk about at another time.  Suffice to say, the building unit has confirmed to me that every new school built in the future will automatically provide those SEN units, which will alleviate the need to look for places in the future.  We will try to work in a collaborative way to ensure existing schools can open up classes and, if not, we will look to opening up new schools or to expanding the existing schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002#C00800","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the Minister of State.  I acknowledge the unprecedented situation in which they have found themselves in the early months of their tenure and I acknowledge the great work that has been done.  I was the deputy chairman of the education and training board, ETB, in Cork for five years and still keep in touch with a number of principals.  To be fair, it is universally acknowledged that great efforts have been made to keep our schools open.  I was just reading the international news this morning and the number of countries across the world that have been forced to close schools in the past couple of weeks is massive.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister and Minister of State on the job they and the Department have done up to now.  I welcome again the comments on the capital funding budget where there has been a massive increase of almost 12%.  There are a number of schools in my locality, which is a growing suburban area, where there is a lot of house building.  The fact that increased budget is there is extremely welcome for areas such as Carrignavar to the north of Cork, which will hopefully benefit from that in the future.  I think the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was on a call yesterday with a number of principals in Cork on the provision for special needs education.  I want to flag that Cork is lagging behind.  I welcome her comments about the building of ASD units being mandatory.  That is a welcome position to take because Cork has one of the greatest deficits in terms of provision for that sector.<\/p><p> Previous speakers touched on school transport.  I plagued Ministers over the summer months on this issue.  While I welcome that additional funding, which is due primarily to Covid, going forward a review must take place.  Previous Ministers have given that commitment but, unfortunately, they were not in a position to follow that through as they are no longer here but I hope and urge that the review take place.  School transport is not fit for purpose and many rural areas in particular suffer because of that.  I urge that this be taken into consideration.

I will be brief so as not to take time from members.  I am very grateful for the opportunity to address the committee, along with my ministerial colleague, Deputy Niall Collins, as part of its consideration of my Department's Further Revised Estimate for 2020.  This is the first time we have had Vote 45 constituted; it is a new Vote for a new Department.  I propose to give a very brief overview of the Estimate and address any questions.<\/p> <p>  This Further Revised Estimate includes two main components.  The first involves moving money that was in the Department of Education and Skills to my Department.  This comprises two expenditure programmes that transferred from Vote 26, namely those for skills development and for higher education.  The D&aacute;il previously voted on these elements on 16 July 2020.  On 21 October, these relevant functions were transferred from the Department of Education to my Department.  Therefore, element one is a straightforward transfer of the funding to go with the functions from the Department of Education to the new Department.  The second part of the Revised Estimate is additional funding that has been included in this Estimate to meet the Covid-related expenditure incurred by the Department, which was approved by the Government and announced earlier in the year, as well as certain other expenditure.  <\/p> <p>  I should say that there will be further transfers of functions into my Department but what we are looking today is the Vote that has transferred from the Department of Education.  The primary additional functions to come relate to research and will transfer from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  These include the research area, Science Foundation Ireland and so on.  The work to underpin these transfers is well advanced and I expect that in terms of funding, this will be reflected in the Revised Estimates for 2021.<\/p><p>The further Revised Estimate for Vote 45 that is now before the committee provides for a net allocation of &euro;2.402 billion.  This represents a gross allocation of &euro;2.506 billion reduced by appropriations-in-aid of some &euro;103 million.  This allocation includes the original gross allocation transferred from Vote 26, which I have gone through already.  It also includes an additional &euro;150 million allocated to provide for Covid-related expenditure, and this funding provides for support for institutions, students and researchers.  It also includes an additional &euro;23 million for 2020, allocated to the Department at budget time, which is reflected in the Estimate.  This will support an additional capital grant of &euro;15 million to higher education institutions, which is, effectively, a minor works scheme for higher education institutions, as well as &euro;8 million for a new initiative managed by SOLAS.  It is a new educational disadvantage fund for the further education and training sector.  It is the first time we have had a ring-fenced fund for this and we need to make it a permanent part of the landscape.<\/p><p> At budget time, I also announced a once-off &euro;50 million fund to support students in the context of Covid.  I will be bringing proposals to Government next week on how we intend to distribute this fund.  I believe we will have statements on third level education in the D&aacute;il next Thursday and there will be an opportunity for me to seek Government approval on Tuesday and debate it and any other matter in the D&aacute;il next Thursday.

We all really appreciate how promptly the Department responded with additional spaces, particularly after the calculated grades issue was identified and rectified.  The Department certainly responded promptly.  Next year, we will potentially have another problem brewing because of the additional numbers that had to be created in this academic year.  Is there a commitment to make sure these places are available next year?

The impact on regional development could be very significant.  The Deputy referenced the south east of our country.  It has no universities.  In the north west of the map of Ireland, forget about partition and politics, there is a big gaping hole, whether people are in Derry or Letterkenny, and there is a huge amount of work to be done there.<\/p> <p>  Specifically on the question about additional places, the Deputy is right to be looking ahead to the next leaving certificate.  I am pleased we received funding in budget 2021 to retain, effectively, all of the additional places we put into the system this year.  It was not a once-off blip or inflation of places.  We have banked these places, which is important.  A total of &euro;18 million has also being provided in budget 2021 to deliver an additional 2,700 new undergraduate places from next September to address demographic growth pressures.  This equates to an overall investment of almost &euro;80 million since 2018 for extra places in higher education.<\/p> <p>  This year was an horrific year for students, but I hope one of the good things to come out of it will be significant investment in expanding higher education places.  It would be very useful for the committee to hear from ourselves and the Department of Education on how we are planning and preparing, and I have no doubt it will do so.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire previously questioned me on how we are preparing for the leaving certificate in 2021.  From the Department's point of view, making the additional places for this year a permanent feature and putting in extra places for demographic pressures is a large part of the role we are trying to play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002#G00300","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and Minister of State for coming before the committee and I commend them on the announcement from the Department earlier in the week on trying to encourage on-campus activity.

I am very worried, as I know he is, about the mental health and well-being of our students.  I am also worried about the dropout rate.  This is why I made the comments that I did.  Our colleges have been great and they have followed public health advice.  They have stepped up to the plate and acted in a co-ordinated manner.  They have linked with us.  This afternoon, I am meeting the representative bodies of the universities and institutes of technology and next week the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, and I will meet the presidents of our universities.<\/p> <p>  We have to follow public health advice and there will be no deviation from this.  Safety for staff and safety for students will come first.  If, God willing, this country gets back to level 3 because of the work people are putting in now with regard to the sacrifices people are making, it does have to mean more activity on campus than it would at level 5.  That is logical.  Today, the libraries are open and this is an important message.  The libraries are still open and people can book them and use them.  Not everyone has a safe place to learn at home.  Practicals are ongoing, as is research.  There is also an ability for universities to bring in small groups of students, such as vulnerable learners and people they are worried about.  I would like to see a focus on first year students and, perhaps, final year students.  I do not think I will be able to be prescriptive and say every institution must do this, because they come in all different shapes and sizes, but I do not think it is unreasonable, in return for the massive investment we are making in our university sector to help it with Covid, to say that in return we want to see an expansion of the on-site campus, subject to it being in line with public health advice.  We will be able to bottom this out one way or the other in the next fortnight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002#G00500","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002#G00600","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  The first year student in my house will be pleased with that.  With regard to the transfer of the functions and funding, when will it happen?  I know the Minister has said it will be reflected in the 2021 figures with regard to enterprise, trade and employment.  Was is easier to make the transfer from education?  Are there blockages?  Perhaps the Minister will speak about this.<\/p> <p>  Subhead B11 indicates that student support and related expenses amounted to &euro;19 million, which was a decrease of 5% in 2020 compared with 2019.  Is this an accurate figure?  Why did this happen?  What caused this reduction?  As part of the 2021 budget announcement, the Minister earmarked &euro;20 million in additional funding for the anticipated increase in SUSI eligible applicants.  Is it the case that, even with the effects of Covid, we are only anticipating the need for the same level of funding as 2019?  I am trying to get a grip on whether we really have more money or do we just have more announcements now that we have a specific Department.  When we account for scheduled increases, such as pay and the high level of student numbers due to the demographic changes, what is the level of increase per student in further and higher education between 2019 and 2020?  The Minister answered my question on the hardship fund and I look forward to seeing the outrun of this on Thursday.<\/p> <p>  Subheads B12 and B16 cover research and infrastructure.  The Minister stated the research fund has not all been transferred over.  We see a decrease in that the figure for research is 13% less.  I take it this will be made up.  Infrastructure is &euro;6 million, or 7%, less than in 2019.

I will circulate a copy of that to the committee through the clerk at the end of this meeting.<\/p> <p>  On the transfer of functions question, I am being blunt and honest, but it was easier to do it from education to further and higher education because there was a very clear demarcation.  We were basically lifting anything that did not involve going to primary or secondary school and moving it to the new Department.  With the new Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, it took a bit longer to work out what should be retained, for example, with Enterprise Ireland, versus what should come to the new Department.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will bring the memo to Government this month to transfer those functions, and then the budget will be transferred with the agreement of this committee, early in the new year.  Therefore there is no difficulty or blockage.  The principal area for which we will be receiving responsibility is Science Foundation Ireland and, in addition to that, the responsibilities for research policy and innovation 2020.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the figure per student, it is an important figure, and I will get it to the Deputy because I do not have it.  The point made by the Deputy on infrastructure is a fair one, and it is one of the reasons, when I got the chance to get some one-off money on budget day for 2020, we decided to favour capital investment.  There is &euro;15 million extra going out to the higher education institutes now for capital work schemes.<\/p> <p>  Subheading B12 relates to a technical adjustment.  In fairness to every colleague here and myself, some of these tables are a little bit difficult, because some parts are remaining under the Department of Education and some parts are coming to my Department, so sometimes the minus figure can be a reflection of that.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of student support, I was asking the very same question.  It just so happens that in terms of the demand for SUSI, we have not seen the level of increase that we expected to see, probably because we were in a good place economically at the start of 2020 in terms of people's employment.  However, we expect that figure to rise in 2021, and that is why we have set aside an additional &euro;20 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002#H00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to respond to the Deputy through the committee clerk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002#H00300","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I have already raised this issue with the Minister, but I am going to raise it again to keep it on the agenda.  It concerns the funding of software costs.  I know that significant funding has been allocated at third level in the area of hardware to try to close the digital divide and allow people participate in an off-campus way, but we need to keep an eye on the software issue because there are some packages that are still not funded, as I understand it.<\/p> <p>  The second issue I wish to raise is on the percentage of the labour force in the national qualification framework levels.  The numbers of people remaining at levels 1 to 3 remains stubbornly high at 18%, and it shows that one of the areas in which we do not well in education this country is lifelong learning.  I would like the Minister to comment on that issue and whether funding is being allocated to tackle it specifically.<\/p> <p>  The third issue relates to equality budgeting.  The Minister's Department was involved in a pilot scheme, and we have already seen great success in this area.  The number of women involved in apprenticeships jumped from 145 in 2017 to 622 in 2019, which is excellent progress.  We saw similar results in the film industry where there was another pilot programme run by the Department of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  Is equality budgeting going anywhere, however, and have the successes been fed back to the Department of Finance or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002#H00400","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>On the issue of software costs, I must have a separate conversation with the Deputy, because he clearly has a concern in respect of some examples and I am very happy to take them up.  As a Department we engage very regularly with the Irish Universities Association, the Technological Higher Education Association and directly with the institutions, so if there are specific programmes, I would be happy to look into them.<\/p> <p>  The issue of lifelong learning is a key issue.  Most of the questions I am asked are about universities, as though I am the minister for universities, but one of the big priorities for my Department has to be that of lifelong learning, the fact that we still have a level of participation in lifelong learning that is below the OECD average, and that our adult literacy levels still mask the veneer that we like to promote in terms of our country being a knowledge-based economy.  That is why we are doing a few things to improve that.  The educational disadvantage fund of &euro;8 million that we have given to SOLAS for the first time ever is specifically about trying to engage with vulnerable learners, which is a bit of a catch-all term for those who might not otherwise be in a position to continue to interact with education in the community.  Today, as part of the dormant accounts funding, I have announced funding of &euro;600,000 for Travellers and Traveller education.  Yesterday I had a joint meeting with the Minister for Education about a Traveller education plan, which is a commitment in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p>  We also need to ask ourselves why people are not engaging in lifelong learning in Ireland in a way that they are in other countries.  I think there are two answers to that.  One, is perhaps the rigidity of our education system, the idea being that the system has not been that responsive to people dipping in and out of education.  Even when I have conversations with those in universities on this issue, there is this rigid idea that one goes and does a three- or four-year programme, but that does not work for everybody.  I think a modular system could be a big thing.  The second point is that, culturally in business, we need to change the attitude as well.  I addressed Skillnet Ireland yesterday, and we are funding businesses - quite a lot now, thankfully - to help them with skills and retraining.  However, we need to help employers - whether it requires Government help is a different day's work - so that it becomes a normal part of being in the workforce that a person can take time out to reskill and upskill, because we need that and we are not where we need to be on that.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of equality budgeting, I will come back to the Deputy with a proper note that perhaps I could send to the committee.  However, I do take his point, and wherever I look in my Department I do see huge issues of inequality, and the whole area of gender inequality is very pertinent.  As the Deputy said, we have made progress in respect of apprenticeships, but we still have a long way to go.  There is a degree of \"if you see it, you can be it\", to the issue.  For example, up until a few weeks ago we had never had a female president of a university in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002#H00500","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I welcome both Ministers to the committee.

It was initially announced in media circles that the funding was going to equate to &euro;250 per student.  Will he give the committee any indication if the funding will be per student or per head or will it be allocated on a needs basis with some type of assessment in that regard?  Will the funding be available to SUSI students only or will it be open to students who are studying in the UK, although they might be doing so from Ireland at the moment given the Covid restrictions?  I ask the Minister to give the committee an indication of whether there will be an assessment for the allocation of such funding.<\/p> <p>  If there is time, and I am happy for him to answer in writing, on a separate issue, there was an initiative for a &euro;3,000 incentive for employers to take on apprentices until the end of June or July.  I ask him to outline his plans for that kind of incentive going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002#H00600","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":376,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's final point first, I am really pleased with how the incentive scheme is going, and I will get the committee the latest figures.  However, the last time I checked, approximately 1,000 new apprentices had taken up that scheme, so it really has worked and I have received very good feedback from both apprentices and businesses who have availed of it.  It was due to run out in December 2020, but we made a decision in the budget to keep it going for the first six months of 2021.  My view is that if it is working, I would like to see the scheme as a permanent part of our landscape, but we have our apprenticeship action plan due to go to Cabinet by Christmas and that will try to tease out some of those issues.<\/p> <p>  On the &euro;50 million, what I can say and have said before is that there are two cohorts whom we are trying to assist.  First, there are those who are in receipt of the SUSI grant, and by virtue of the fact that they are in receipt of this grant, we recognise, as a State, that they need financial assistance.  The most obvious way to help them is with a once-off top-up to the SUSI grant, which I would like to happen in the majority of cases in advance of Christmas, if at all possible.  The second group is the many students who do not get the SUSI grant and who also have met additional financial costs this year.  I am looking at a way of supporting them, be it through a credit note, rebate or other option.  I need to tease those things through, but the direct answer to the Deputy's question is that it is not just a scheme for students in receipt of SUSI grants.  We aim to support all full-time students in higher education at undergraduate level, and I am also looking into whether we can also do something at postgraduate level.  We will have further details of that next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002#H00700","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank the Ministers.  As we are tight for time, I would like to raise two issues.<\/p><p>It is desirable and the objective is that where possible, students should be in publicly funded accommodation on campus or adjacent to campus.  The problem is that much of the accommodation provided by third level institutions is through arm's length companies, which have taken an enormous financial hit in recent times.  While students might have a contrary view, those companies often believe they need to increase rents.  Many of them are financially unsustainable.  Moreover, my understanding is that universities are at least discouraged, if not prohibited, from cross-funding these arm's length bodies.  That is already a problem and I suspect it could be a growing problem.  If these companies come under increasing pressure, rents could become increasingly higher putting them even further beyond the reach of students.<\/p><p> I have raised the issue of apprenticeships previously.  While some public bodies are good, many of them are not the best at taking on apprentices.  That needs to be looked at.  I particularly highlight local authorities.  Again, some are good, and some are not so good.  The same is true of universities and other third level institutions.  I was contacted by a tradesperson - I will not make him too identifiable - in one of the major universities.  He has been trying to get an apprenticeship programme running in that university for some years.  He has met resistance and would love to bring it on because the skills involved would be very particular and diverse.  That issue needs to be examined in public bodies, including universities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2020111200002#H00800","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I will comment on the student accommodation and will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, to comment on the apprenticeship issue.

I do not think it is robust enough and the State does not have enough levers to pull.  I am frequently asked about what I am going to do to support particular students.  I look at the legal options available to me and they are often not there.<\/p> <p>  I believe we need to devise a funding model that enables particularly our institutes of technology, now to be our technological universities, to build student accommodation.  Technological University Dublin, the largest higher education institution in the country, is unable to build student accommodation.  We will shortly discuss the Munster technological university in the Deputy's neck of the woods, which is in a similar situation.  We will continue to open technological universities.<\/p> <p>  While I am not the Minister for housing, this is a housing challenge as much as an education challenge.  Students are competing with families with two or three children for the same house.  I do not think the strategy between the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and my Department is adequate.  I will be working with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to come up with a better plan.  It must involve, as part of the building of technological universities, the building of purpose-built institution-owned student accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I would genuinely be interested in working with the Deputy and this committee on it.  I could say we are going to get all our colleges to give refunds to students who are in college-owned accommodation.  They largely do so when issues arise, but that does not affect most of the students.  I would be very happy to have a session on this with the committee and would welcome members' ideas.

Are people aware of that statistic?  Do they know what functional illiteracy means?  How we can grasp this issue as a country and drive it down?

That one in six of Irish adults are functionally illiterate should set alarm bells ringing.  I am greatly encouraged that the Minister has been to the forefront of raising the matter.  He is trying to find solutions and funding mechanisms to tackle it.  I ask the Minister to expand on that.  Along with other members of this committee I am determined to work with both the Ministers to achieve improvements in that area in the period of this Oireachtas.  Many people in all age ranges have that severely debilitating issue, which minimises their capacity to fully engage in Irish society.  It is truly crippling.

One of the reasons for people not knowing about it is the institutionalised stigma that exists.  We talk about destigmatising illiteracy and the likes, as we should, but we as leaders are not talking about it enough because we are rightly busy promoting our country as being a knowledge-based economy.  We ask companies to come and invest in Ireland because we have a great workforce.  While all that is true, it should not take away from the fact that a significant number of people are being locked out of economic and social inclusion.  The Deputy knows as well as I do about the intergenerational effect of it.<\/p> <p>  In the first instance I am determined to use the role I am honoured to hold to support initiatives.  For example, I recently spoke at a graduation ceremony in Portlaoise Prison for six students who had trained as literacy tutors.  Not only had they tackled their own literacy issues, they will now tutor other people in the prison.  I had a very good meeting with representatives of the Irish Prison Service and others about the intergenerational deprivation that often results in somebody ending up in prison.  Whatever about the person in prison today, how can we ensure we get to his or her children at home to provide them with the gift of educational literacy to break the cycle of deprivation?<\/p> <p>  Tomorrow the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, and others will launch the consultation for our adult literacy, numeracy and digital skills strategy.  I will send details of that to the Deputy.  Obviously, a literacy consultation needs to be inclusive.  It cannot just be sticking something up on a website, which would be utterly ironic.  We need work out how to take it on a Covid-safe roadshow to engage with all our communities and organisations.  I will be relying on and I know I will receive the Deputy's help and support in that regard.<\/p> <p>  SOLAS has about five or six months to come back with our literacy strategy.  That will be a big piece of work for it to deliver in 2021.  I am very encouraged by the group of people working across Departments on this.  They are passionate and committed, as is NALA.  Much of this is us talking about it and encouraging other people to talk about it and to know that people are not alone in having literacy issues.

It is a pleasure to meet with members of the current committee for the first time.<\/p> <p>  My Department has provided an information note on the issues that the Foreign Affairs Council has considered in the 13 months since I last met with the previous committee.  In the future, I would hope to meet with the committee at least every six months, or more if it so desires.<\/p> <p>  Given the large number of items on the Council agenda, I will address the major themes in my opening remarks.  I am happy to answer questions on any other foreign policy issues during the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to say at the outset how sad I was to learn of the death this week of Saeb Erekat, Secretary General of the PLO and chief Palestinian negotiator.  I met with Saeb on numerous occasions, in Palestine and in Dublin.  He devoted over 30 years of his life to the cause of peace between Palestine and Israel.  My sincere condolences go to his family and the Palestinian people.  The work that he was involved in for over 30 years will undoubtedly continue.  I spoke to him by phone in recent weeks before he was diagnosed with Covid.  He was as energetic, proactive and positive in trying to find ways of moving a peace process forward as ever.  He will be missed.  Many colleagues have made statements on this matter.<\/p> <p>  The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has left no corner of the globe untouched and the Council has addressed it frequently.  In the early months of the pandemic, we focused on co-ordinating consular assistance to EU citizens.  My Department assisted over 8,000 Irish citizens to return home safely from 126 countries.<\/p> <p>The Council also discussed how the EU could step up support for vulnerable countries.  A co-ordinated Team Europe response package has provided over &euro;35 billion to date.  Ireland has allocated over &euro;140 million to the global Covid-19 response in 2020 to date.<\/p> <p>  The wider Middle East region is an area of particular focus for the Council.  The Middle East peace process was the focus of a number of discussions in 2020.  Ireland played a leading role throughout the spring and summer in ensuring that the Council made clear that any annexation of territory by Israel in the West Bank would be unacceptable and a clear violation of international law.  We also emphasised the EU&rsquo;s continued commitment to a two-state solution based on internationally agreed parameters.<\/p> <p>  The Council had a very good meeting with the new Israeli Foreign Minister, Gabi Ashkenazi, in August and will meet with the Palestinian Foreign Minister, Dr. Riad Malki, later this month.  While Prime Minister Netanyahu has announced that plans for annexation have been suspended in the context of the normalisation agreements with the UAE and Bahrain, I remain very concerned about Israel&rsquo;s actions in the occupied Palestinian territory.  The expansion of settlements and demolitions, even as recently as the last week, and seizures of Palestinian property have accelerated in 2020, despite Israel&rsquo;s commitments not to target homes during the Covid-19 pandemic.  I have been absolutely clear in my condemnation of these actions.<\/p> <p>  Lebanon is also facing complex challenges.  The situation there was increasingly fragile even before the August explosion.  My Department provided significant supplies of medical equipment immediately after the blast, with the support of the HSE and the Defence Forces, as well as disbursing emergency funding through Tr&oacute;caire.  The EU has been clear that the political leadership in Lebanon needs to urgently form a government which can enact real reform.<\/p><p>I am often asked about the connection between defence and foreign affairs.  This committee probably understands it well but the response to the explosion in Beirut was a very good example of the connection between the two.  I instantly got briefings through our contacts in UNIFIL on what was happening on the ground, what was needed and the security situation.  That allowed us to make foreign policy decisions on co-ordinating assistance and using defence infrastructure to get there quickly.  Ms Hyland was responsible for co-ordinating for the Department of Foreign Affairs, along with her counterpart in the Department of Defence, a political and practical response to what was needed on the ground using Defence Forces infrastructure and intelligence.  It was a really good example of the two Departments on the same policy platform working in tandem with each other very effectively.<br\/><br\/>The Council also regularly discussed Syria, responding to a succession of crises, including the intensification of conflict around Idlib in the spring.  EU member states halted arms exports to Turkey late last year in response to its unilateral military action in northern Syria.  We have consistently called for de-escalation, the protection of civilians and the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid, which is a big challenge.  We have also urged Syrian authorities to engage in a more serious way in UN-led efforts to find a political solution. <br\/><br\/>On Libya,<b><\/b>there are now some grounds for optimism, I am glad to say<b>. <\/b>We saw a permanent ceasefire agreement signed last month and political negotiations are now well under way.  The EU has effectively used the tool of sanctions to support this progress.  We have rewarded constructive engagement by easing sanctions against certain individuals but have expedited sanctions against those who defy the UN arms embargo.  Ireland supported the launch in March of Operation Irini, which is tasked with implementing the UN arms embargo.  Again, that was a political foreign policy decision but from a defence perspective, some of our defence personnel are based at Operation Irini headquarters, assisting with that operation and making an Irish contribution to it.<br\/><br\/>More broadly in the eastern Mediterranean,<b><\/b>Turkish provocations have continued, with Turkey conducting seismic surveys in Greek and Cypriot waters.  This is causing enormous tension within the EU and further afield.  Turkey must contribute to stability in the region, not engage in aggressive unilateral actions.  We hope that these issues can be resolved through dialogue.  If, however, Turkey continues to raise tensions, consideration of further restrictive measures will be on the table at future Foreign Affairs Council meetings. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The last year has seen momentous events in the EU&rsquo;s eastern neighbourhood.  The response of the Belarusian authorities towards peaceful protesters in recent months has been appalling and shocking.  Two rounds of sanctions against influential figures in Belarus have been adopted by the EU, including targeted sanctions on Mr. Alexander Lukashenko.  This has sent a firm message to Minsk.  Ireland will continue to call for human rights and media freedoms to be respected and for violence against peaceful protestors to stop.  It goes without saying that Ireland does not recognise the legitimacy of the last presidential election in Belarus.<br\/><br\/>In October, Ministers considered the current state of play in the EU&rsquo;s relationship with Russia which is very complex.  Meaningful engagement by Russia in the resolution of the conflict in Ukraine remains a key condition for any improvement in EU-Russia relations.  The Council also condemned the shocking use of chemical weapons in the attempted assassination of Mr. Alexei Navalny and agreed on the implementation of sanctions against a number of individuals who are believed to have been influential or responsible.  I also note the agreement for the cessation of hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh in recent days, which is very welcome.  All sides will now need to engage in constructive dialogue to ensure that a lasting resolution can be found.  The tensions and military activity involving Armenia and Azerbaijan were very worrying and we must try to ensure that the ceasefire holds.  Otherwise, we could see a war being waged right on the edge of Europe.<br\/><br\/>The Council held a strategic discussion on the EU&rsquo;s relationship with China in May.  We reviewed the commitments and deliverables of the 2019 EU-China summit and prepared for the September 2020 leaders&rsquo; meeting.  Progress has been made but much remains to be done, particularly on the comprehensive agreement on investment, sustainable development and industrial subsidies, as well as market access in the agri-food trade, financial services and digital sectors.  We need to engage positively with China in a number of areas, including on climate change and World Trade Organization reform, but we also need to tackle the unbalanced trade relationship and address human rights issues.  I remain deeply concerned about credible reports of arbitrary detention, widespread surveillance, forced labour, and forced sterilisations and birth control in Xinjiang.  We have raised these concerns on a number of occasions and will continue to do so.  <br\/><br\/>We have also expressed our clear concern about the adoption of a national security law in Hong Kong.  That law risks undermining Hong Kong&rsquo;s high degree of autonomy under the one country, two systems principle which we support.  The Council adopted conclusions on Hong Kong in July and set out a co-ordinated response, including on the issue of extradition agreements with Hong Kong.  On 13 October, the Government suspended Ireland&rsquo;s extradition agreement with Hong Kong, clearly signalling the depth of our concern.  We co-ordinated closely with Germany, Finland and the Netherlands, which have taken the same action. <br\/><br\/>I will say a few words about Ireland&rsquo;s upcoming term on the UN Security Council which is a hugely important opportunity for this country over the next two years.  We take up our seat on the council in just over six weeks.  The Security Council has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.  We ran for election because we believe we can make a real contribution to that work.  Three principles will underpin our approach, namely, building peace, strengthening conflict prevention, and ensuring accountability.  All three are areas in which Ireland has real credibility.  As the Chairman knows, having previously served as Minister for Foreign Affairs, these principles are at the heart of Irish foreign policy and have been thus for consecutive governments for many years.  <br\/><br\/>For Ireland, a key aspect of building peace is peacekeeping.  We will seek to improve peacekeeping mandates to make them fit for purpose and to strengthen the link between peacekeeping and peacebuilding.  We want to emphasise the importance of an inclusive approach, ensuring the involvement of women, young people and civil society.  On strengthening conflict prevention, we will address the underlying factors that contribute to conflict, notably human rights violations and climate change.  We want to strengthen the protection of civilians, including from conflict-related hunger.  To ensure accountability, we will seek to uphold international humanitarian and human rights law, and stand firmly in support of the International Criminal Court and the principles of the Rome Statute.  That is not always easy to do because there are many very powerful actors globally who do not co-operate with the International Criminal Court, some of whom are close friends of Ireland.  Nonetheless, it is important that Ireland stands up for that institution for all the right reasons, and we will do so.  We will also engage actively on country-specific issues.  We are identifying the specific areas on which we believe we can have most impact, including on the women peace and security agenda, on climate and security, in relation to Iran and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JPCOA, on sanctions policy and practice, and on humanitarian access in Syria which I mentioned earlier.  The last of these is of particular interest to my Department and to me.  <br\/><br\/>We have good relationships with the Security Council&rsquo;s permanent and elected members.  We do not agree on everything and we have no illusions about the challenges ahead.  I am consulting a wide range of my counterparts and we are doing the same at senior official level.  We will also draw from the extensive expertise available within Irish civil society and academia.  We have recently established a stakeholder forum, in partnership with the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA, to support us in planning for our Security Council term.  I look forward to keeping the Oireachtas informed of our work on the council.  My Department will provide regular updates to this committee and my officials will always be available to provide oral or written briefings.<\/p><p>Obviously, it is a matter for the committee but, if it wanted to, it might be useful when we have a formal decision on Ireland's responsibilities in chairing committees and holding the pen, as it is called, on certain policy areas and in certain initiatives, which we will certainly know before the end of the year, to have some intense focus in those committees on some of those agendas and the issues around them, on which Ireland can be influential as a source of change and progression.  I will not confirm anything today but I understand that Ireland will have some pretty weighty briefs on which we will be expected to either co-ordinate or offer leadership.  This committee will, I hope, find it very interesting in that context from the defence perspective with peacekeeping and preventing conflict, and from the foreign policy perspective in the other issues.<\/p><p> I thank the committee members for their engagement.  As ever, I look forward to their comments and questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020111200002#A00300","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that wide-ranging overview of the recent meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.

To start, I concur with the Minister's sentiments on Dr. Saeb Erekat, the general secretary of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation.  I expressed my condolences yesterday in the Chamber and I do so again.  Dr. Erekat was certainly instrumental in bringing forward peaceful solutions, in trying to address the serious issues facing the Palestinian people, and in driving forward prospects of a two-state solution.  I offer my condolences and those of my party to his family, to his colleagues in the PLO and in the Palestinian Embassy in Ireland, and to the Palestinian people.<\/p><p>On the issue of the Middle East one certainly would not be surprised with the approach.  The UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory, Michael Lynk, has said:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \tNo country creates civilian settlements in occupied territory unless it has annexationist designs in mind, which is why the international community has designated the practice of settler-implantation as a war crime.  The political purpose of the Israeli settlement enterprise has always been to establish sovereign facts-on-the-ground and to obstruct Palestinian self-determination.  <\/blockquote> <p>Mr. Lynk also said that, &quot;While Israel may have shelved its plans for the<i>de jure<\/i>annexation of the settlements in August, it is continuing with its <i>de facto<\/i>annexation of the Palestinian territory through this unrelenting settlement growth.&quot;<\/p><p>Up to 2017 there were 620,000 Israeli citizens residing illegally in approximately 200 illegal settlements in Palestine, in the West Bank.  I welcome the Minister's comments criticising plans to expand the illegal settlements.  Approval was given for an additional 5,000 units.  We also see illegal measures being carried out by Israel.  Only last week we saw 70 structures illegally demolished in the northern Jordan Valley.  I put it to the Minister that annexation, as they call it, not only remains on the table, is actually happening as we speak.  My words and the words of the UN special rapporteur graphically highlight that.<\/p><p>While I welcome the Minister's comments, words come easily and without action they exist in a vacuum.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, was one of 11 European Union leaders to sign a letter in May asking what measures could be taken at EU level if the annexation did go ahead.  We know that <i>de facto<\/i>annexation is happening but does the Minister agree it is happening as we speak?<\/p><p>What measures were outlined in response to the Minister and the other EU foreign affairs ministers that could be taken, and which I believe should be taken immediately, to deal with the aggression being carried out by the Israeli state?  What measures were outlined in response?<\/p><p>The silence from the Irish Government has been deafening with regard to taking real actions and real measures.  I am at a loss, as are many people, as to what is the strategy of the Irish Government and of Europe to deal with the illegal actions carried out by the Israeli state.  Will the Minister outline some of the responses?<\/p><p>Some of the actions that have been taken by the Government have included the shelving of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018.  The Government has also ignored the express will of the last D&aacute;il when it passed unanimously the motion that the Government should officially recognise the state of Palestine.  These measures should be taken immediately.  I ask the Minister to outline the Government's strategy and approach, and the EU strategy.<\/p><p>Sanctions are imposed on Russia because of the annexation in Crimea.  We have seen sanctions imposed on Belarus, and rightly so.  We see sanctions imposed very quickly in other areas but there seems to be a kick-love approach to Israel.  I am at a loss, and more importantly, the Palestinian people are at a loss, as to why that softly softly approach is taken.  I would appreciate the Minister addressing those points.<\/p><p>What are the Minister's views, and those of the Council, on the situation in Syria and the penalising of ordinary Syrian civilians?  The placing of measures, sanctions and embargoes is having a dire impact on ordinary Syrian civilians.  We have seen the illegal occupation of eastern Syria by the Americans and the US President, Donald Trump, who is now on his way out of the White House, stated quite clearly that the US mission in Syria solely focused on protecting the oil fields.  Is that an approach the Minister and the Foreign Affairs Council would support?  While protecting the oil fields it is an illegal act, and also deprives the Syrian people of what is rightfully their natural resource.  Will the Minister comment on that also?<\/p><p>I will now turn to Turkey.  I welcome the ceasefire agreed between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.  The Minister mentioned both countries and the horrific war going on there in recent months, but he failed to mention Turkey's role in that, which is frightening and which needs to be highlighted more.  We had a briefing from representatives from Armenia and we invited representatives from Azerbaijan.  We also invited the Turkish Ambassador in to speak to us.  As far as I am aware we got nothing back in relation to that.  We know all the evidence there with regard to the illegal use of munitions, including cluster munitions, in civilian areas.<\/p><p>The Turkish involvement in the conflict should not be regarded in isolation.  We see the Turks trying to flex their muscles in places such as Libya, and we also see what is going on in the eastern Mediterranean.  Again, the silence from Europe has been deafening.  Potential sanctions of Turkey for its actions in the eastern Mediterranean have been shelved.  I would like the Minister's view on this.  The examination of the matter has been kicked to touch until December.  I would like the Minister to comment on President Erdoan's comments last week.  He said now is the time for a two-state solution in Cyprus.  We are aware that Turkey illegally occupied northern Cyprus.  Does the Minister agree with the Turkish approach?  It is absolutely scandalous that it should be put forward as a solution or proposal.<\/p><p> There was no comment on the developing major catastrophe in Ethiopia.  The conflict started over the past week or two.  I am aware that the area in question, the Tigray region, has been an area of potential conflict over many years.  Over 600,000 people in the area are affected and dependent on food relief.  It is an area of major concern.  I would like the Minister's views on it.  What measures are being examined to arrive at a peaceful solution?<\/p><p> My last point relates to the Irish position on the Security Council, particularly in the context of human rights.  We note what is happening to human rights defenders from Colombia to Saudi Arabia.  Even in India, we have heard about the imprisonment of Fr. Swamy for standing up for human rights.  The Minister outlined the three principles underlining our approach to the Security Council - peace building, strengthening conflict prevention, and ensuring accountability.  These need to be key components in protecting human rights defenders.  In Colombia, where there is supposed to be a peace process, human rights defenders are being shot down on the street.  Women in Saudi Arabia are being imprisoned.  People such as Fr. Swamy are being imprisoned in India.  It is very concerning.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would outline what approach will be taken by us when we take our position on the UN Security Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020111200002#C00300","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":405,"content":"<p>A number of important questions have been asked arising from what the Minister said.

I will go backwards with regard to his speech.  It is very exciting that we are taking a seat on the UN Security Council in the next few weeks.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will be keeping us informed, but because it is so soon and because the Minister will be attending only every six months, I suggest that he give us an ongoing rolling update on the work we are doing on the Council.  Perhaps it could be done through the clerk of the committee.  We are obviously all very interested but the public really wants to know what we are doing and how we are using our seat on this important national body.<\/p> <p>  The second matter I would like to raise concerns the Uyghur Muslims in China.  Has the Minister brought this matter to the attention of the Chinese representative?  What was the Chinese response when he raised this issue?  We are hearing about forced labour and forced internment.  These are very worrying.  We should ensure that we raise this matter with the Chinese representative in Ireland.  It is incumbent on us to do so.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's condemnation of actions in Palestine.  I met the Palestinian ambassador to Ireland, who gave me a clear outline of further accelerated occupation activity by the Israeli forces.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to raise the matter of the Israeli practice of administrative detention.  Conditions for detainees have worsened considerably due to the pandemic and visits have been suspended since March.   There is poor sanitation.  Prisoners' rights and children's rights are routinely violated with impunity by occupation forces.  Administrative detention is a practice by which Israeli authorities detain Palestinians, including minors, without charge or trial.  The detention period can be renewed every six months.  Administrative detention is in violation of international law, primarily the Fourth Geneva Convention.  Detainees do not get the opportunity to defend themselves in court.  The reasons for their detention are rarely revealed to them, or are provided in Hebrew only.  Some 30,000 detention orders have been issued in the past 30 years.  There are currently 340 Palestinians in administrative detention.  Over 120,000 Palestinians have been detained in the past 20 years, including 18,000 children.

As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have spent more time from a policy perspective on the Middle East peace process than on anything else outside of Brexit and EU affairs.  I have been to Palestine and Israel four times in two years as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We cannot travel at the moment because of Covid.  I have got to know those on both sides very well because I want Ireland to be a credible contributor to this debate internationally.  That is the way we get change.  Taking positions on our own in isolation because they may sound good or feel good in terms of the domestic audience is not necessarily the way to achieve change on the ground for Palestinians, or for Israelis for that matter.  The only objective that I have in terms of the Government's approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Middle East peace process more broadly is to try to find a way of contributing to the commencement of a process that can result in a two-state solution, in fair treatment of both sides and equality of esteem in terms of that process.  On many occasions I have been very publicly critical of the approach of Israel towards Palestinians in recent years, and the approach of some Israeli allies too, in terms of condoning certain actions.  I will continue to be critical in this regard.<\/p> <p>  If some had their way in Ireland, we would be expelling ambassadors every few months because we do not agree with something that is happening in a country in some part of the world.  In doing so, we would lose our contact with them then and relationships would break down.  From my experience of international affairs and foreign policy, the way one gets things done is to build relationships not break them.  Of course there are times when one needs to take a stand on principle, and we will not shy away from doing that, whether it is on the Security Council, in the UN more generally, or in the EU more generally.  Ireland has been right at the centre of the debates in the European Union on the Middle East peace process.  Over the summer, we were the ones, along with Luxembourg, who took the most proactive approach towards a very clear statement being made by the EU in terms of what the consequence of annexation would have been.  In my view, it was dialogue, proactive diplomacy and very clear messaging to the Israeli Government that contributed significantly to annexation not moving ahead.  If we had taken the advice of some others and gone out on our own to make a statement - I accept that this would have been seen as one of solidarity with many Palestinians - it would have meant that we would not have been taken as seriously as we are taken on the debate in the Middle East peace process within the European Union, which is ultimately what will bring change.<\/p> <p>  If Ireland wants to change the direction of global policy, we do that by first of all changing the direction of political discourse on particular issues within the European Union and that creates a real power and momentum for change.  In my view, that is how we bring about the change that all of us in this room want to see in the context of a Middle East peace process that can result in Palestinians have a peaceful state of their own, living side by side with a secure Israel.  I will continue to pursue that.  There is very clear language in the programme for Government in terms of Ireland wanting to recognise the state of Palestine in the context of a negotiated solution or before then if we believe that will protect Palestinian territories or advance the cause of peace.  There is very strong language on that.  I look forward to the day when I hope I will bring a proposal, which I am sure will have all-party support, on the recognition of a Palestinian state, but I would like that to be in the context of a two-state solution that has been negotiated so that then we can reinforce the new Palestinian state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020111200002#E00400","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":415,"content":"<p>There are more illegal settlements.

We would have no embassy in Israel.  We would have no channels of communication to try to influence decisions that could be good for Palestinians.  That is not the approach that I propose to take because I do not believe it will get the outcome we are seeking.  It may get a headline for a few days in Ireland, but it will achieve little more than that.<\/p> <p>  We will continue to be proactive on this agenda to try to work with both Israel and Palestine.  We will try to make sure that we use every opportunity, whether that is a change of US President or trying to change EU policy and attempting to get a more collective approach from the EU that can be more proactive, which is what we are working on all the time.<\/p> <p>  I do not think anybody could accuse me of not being direct, blunt and clear in my condemnation of expanding settlements in the West Bank.  I refer to my commentary on the potential for annexation over the summer, my commentary last week on demolitions, which were both illegal and disgraceful, and my commentary on the existence and expansion of settlements in the West Bank.  It is very clear.  In truth, no matter what I say on the Middle East peace process, it is simply not enough for some people.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill, I will not be part of a Government that does something illegal.  We have very clear advice on this.  Deputy Brady knows that but he chooses to ignore if, as it was not there.  In fact, many have tried to demonise the Attorney General, who gave very clear advice on the Bill.  I have simply followed the advice of an Attorney General on this issue, no more and no less than that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady and I agree on the outcome we want, but it is the approach on how we get there on which we disagree.  Unfortunately, because of that change in approach, some parties seem to paint me and my party as not being committed to this cause.  I completely reject that and my record shows it.<\/p> <p>  It is surprising that Deputy Brady would single out the US presence in Syria but not the presence of anybody else in terms of his criticism.  Many would be critical of the US for not being more present in Syria to try to protect civilian populations.<\/p><p>Sometimes, therefore, it seems that the United States cannot do anything right in some people's eyes.  Syria has been a humanitarian catastrophe.  When history books are written, the global community, the UN Security Council and many state actors will be judged very harshly regarding what has been allowed to happen to a country and a population in respect of death, destruction, forced migration and millions of refugees in neighbouring countries.  It is an absolute tragedy.<\/p><p> We must be a country that contributes to the debate about how we can be as constructive as possible in bringing about and protecting ceasefires where they exist and are under strain, and, of course, approach in a constructive way the political conversation, which is a difficult one, about how we begin the process of reconstruction in that country and continue to access vulnerable populations with essential internationally funded humanitarian aid, which is one of the things that has been a topic of important debate on the Security Council.  There is only one crossing point into Syria left for humanitarian aid.  It is really important for those of us advocating for it to remain open to make those arguments and build alliances and relationships that can ensure that is the case.  We will not get this done by scolding people in the international press, waving banners or organising protests.  The way to get powerful countries, superpowers in this case, to agree to an approach politically is by building relationships and winning arguments with them, and that is the approach we will try to take to protect civilian populations in Syria, some of which are in very vulnerable situations.<\/p><p> Turning to the issue of Turkey, we have been very worried about the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.  Turkey has played a role in that conflict, and so has Russia.  For whatever reason, Turkey has decided to take a much more aggressive foreign policy approach towards the eastern Mediterranean, including becoming involved in Libya as well as in the tensions and conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan and taking a much more aggressive approach towards drilling in Greek and Cypriot waters.  No matter what direction we look at it, there is the creation of tension coming from Turkey.  That is very worrying because Turkey is a NATO member state, and I know that we are not, it is causing major tensions with other NATO states, and it is on the edge of Europe and of the European Union.  In my view it needs to be and should be a partner of the European Union in a progressive way.  What we are seeing at the moment is a lot of tension, which is moving in the wrong direction rather than the right direction.<\/p><p> With reference to the term, \"the European Union silence is deafening\", I have been in meetings for hours with EU colleagues talking about Turkey and how we approach its aggressive foreign policy and interventionist approaches, whether the right approach is sanctions, because that is a very blunt tool, or whether it is engagement.  Again, often the easy answer when somebody is doing something wrong is to call for sanctions.  If that breaks down relationships, however, in a way that actually entrenches divisions, then it is not the most intelligent strategy to adopt.  In international politics, it is always a combination of engagement, of calling people out publicly, of having quiet diplomacy and, at times, having tough and hard sanctions too.  The assumption that if we sanction somebody, we will get what we want is something that time and again we are reminded does not always work.  The relationship between the EU and Turkey, therefore, is a very complicated one, but it is one that is under quite some strain at the moment.<\/p><p> There are interventions from Germany and France, in particular, in terms of intensive engagement, and from Cyprus and Greece, obviously, but from many others as well in trying to find a way of easing tensions but at the same time sending a clear signal to Turkey that the EU cannot ignore its actions, particularly deliberately targeting EU states.  That is complicated even more in respect of the arrangements and agreements we have regarding refugees and migration.  I know some people would be very critical of that aspect, but it is reality and it complicates the relationship even further.  I do not think, by the way, that it compromises the positions that the EU will take, but it certainly complicates things.  I think the Deputy and I are in agreement on many of the concerns regarding Turkey, and I hope to be able to visit that country, if it is possible to do it, before the end of the year to raise a number of these issues directly.  I have had direct phone calls with the Turkish foreign minister raising some of these issues as well.<\/p><p> Moving on to the subject of Ethiopia, this is a worry.  Let me refer to the official note because this is in many ways a developing crisis.  Ireland is deeply concerned by the outbreak of armed conflict between the federal Government of Ethiopia and the regional authorities in Tigray.  I visited that region when I was the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, because we have several funded projects there in agriculture and agricultural research and development.  The Ethiopian Government has declared a state of emergency in Tigray for six months and has ordered a military offensive.  There are reports of casualties, although it has not yet been possible to verify numbers.  If not contained, this conflict could threaten the stability of Ethiopia and have serious regional implications for the wider Horn of Africa.  I have urged all parties to cease hostilities, de-escalate tensions, demonstrate restraint and work for reconciliation.  Ireland has been working in Tigray for many years and there is an Irish Aid office there with two staff.  We are also aware of one Irish citizen in Tigray.<\/p><p> The EU is supporting regional efforts to engage with the parties, the UN Secretary General has also offered to support dialogue and our embassy in Addis Ababa is actively supporting these efforts.  Tigray is home to many refugees, displaced persons and local communities which have been significantly impacted by Covid-19, flooding and invasions of desert locusts.  Humanitarian issues, therefore, are central to Irish concerns as well.  I do not want to overstate Ireland's influence on some of these conflicts, but we will watch the situation and try to play as constructive a role as we can.  Ethiopia is a really important stabiliser for that part of Africa, given the countries that surround it.  For this tension and conflict to spiral out of control could be a worrying regional event, as well as one for Ethiopia.<\/p><p> I will be shorter with my answers from now on.  On human rights abuses and our role on the Security Council, accountability is our third big pillar.  That means we want people who are responsible for human rights abuses to be held to account and to be called out by the Security Council.  It should not be forgotten, however, that the use of the veto in the Security Council by the five permanent members has essentially prevented accountability in many cases, whether it has been the use of chemical weapons, human rights abuses in conflicts, the use of munitions in built-up populations and so on.  We will be, I hope, an independent and courageous voice within the UN Security Council for calling out international events and atrocities if and when they occur and doing everything we can to try to apply international law and Security Council resolutions to the people and countries responsible.  We live, however, in a world with so many conflicts that are ongoing and so many countries that perhaps do not apply the rules of international law as we would like them to that we are going to have to be selective and targeted in the areas where we really shine a light, I hope, so that we can be impactful in what we are trying to do.<\/p><p>As already stated, I am very happy to speak to colleagues and all parties about areas of concern on which we could have an impact when we are on the Security Council.<\/p><p> Senator Ardagh raised a few issues.  I will try to ensure that we provide a rolling update on the topical issues so she can call me in if she wants to try to get more detail or more proactivity.  I have raised the issue of Uyghur Muslims in China and I can outline our position on this.  Ireland remains deeply concerned about the credible reports regarding restrictions on freedom of religion and belief, arbitrary detention, widespread surveillance, forced labour and forced sterilisation and birth control in Xinjiang.  We supported an Opposition motion expressing real concern on this issue recently in the Seanad.  Ireland was one of 39 states to sign a joint statement at the UN Third Committee on 6 October.  We also raised this matter in our national statement to the UN Human Rights Council on 25 September.  We have consistently called on China to allow unrestricted access to the region for independent observers, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  We have also called on the latter to provide regular information about the situation to safeguard the rights and freedoms guaranteed under international law.  Ireland fully supports the EU position of raising this matter in its engagement with Chinese authorities and we will continue to raise our concerns bilaterally and at multilateral fora.<\/p><p> Our relationship with China is important.  It needs to be proactive and positive in many areas but it also needs to be honest in terms of calling out matters in respect of which we have real concerns.  We have tried to do this in a firm and respectful way.  If we are going to be effective in bringing about change in areas where we have concern, having a relationship that allows those conversations to take place in the first place is important, as opposed to reactions that break those relationships in a way that limits the capacity to bring about change.<\/p><p> In terms of my condemnation of actions and expanding settlements, I have referred to such settlements as effectively being a form of creeping annexation.  Formal annexation is something different.  Essentially, that is applying Israeli sovereignty to large tracts of land in the West Bank which, in my view, is completely illegal and totally unacceptable politically.  This is why we have fought very hard to prevent that happening.  Expanding existing settlements has a similar impact over time but is not the same as extending sovereignty legally to parts of the Palestinian territory because, effectively, they are seen as temporary settlements within occupied territory.  It is still illegal.<\/p><p> Senator Ardagh also inquired about administrative detention.  I have an note on Palestinian prisoners during the Covid crisis, which she might find interesting.  There are well-founded concerns about the treatment of Palestinian prisoners and Ireland has repeatedly recalled to Israel the applicability of international human rights standards.  I have also raised specific issues, including in respect of the detention of minors, during a visit to Israel.  There have been worries globally about the vulnerability of prisoners to Covid 19 and Irish missions in the region continue to monitor this situation closely.  I also wrote to my counterpart, the Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ashkenazi, about a prisoner who was previously on hunger strike and who had been on hunger strike for 100 days.  I expressed real concern about that case.  Subsequently, it has been addressed but not because of my letter I am sure.  The relationship is there that allowed me to send a pretty direct letter expressing concerns.  We will continue to watch this and I take the points raised.<\/p><p> Senator Craughwell also asked for a rolling audit.  With regard to Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia would not be a country that contributes peacekeeping troops very often, just as the US does not.  We are going to have to wait and see how this develops.  The important thing is that the military offensive has stopped.  A Russian-influenced ceasefire is holding for now and let us hope it can last.  I know it has created huge tension politically, particularly in Armenia, and there has been a great deal of unrest as a result of this.  This is a very delicate situation and Ireland needs to be very responsive in how we comment on it to ensure the ceasefire holds and we can move into the space of political dialogue again.<\/p><p> In terms of reopening an embassy in Teheran, the closing of our embassy there in 2012 was a decision based on the cuts to Government spending at the time.  We maintain open relationships with Iran on a range of issues and Iran continues to have an embassy here in Dublin I am glad to say.  The embassy of Ireland in Ankara is accredited on a non-residential basis to Iran.  The ambassador in Ankara supports our engagement with Iran, including the development of political relations, trade relations and supporting Irish businesses operating or hoping to operate there.  Ireland is also represented in Iran by an honorary consul.  Honorary consuls are an important element of the State's global engagement and they provide consular services and assistance as well as supporting citizens.  It is not, of course, the same as having a resident embassy and we are reviewing this issue.  I am not in a position to say anything beyond that for now.<\/p><p> I have already commented on relations with China.  China is far too big a country not to have structural relationships with it, and we have a very good relationship with the Chinese Embassy and the Chinese ambassador here.  We speak to him on a regular basis about various things, from important consular cases to trade to concerns they have about some of the statements we make on human rights and Hong Kong.  Again, we will try to maintain a relationship that maximises Ireland's influence on the issues we care about.<\/p><p> With regard to the World Health Organization, this year Ireland has been very vocal about supporting it and we have put a lot of money behind those statements.  It is not just words.  We are also aware of some of the other tensions.  I do not want to make any comment on China and the World Health Organization without putting a bit more thought into that comment.  It is something we are open to discussing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020111200002#E01100","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.

Earlier this year in Australia there was an inquiry into Covid and how all this happened or from where it emanated.  It is not about seeking to apportion blame but obviously we will learn lessons from it.  Covid-19 has and is, as we know, killing many millions and devastating the economy.  I would have thought there was an obvious obligation on the international community to involve itself in such a process and investigation.  Can the Minister enlighten us as to whether that appetite exists, especially in the context of a vaccine, which has given us all hope that we would be in a position to exit from this calamitous situation?  It has dominated the world for almost a year at this stage.  <\/p> <p>  It was reported earlier in the year, although it may not be the case and that is why I ask, that some countries within the Union which were hardest hit by Covid did not necessarily appreciate - or it was not apparent that they were getting - the level of support that one would expect from their counterparts in the Union.  That dissipated and there is now a more unified and a better European-centred approach that will allow countries to be in a situation where citizens throughout the EU see a pathway where there will be a universal approach.  We saw that recently in relation to travel.  Many might say this is a belated approach but, as I said, this is not about apportioning blame but ensuring we build on the hope and evidence across the globe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020111200002#H00300","speaker":"1591"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":428,"content":"<p>On the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu's suspension of annexation, we are uncomfortable with the fact that he has essentially described it as a temporary stalling of plans to annex part of the West Bank.  We want that to be a permanent commitment from Israel not to annex parts of the West Bank.  The land is not theirs.  Israel is an occupying power in occupied territory.  It was interesting because when the Israeli Foreign Minister, Gabi Ashkenazi, was asked about this, in the context of more recent initiatives around normalisation with some Gulf countries, he made the case that, as long as normalisation is progressing, annexation will not be progressing.  It was about the most definitive step I have heard a senior Israeli politician take in terms of a commitment not to allow annexation to proceed.  That is something we will watch closely.<\/p> <p>  It is a time for Ireland to engage with all parties but also to see what follows in the context of the presidential election in the US and whether that impacts US policy in the Middle East process.  Many people are waiting to see where this will go next.  Certainly Ireland will do everything it can to influence this in a constructive way, speaking to both Israel and Palestinian leaders, to progress a peace process that can result in a successful outcome, as opposed to what we have seen in the past several years.<\/p> <p>  On Belarus, many of us were pretty shocked by what we have seen there.<\/p><p>We have seen women protestors thrown into the back of vans and taken away, detention without trial and a lot of clear intimidation.  As has been rightly said, perhaps the most prominent Opposition spokesman, who is not in Belarus but is from Belarus, is someone who has a very close personal connection with Ireland and was here as a child.  We are watching this closely.  We are in absolute solidarity with those who seek democratic reform.  Most importantly, this is not Ireland trying to intervene in another country's affairs.  This is Ireland trying to speak out for, along with others in the EU, free and fair elections that would allow the Belarusian people to decide who governs them democratically.  We do not believe that the last election was either free or fair and that is why we have supported the peaceful demonstrations and pro-democracy movement in Belarus, and will continue to do so.<\/p><p> In terms of Poland and the rule of law, I will say a number of things.  We note with concern the recent rhetoric in Poland regarding the LGBTI+ community, and the development of so-called LGBTI ideology-free zones.  It is extraordinary that a country in the European Union even has that terminology on a sign anywhere.  Our embassy undertakes a number of initiatives to raise awareness and to facilitate discussion on the rights of LGBTI+ people and this includes taking part in the Warsaw equality parade each year.  The embassy is also one of a number of diplomatic representations that sign an annual letter in support of the Warsaw equality parade and other such parades around Poland.  This autumn the embassy will support a number of engagements, including events to showcase the experience in countries, such as Ireland, ensuring the adoption of equal rights for the LGBTI+ community. <\/p><p> As for concerns that were raised regarding Hungary, the rule of law is a fundamental principle for all EU member states.  Our concerns about issues relating to the rule of law in Hungary are well known, particularly around judicial independence, civil society space, media freedom, academic freedom and fundamental freedoms.  Under Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, there have been a number of hearings at the General Affairs Council over the past two years, involving the Commission, Hungary and other member states.  We have participated actively in these, highlighting the importance we attach to respect for the rule of law.  We support the continuation of Article 7 proceedings against Hungary.  Constructive dialogue should continue with a view to ensuring that the values of the EU are respected by everybody.<\/p><p> Deputy Stanton has raised the issue of &euro;35 billion.  What the EU has done but not communicated as well as perhaps it should have, is that it has been extraordinarily proactive in funding supports for Covid responses such as healthcare systems, personal protective equipment, PPE, and supporting countries all over the world that simply could not afford a response themselves, ranging from Africa, Latin America to parts of Asia, and in our own neighbourhood in particular, in terms of some of the eastern partner countries and so on.  The European Union has even made commitments, or has already funded, programmes that are supporting a public health response to the challenges of Covid all over the world.  Other countries are sometimes far better at trumpeting what they are doing than the Union is collectively but I hope that is changing.<\/p><p> In terms of South Sudan, I have been asked to make sure that South Sudan and Yemen remain a priority and part of Foreign Affairs Council, FAC, debates and I can assure the Deputy that we will do that.  There has been a focus, particularly on Yemen.  Over and over again we have items on the agenda on Yemen and, more recently, there has been discussion on South Sudan as well.  <\/p><p> Deputy Cowen raised the issue of Australia and called for an international inquiry into how Covid began.  We need to understand what happened so that we can learn lessons to make sure this does not happen again.  Part of the problem is that some have been very targeted in terms of their blame so that, politically, there has been a focal point for anger and blame against where Covid originated.  That has resulted, I think, in a tension that makes getting an international and credible inquiry agreed.  We need to approach this matter in a way that is likely to succeed in getting co-operation from countries like China and others on how did this happen, when was it spotted, what was the response, what were the mistakes, how can we do it better the next time, how can we have a global alert system for a virus like this when it is forming in its initial cluster and before it starts to spread, and how can we stamp it out more efficiently.  These are very real and genuine questions that at the end of all of this we are right to ask, albeit while getting buy-in in order that this does not turn into an international targeting of one country, particularly when it happens to be as large and influential as China.  If we are going to get buy-in from China then the approach that we take has to be one of partnership, which is less about blame and more about establishing facts.  <\/p><p> As for the EU's response to Covid-19, at the outset the European Union was, like every country, taken by the pace at which the disease spread.  What happened was that countries looked after themselves as best they could.  They shut borders, ignored EU rules and concentrated on trying to protect their own populations.  As a result, countries like Italy in particular were torn apart by the virus.  I am not sure what the EU could have done to help them faster.  As we have moved on through this pandemic, the European Union has really got its act together.  In the early days we were really effective at co-ordinating a response on getting people back to their home countries.  There was really good co-ordination in terms of rescue flights where European countries shared information with each other and brought each other's nationals home.  For example, when we organised a rescue flight out of Nigeria we brought other EU nationals back and dropped them off in London.  When we had a rescue flight out of Peru, we did the same.  Of course, we got Irish citizens on rescue flights that were organised by other member states and by the UK, that formally is not a member state any longer but certainly behaved in a way that was hugely helpful and responsible towards helping us to get Irish citizens home or helping them to get off cruise liners and so on in a way that friends and neighbours should support each other.<\/p><p> That co-operation demonstrated very good early solidarity within the European Union.  Since then, on vaccines, PPE and international travel, there is a lot more co-ordination and leadership coming from the EU.  The big thing is the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, the budget and the recovery fund that has been put in place and the scale of it, which is going to help the countries and their economies that have been hit the hardest to recover.  As a country that is going to have to recover in a post-Covid environment, I am very happy that we are a member of the European Union in terms of the supports.  As a country, I would not like to be fighting on our own to access vaccines, for example, when there is going to be a lot of pressure and competition to access them early.  We have the European Commission now centrally purchasing, in advance, vaccines in hundreds of millions of doses to make sure that large and small EU member states can be protected.  It does not matter whether a country is Germany or France, or Cyprus or Malta, it is going to be protected as an EU member state and get fair access and so on.  We have learned a lot of lessons.  The EU has really responded to the Covid crisis in the second half of the pandemic thus far in a way that has learned lessons from the pressures of the first half.<\/p><p>It is important to recognise that.  The European Union's response has been far from perfect but no one is talking about a shortage of personal protective equipment, PPE, in the second wave.  I hope we will not be talking about a shortage of vaccines, even though other parts of the world will be desperately trying to get their hands on vaccines and may not be able to.  By the way, the EU will be extraordinarily generous in using its buying power to buy up vaccines for parts of the world that will not be able to afford to compete, and so it should.  It is an opportunity for us to build relationships with countries that are fearful they will not be able to afford to compete in the market to buy vaccines when they become available.  The EU is planning a big funding programme to help other parts of the world in that regard.  Not only are we showing solidarity within the European Union but the value system the EU represents will, I hope, ensure our wealth, buying power and influence will see to it that countries which otherwise would not be able to compete to access vaccines when they become available will be able to do so.  All of that is positive and worth putting on the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020111200002#H00400","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>With regard to the global business and human rights treaty, the sixth session of the open-ended intergovernmental working group on business and human rights took place in Geneva.  For a long time now, there have been calls for the Irish Government to become more involved and engage more proactively in this treaty-making process.  One of those leading the call is Tr&oacute;caire.  It has stated it is time for Ireland to stand up, speak up and be on the side of those who are under attack from big business.  It stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tCorporate greed is leading to land being seized, forests being cut down and rivers poisoned.  Those who stand up to defend their rights are being harassed, intimidated, even murdered.<br \/><br \/>Indigenous communities often face the impact of this race for natural resources.  The number of killings of human rights defenders in the context of corporate activities is shocking, with an average of over four land and environmental defenders being killed every week in 2019.<br \/><br \/>Since 2015, more than 2,000 attacks on activists working on human rights issues related to business have been documented by the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre.  Women human rights defenders are also being targeted through threats of sexual violence and smear campaigns. <\/blockquote> <p>The EU opposed the negotiations, recommendations and conclusions of the process in 2018.  Is this position of the EU in line with the views of the Department?  Does the Minister agree that the EU's strong opposition to this treaty on business and human rights is correct?  Has he or his Department been lobbied to oppose any of the drafts of the business and human rights treaty since 2014?  Most important, why has Ireland yet to address the treaty session in the absence of an EU mandate?  So far, France and Spain have done so.  The Minister was recently quoted as saying he was looking at it.  What does that mean?  What does that look like?  What will his priorities be with regard to this treaty?  What are the red lines as far as this Government is concerned?<\/p><p>On behalf my staff and constituents, I express genuine and sincere thanks to the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs who went above and beyond and played an absolute blinder in getting my constituents home from some of the most far-flung places on the planet during Covid-19.  The Department put their minds at ease and their families' minds at ease and they landed safe and sound back in Ireland.  I thank the Department.<\/p><p>I want to drill down a little on the issue of people who are victims of crime while abroad.  There is a lack of knowledge about consular services.  I am sure there is not one Member of the Oireachtas who has not been contacted by a brother, sister, mother, father or other family member trying to get contact details for consular services abroad during Covid.  The issue extends beyond Covid-19.  There is little easily available advice for people who are abroad.  I am referring to pertinent information specifically in the initial hours following a traumatic event, for example, where somebody is the victim of a serious assault or an accident.  We should also bear in mind the language barrier that arises in many of these cases or even the lack of access to a mobile phone.  The Minister and I know consular services are available but there seems to be a lack of awareness among the general public or a breakdown in communication about them should someone need these services while abroad.<\/p><p>I will highlight a specific case, primarily because it has come back into the public eye in the past few months, namely, an attack on a young Irish woman in Praia da Rocha in Portugal in 2004.  She was 20 years of age at the time and working as a holiday representative.  Her name has been in the public domain.  This young lady was stalked, bound, gagged, beaten and raped following a home invasion in what can only be described as an absolutely horrendous ordeal.  She described that the attack was planned, orchestrated and carried out in a manner that left her genuinely fearful for her life.  She thought she would die at the hands of her attacker on the night in question.  Unfortunately, since day one, the State has not provided any assistance.  There has been no involvement, advice or support.  The woman's name is Hazel Behan.  She is remarkably resilient and has rebuilt her life, work and world.  She has a strong family and good friends and she is now in a good place.She has spoken openly about this attack over the years on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; and on national media.  Throughout this process, the State has not provided any support or assistance or involved itself in the case.<\/p><p>I raise this case now, even though I freely admit that none of us in this room, whether the Minister, I or anybody else, can turn back time or rewind the clock.  This incident may have taken place 16 years ago but it is now in the public domain again because of recent developments.  Multiple law enforcement agencies from a number of jurisdictions are involved, yet there is still no support or assistance being provided by any arm of the Irish State, despite the State being involved in the logistics of what is taking place beyond our borders.  Ms Behan says she had received most support from Germany.  She is not a German citizen and, until recently, had never set foot in Germany.  She also received support from the British but she is not a British citizen.  There is no legal obligation on these countries to provide her with the level of assistance they are providing.  They see, however, that they have a moral obligation and they are stepping up to meet that obligation.<\/p><p>The Department of Justice is very much aware of what is going on in this case because it has such a high media profile.  I have no doubt that will be the case again.  Do the Departments of Justice and Foreign Affairs communicate in cases such as this?  Ms Behan thought at one stage this incident was in her past and would never gain play such a prominent role in her life but here we are today.  For some reason, it seems steps have not been taken to help victims of these crimes feel supported and listened to by someone with relevant experience who can talk them through what a process abroad may involve.<\/p><p>Hazel Behan is an Irish citizen who was attacked in Portugal and is getting more support from the German and British authorities than she has ever received from this State.  This is a serious and worrying case.<\/p><p>The Minister and I know those services are available but, in terms of the general public, that breakdown of communication and awareness causes trauma and anxiety in people's lives.  Not knowing where to go to get the most basic of information compounds that trauma and anxiety.  I know that is the case because I spoke to Hazel this morning.  To quote her directly, she said: \"Hazel Behan found herself standing in a foreign country literally naked with not so much as a flyers of where to go for assistance.\"  Is that the best we can offer those of our citizens who are victims of crimes in a different country?  I do not believe so.  I believe even the Minister set a higher standard for what it is we could be doing, and rightly so.<\/p><p> The final issue I want to raise is one a colleague of mine, Deputy Maire&aacute;d Farrell, raised in the D&aacute;il recently.  It is to do with the Finance Bill and the subsidies for NATO military forces for exemptions from VAT and excise on services and goods they will receive from 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020111200002#K00200","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I am reluctant to interrupt the Deputy but there is a parallel process here insofar as the Finance Bill is tabled for discussion and debate next week.

I will focus on two issues he touched on in both his update and in the briefing material provided from the EU Foreign Affairs Council meetings.  There was a significant discussion in the Council on Russian activities and influence.  In the main, it seemed to be around the geographical sphere of influence on the borders in eastern Europe and into Ukraine, Belarus, etc.  I am interested in that but I am also interested in a wider sphere.  Was there any discussion at that meeting or at other recent meetings on disinformation campaigns, which may have been advanced beyond their immediate geographical sphere across the EU, perhaps into Ireland or further afield into the US?  Is that a concern to the Council?  Is it something that has been discussed?<\/p> <p>  On a related note, I ask about Ireland's position on housing up to 40% or more of the EU's datasets, the predominance of US but also other multinational technology, financial services, pharma, life sciences and other companies in Ireland as the European, Middle East and African headquarters?  There are very significant commercial activities and data activities in Ireland, which is a good thing.  It is something we want to propagate, continue and welcome and is fundamental to our own economic strategy but it leaves us somewhat exposed in terms of cyber security and attacks and threats.  It may be more a question on the defence side than the foreign affairs side, although I believe it touches on both, but in terms of hostile actors, be they other nation states or non-nation actors, what is our state of preparedness for that?<\/p> <p>  On the same theme, we have the transatlantic cables at a proximity to data transfers, both across the EU and back to the US.  I believe there is an exposure in that in terms of attacks on cyber security, which may tie in to some of those points.  That is one set of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020111200002#L00700","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Apologies.

An extremely significant volume of data would transfer from Ireland to the US which contains a good deal of EU data also.  There is 40% or more of the EU's data within Irish data centres so there are very significant volumes of data here, which is a concern both from a privacy and data protection view in terms of the data itself but also from a commercial sensitivity point of view.  From a cyber security and cyber defence point of view, what is our degree of preparedness if there are any attacks on that?<\/p> <p>  On South Sudan, which the Minister touched on, I had the opportunity to visit the South Sudanese border with a group from the previous Oireachtas.  I am aware that in some circles at that stage, which was late 2017, the question being asked was whether the experiment, to use that word, of South Sudan as a new, independent nation state had succeeded or whether it was regressing.  I note that in one of the briefing documents Sudan is about to receive additional aid because it has been removed from various lists of terrorist sponsors.  Perhaps its northern neighbours enjoy a little more success but South Sudan is problematic, to put it mildly.  We saw the greatest population displacement there since the Second World War take place across the south Sudanese borders over the past five years.  It is catastrophic.  We have talked about Syria and other countries which are equally in disarray and difficulties but South Sudan continues to be a global black spot.  I know from being on the ground on that occasion that there is a significant Irish presence, which we were very proud to see.  The Minister has touched on it already but he might provide a quick update on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020111200002#L00900","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I do not wish in any way to curtail the Minister in his reply, particularly having regard to important issues raised by Deputy Clarke and Deputy Lawless, but we have some private business to conduct and we have 15 minutes to hear the Minister's reply, closing comments and deal with our private business.  We will see how we do but in the context of the Minister's attendance, I wish to remind him briefly of an issue that has been the subject matter of discussion here, that is, the Armenian-Azerbaijanian conflict.  We have had submissions here, and there has been debate and concern expressed among our members.  I ask the Minister to continue to do what he can, with his EU colleagues, to ensure that every effort is made to help assist a settlement process that will not involve any miliary engagement or undue influence externally.  It is an issue we might come back to at a later stage with the Minister but, in the meantime, let us hope that the ceasefire can be maintained and that matters will proceed towards a satisfactory settlement.

To respond to that last point because I know a number of people have mentioned it, I have a good short and concise note on it.  On 9 November, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia signed an agreement to bring an end to the conflict.  This agreement was to come into effect at midnight on 10 November.  This followed significant Azerbaijani military gains on the ground which could have cut off Armenia from Nagorno-Karabakh.  The agreement, if fully implemented, would see a lasting ceasefire, a return of territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan and the deployment of Russian peacekeepers.  Those peacekeepers would be mandated to safeguard a land corridor for Armenia with those parts of Nagorno-Karabakh that are not under the full control of Azerbaijan.  Armenia, in turn, is to provide transport links for Azerbaijan to allow it connect with the autonomous republic to the south west of Armenia.<\/p> <p>  Internationally displaced persons or refugees will return to the territory and adjacent areas under the control of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Ireland will continue to monitor developments closely and we will work constructively with our EU partners to assist in the challenging task of making any ultimate settlement sustainable.  It is good that we would have an official position on that.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Clarke, on the global business and human rights treaty, Ireland is committed to the UN guiding principles on business and human rights adopted unanimously by UN members in 2011.<\/p><p>Any new UN initiatives should be consistent with and build on the guiding principles and important measures, including the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises and the International Labour Organization tripartite declaration principles.<br\/><br\/>The sixth session of the open-ended working group took place in Geneva from 26 October to 30 October, two months after a second draft of a legally binding instrument on business and human rights was circulated.  The EU made a statement on behalf of member states, which Ireland helped to shape.  The EU statement welcomes some of the changes in the current draft of the legally binding instrument and highlights the further necessary changes and the measures taken by the EU and member states to protect human rights in the context of business activities.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has taken an open-minded, constructive approach on the matter and we will continue to consult relevant stakeholders, including civil society.<i><\/i>I am aware of the strong views of the Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights.  My officials in Dublin and Geneva have met members of the coalition, including in recent weeks, and we will continue to have this valuable engagement.<br\/><br\/>We have a very strong record in supporting human rights defenders in different parts of the world and I presume members are familiar with the Front Line Defenders awards that take place each year.  Before I was a Minister I was on the panel of people who chose who would be given those human rights defenders awards each year.  In Iveagh Gardens, next door to the Department of Foreign Affairs, we have mounted a plaque that is essentially a monument to human rights defenders.<br\/><br\/>This is an area on which we want to continue to be a global voice.  Unfortunately, there are many people in incredibly vulnerable positions trying to raise concerns and protect people.  These include indigenous or vulnerable populations that are being persecuted.  They need a voice and often that voice gives them protection as well, and that is what we are trying to do.<br\/><br\/>I am always told by my team that I cannot speak about individual consular cases because there are so many sensitive cases.  The member has named Hazel and I presume she is okay with that.  I know she has also raised her own case.  All I can say is that we have a consular charter on our website and it indicates how we are supposed to support and protect Irish citizens abroad when we can.  This is a case that happened in 2004 and I would like to hear more about.  If a note is sent to me, I will certainly take a look at the case to consider lessons learned or how we could have supported her in a more comprehensive way.  If mistakes were made, we will try to learn from that.  I certainly was not familiar with the case at the time.<br\/><br\/>We have a 24-hour helpline for emergencies that people can call from any part of the world.  In many cases we have helped people to get legal representation in different parts of the world they may not have been able to get themselves, or there may be language or access difficulties and so on.  Our consular team does an extraordinary job, often in very difficult circumstances.  I am very proud of the work it does but that does not mean we cannot constantly strive to do things better or learn lessons from individual cases.  If Deputy Clarke wants to follow up the conversation on Hazel's case, I will certainly try to be as supportive to her as I can be.<br\/><br\/>I am not familiar with the element of the Finance Bill that was raised.

The security and resilience of Ireland's 5G network are clearly essential for all the reasons outlined, including the amount of data that moves in and out of the island across the Atlantic and within the EU.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the National Cyber Security Centre engaged fully with the EU process on the security of 5G networks.  The Department produced a national risk assessment of 5G and contributed to the EU-wide risk assessment that was published in October last year.  Ireland also actively contributed to the development of the EU 5G security toolbox of mitigation measures published in January this year.  The national cybersecurity strategy contains specific measures around the security of telecommunications systems, including 5G, and these measures build on a comprehensive EU process.

It is interesting being the Minister responsible for defence and foreign affairs in this space as Ireland must be to the fore, internationally, in ensuring we are securing data and protecting it, both in law and in reality when it comes to protecting our networks, and we must also communicate that internationally.  I am glad this important topic was raised.<\/p> <p>  Misinformation campaigns are a concern that has been raised time and again.  Conflict and security are now shaped very differently in political debates.  The damage is done or instability is created by state or non-state actors in a cynical or underhanded way, either during elections or in destabilising governments by influencing public discourse in multiple ways, particularly on social media.  It is something the EU is very alive to and concerned about.  There is much evidence to suggest this is a very active and moving space.  We are alert to it and it is very much part of our broader cybersecurity strategy.<\/p> <p>  The issue of South Sudan was raised.  As I mentioned, the number of refugees displaced across borders into neighbouring countries is significant.  We provide significant humanitarian funding to South Sudan, mainly through the World Food Programme and other non-governmental organisations.  Concern, GOAL and Tr&oacute;caire are all active there.  We will send a more detailed note to the committee if required.  We also support the South Sudan peace process and the funding of a ceasefire monitoring mission there as well.  We have a stake in that matter, and for good reason.  It could not only contribute to destabilising South Sudan, which is a very new country struggling to find its feet.  It could also have a regional destabilising effect on neighbouring states.  It is something we are watching closely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2020111200002#M00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his attendance and the comprehensive nature of his replies to members.

I have responsibility at assistant secretary level in the Department of the Taoiseach for the shared island unit and, indeed, for the broader British-Irish and Northern Ireland affairs division.  I am joined by Mr. Eoghan Duffy, principal officer in the unit.  I will make our opening statement but both Mr. Duffy and I will be available to answer any questions members may have.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, the programme for Government sets out the Government&rsquo;s commitment to working with all communities and traditions on the island to build consensus around a shared future underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement.  In a major address at Dublin Castle on 22 October, the Taoiseach set out the Government&rsquo;s vision and priorities for a shared island.  More than 800 invited guests from Ireland, North and South, as well as from Britain, joined the online event.  I know that several members of the committee were able to attend the event virtually.  As the Taoiseach outlined in that address, the Government&rsquo;s approach to a shared island involves working in partnership with the Executive, through the North-South Ministerial Council, and with the British Government to address the strategic challenges faced on the island, further developing the all-island economy, an enhanced connectivity and deepening co-operation in areas such as health and education and investing in the north-west and border regions.  It also involves fostering constructive and inclusive dialogue, as well as developing a comprehensive programme of research to support the building of consensus around a shared future.  The Taoiseach outlined that the shared island agenda is a whole-of-government priority.<\/p> <p>  The shared island unit of the Department of the Taoiseach does a significant amount of work co-ordinating and driving this work and agenda.  The work of the unit and the whole shared island agenda are underpinned by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.  We operate in close co-operation with the ongoing and extensive Northern Ireland-related work across the Government, including with the Department of Foreign Affairs, as well as through the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  We are still in the early days.  The unit started its work at the beginning of September, when Mr. Duffy and I came on board.  We now have two additional staff members and plans are well advanced for a further two or three posts.<\/p> <p>  Operationally, the current focus of the unit&rsquo;s work is on three areas: commissioning research, fostering dialogue and building a shared island agenda, including through delivery of the commitments in the programme for Government.  I will briefly set out our work under each of these three areas.  Building a shared island agenda involves the promotion of all-island approaches to the strategic challenges facing Ireland, North and South.  Delivering on the commitments in the programme for Government is a key focus.  Importantly, many of the programme for Government commitments are reflected in the Irish Government commitments under the New Decade, New Approach agreement.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware that in budget 2021, the Government announced the shared island fund, with &euro;500 million to be made available over the period to 2025 and ring-fenced for shared island projects.  As the Taoiseach set out in the D&aacute;il, the shared island fund provides significant new multi-annual capital funding for investment in collaborative North-South projects.  The funding will support the delivery of key cross-border infrastructure initiatives as set out in the programme for Government.  We hope it will also support new Government investment in all-island initiatives in areas such as research, health, education and the environment, as well as addressing the particular challenges of the north-west and border communities.  In all these areas, there are already several commitments in the programme for Government.  The Taoiseach has emphasised the importance of moving ahead with cross-border investment commitments, working closely with the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure delivery.  This was discussed at the North-South Ministerial Council plenary meeting in Dublin on 31 July.  An update on progress will be provided to the next plenary meeting of the council, to be held in December.<\/p> <p>  On research, given the scale and potential impact of the work on the shared island initiative across all sectors and communities, it is essential to support a wide-ranging programme of research to provide high-quality and evidence-based policy analysis.  This in turn will support consideration both in the Government and in broader public discourse on building a shared island and a consensus around a shared future.  The shared island unit is finalising a research partnership with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  There will also be a North-South and east-west collaborative element to this research work.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, has been asked to prepare a comprehensive report on shared island issues in 2021.  This will provide valuable input from economic, social and environmental partners.  There will be scope for collaboration with academia and other experts on the island or from Britain, as well as potentially drawing on wider international expertise.  In developing all of this, we are and will be working closely with other Departments in terms of their policy and research priorities.<\/p> <p>  On dialogue and outreach, as I am sure members are aware, the Taoiseach launched the shared island dialogue series at Dublin Castle on 22 October to foster constructive and inclusive civic dialogue on all aspects of a shared future on the island.  The dialogue series will start later this month.  In a way, there are two elements to it.  One will be a focus on key sectoral issues, including environment, economy, health and education.  There will also be engagement on an inclusive basis on overarching concerns for the Good Friday Agreement, including around issues such as identity rights and the equality agenda.  The dialogue series is complementary to the range of discussions and engagement that are already happening in community and civic settings on peace process issues.  The dialogue series is intended to provide a focus for people to engage on an inclusive basis on a shared future on the island.  It can also be the starting point for broader and deeper discussions in civil society.  We will actively seek as broad a range of perspective and experience as possible in order to ensure the inclusion of voices that traditionally have been under-represented in the peace process, including those of women, young people, and immigrant communities.  Indeed, the first shared island dialogue, which the Taoiseach has already announced, will be around the topic of new generation, new voices.<\/p> <p>  That concludes my opening remarks on the shared island unit.  I wish to express my appreciation to the committee for this opportunity to present to it and, very importantly from our point of view, to hear the views of members on the initiative and, indeed, the role that they, as Oireachtas Members and elected members can play.  I thank the committee.

The funding is welcome.  I noticed in some other presentations that reference was made to speed rail.  Some of the presentation from Ms O'Donoghue focused on the north west, which I was pleased to hear, and the Border.  Does Ms O'Donoghue have any awareness of the thinking on speed rail?  Two of the largest cities in the country are Derry and Belfast.  There is a major opportunity to connect them with Dublin via speed rail.  It would help the region as a whole and it would not be a major stretch to connect the town of Letterkenny in Donegal to that as well.  This is something I want to throw out so that the officials have it in the back of their minds.  The A5 is progressing as we know and I am delighted to see it.<\/p> <p>  I have mentioned several times at this committee, including to the Minister for Foreign Affairs when we had him in, the question of the make-up of this committee.  Not all parties are around the table.  It is really important that the Department of the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach work in conjunction with our Chairman and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to get all political parties in Northern Ireland around the table of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is imperative that we all work on this.  We are all stakeholders in the Good Friday Agreement.  It is imperative that all are brought on board.  All Departments need to work together.  People need to sit down and negotiate to see what the hurdles are and to do our best to work on them.

As Ms O'Donoghue said in her presentation, this new initiative is welcome and inclusive.  It is very much underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement and the progress made since April 1998.  We want to maximise the potential of the Good Friday Agreement and ensure no diminution to any aspect of the Good Friday Agreement post-Brexit.<\/p> <p>  The presentation echoed the point made strongly by the Taoiseach speaking in the D&aacute;il to the effect that this is new and additional funding.  In the past those of us who represent Border communities have often argued that some of the new programmes that came to our areas, whether PEACE or INTERREG programmes, did not bring the additionality that they should have.  Central government and local government often use these funding streams to fund particular projects that should be funded through the normal Government programmes of investment.  It is important that the message is given out clearly that this is new and additional funding under this welcome initiative.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that Ms O'Donoghue said that there will be greater collaboration and input by groups that previously did not have as much input as they should have had, such as women's groups and youth organisations.  It is important to ensure that we draw on the wealth of experience and knowledge among local public representatives throughout the Border area.  We have a structure with the north west involving the councils in Derry, Strabane and Donegal.  We have the Irish Central Border Area Network and the East Border Region.  Research has been done already with regard to projects that have the potential to bring investment and grow our economy on a cross-Border basis.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;500 million to be committed up to 2025 is welcome.  There is urgency about getting this going.  That was reflected in comments by An Taoiseach as well.  Ms O'Donoghue has outlined the urgency with regard to the new structure being put in place as well.  We look forward, as the Cathaoirleach has said, to good projects of a cross-Border nature in our areas being developed and earmarked for this investment.  It would be a great message to go out to Border communities who are nervous because of Brexit, which lies ahead of us.  There will be additional investment in human and physical resources.  I wish the officials well in the important work they have ahead of them on behalf of all the people of all of the island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111200002#C00500","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":469,"content":"<p>My thanks to our guests from the shared island unit.  I wish them every success in their project.  It is a great opportunity for this committee to work with them and it is an exciting time to be a part of the new initiative.  I had a quick review of the Taoiseach's speech.  I was logged in to the Dublin Castle event some weeks ago.  The discussion that followed with the stakeholders was interesting as well.  Even that, in itself, was part of the journey.<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned three things.  He talked about the dialogue series that will be commenced.  I understand it will bring together stakeholders from different strands to begin that process of dialogue.  One thing has been central to the Good Friday Agreement from the outset and it is also central to the shared island initiative.  This is the relationship in different directions, including North-South and the east-west relationships.  Where are we at with regard to the dialogue series and the east-west relationship as well as the North-South relationship?  What does the unit see as being a timeline?  What are the next steps in the coming 12 or 24 months?  Where does it go?  How does it take shape?  I am interested in that.  I appreciate that this may be yet to be defined to an extent and that all of us who have a contribution to make will help to shape it.  Where is that at the moment?<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach said something which I thought was interesting and true.  From the different contributors we already see different people bringing different perspectives, and often these are geographic.  One point the Taoiseach made in his speech was that a person's view on this may differ depending on what part of the country he is in or what part of the island he is on.  It may depend on what county and place and what traditional leaning a person may have.  This is paramount for everyone in every corner of the island, whether in the farthest-flung corner of the south west or the top of the north east.  Whether a person is a Border representative or otherwise, I see this as being fundamental to the entire island and across the island, although that is a personal view.  In terms of timelines, as far as we can today what are the next steps?  What do they look like in the coming 12 to 24 months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111200002#C00600","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605139200,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I will be brief and maybe I will ask Mr. Duffy to come in as well.  My thanks to all the committee members.  A considerable amount of what was said is exactly what we are aiming to do and trying to do.<\/p> <p>  I will say a few more words on funding.  As announced, it is a total of &euro;500 million for the next five years.  There is already an initial provision in budget 2021 of &euro;50 million.  To answer the first question, it is important to understand this is about additional money.  The Government is already providing a large amount of funding in a range of North-South areas, including the support for the North-South bodies and a variety of initiatives from the hospital in Altnagelvin to the Middletown Centre for Autism.  There are other areas like the reconciliation fund of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  These are in place and will continue.  Equally, we have the PEACE PLUS funding, which we expect to come on board from next year.  That is in place and will continue.  The idea with the shared island fund is absolutely one of additionality.  It will go to fund a variety of the commitments in the programme for Government.  Where there are existing allocations to Departments, as there are in some cases, for example, like the A5, then they stay in place.  It is about Departments continuing to do what they are doing already and then we are able to come in on top of that.<\/p><p>As projects become ready for funding, we will have a governance arrangement in place between the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the disbursal of the moneys involved.  Another point to note is that this is capital funding rather than day-to-day, ongoing funding.<\/p><p> Deputy Blaney mentioned a number of projects.  In terms of the rail project, it is being extended from Cork, Dublin, Belfast and on to Derry in terms of developing terms of reference for a feasibility study.  We see that as a project that has a lot of potential.  The Chairman mentioned the Narrow Water bridge, on which subject I also heard him speak last night in the debate on the Brexit omnibus Bill.  Again, this is very much to the fore and it has been discussed already by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his counterpart in Northern Ireland, Ms Nichola Mallon.<\/p><p> On local authorities, we do see them as an engine of cross-Border co-operation.  As has been said, they have been active for a long time in this area.

This will start later this month, with the first dialogue on new generations and new voices under the Good Friday Agreement.  As mentioned by the Taoiseach, there are 1.3 million people on the island who have been born since 1988 and who have a huge role to play in the future of what it will look like.  The first dialogue will give prominence to their voices, ideas and concerns.  From there, there will be a regular series of dialogues, roughly once a month well into next year and operating across two overall strands.  The first strand will focus on the theme of building a shared island and will look at practical areas of co-operation and connection on the island, whether to do with the environment, education and training in the area of health, cross-Border employment and, of course, the all-island economy.  The second strand will be around the theme of deepening the relationships under the Good Friday Agreement and will look at some of the key concerns in this regard in recent years and into the future, including identity, cultural exchange and barriers to reconciliation.  There will be a different thematic focus in the context of different dialogues on a regular basis well into next year, bringing people together across the island on a representative basis to engage with these themes.  Obviously, the engagement will take place online for the foreseeable future.  When it becomes possible to engage in person, they will be representative dialogues.  We are hoping - we are already seeing this response - that they will prompt, foster and encourage much broader and deeper engagement in civil society from people to provide their views on these really important themes.

It is lovely to see Ms O'Donoghue again.  I met her approximately 20 years ago in Belfast, which is not nearly as glamorous as Gettysburg, but we have crossed paths before.  I welcome the development of the shared island unit and I welcome that the witnesses are engaging with us today.  We welcome the new resources that are available.  Ms O'Donoghue mentioned new money and previous commitments.  It is good to hear that that money is in addition to previous commitments.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in hearing about how the unit proposes to engage.  I note Mr. Duffy's reference to the engagement happening online.  How do the witnesses expect to touch base with the groups?  I am keen to ensure that people who do not always have a voice will have a voice in this engagement.  We need to hear from those groups in communities that often are not able to articulate their point of view.  How is it proposed to select groups for engagement?  The people who will put their hand up will be the same ones who will always put their hand up.  How we involve the people who normally do not put up their hands is the issue.  I would like to hear from the witnesses regarding how they intend to engage in the future and what those meetings will look like.  For example, will they be available publicly, what is the framework for them and what does the unit hope to get out of them?  There is a broad piece of work going on and I would like to flesh out what that means for groups and people across the island.<\/p> <p>  On the local issue of the Ulster Canal, I also listened to the Taoiseach's speech referenced by Mr. Duffy who mentioned the matter too.  There have been previous commitments in this area and some money has been spent on scoping the marina and the stretch to Clonfad.  What is the next stage in this project and, if the Executive does not come up with funding in time, will the unit continue to work towards completion of that project?  As we have seen, sometimes it is not that easy to get agreement in the Executive.  I am concerned that because of difficulties within the Executive funding might be held up on unit's side as well.  I would appreciate it if the witnesses could elaborate on those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111200002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Gildernew"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605139200,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Donoghue for her presentation.

The witnesses indicated that there is &euro;500 million allocated to it and that the funding is ring-fenced, which is to be welcomed.  All politics being local, I want to touch on the A5 western transport corridor.  This is a long awaited project, one which the Irish Government committed to in the St. Andrew's Agreement.  At that time, it committed to co-fund the A5.  Unfortunately, it has reneged on that commitment and currently has only committed to funding &euro;75 million towards to it.  If we are to see delivery of that project within the next five years, it is crucial that the Irish Government uplifts its current contribution in line with its original commitment, which was to co-fund the project.  I would be grateful if the witnesses could give us a breakdown of how the &euro;500 million will be allocated across the cross-Border projects and outline the timescale in that regard.  I know it is probably early days in terms of a timescale for disbursal of that funding but I would welcome an update on projects that are ready to go, such as the A5 project.

It has been ongoing for a number of years now and people are looking forward to its fruition.  I have a couple of questions on the issue.  The Taoiseach indicated that the money for the Narrow Water bridge will be ring-fenced.  Hopefully, that is the case.  Have steps been taken to expedite commencement of that project?  There has been a great deal of interaction between Newry and Mourne District Council and Louth County Council and there is a long-standing memorandum of understanding between the two which has proved very useful in the past and which continues to facilitate good dialogue between the two jurisdictions.<\/p><p>Is it likely to be done fairly quickly?

I spent some very interesting years working in North-South co-operation from 2003 to 2008 and that is when Ms Gildernew and I met.  There were some great achievements during that period.<\/p> <p>  I will make a preliminary point related to Covid, which Mr. Duffy touched on.  Some of what we originally envisaged, including in terms of engagement and outreach and notably in terms of travelling to meet different groups, is severely restricted at the moment.  Regarding some of the projects, such as the Narrow Water Bridge project, I would need to do a tour to see the locations and remind myself because, as I said, I was heavily involved until 2008 but have been involved in other issues since then.  There is a challenge in this early phase because of Covid.  We are trying to work through that and there are some pluses to virtual engagement in terms of the numbers of people one can have.  <\/p> <p>  I will say a couple of words on the projects.  One of the pitfalls is if one mentions one project and not another, it can be read one way or another.  Everyone should take it as read that all the projects listed in the New Decade, New Approach, commitments from the Irish Government and all the projects listed in the programme for Government are part of our agenda, although it is absolutely correct to ask about different ones.  <\/p> <p>  On the A5 road project, the current issues are not about funding but about planning permission, public inquiries and environmental issues, which are within the remit of the Northern Ireland Executive.  There have been a series of challenges and public inquiries related to the planning for the A5 project.  The state of play is that the latest public inquiry in the North has issued an interim report to the Minister, which I understand she is considering.  Once we see the way forward to do the project and get past legal and planning issues, we will be ready to have further conversations on funding.  We have allocated the money that has been mentioned, some &pound;75 million.  For the past number of years, the Department has not been able to spend that money on the A5 because of these obstacles.  We have to overcome those first.<\/p> <p>  On the Narrow Water Bridge project, there was a good discussion between the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister for Infrastructure in the North, Nichola Mallon, at the North-South Ministerial Council.  We have to look at what options we want to put on the table and reach agreement on what the plan is.  There are many stakeholders and different views, including in the relevant region, but I assure the committee that the Taoiseach is committed to this project, which he has emphasised.<\/p> <p>  On the Ulster Canal, feasibility work is being carried out in the Clones area and there is a real commitment to the project.  It has a great deal of support in the Executive.  We are looking at delivering the phase around Clones and then planning for a further phase.  The project will be done on a phased basis but it is viewed as iconic, as is the Narrow Water Bridge.<\/p> <p> I will ask Mr. Duffy to address the issue of engagement and some of the projects.  Dialogue is the formal part of that but we are engaged in an extensive listening and learning exercise, reaching out to a variety of organisations.  Ms Gildernew's point that it cannot just be the people who put their hands up is well made.  We are doing a lot of work making sure we have exhaustively explored who might wish to contribute or might be interested in contributing and might not have done so until now.  It is not just about who is in the room, even if it is a virtual room, but about making the conversation relevant to them and their issues and interests.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Lawless noted that one area we are focused on is developing dialogue in the South in the regions and with different groups.

We envisaged that some of the dialogue work would bring people together online.  We hope to capture some of those exchanges and conversations and make them available publicly to support a broader dialogue, getting a sense of what people are saying and what the key themes are.  In some of the sessions, we will want people to have space for private discussions between invitees but there will also be a public element.  The conclusions and themes coming from these dialogues will be very important for us in the unit in terms of how we shape the work and make it publicly available.<\/p> <p>  As Ms O'Donoghue said, we want to hear from people and allow them to directly shape how the dialogues work.  On the first dialogue we are planning with new generations on the Good Friday Agreement, as part of extending the invitation, we will ask for suggestions on what areas should be discussed.  We have some ideas.  The key theme to be explored will be broadly around opportunity, equality of opportunity and employment on the island into the future.  Another theme we believe to be relevant, and on which we want to hear back from people, is that of connections between people in work, in communities and in all aspects of life.  What does that mean today?  How can it be improved and deepened in the future?  Where are the people across the island who are already providing leadership in that area?<\/p> <p>  We will be drawing out and making available such themes.  Based on what we are hearing already, the dialogues will be a point where people come together and say what they are doing, what really matters to them, where they want to go and do from here and how they want to do it.  Hopefully, the dialogue series in each sector, under each theme and, as Ms O'Donoghue said, in different regions around the country will provide a touch-point, give people a focus and allow them to proceed and shape it as they want.<\/p> <p>  I hope that gives the committee a sense of the thinking behind the dialogues.  As Ms O'Donoghue said, we are investing a great deal of time in trying to reach out and talk to people across the board online, from community groups and civil society top academics, political stakeholders.

I particularly like the fact that there are different aspects to it including dialogue, research and an investment and development fund, which is about putting our money where our mouth is.  I congratulate the Taoiseach in that regard.  His speech has started things off in a very positive manner.  It points to how dynamics change and challenges appear, as they have done over the last couple of years and underlines the longevity and importance of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses touched on engagement and I am heartened to see that a lot of thought is going into that on a north, south, east, west and cross-community basis in terms of reaching out to people who have not engaged much previously.  The witnesses are working on their outreach strategy.  Will there be a communications strategy as part of that, so that people are being pulled in from different communities and different points of view towards dialogue?  Will the witnesses push out to engage more people?  Will there be an online presence?  Is the shared island unit going to have an identity?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses talked about how there will be a comprehensive programme of research to support the building of consensus around a shared future.  I would like them to tease that out further and tell us what they mean.  There will be research into sectoral issues as well and reference has also been made to an all-island research hub.  I ask the witnesses to tell us more about the latter.  Is that a physical hub or a coming together of different academics in a group?  Will the research be quantitative or qualitative?  <\/p> <p>  My next question relates to resilience.  When the Northern Ireland Executive fell it was for three long years.  We have talked about the importance of health and the work that is being done through the North-South Ministerial Council on things like children's cardiac surgery in Crumlin hospital and in the north west on cardiac and cancer care.  In reality, those initiatives started before the Executive fell and they continued on.  Part of me wonders, in the context of Covid-19 and our current vulnerability, where we would be if work had been able to continue during those three years on new public health projects.  If the Executive fell again, would the shared island unit be able to continue its work?  How would that work?  <\/p> <p>  The University of Ulster campus at Magee is mentioned in the programme for Government in terms of its potential in the north west.  What is the situation in that regard?  A tour of the shared island unit projects would be beneficial for this committee in order to keep us engaged.  These projects are important and will be the basis of what the shared island unit represents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111200002#F00100","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Dowd and I would be delighted to welcome everybody to the Narrow Water bridge project in north Louth.  It would be very remiss of me not to mention the former councillor, Mr. Tommy Elmore, now long dead, who put the concept of the bridge on the map.  It was his brainchild and he was pushing it in the 1980s and 1990s, long before any of us came along.  It would be remiss of me not to mention and give credit to the man who put the concept of the Narrow Water bridge on the map.  In 2013 the Narrow Water bridge came excruciatingly close to getting across the line.  We all know why it did not but it must be the top priority project now and I am sure the Chairman will agree with me on that.  The Chairman and I would love to welcome this committee to Louth to see this top-class project.<\/p> <p>  As an avid rail user I also wish to raise the high speed rail project between Belfast and Dublin which is included in Project Ireland 2040.  There are eight direct trains from Belfast to Dublin every day whereas Liverpool to Manchester or Glasgow to Edinburgh, cities of similar size and distance apart, have up to 30 direct trains per day.  I would love to see a significant increase on the Dublin-Belfast line.  In terms of cross-Border greenways, Louth County Council and Newry and Mourne District Council are already doing a lot of collegial work on connecting the greenway in north Louth through Victoria Lock and on to Newry.  I would love the shared island unit to set out a long-term vision for our greenways.  I would really love to see a greenway stretching from north Louth right up through Newry and along the south Down coast.  That would be a great way to increase cross-Border tourism.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about the projects that are coming along, are we talking about more established projects like the Narrow Water bridge that have come very close to completion or is there space for funding new projects or new ideas?

He asked if funding will only be available for established projects or whether there is scope for new projects.  From my perspective, and the Taoiseach agrees, delivering on what we have already committed to is the first priority.  That is what shows that we are serious.  Some of those projects, as has been mentioned, have long histories and also have complications but they are the priority for us.  That said, part of this is also about developing a new agenda and new ideas.  In that context, Senator Currie asked about the all-island research hub which is a very good example of a new concept and new project that we are trying to develop.  That would involve creating a context, a structure and ways for researchers in academia and industry on this island to collaborate.  Players involved could include Science Foundation Ireland and Universities Ireland and we would need to see funding from the Irish Government and the NI Executive as well as, potentially, the British Government.  An all-island research hub is one of the examples of a potentially new and very exciting project.  It will take time to roll out and deliver but it is one that we are actively pursuing with the NI Executive and the British Government.<\/p> <p>  On the greenways, the Senator made a very good point.  Just this week we had a discussion with our Northern counterparts on a number of issues including greenways.  One of the takeaways from that was the need to join up the plans on both sides of the Border and see what that looks like.  This is something on which we can make progress.<\/p><p> I fully agree with regard to high-speed rail.  Coming from Cork, there is a contrast between even an hourly train service from Dublin to Cork compared with trains that do not go at simple hourly intervals.  Again, what we are talking about here is looking at options.  What would give us maximum impact and what is feasible?  Quite a few of these projects are still in the terms of reference and development phases.<\/p><p> In terms of the research programme, we are looking at a number of different elements.  At the end of the Taoiseach's event in Dublin Castle - somebody mentioned that there were a number of stakeholder engagements - Professor Deirdre Hannon made a very strong point about the research basis we need to promote further health co-operation on the island.  It is that sort of work.  It could be on a sectoral basis or on the broader all-island economy.  It will certainly involve climate change and biodiversity issues.  We expect to see some early work around issues like climate and good jobs and what that means for the island but there will be a broader and more sustained programme of research as well.<\/p><p> The point about resilience and the Northern Ireland Executive is valid.  What is hugely important about this period is that we have a partner in the Northern Ireland Executive and that is how we want it to stay.  What I wish to mention, because it is not necessarily seen as much as it should be, is that in addition to the North-South Ministerial Council plenary which took place at the end of July, there were six different North-South Ministerial Council sectoral meetings in September, October and into early November.  This sees Ministers from the North and the South meeting regularly - at present, virtually, like everything else - but developing agendas together, etc., so it is hugely important to begin to see the outworkings of the North-South Ministerial Council.  If we have time, I would ask Mr. Duffy to speak more generally and also to say a few words on the research programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111200002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Aingeal O&rsquo;Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605139200,"counter":486,"content":"<p>In respect of Senator Currie's point about communications, bringing in under-represented voices and the full diversity of views and opinion on the island is very important.

That will happen and we will certainly do everything we can to encourage.<\/p> <p>  In terms of specifics, we envisage an online presence, particularly to provide information and content from the dialogue series more broadly and also in the context of the research work.  When different research projects are concluded, we will work with the research partners to convene events, discussions and press and other media work in that regard in order to publicise the conclusions of the research and support broader engagement with those themes.  Those are some of the key points we would see in the context of communications.  As the different projects in terms of delivery on a shared island agenda are developed and delivered, there will be communication aspects around all of that.  I hope this provides a sense of the communications aspect.<\/p> <p>  Regarding research, we are finalising partnership co-operation with the ESRI to start producing research on some of the themes that were mentioned, particularly in respect of the all-island economy, health on the island and education.

Delivering some of the key connectivity and infrastructure projects will boost the attractiveness of those regions.  The shared island unit is about promoting and developing all these aspects.  Mr. Duffy mentioned the work on good jobs, the skills we have to meet the potential demand on the island and how we match that up.  We work on all of those areas.

It has got off to a really good start in terms of a work programme and looking at the practicalities and opportunities of uniting infrastructure and people across the island because it is fair to say that those were opportunities that were hard worked into the agreement but were not always realised.  There has been much focus on the when of synchronisation across the island rather than on the why and the how.  I look forward to seeing what the unit can produce in that regard.  People have covered all of the different areas relating to infrastructure, sustainability and health.  There is a real need to synchronise the two economies.  It is stunning how different they are and the different opportunities they provide workers with.  Some of that will be about waiting for the dust to settle from Brexit, which will inevitably create a recalibration over the next couple of years.  While the unit cannot drive a large amount of that economic regeneration, it can certainly pump-prime it in terms of investment by the Government.  I very much welcome the fact that it seems to be a moveable feast as in the unit is still looking for projects rather than a closed shop.<\/p> <p>  Senator Currie asked about areas I intended to explore in terms of the research unit.  The witnesses have set out the position in that regard.  Some of the value of the New Ireland Forum in the 1980s was related to putting good authoritative facts and figures into the public discourse.  This is very welcome.<\/p><p>There are just so many questions about challenges and opportunities that we do not really know what we are dealing with.  As I said, a lot of that is in flux because of Brexit; we cannot even calculate some of the basics.  It is also because of Covid and the radically different patterns of spending that is creating, as well as, for example, change prompted by climate, but that will be a really valuable part of the project.<\/p><p> I ask about the dialogue and engagement strand, which is really exciting and, again, seems to be very much in the right place regarding some of the demographics identified and even already brought in with the Taoiseach's speech.  I wanted to ask as well about harder to reach people and some of the opportunity that Covid maybe provides because we are talking about online engagement.  I worked on a project for an international NGO years ago about trying to get research from all sorts of people, and the driving thing was what if the cure to malnutrition was locked in the mind of somebody who could not afford an education?  In the same way, what if the answers to some of these issues are locked in the mind of somebody who is not part of a union of students or is not part of an identified demographic?  The fact we are going to be talking online really does potentially open things up.  Looking at the likes of the Citizens' Assemblies and the Citizens&rsquo; Convention on UK Democracy, their value was in the fact that it was kind of random, it did reach people who, as somebody else said, did not and are not necessarily those who put their hand up every time.  Is that something the officials have perhaps worked into their plan?  Obviously some of the responses are mad, but looking at the Scottish Government, it is harnessing some of this technology for everyday policy questions, literally throwing it open to the floor.  While there is some work in curating it and not all of the submissions will reach the next stage, is that something the officials can build on, really opening the dialogue to the crowds and to people who are not politically engaged in one or the other groups that might be reached or found by the project?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111200002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hanna","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Stephen Farry MP of the Alliance Party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111200002#H00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605139200,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I very much welcome the opportunity and it is good to see Ms O'Donoghue and Mr. Duffy again.  I had a good meeting with them only a few weeks ago in Belfast so I am happy to continue the dialogue.  It is important to get a sense of the potential of the shared island unit.  It is something I very much welcome and I welcome the comments made by An Taoiseach in his recent keynote address as well.  In addition to the dialogue issue, I am sensing that the main intervention here, not least given the relatively few staff the unit has, is one of steering and co-ordination and ensuring the different levers of Governments are pointing in the right direction in terms of maximising the degree of co-operation and collaboration that can happen on an all-island basis.<\/p> <p>  There are two angles I want to highlight today.  The first one is around what one might term protecting what we already have, with Brexit being the key threat in that respect.  The second angle is then some of the new opportunities we could take forward.  On Brexit itself, we still do not know whether we are talking about a no-deal situation or, hopefully and more realistically, some sort of flimsy deal with a lot of questions still unaddressed.  To what extent are there plans across Government essentially to revisit the mapping exercise that was done a couple of years ago that fed into the joint report of, I think, 2017, particularly given that we do not know exactly how the fallout from the decisions, or non-decisions, taken over the coming weeks will impact upon areas of co-operation?  I am mindful of things like the service economy which may be hindered and may not be addressed by a goods-based free trade agreement at this stage, and how we protect existing levels of interaction both in services and the flow of people across the Border due to life, work, sport and other things like that.<\/p> <p>  The second thing, which Ms O'Donoghue is already aware of, is around things like medicines.  Both Ms Hanna and I were at the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee yesterday talking about what is going to happen with medicine.  While we have potentially a 12-month derogation from the falsified medicines directive as part of the implementation of Brexit, beyond that we are likely to see a major reorientation of medicines supply chains into Northern Ireland through Ireland rather than through Great Britain.  Those impacts are issues that Governments across the island perhaps need to factor through how that is going to work in practice.  Very briefly, looking at some of the new opportunities, I echo the points made about climate change and around renewables.  I see that as being a major area where we can really scale up the level of North-South collaboration.<\/p> <p>  A grander one, if I could put it on people's radar, is around things like fire and rescue services.  I was speaking to the unions in Northern Ireland today and they were saying they have some bilateral arrangements with some counties in the South but it is not a uniform agreement across the island.  That is something where there could be a fairly quick early win where increased collaboration is concerned.<\/p> <p>  The final point is around the 2040 national planning framework, which is perhaps an area that needs to be revisited.  I apologise if I have put my two feet in it by raising that, given it is probably something that has been very carefully worked out to date.  It strikes me, however, that a lot of the fresh talk we are now seeing around North-South collaboration, such as on transport and the rail infrastructure, is not really factored into that document as strongly as it could be.  It is probably not looking sufficiently at the potential for collaboration on the island, and that may be something worth revisiting either by the Irish Government or by both Governments on the island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605139200,"counter":494,"content":"<p>For us, this is as much about us hearing from the members as it is about them hearing from me.  There was a lot of really valuable food for thought there from a whole range of people who have come in so far.  I just wanted to say that.  We will be very careful in taking away all the points that have been made here.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hanna mentioned synchronising the two economies and the Brexit piece.  On Brexit, some things we know already.  Even with a deal we know that Great Britain is outside the Single Market and the customs union and that Northern Ireland will operate under the terms of the protocol.  However, there is a whole range in there still, including depending on whether we have a deal or not, so that is kind of an unknown.  Certainly looking under the hood of the all-island economy, to put it that way, is something we really want to do and that will form a major part of our work, especially where research is concerned.   It is also about making that real so it is around the supply chains, how will those be affected and in what ways will they change.  Mr. Farry raised the services economy not being part of the protocol, which is exclusively about goods.  As such, what Ms Hanna, more elegantly than me, called the synchronisation and recalibration of the two economies, that kind of looking under the hood is a key part of what we need to do to build a pipeline for the future, which is what a lot of this is about.  On the research, which Ms Hanna mentioned and I think Mr. Duffy did as well, it will be about the research but about publishing our research so that that it will be available to everyone to inform ongoing debate and development.<\/p> <p>  On the mapping exercise, again, some of this is about knowing where we end up on the final Brexit outcomes.  There is no doubt about this, we all know it and it was the basis of the mapping exercise, that there are aspects of North-South co-operation that will become more challenging without a shared underpinning of a shared EU regulatory system.<\/p><p>That is what the mapping exercise did.  As part of every North-South Ministerial Council meeting, there is a standing item around that sectoral area and Brexit, which is one of the ways we assess it.  Into the future, those areas of North-South co-operation that are most impacted by Brexit and how we can put different scaffolding around them - I do not refer to institutional issues but rather what happens in respect of differing regulation and so on - will be an important part of our work.<\/p><p> There was a point on the national planning framework and other economic plans such as the national economic plan which was published this autumn.  Part of what we will do is mainstreaming much of this into the strategic planning that the Irish Government is taking forward.  We will want to see more North-South, all-island issues appearing in those documents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111200002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Aingeal O&rsquo;Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605139200,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I will add two points to Ms Hanna's suggestion around getting as broad and as deep a base of suggestions and contributions.

I wish to reinforce Deputy Conway-Walsh's remarks about formal engagement with the Oireachtas.  The unit is within the Department of the Taoiseach.  As those of us in the Seanad and on this committee do not always get the opportunity to engage directly with the Taoiseach, it is crucial that we keep up momentum from this very welcome engagement.  I know the Chairman will seek to drive that i the future.<\/p> <p>  I also welcome the opportunity to hear from the officials today and their willingness to listen to the committee.  However, when will we get to the stage that we would see terms of reference for the unit that are clearly identified in order to help inform our work to better engage with it? <\/p> <p>  Ms O'Donoghue mentioned the programme for Government and identifying the priorities in it.  An example of a great way of sharing the island which was identified is the proposed referendum on presidential voting rights being extended to citizens in the North.  I am keen to hear if Ms O'Donoghue sees that as falling in the remit of the shared island unit, as well as other aspects of the Government.  I am sure it could feature on the dialogue series in the future, which Mr. Duffy mentioned.  <\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach raised the work of cross-border bodies in relation to the unit.  Others have touched on some issues where we could collaborate.  Senator McGahon mentioned the greenways and Ms O'Donoghue said there was some engagement on that with the North.  Currently, Tourism Ireland is an all-Ireland body and then there are the two different tourism boards on the island.  One crazy by-product of partition is the ending of the Wild Atlantic Way in Donegal, and the end of Ireland's Ancient East around the Chairman's and Senator McGahon's part of the country.  Changing that would be a very positive proposition, if we can engage with how to go beyond merely connecting greenways.<\/p> <p>  This point is probably mostly for Mr. Duffy.  Article 2 of the Constitution allows for everyone born on the island to be part of the Irish nation.  That is a foundation stone for the work of this shared island unit, as it is already in existence.  One of the really important things that the unit could do is to have a dialogue or series of engagements and some serious thought as to how the Irish Government, acting within its capacity, could give further effect to Article 2 without reinventing the wheel.  What mechanisms can be brought forward in order that we greater share the nation, as identified within Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and the provision that already exists in giving everyone on the island the right and opportunity to be part of that nation?  That might be a question for a broader dialogue but it is one that I would like to advance in the joint committee's engagement with the unit.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111200002#J00400","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Donoghue and Mr. Duffy for their presentation.  The Community Foundation for Ireland will provide over &euro;15 million in grants to communities.  They are exploring future all-Ireland co-operation between community, voluntary and charity groups post Brexit.  It has contacted some of us for clarification on the role the unit emphasises for civic society engagement; the possible role for philanthropy, and facilitating such all-island engagement between groups; and the willingness of the Government to use matched funding opportunities between the public and private sector to support civic engagement, in particular in those communities most impacted by the Border.  It has been announced the reconciliation funding through the Department of Foreign Affairs will be realigned.  Is the Government in a position to provide an update on this?  If answers to these are not to hand today, the witnesses can email a response.<\/p> <p>  The presentation referred to the research project with the ESRI.  More specific to the Community Foundation for Ireland's questions is the work that was going to be carried out by the National Economic and Social Council.  Built into that is engagement with civic society groups.  I look forward to a response on that.<\/p> <p>  Access to the north west has been mentioned.  It is accepted, without myself or Senator Blaney being parochial, that nowhere on the island has been more affected by partition than the region now known as the north west city region, encompassing Donegal and the Derry City and Strabane District Council area.<\/p><p>A crucial objective for us is to have improvement in rail, road and air infrastructure in the region.  My concern about comments that have been made about rail is that the talk is about the Belfast-Dublin-Cork connections.  The difficulty is, where does that connect to Sligo, Donegal and Derry?  With the focus on climate change and all those challenges, rail has come back onto the agenda again after being parked in recent years.  There is the campaign in the west of Ireland on the western track.  I believe there is a ready-made campaign in the west to connect from Cork up to Derry.  That would be critical to our region.  I seek clarification on early thinking about that.<\/p><p> The funding of the A5 has been raised.  It is important that when that project finally gets over the line next year, the money is available to move it forward quickly.  There is also the support for the City of Derry Airport.  Some 40% of the passengers who use City of Derry Airport are from Donegal, which is a large percentage.  There has been no financial support from the Irish Government for almost a decade.  It is unacceptable.  It is not just about connecting Derry to Dublin, but connecting the world to Derry and the north-west region.  One can fly into Dublin or Belfast and get a connecting flight.  It is about interconnectivity by air, so I cannot stress enough the importance of supporting the City of Derry Airport under this shared island approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111200002#J00500","speaker":"1463","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I will just deal with some housekeeping.

Given the time, we might not be able to reply to all of them, but we will note them and, where appropriate, revert to the committee.  Then we will hear the three speakers.  I will be brief and just check-mark a few things.<\/p> <p>  The referendum on presidential voting rights is a key priority for the Government.  The Bill is now back before the Oireachtas.  However, I have made a point a few times.  There are initiatives and work that will contribute to a shared island where we will play a role, but they also might have a home elsewhere in the Government.  The presidential voting rights referendum is being led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We will co-operate with them, but they will take the lead.  It is moving forward and is now back in the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  I note the points on tourism.  I have to say we have not engaged much.  In terms of sectoral issues, tourism is one we still have to turn our minds to properly.  Regarding engagement with the Oireachtas and political parties, there is a piece of work in that regard that we are still thinking through from our point of view.  Part of our purpose today when invited to the meeting was to hear from the members.  For us, an important strand to see happening is the North-South parliamentary engagement.  The North-South parliamentary forum has had a checkered history in terms of stop-start and so forth, but whether it is in a formal forum or otherwise, having some way and more advanced mechanisms on North-South parliamentary engagement would be very important.  We are also open to thinking more about how we would engage with the committee, both by coming here periodically to report on progress but also in terms of engagement.  For the present, we see the dialogues as being very much a civic society and NGO engagement, but we then need to find a way to build in political engagement as well.  In addition, we are always happy to talk, and have a great deal of contact already, in Northern Ireland with the Assembly parties.  We are also happy to engage here as well.<\/p> <p>  On the rail matter, I do not wish to make policy pronouncements that are a matter for the Minister for Transport, but I can safely say two things.  First, there is now a Minister for Transport in the Republic who is highly committed to rail travel.  Second, there is work ongoing to extend the examination of the high-speed rail link - we are still at the feasibility study stage - to extend that to include Derry.  That is part of the thinking at this stage.<\/p> <p>  Does Mr. Duffy wish to comment on a few matters?

It is an example of a part of society which is ready, willing, engaged and keen to contribute significantly in this area, which is very encouraging.  The broader point the foundation raises on civil society engagement is simply that civil society engagement is absolutely central to all this.  For anybody who was able to tune in on 22 October to the Taoiseach's launch, there were active, constructive and forward looking contributions from a representative from The Wheel and from other civil society representatives on the island.  We will be doing everything we can to foster and support that.<\/p> <p>  On research, which was raised by Deputy Conway-Walsh, we will be looking closely with the Departments and agencies in government to ensure that the research work is integrated very much with their current policy and research work.  It is another point about working on a whole-of-government basis in that regard.  We will be updating regularly on the research and, as Ms O'Donoghue said, that will be published from work with the ESRI and NESC as well as any other research on issues that is undertaken.<\/p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised interesting points regarding presidential voting and Article 2 of the Constitution.

We cannot talk about a shared island without inevitably talking about Brexit.  As I was listening to everyone, I thought about how the conversation on Brexit descended into really deep division and a very contentious issue.  One can see how that is now playing out.  I am certainly not saying this is a precursor to a referendum that may happen on this island, but having that vision, working towards a shared vision of the island and creating an underpinning of hope are very important when we see how deeply divisive and corrosive the Brexit debate became.  I commend having that space of hope, which is so important.<\/p> <p>  I wish to take a moment to reflect on the student movement.  What is particularly interesting about it is that the vast majority of the current students will have been born after the Good Friday Agreement.  There is a collective body of young people who have an experience of living on this island which is in a completely different time and space.  I draw attention to the National Union of Students-Union of Students in Ireland, NUS-USI, a cross-Border link between the UK and the Republic of Ireland that is promoting student unity.  That has been going since 1972 with the trilateral meetings which happen three times a year.  I used to attend them.  The NUS-USI did some research in January 2019 and a big issue that came up for students, the vast majority of whom had been born after the Good Friday Agreement, was a real fear about a lack of cohesion and a threat to safety on the island.  The research was conducted by European Movement Ireland, NUS and USI.  Students across the island have this fear, which is quite striking given the age profile.  I wish to flag that.<\/p> <p>  In addition, education is a key issue.  Members of the student movement felt that education was not high on the list of priorities during the Brexit negotiations and they are fearful about what is going to happen to the education sector in Northern Ireland and across the island.<\/p><p>Education attainment is a great leveller.  There is a real fear for the future of education, so I thought I would flag that that space be perhaps explored and articulated through either the student movement or its representatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2020111200002#K00500","speaker":"1663","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":506,"content":"<p>We are talking about a shared island.

The point about the post-Good Friday Agreement generation was in the Taoiseach's speech and is at the heart of our first dialogue.  We have not talked about education as much as we should have.  It is a key priority for us.  To reassure the committee, we are working with both the Department of Education and the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, is very engaged on this issue.  Part of this goes back to the north west, the university and higher education provision more generally in the region.  To respond to one of the earlier points made, we have met with the two CEOs of the Donegal and Derry and Strabane local authorities and will continue an engagement through the north west as well.<\/p> <p>  As to what engagement the Taoiseach had before his speech, he had spoken in the margins of the North-South Ministerial Council, for example, to both the First Minister and the deputy First Minister about his plans and his thinking around the shared island initiative.  We have engaged with a variety of people.  This is a two-way street.  We look forward and hope we can create a space where everyone will feel comfortable engaging with us.  We have had quite bit of engagement with civic unionism and, although I do not want to put words in people's mouths, a level of response that we have found heartening.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Senator Craughwell's point that capital projects do not build communities, again, this is a multi-stranded approach.  We have talked a lot about the funding.  The provision of a ring-fenced shared island fund is one of the biggest new elements of the shared island initiative, but that is just one strand.  The dialogues are about creating and building a community and a sense of community on the island.  The ongoing work in a range of other Departments, including from the reconciliation fund, etc., is all part of that.  It is important to understand that this is a multi-stranded approach and that doing one thing, namely capital funding, does not mean that nothing else is being done.  This is about fostering inclusive dialogue, which is at the heart of the initiative.  As to what is new, the ring-fenced funding is very new.  It is about re-energising the agenda on the island in terms of all-island co-operation and a very deliberate, careful approach to developing and fostering inclusive dialogue.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious of the time.

My name is Fiona Quinn and I am the assistant secretary of the Department&rsquo;s corporate division.  I am accompanied today by Damian Allen, the principal officer who heads up our strategic business support unit.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with the Public Service Management Act 1997, each Secretary General is required to prepare and submit a strategy statement to their Minister within six months of the appointment of a new Minister.  Work has, therefore, commenced on the preparation of the Department&rsquo;s new statement of strategy to cover the period 2021 to 2025.  The statement will comprise the mission statement, strategic goals, key objectives and actions of the Department and will serve as a framework for the Department over the period.  The Programme for Government <i>- <\/i>Our Shared Future, will be a cornerstone of the new strategy, but it will also take account of overarching national strategies and plans, including Project Ireland 2040 - National Planning Framework, and the climate action plan.<br\/><br\/>To ensure that relevant strategies and plans are considered and reflected in the statement of strategy, the Department undertakes a consultation process with stakeholders and interested parties, including the committee.  Observations were sought from local authorities, relevant State agencies and other Departments.  The consultation process also involved a public consultation.We have received a total of 36 submissions, the majority of which came from stakeholder bodies operating in the fields of housing, planning, water and heritage.  In addition to the observations received from other Departments, these include extensive submissions on planning policy, housing policy and delivery from Age Action Ireland, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, Apartment Owners' Network, Community Law and Mediation, COPE Galway, the Disability Federation of Ireland, Inclusion Ireland, the Land Development Agency, Simon Communities of Ireland and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Observations regarding water policy were received from the Water Advisory Board, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, the Environmental Protection Agency, Ervia and Irish Water.  A number of submissions addressed multiple areas within the Department&rsquo;s remit.  Each of these will be reviewed and recommendations within the submissions will be considered for inclusion in the new strategy.<br\/><br\/>The proposed format of the new strategy will be similar to the current one.  The main chapters will reflect the Department&rsquo;s high-level business functions or programme areas.  These will correspond to the programmes in the Revised Estimates Volume, namely, housing, planning, local government, water, heritage and Met &Eacute;ireann.  This approach ensures that the statement of strategy complements the financial information in the Revised Estimates Volume.In keeping with the commitment in the programme for Government, all new departmental strategy statements must have climate action included as a core pillar.  This will include, but not be limited to, how the Department intends to ensure delivery of the climate action plan and the increased climate action ambition in the programme for Government, as well as the ways in which the Department can lead by example in reducing emissions.  We will also have particular regard to: cross-cutting priorities included in the programme for Government or agreed at Cabinet committees; overarching budgetary and policy frameworks including the national digital strategy, open data strategy, etc; public service reform plans; workforce planning; and obligations under the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014 to assess and report on human rights and equality issues.  Our intention is to have the final document ready to submit to the Minister at the end of November.  We would welcome members' comments and suggestions regarding the statement of strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Quinn.

Statements on strategy are important for the period 2021 to 2025.  All of us have a role working with local authorities to provide the best service we can to people.  There are many issues I wish to address in the Department's strategy to deal with local authorities.<\/p> <p>  I heard this morning that millions of euro worth of funding has been announced for Irish Water.  I have concerns about Irish Water and local authorities.  While Irish Water is an entity, local authorities play less of a part.  There needs to be much more engagement between local authorities and Irish Water.  There is an issue there.  If a local authority wants to get a pipe fixed, everything has to go to Irish Water and then come back to local authorities.  The timescale is long and plans are delayed.  There needs to be more engagement with Irish Water and that needs to be a part of the strategy.<\/p> <p>  There was an excellent meeting of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters yesterday which heard about the concerns of the disability sector and how disabled people feel they have been forgotten in this strategy.  They feel there is no strategy for accommodating disabilities in the local authorities and in general.  That is an area to address.  Mental health is another.  We are going though the Covid-19 pandemic and there is not a designated person in each local authority equipped to deal with people who are presenting with mental health issues.  In 2021, someone needs to be assigned to every local authority, or a training course given, so that local authorities can deal with the needs of people.<\/p> <p>  There are no criteria in respect of homelessness.  I can only speak from my own experience but I know people in homeless accommodation.  I have seen people on housing lists whose need was not as urgent get housed before the homeless.  There are 31 local authorities.  Do they all have different strategies and do things differently?  Are there absolute criteria?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111200002#B00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":534,"content":"<p>The Deputy has two and a half minutes left.

It was announced approximately two years ago and no one is able to use it.<\/p> <p>  The following is something about which I have a real bugbear.  Do our guests feel that the general data protection regulation, GDPR, is sometimes used as a tool against obtaining information?  We all welcome people's privacy and know that we have to be respectful but when one goes looking for certain information, one is told that it is not available under GDPR.  It is a tool.  Do we need to look at a local authority strategy to tackle that?<\/p> <p>  I again thank our guests.

My colleague, Mr. Allen, and I are on the corporate side of the Department so we might not be able to answer the specific detail of some of the issues raised by the Deputy.  I can reassure the Deputy about the relationship between the Department, local authorities and Irish Water.  It is a key priority.  The Irish Water reform programme will continue in the years ahead.  That will become even more important and will absolutely be reflected in the strategy statement.<\/p> <p>  To make a general point that the Deputy will be familiar with, the programme for Government outlines over 200 actions for this Department to implement during the lifetime of the Government.  Some of those actions will address many of the issues that the Deputy has raised.  There is a continued focus on Housing First, which recognises the holistic support that people need, particularly on the mental health issue.  The disability funding schemes that we run are also called out and will be reflected in the statement of strategy.<\/p> <p>  From the Department's perspective, we have a role as data controllers under GDPR.  We have a role whereby we are joint controllers with local authorities.  That arises in respect of many of our housing schemes in particular, as the Deputy can imagine, and we must ensure that the GDPR requirements are implemented.  From all of our perspectives, even though it has been in place for a couple of years now, it is still a relatively new requirement and many things are still bedding down.  It is important that we recognise our responsibilities in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111200002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I would ask Ms Quinn to finish there because we have a five-minute limit.

I suppose, in some senses, today's discussion is less about policy because that is really for the Minister and the programme for Government.  This is more about how the Department sets out those policies in a strategic statement.  I will restrict my questions to those areas rather than policy areas because that is for another meeting.<\/p> <p>  Many of us are interested, in the first instance, to know what is the status of Rebuilding Ireland as the framework within which the most recent strategy was set.  Is that to expire at the end of 2021?  Is it to be replaced next year?  Can Ms Quinn give us a little bit of information about that?  That is about the strategic context but also the messaging context.  There is a separate website and communications strategy and all of that for Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Data protection is the other big issue.  One of the roles of this committee, as our guests know, is to monitor the implementation of the commitments and strategies in the programme for Government.  We have had many disputes around data over the past number of years.  We are aware that the Department deals with phenomenal volumes of data but sometimes the way in which data are presented or the timing of data can make it genuinely difficult for the committee to properly scrutinise.  Is that something the Department is reviewing?  Do our guests have thoughts on that in the context of the strategy?<\/p> <p>  Monitoring is exactly the point.  One of the best reports the Department produces is the social housing construction pipeline report.  It is a very detailed piece of work that lets us all know, per project and local authority area, where construction is in the pipeline.  It would be really great to have the same report for, for example, the Traveller accommodation programmes or other key aspects of delivery such as affordable housing through the serviced sites fund.  Is that possible?<\/p> <p>  The other challenge that many of us have is obtaining data.  Many of us are really interested in the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme.  The Department publishes data but not always in ways that allows us to compare the number of applicants with the number of approvals and drawdowns, etc.  How is the Department looking at reviewing and rethinking the presentation of that data? I know that there has been increased involvement with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, in some of the research.  If we had better, cleaner, simpler data, it would allow us to properly track all of those things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111200002#B00700","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605139200,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The data piece is one of my areas of responsibility.  It is three or three and a half years since we established a statistics and data analytics unit in the Department.  Many of the improvements that have been seen in recent years have come from the availability of experts to help us manage the data.  The volume of data with which we deal has grown exponentially.  As our activities grow, the volume of our data grows.  We absolutely recognise that there is a need for continued improvement in that area.  The Department is currently working on a data strategy to drive continued reform.  There has been much improvement but we certainly acknowledge that there is further to go on that journey and the statement of departmental strategy will call out the focus on a data strategy for the period ahead.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about Rebuilding Ireland and its future.  There is a good 13 months left in the strategy and much delivery to come in that time.  We will be turning our minds to that early next year.  The programme for Government, as I said, calls out a considerable amount of objectives and actions for the Department but we will have to turn our minds to the specific status of Rebuilding Ireland early next year.<\/p> <p>  I think that is probably all I have to say.  As I noted in my opening statement, there are also overarching data pieces.  We are engaged with and embedded in the open data strategy and the Government's data strategies.

I highly recommend that as a practice that could be returned to, because it was really useful.<\/p> <p>  One of the frustrations faced by all Deputies on the committee is that when we look for data on outputs from local authorities in respect of policies funded and driven by the Department, we are told the Department does not collate that information.

They feel they are getting caught up in red tape and there is a lack of clarity on whether they are still eligible.<\/p> <p>  I would love to learn more about the national digital strategy and the national open data strategy.  I am particularly interested in plans for digitalisation in areas such as making and paying for planning permission submissions online.  I refer to streamlining that process and allowing for more online interfacing.  Last week, we had other officials from the Department and from An Bord Plean&aacute;la before the committee regarding strategic housing developments, SHDs.

I would also like some more information regarding the role of the Department in helping Irish Water to grow its workforce.  Perhaps the officials can clarify whether people are likely to be redeployed and, if so, it will be done voluntarily.<\/p> <p>  I noted the Department's briefing note referred to its important role in supporting and enabling democracy.

The interesting thing is that with all the challenges Covid-19 might have caused across the State, one of the potential benefits has been the acceleration of activity in digitisation.  We have seen that ourselves.  Almost overnight, we managed to move the majority of our staff off site and seamlessly continued to provide services.  It is an area on which we will see a huge focus, and there is a commitment to that in the strategy statement.<br\/><br\/>I will link that aspect in with the Deputy's question on the electoral register because that is a key project we will see coming up.  Regarding our engagement with the committee, the programme for Government commits to several reforms in the area of electoral policy, including the establishment of an electoral commission and the modernisation of the electoral registration process.  Those are two issues we are progressing well.  It happens to be my area of responsibility as well, so I know the detail.  We expect in early December to provide the committee with a general scheme of a Bill to effect and implement some changes in this area.  We look forward to detailed engagement with the committee on the initiative.  One of the parts of the electoral registration modernisation programme is that it is much bigger than just the online reform aspect; there will also be an optional online element to the project.  It will be very much about learning from the experience of the Dublin local authorities and their use of .  We have engaged with those authorities to try to learn from that experience.  We hope we will be able to build on that and roll out that capability across the country.  It is a big IT project, as the Deputies can imagine.  I do not want to waste too much time on this topic today because we will be in to talk to the committee about this in detail before too long, hopefully.  A roll-out of an IT project of that nature will take some time, but it is certainly in our sights.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the role of the Department in the area of water provision, again I will get some of my colleagues to respond to the Deputy in more detail.  The Department, however, has a role that is similar to the role it has with the rest of our agencies and local authorities.  I refer to setting policies and supporting, engaging and overseeing activity in our areas of responsibilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111200002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Quinn.

I do not have any questions.  I am just going to make some comments regarding this subject.  The outgoing strategic statement was excellent.  Its layout was excellent, as was the way it was possible to measure its delivery.  I greatly appreciate the Department and its engagement with this committee in the last four years.  It was exemplary and much talked about across all the Oireachtas committees, and I hope that will continue.  We had strong engagement and a strong professional working relationship with the staff of the Department.  I also acknowledge and thank the outgoing Secretary General, John McCarthy, and all his assistant secretaries for their work and engagement.  It really contributed to a positive attitude in this committee and in the Department.  I must state that point.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to some key issues, I note that Ms Quinn spoke in her presentation about climate action.  There must be a strong emphasis on the sustainable development goals.  That is an important feature, and it recognises the three-legged aspect of this Government, namely, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, and their priorities.  It also ties in with the agreed programme for Government.  I would now like to leave some comments on key issues with Ms Quinn.<\/p> <p>  We should not lose sight of Oireachtas engagement.  I would also like to see great emphasis in the strategy on that aspect.  I refer to legitimate engagement with this committee and with the public representatives who represent their constituents across the country.  It is important that we keep sight of the need for timely responses to representations.<\/p> <p>  Open government is and should always be to the fore.  I would like to see an emphasis in the strategy on how the Department and its officials will promote open government because that is an important part of any democracy.  I would also like to see greater emphasis and focus on freedom of information, and how people can see it.  That needs to be clearly stated in the strategy.  We need to facilitate and not frustrate people seeking clarification or freedom of information, and that happens from the top down.  It is not that people are agitators, objectors or asking questions for vexatious reasons.  It is important that we support openness and transparency in local government.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to see an emphasis on and stronger clarity regarding language concerning protected disclosures.  It will be recalled, and known, that there is an obligation on every Department to keep a register of protected disclosures and have an open process to facilitate access to those open disclosures.  A freedom of information log is required in every Department as well.  In the last few days, I took the liberty of looking at some Departments, and some have not posted that information for two years.  There is a statutory obligation on every Department to have a freedom of information log on its website.  I would like a focus to be kept on that area.  I am not suggesting anything about the witnesses' Department, because it is one of the better ones.<\/p> <p>  I also want to address the issue of what is in a name.  For some reason the Department, the civil servants, the Government or someone else took a decision to drop the word \"housing\" from the name of the Department.<\/p><p>It is a key word in the work.  As I still have time, I ask for some background on this.  We used to have the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I did not see why we could not have added \"heritage\" to it.  It is very important.  I ask the powers that be to look again at incorporating the word \"housing\" into the name of the Department.  These are just comments and I am not asking the witnesses to feed back too much.  I thank the witnesses and the staff in the Department for the very positive engagement they have had with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111200002#C00800","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for those observations.

According to Ms Quinn's opening statement, a key part of the strategy will be about the climate action plan.  When we look at the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis, the agency at the forefront, in terms of biodiversity, is the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  From my experience, it is hugely committed and has capable staff with great expertise and passion in the area but it is heavily under-resourced.  With regard to what we need to do in terms of biodiversity, it is absolutely critical that the National Parks and Wildlife Service is much better resourced.  Some of the NGO commentators have the view it should have something in the region of between four to eight times the amount of funding and resources it has.  When we look at the work done, for example, by the Environmental Protection Agency, we see that today it has been able to call out Irish Water on wastewater discharges.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service is not able to do this type of work.  It does not have this type of public education role to be able to hold people to account and be capable of stronger enforcement.

Interestingly, it has increased the number of staff in the Department by more than 50%.  It is a very big function to move into the Department.  We are working really well with it and there has been a very good beginning with regard to settling it in and integrating it into the Department.

It is very important that we get this strategy document right and that the strategy for the Department reflects the significant challenges facing the country in terms of Covid, climate action and Brexit but also reflects the fact we have a new Government made up of three very distinct parties.<\/p><p>Significant effort was put into agreeing a programme for Government with shared objectives.  The Department's strategy must reflect it so it is important that we do not just have a business as usual approach and a refreshing of the previous strategy document but instead have a new departure and a new strategy that reflects the shared objectives of this Government.  It is critical that it reasserts the State's role in the provision of social infrastructure, the protection of our natural resources and serving our communities in terms of local democracy.  <\/p><p> When I go through the last strategy document, and I presume the witnesses will attempt to mirror somewhat the sections, in terms of housing, there was a specific question about the referendum on housing.  While I accept that this is a strategy document so it will not call out a date for a referendum on the right to housing, it must mention the very clear actions that have been identified in the programme for Government.  There are over 200 of them that, as was noted by the witnesses, this Department will be responsible for delivering so the strategy must reflect that level of that responsibility and also reflect that level of commitment.  In terms of housing, the strategy must state that the State is going to reassert its role in the provision of housing, a referendum on housing, the provision of public housing on public land and the provision of affordable housing.  The previous document spoke about renting and improving the rental sector.  We need something much more ambitious than just saying we are going to improve the rental sector.  We must say that we are going to deliver affordable rental and secure tenure in sustainable homes.  If this strategy is not ambitious like that, delivery will fall far short of what people demand of us.  <\/p><p> The planning section needs to call out significant important planning objectives around planning for the marine and wind energy.  We have all collectively agreed that the SHDs have failed to deliver housing.  They did deliver accelerated planning decisions.  We welcome that but the planning section needs to talk about not just achieving efficiency but also quality in planning decisions.  <\/p><p> In terms of local government, a number of referenda are mentioned but local government is key to local communities and citizens so we must champion local government in the strategy.  The Department must do so over the next four years in terms of its strategy and its ability to deliver for its citizens, housing and planning.  Our local authority members are the hardest working public representatives in the country.  The Department's strategy must call out a commitment to supporting our local authority members and working over the next four years to do that.  <\/p><p> We all know that water is a precious and finite resource.  We need to very much call that out in our strategy and identify how we are going to ensure that is asserted.  I appreciate that heritage is a new Department but it is a 50% increase in the Department's staff so I am really interested in seeing how we will incorporate heritage in the next draft strategy.  <\/p><p> Was an evaluation of the previous strategy carried out that identifies achievement against objectives and if so, can we get a copy?  What are the next steps?  There is a target for a strategy to be agreed within six months so the clock is really ticking.  Will we get a draft of it before it is published?  Will it come back to the committee?  How will that work?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020111200002#D01800","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1605139200,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I wish to reassure the Senator that the programme for Government will be the cornerstone of the statement of strategy.

I am joined this morning by three of my colleagues from the Department, Ms Marguerite Ryan, Mr. Eamonn Waters and Mr. Patrick O'Sullivan.  I will quickly run through the opening statement I have circulated.  I will be happy to answer any questions.<\/p> <p>  It is just over a month since I had the opportunity to meet with the committee to discuss the 2020 Estimate for my Department in its totality.  I thank the committee members for their engagement on that occasion and for facilitating this meeting at very short notice.  I will keep these remarks short and focus on the &euro;432 million of additional funding to be added to the overall provision for my Department.<\/p> <p>  The Estimate I put before the committee in October detailed my Department's budget for 2020.  This totalled some &euro;5.036 billion.  I will now outline the changes contained in the Supplementary Estimate before the committee today.  An additional &euro;300 million is to be allocated to the Local Government Fund; Irish Water is to receive an extra &euro;44 million in capital expenditure and &euro;28 million in current expenditure; and an additional &euro;60 million in current expenditure will be allocated to addressing homelessness.  This additional expenditure comes to a total of &euro;432 million, which brings the Department's ceiling to &euro;5.468 billion, just over &euro;3.078 billion in current spending and &euro;2.390 billion on the capital side.<\/p> <p>  Reducing homelessness continues to be my absolute priority and I know it is a priority of all the members of this committee.  In October I provided the committee with an overview of funding and activity of the housing programmes in 2020.  My Department is continuing all programmes at pace.  My own homelessness task force meets on a regular basis with NGOs and our delivery partners in that sector.  Our priorities are to ensure that the greatest possible number of new homes can be provided to households across all delivery streams this year; to maximise the output of additional resources allocated under the July stimulus, which particularly focused on the voids programme we covered in detail at our last meeting; to continue the wide range of grant schemes where possible and safe; to ensure that new supply pipelines are developed in parallel; and to maintain support for teams continuing off-site activity to the highest possible degree.<\/p> <p>  We are deploying capital and current funding to all these critical areas.  Looking back at the 2020 budget in comparison to today's Supplementary Estimate, I note that we will be spending an extra &euro;100 million on homeless services this year, and rightly so.  That shows the absolute priority that the Government, my Department and I have afforded to this issue.  We will not be found wanting next year either.  As sought, today's Supplementary Estimate includes &euro;60 million under the homelessness subhead.  This will increase the provision for 2020 to a total of &euro;256 million.  As I mentioned, the original budget allocation for homelessness accommodation and related services was &euro;166 million.  This increase represents just under &euro;100 million in additional expenditure. <\/p> <p>  Significant additional costs have been incurred during the year due to Covid-19.  This expenditure was undertaken to ensure the safety of individuals and households accessing emergency homeless accommodation.  This additional funding will ensure that these vital services remain in place for the remainder of this year.  This additional funding will also ensure that enhanced services remain available, particularly intensive outreach services and increased capacity for rough sleepers as we face the winter period.  It will enable a continued focus on preventing homelessness in the first instance while also ensuring that pathways out of homelessness and into permanent accommodation are secured as quickly as possible for those individuals and families in emergency accommodation.  It will support the operation of family hubs and other supported facilities for single individuals.  We will also continue with the call for housing, an initiative I put in place in July which purchases properties on an exceptional basis, specifically focused on the homeless community and particularly on singles.  The number of single people who are homeless and the lack of appropriate accommodation for them remain as challenges for this State.<\/p><p>Good progress has been made to date.  Many people are being prevented from entering homelessness and exit numbers are improving.  It is important that we build on this work and provide the necessary resources for it to continue.  We have done so in budget 2021 with significant additional funding next year for homeless services and, in particular, &euro;3.3 billion on the housing side to provide more public housing than has ever been delivered in the history of the State.  It is entirely appropriate that supplementary funding now be provided for the homelessness budget in 2020.<\/p><p> Water services is an important issue.  More than &euro;1.2 billion has been voted, involving slightly less than &euro;600 million on the current side and &euro;635 million on capital.  This is a priority for me on the basis that Irish Water suffered from reduced investment between 2019 and 2021 and that is something we need to reverse.  In July, the Government brought forward an additional &euro;43 million in capital stimulus, providing &euro;30 million for Irish Water&rsquo;s leakage reduction programme and &euro;13 million for capital maintenance work.  Much of that work is under way and nearing completion.  An additional &euro;44 million was announced as part of budget 2021.  This targets investment in a number of key areas and will lead to investment that sustains and generates employment.  It will involve work across all 26 counties, accelerate the delivery of essential major infrastructure and future-proof the network for growth.<\/p><p> I am bringing before the committee an additional &euro;28 million in current expenditure.  This arises from an income shortfall of approximately &euro;50 million from non-domestic customers in 2020 due to Covid-related impacts on businesses.  That &euro;28 million is provided for in the Supplementary Estimates being dealt with today.  The capital and current supplementary requirement for Irish Water is to ensure the continued underpinning of the overall investment in water and waste water services as planned for under Project Ireland 2040.<\/p><p> On the Local Government Fund, I have proposed the significant amount of &euro;300 million to deal with the extension of the rates waiver for a further three months.  The Government has been committed to supporting the SME sector.  This additional funding means a total allocation in respect of the rates waiver of &euro;900 million, which has been welcomed by businesses and employers across the country.  We needed to ensure that the hole created in this important funding for local government was filled.  In total, 100% of that &euro;900 million will go back into the local government sector.<\/p><p> My Department is currently working with local authority representatives to ascertain the scale of other Covid-related income losses and expenditure.  It is expected that flexibility within the &euro;900 million allocation will be sufficient to cover rates losses and to partially cover the loss of non-rates income and the cost to local authorities of responding to the pandemic.  We have had detailed discussions with the chief executives and local authorities.  The package I am bringing to the committee has been welcomed by them.  It will ensure there is no deficit in local government funding this year and shows good cause into next year, when we will have access to the Covid contingency fund if required.  Local government is important to us.  We have seen the incredible work that has been done by local government staff all over the country.  One clear example of that is the community call programme.  The local authorities have incurred significant additional work and expenditure in ensuring citizens can go about their daily lives as safely as possible during the pandemic.  I take this opportunity to commend the local authorities on the work they have done.  It is a priority for me to confirm this funding as a matter of urgency in order that local authorities can move on and agree their 2021 budgets.  Many of them will start their budgetary meetings next week.  I think Laois County Council is the only one to have held its budget meeting.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for facilitating this meeting at very short notice.  It clearly feeds into the budgetary process for our colleagues in local government.  I have kept my remarks as brief as possible and tried to cover as much as I can in that short time.  I am happy to take any questions and answer them as well as I can.  If there is any issue on which I and my officials cannot answer in detail today, I commit to members that we will take notes of same and respond directly to the Deputy on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020111200002#A00400","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":579,"content":"<p>The three areas provided for in the Supplementary Estimates are of significant importance.

It is great to see that level of investment in tackling it.  I appreciate that everything costs more due to Covid and health and safety and I understand that current expenditure is a priority in homelessness, but is any capital expenditure being allocated to homelessness in the Supplementary Estimates?  Two of the priorities outlined by the Minister are delivering the greatest number of new homes for households this year and providing new supply pipelines.  How will this funding help to achieve that?<\/p> <p>  I welcome the rates waiver totalling &euro;900 million, which provides for an extension of the waiver from the end of September to the end of December.

On her second question, the rates waiver has been significant.  As I stated, it has had a positive impact on businesses.  The Government wishes to keep businesses going through the pandemic.  There was positive news earlier in the week and it is hoped we will be able to get back to some degree of real normality next year.  The rates waiver is about keeping businesses alive.  It is just one aspect of the supports that are available.  There are also the wage subsidy schemes, restart grants and other measures.  We are looking at the ways in which we may have to support businesses into next year.  I do not envisage a blanket rates waiver early next year.  We would have to be more targeted in that regard.  That work is ongoing and has not been concluded.<\/p> <p>  On homelessness, the additional &euro;60 million funding in the Supplementary Estimates relates to current spending.  We had to do several things at the height of the pandemic.  We moved money from other subheads to spend it specifically on homelessness.  Much of that was around providing additional capacity, particularly in emergency services.  Additional bed capacity was provided to de-congregate settings and allow for social distancing among our homeless community and those in emergency accommodation.  We do not talk about cocooning any more, but we provided for shielding for some of our community and provided wrap-around services and supports.<\/p> <p>  The housing budget for next year is &euro;3.3 billion, with a two to one ratio on capital versus current.  The big focus of that is on capital expenditure and building public homes.  Our target next year is to provide 12,750 homes, 9,500 of which will be built.  They will be public social homes.  We are targeting a figure of 6,000 people exiting homelessness next year, which will be significant and an increase on the number this year.  Thankfully, many people have been prevented from going into homelessness this year as a result of our investment in homelessness services.  For example, we have put additional resources into the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  Deputy Higgins and many other Deputies who are present supported the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act passed by the House in July, which provided additional supports to protect people from eviction.  The Residential Tenancies Act received cross-party support and is about protecting people during the level 5 restrictions due to the pandemic.  We have seen a continued decrease in homeless numbers.<\/p><p>We want to accelerate that decrease through provision of permanent accommodation, and that is what we are focusing on.<\/p><p> We are continuing with our voids programme at pace in order to get 2,500 units back in use this year and, if not actually occupied, then allocated.  Every single local authority across the country has a specific target from me and my Department that they must meet by December.  A sizeable proportion of those voids will be going to people on the homeless lists.  That is coupled with the Call for Housing which I announced just a few weeks after I took over as Minister, which is about purchasing vacant properties and other properties around the country, and it is still moving at pace under the Housing Agency.  I hope we can bring an additional 300 properties into the public housing stock through that one programme alone.  That is not insignificant, and it is 300 additional families who would not have been housed before.<\/p><p> We are making progress.  In the detailed briefing note, the Deputy will see we have highlighted the reduction in numbers across dependants and families.  Behind all of those numbers are people, as we are all acutely aware.  Our policy direction is about accelerating the reduction in homelessness.  It is about keeping people safe through our winter plan, which is in place to make sure there is enough emergency accommodation capacity for rough sleepers in all of our cities, which there is, by the way.  It is important that the committee knows that there absolutely is capacity in each of our cities for anyone who needs it.  No one should have to be sleeping on the streets.  There is capacity there and we will continue to work with the community to deliver on that and to keep people safe during the winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020111200002#B00400","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":583,"content":"<p>That is extremely important.

There are three sets of questions.  With respect to the homeless Supplementary Estimate, is all of the additional &euro;60 million going to the Covid-related provisions, as the Minister outlined, or is there an opportunity for some of that funding to address some of the other specific issues that have arisen this year?  Obviously, there is the issue of the very significant increase in the number of people experiencing homelessness who have died, with over 50 reported so far this year.  There is also significant concern about the lack of inspections of emergency accommodation, particularly in the private sector, and questions on and criticism of the quality of some of that.  It is also important to say that while the Minister is right that, on paper, there is capacity in the system, part of the difficulty is that some of that capacity is in the lower threshold hostels, and people who, for example, have gone through detoxification or who have significant mental health problems may not feel safe in some of that emergency accommodation.  Could some of the &euro;60 million be used for that?<\/p> <p>  With respect to Irish Water, part of the difficulty is that Irish Water&rsquo;s funding position this year was already negatively affected by a cut of almost &euro;100 million from its capital funding for other reasons last year, and there is also the &euro;50 million in lost commercial rates revenue.  Therefore, while the additional money the Minister is providing today is welcome, as well as the stimulus, the fact is that Irish Water is &euro;150 million worse off this year than it would have been if not for the cut and Covid, and only &euro;72 million of that money has been replaced.  We see today the EPA report which again, after four, five or six years in a row, has pointed to very slow progress on addressing raw sewage being pumped into some 34 rivers, waters and lakes.  How does the Minister feel that funding is going to address those problems?<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister have a date for the publication either of the affordable housing programme or the legislation?  Has he any concern about the reports in today's newspapers that Dublin City Council has proposals to deliver so-called affordable housing at Oscar Traynor Road ranging between &euro;325,000 for a one-bed and &euro;380,000 for a three-bed, taking into account the purchase price and the serviced sites fund.  It is working in the context of help-to-buy, even though there is no guarantee help-to-buy will exist when those homes are ready.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020111200002#C00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I appreciate the questions and I will deal with them individually.  On the &euro;60 million additional announced today, the full programme relates to Covid-related costs on the current side but it does add to the total this year of nearly &euro;100 million more than would have been allowed for in budget 2020, so it is significant.  Into next year, obviously, we have additional funding specifically for homeless services to bring that up to about &euro;218 million.  We also have capacity to access the Covid contingency fund, and this is something I have discussed at length with both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, with regard to the money here today, the &euro;60 million, the full programme relates to Covid-related costs.<\/p> <p>  We are going to expand Housing First next year.  If we look at those with very complex health and addiction issues, as discussed by Deputy O'Callaghan, Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others, some 460 people have already been rehoused through Housing First.  We are going to expand that across the country and there is funding into next year.  That is a cohort of our citizens we really need to focus on, given many have been homeless for a long period.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons I brought forward the Call for Housing is that about 50 families have been homeless for four years or more.  These are large family groups and we do not have appropriate homes for them and we are not building those homes.  That is why we are always going to need to have some capacity to buy homes.  In next year's budget, there is an allowance for about 800 acquisitions next year.  I am really trying to get the Housing Agency, through our local authorities across the country, to identify larger homes so we can move some of these bigger families into permanent accommodation.  The same issue pertains to singles.  That is why, in some instances, we will need to buy as opposed to build, but in a much smaller way.  There has been a complete shift towards a focus on our local authorities, with our delivery partners in the approved housing bodies, in regard to building additional housing stock.<\/p> <p>  In regard to Irish Water, the funding is not insignificant.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point in regard to the period 2019 to 2020, and I have been critical of that myself.  However, if we look at the provisions made in 2019, the total in the budget for 2019 was &euro;1.2 billion for both current and capital, and, basically, the Estimate for 2020 was just over &euro;1.23 billion.  What we are bringing today means the Estimate and, effectively, the total spend, will be &euro;1.303 billion, so we are significantly ahead of where we were in 2019.  There is some &euro;88 million in capital funding and &euro;28 million in current funding to cover that loss in current funding for non-domestic water rates, which is important.  Irish Water&rsquo;s delivery on capital programmes has been hampered somewhat by a lack of investment, which is why the Government has put in an additional &euro;100 million in capital for next year.<\/p> <p>  We also need to look at our processes.  I meet Irish Water on a regular basis and I had discussions with it earlier this morning about prioritising our capital plan and looking at where our water and wastewater infrastructure can support the delivery of additional homes.  That needs to happen.  I know of developments and potential developments across the country that are held up because of the lack of water and wastewater infrastructure.  We need to look at that capital plan again in order to tackle that, and that is something we are doing.<\/p> <p>  Certainly, the supplementary budget puts Irish Water in a much better position.  It has been in a much better position since the new Government took over in July, with an additional &euro;88 million in capital and &euro;28 million in current, and on top of that will be another &euro;100 million in capital next year, which will bring the spend to well over &euro;1 billion.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the proposals in front of Dublin City Council, I am aware that is a matter for the council and it is going to come up on Tuesday.  I have looked in some detail at the proposals in front of the city council and I do not want, in any way, to be seen to be butting in on their responsibilities as a group when they assess the plans for the Oscar Traynor Road site.  When one looks at the cost of an affordable house in the region of &euro;380,000 and that encompasses help-to-buy, I would also have some issues with that.  However, I want the local authority and the members of Dublin City Council to look at the proposal that is put forward by the local authority itself.  This was in train before I took over as Minister.  All of us have a frustration sometimes at the speed, or lack thereof, of the delivery of public and affordable homes on public land.<\/p> <p>  The site at Oscar Traynor Road is a really significant one.  I have actually walked the site with Deputy McAuliffe, as I have done on many sites across the country.  We need to be delivering better and faster.  On that, from what I have heard about the level of other properties within that site, I would have some concerns that these may become long-term private lets.  I believe in home ownership, as does my party and the Government.  It is something we may have to return to after Monday but I am not going to say too much in advance as I do not want to in any way prejudice the meeting or the decision the members of the local authority will make on Monday.<\/p><p>Suffice it to say I am very interested in this particular project, as I am in others.  I was glad to see D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council give approval earlier in the week to move forward with Shanganagh.  That is a significant 597 homes.  I will be watching it carefully next week and taking advice from members in Dublin City Council. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020111200002#C00400","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I propose that I take two minutes, Deputy Murnane O'Connor takes two minutes and we give the Minister one minute.

In some local authorities, rates are not the same percentage of income that they might be in smaller counties.  I name Dublin County Council.  I hope the Minister will do everything he can to assure them the support he has given this year will be matched next year.  I say that in a soft way because it will be hard to make commitments given that we do not know what next year will be.  However, I ask the Minister to do everything in his power to assure local authorities that they can budget for next year in an uncertain year.<\/p> <p>  The community call has been hugely important and one of the key ways in which the Minister has engaged on the ground with local authorities.  It is a great example of how local authorities deliver.  I have questions about how we continue to do that in the Covid times of 2021 and about how, in non-Covid times, we can use the community call better.<\/p> <p>  I come back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point about Oscar Traynor Road, which is in my constituency.  One of the things this committee will want to see is a change of direction in housing and the Minister will also want to see that.  We want to see public housing on public lands and we want to see delivery.  While compromises have had to be made with the previous Government in this area, at some point we will have to draw a line in the sand and say, \"New policy, new Government, new way of delivering housing\".  At the same time, we want to make sure that does not result in a chilling effect on delivering housing.  It is a difficult balancing act that the Minister has to perform but there are concerns.  The Estimates need to reflect the ability of local authorities to manage big projects like that.  We have to make sure local authorities have the skills in house to be able to deliver these products and not rely on the private sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020111200002#D00400","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  He was here this morning when we had the representatives of the Department in and they spoke about the statement of strategy to cover the period from 2021 to 2025.  That is about strategy and policies.  The 31 local authorities are doing their best but we need proper policies and procedures, whether it is to do with homelessness, mental health, disabilities, thresholds or the tenant purchase scheme.  We have a chance to make a difference because Covid has changed everybody&rsquo;s lives and we need to make sure that, when we get the strategy ready, we take in everything from our local authorities.

Has there been a big uptake on grants?  Because of Covid and people working from home, in my local authority we need extra staff.  What is the update on that?  With housing policies, in relation to Rebuilding Ireland, as we call it, it is important that the local authorities and the approved housing bodies work together and that we get the correct amount of housing we need.  More than ever, we need to build houses.  People need their own home.  We were speaking at another meeting on a referendum on the right to housing.

That is well advanced and will be introduced in this session.  I did not get round to answering that.<\/p> <p>  I will say a couple of things to Deputy McAuliffe.  There is a change of direction on housing with a clear focus on public homes on public land and the delivery of affordable housing for working people, both rental and purchase.  Next year we have an allocation in the budget which means that for the first time with the agreement of all of the Government parties we will deliver affordable rental homes, which have been talked about for a long time, and a national affordable rental scheme.  The allocation is to get that up and running and to partner with approved housing bodies.  They have been helpful in that regard and open to it.<\/p> <p>  On rates, I take the Deputy's points that some local authorities may have made 95%-96% rate collection.  In this year, that would not have been the case because businesses have shut down.  We are putting up 100% of the rent rebate.<\/p> <p>  To give local authorities and Members here some comfort, everything we have done by way of the Supplementary Estimate and the additional funding for local government we have done in step with each of the local government managers.  All of the chief executives, the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and the County and City Management Associations, CCMA, are fully in tune with this.<\/p> <p>  After this meeting, each of the local authorities will receive correspondence from me and the Ministers of State, Deputies Peter Burke and Noonan, outlining what we are doing, showing good cause for this year and showing that we will be there to support local government next year.  As Deputy Murnane O'Connor has said, the local authorities are extremely important to us.  They are the front line of government and the boots on the ground.  I come from a local government background.  I was a councillor.  I see the work that is being done.  We will not be found wanting and they know that.  The Supplementary Estimate today, once passed, is significant for them and that will be done.<\/p> <p>  On the delivery of public homes on public land, I am looking at the serviced sites fund, how we can improve the delivery of it and how that might deliver some flexibility with regard to pricing on State-owned land.  I am fully aware of the issue that is in front of Dublin City Council next week and I do not want to say too much more on that.<\/p> <p>  I will get Deputy Murnane O'Connor the figures with regard to the drawdown of grants.  Members of this committee brought to my attention the last time we met that some works were not happening because, once we went into levels 4 and 5, it was deemed they could not happen.  That was clarified.  I got on to the chair of the CCMA and I issued as Minister a further circular to all the local authorities to the effect that these works are essential works and can be carried out, with the permission of the householder.  That is the one complication.  If adaptation work is required or new bathrooms put in, if the householder does not want someone or does not feel safe for someone to come into their house during Covid, that is understandable.  The drawdown is reduced and I will get the Deputy the exact amount.  That money will be carried over.<\/p> <p>  On non-domestic customers, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has a plan to issue for next year a standardised tariff.  Some 98% of businesses will either have a reduction in their water payment or a very slight increase.  I welcome the fact that they have delayed and it is a the decision they made.  They are completely independent so I cannot direct them but they have made the correct decision because of where we are and where businesses are right now.  That was to happen earlier this year and again in November.  Letters would have been going out this month to businesses.  They have taken the correct course of action, in my view, to delay that until next year.  It is not for me to make suggestions to the committee, but I have met with the CRU on a couple of occasions about this and it might be worthwhile for it to do likewise.  Nothing will be happening between now and next May in relation to non-domestic charges on water.  As part of the new arrangement, a substantial number of businesses will see a substantial decrease in the water bills they are paying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020111200002#D00600","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming in.

As the Minister will be aware, there are many concerns over and criticisms of some of the private providers.  There have been reports of no-chatting rules being implemented by some of the accommodation providers.  There are concerns over a lack of inspections, quality control and regulation.  With regard to the Estimate and the extra money going to private providers, will there be measures to ensure basic standards are met?  With regard to some of the private providers, people are being met by security guards rather than support workers.  This needs to be looked into.  There are also concerns that it has become harder to gain access to emergency accommodation because of a change to the thresholds.  The Minister might address that.<\/p><p> I totally agree with the Minister's comments on public housing on public land.  With regard to the proposal for Oscar Traynor Road lands, it would not mean public housing on public land.  Fifty percent could well end up being used for build-to-rent units, and the State could then end up paying large amounts to landlords through housing assistance payments in respect of social housing on what is currently public land.  I ask the Minister to consider that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020111200002#D00700","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I have couple of points on Housing First.  There is a firm commitment in this regard in the programme for Government.  We have now moved that on to another level with the budget for next year, or the additional moneys to expand Housing First across the country.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the most recent data that I have, the national implementation plan, issued in September 2018, includes a target of 663 tenancies for the period to 2021.  We have been moving in that direction.  Really good progress has been made on the national implementation plan for Housing First.  According to the most recent figures I have, 27 individuals entered Housing First tenancies in quarter 3 of this year, bringing the total number of individuals housed under the programme to 459.  That is with all the wraparound supports we need.  I am 100% committed to this, as are my colleagues in the Government.  It works and we want to expand it further.  Yesterday, I launched the Peter McVerry Trust report for 2019.  The trust is heavily involved in the delivery of 14 other programmes associated with Housing First across the country and expanding it out.<\/p> <p>  On the total expenditure on Covid measures, I can give the Deputy the quarter 3 figures, which are the most up-to-date ones I have available.  To the end of quarter 3, local authorities reported expenditure of about &euro;28.5 million on Covid-19 measures.  Ongoing expenditure on Covid-19 is difficult to predict but the current levels indicate an additional &euro;12.5 million from quarter 3 onwards.  Therefore, the sum is fundamentally Covid-related.  It is a matter of additional bed capacity and decongregated settings on the homelessness side.  On the local government side, the expenditure has pretty much been Covid related.  The additional capital for the next year is what we are focusing on.<\/p> <p>  I will obtain for the Deputy the figures on the provision of emergency accommodation on private lands versus public lands.  The standard of private emergency accommodation has been brought to my attention on a couple of occasions.  We are examining this very closely.  I do not have the split to hand but I will get it for the Deputy.  <\/p> <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin stated, inspections are important.  That is why we have provided additional moneys to local authorities to employ staff to carry out inspections.  That was in this budget.  There is a significant increase in funding for additional staff in the RTB for the inspection of private rented accommodation.  In many instances, we have decent regulations, but they need to be enforced.  We need staff out enforcing them.  The additional resources are in place for next year.  The RTB and local authorities are recruiting inspectors in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020111200002#E00200","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":595,"content":"<p>What about private accommodation for the homeless - hostels?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020111200002#E00300","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":596,"content":"<p>We are inspecting them for quality.

Cork City Council has its budget meeting next Monday night.  It has a shortfall in its budget which excludes the funding coming in for rates.  Cork City Council has put up its local property tax by 7.5%, which will bring in an initial &euro;2.5 million, but that will still not fill the gap because the deficit is &euro;4.5 million.  Next Monday night, therefore, the council will probably put up rent.  It is putting up rents in local authority housing because it has no other way to fill the gap.  The Minister says he is talking to the chief executives.  In Cork city, we face an increase in rents and cuts to front-line services, affecting libraries, parks, playgrounds and staff.  I assume there are other local authorities in the same position.  Will the Minister consider additional funding?  Although he obviously cannot provide it this side of Christmas, could it be provided in the new year, in 2021?  Could he talk to the Department about this?  We are going to try to be positive and raise these issues with him.  I am just using Cork City Council as an example because I was a councillor there for 11 years and I understand it.<\/p> <p>  The last time the Minister was before us, I raised the issue of voids.  He outlined his plans for voids, which I welcome, but I want local authorities to have more freedom and independence to fast-track the void system.  Properties should not be lying idle for months or, in some cases, years.  Rather than having local authorities going back and forward to the Department, involving red tape and bureaucracy, they should be given permission to fast-track, carry out the work and then submit the funding application, knowing it will be looked after.  Cork city has more than 100 derelict sites that could be used to house families and others.  Owing to a lack of funding, however, the council cannot purchase them compulsorily.  A former Minister responsible for this matter, Deputy Coveney, changed the rules on the compulsory purchase of properties that have been derelict for two years or more.  The funding was never made available to support this.  There would be an easy victory to be had if local authorities had a funding stream to acquire properties that would get families off the waiting list.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is coming in with loads of plans.  I appreciate that he is trying to make a difference but the problem is that there has been a decade of underfunding and a lack of supports for social housing measures to tackle the housing crisis.  I am trying to offer solutions whereby we can have the quickest possible turnaround.<\/p> <p>  I recognise much work is being done on housing but the reality on the ground for those I am dealing with right now is that the crisis has become worse because of Covid.  Even with all the work that is planned, it will take a while to make a difference.  I recognise the work that is being done but we need to deliver quick victories where they can be had.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020111200002#E00500","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Regarding the Deputy's last point, on the need for quick victories, with which I agree, one of the first steps I took was to improve the single-stage approval process, raising the value to &euro;6 million, to give more autonomy to local authorities to build themselves.  I really want that.<\/p><p>Next year, local authorities throughout the country are fully funded to deliver 12,750 new public homes.  These are social homes.  After next week I will spend most of the rest of the year visiting all of the local authorities.  Many of them are setting their housing targets and targets for delivery for new public homes for next year.  Deputy Gould is right to say that it is not going to change overnight, but I appreciate the positive and constructive nature in which he made his comments.  We all want a resolution to it.<\/p><p> I have been looking at homeless services and where we are with homeless numbers.  It is still tough and the numbers are far higher than they should be.  They are unacceptably high.  However, the position has improved over the course of the past 12 months in particular.  We have to use that progress to accelerate the progress in this area by delivering more public homes.  This means using our stock of public housing better.  Some local authorities are better than others at turning voids around - I am not referring to Cork.  Some local authorities have left stock for various reasons that they believe are appropriate.  It takes some authorities longer to turn properties around and to de-tenant and re-tenant properties.  That is why the &euro;40 million voids programme in July was targeted and focused.  The programme will work to get 2,500 homes back in place.  There is provision in next year's budget of funding for a further 1,000 units to be put back in use next year.  That is targeted for each local authority.  We need to do that.<\/p><p> There is another important point relating to the budget.  I have discussed this with all the chief executives, including the officials in Cork.  We have provided absolute flexibility within the waiver moneys returning to the local authorities.  There should be no reason for cuts in services relating to housing programmes.  That is not the feedback we are getting from any of our local authorities.  They are more than satisfied with the package that we brought forward.  I have also given a commitment to them.  I am saying for the second time this morning that I believe my Department and I have shown our bona fides this year with regard to supporting local governments and filling any deficits.  We are committed to working with local authorities into next year in the same vein.  To be fair, they have accepted that.<\/p><p> I do not envisage any local authority cutting any services.  They should not be.  After today's meeting there should not be a deficit for any of our local authorities in their budget preparation for next year.  They have been given a wide range of flexibility with regard to how they can use the rebated money we are sending to them.  That has been the direct feedback from chief executives across the country.  Obviously, I will watch the budget process carefully.  I will come back to the Deputy on derelict sites - he made a good point on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020111200002#E00600","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I am going to come back to the second slot for Fianna F&aacute;il.

How many businesses will actually reopen?  It is a concern.  I can see it now with people buying online.  People will be nervous going out.  I know everyone wants a Christmas.  We are facing into 2021.  I believe local authorities will experience a major impact from Covid-19.  Do we have a plan to help?  If businesses are closed, the main streets will be affected.  What about Carlow and Kilkenny?  I know the Minister has been promoting a living over shops and things like that.  I hope it will not be the case but the fear is that because of Covid-19 businesses will close early next year.  When they do reopen they will run as well as they can after Christmas.

Deputy McAuliffe mentioned the local property tax review.  The review was paused.  It actually sits under the Department of Finance but it has a direct input in our area and what we are discussing.  Many properties have been built since 2013 that do not actually pay any property tax.  This is significant.  The loss to the Exchequer is in the millions each year.  Up to &euro;32 million is lost to local government in that regard.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has spoken to me about this matter.  Deputies might recall that prior to the budget he made a statement in the D&aacute;il that his next priority Bill is around the exceptions to the local property tax, especially in providing for properties to be brought back in or to be brought in for the first time to pay local property tax.  I see it the full review of the tax being carried out next year.  It has been paused twice now for good reason, to be fair.  Anyway, it needs to be reviewed.  It is led by the Department of Finance.  We have an input.  The Minister for Finance has said that he and I will work on that legislation in partnership.  He was hopeful when I last spoke to him that it would be in the coming month or two and that it would address in particular properties not paying local property tax at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Murnane O'Connor referred to regeneration and funding for our regions.  As Deputies know, only this week I made a significant announcement in respect of investment under the urban regeneration and development fund for Waterford.  Between my Department and the Department of Transport, the funding amounts to a &euro;110.6 million investment between.  With the support of all Government parties I believe this will be a game-changer for the south east.  Balanced regional development and investing in our regions is at the heart of the programme for Government.  The North Quays project in Waterford is the first real tangible measure in that regard.  I believe it has the potential to be transformative, to create thousands of additional jobs and to really unlock the vast potential that is Waterford and the surrounding south Kilkenny region.  I expect that later this month or in early December further announcements under the new urban regeneration and development fund will be made from the second call.  The assessments are being assessed in my Department at the moment although I have not received them yet.

Affordability and associated measures are at the centre of it.  The serviced sites fund is part of it.  I am working on measures that I believe can improve the delivery on that.<\/p><p>As I mentioned already, we will bring forward the national affordable rental scheme which has been outstanding for some time.  It is a new mode of delivering housing and a new tenure of housing for many people who are above the social housing limits.  I believe in home ownership, as I have said before.  My party does and the Deputy's party does.  This Government does and, according to most surveys, the vast majority of people who are asked their preferred tenure of housing opt for home ownership at an affordable rate.  That is why in the coming weeks of this session I will bring forward an affordable housing Bill to the D&aacute;il.  We will do extensive work with the Attorney General and others.  We have not had a national affordable housing scheme in many years.  It has been complex but I am happy, given the work and progress that has been made, that we will have an affordable purchase scheme on top of our affordable rental scheme and the delivery of affordable homes through serviced sites and other mechanisms, for example through the Land Development Agency.  Work is advancing on a significant Bill relating to the agency which will come to this committee.<\/p><p> In the interim, I remind Deputy Higgins that the Government made a decision to retain the help-to-buy grant at the increased level of &euro;30,000, which has helped nearly 20,000 homeowners to get onto the housing ladder.  I know some people completely disagree, as is their right, with helping first-time buyers to get their deposits together but this mechanism has helped a lot of families to own a home.  I want to see a more sustainable model.  That is why I look forward to working with the Deputy and her colleagues on delivering a real and robust affordable housing scheme.  Central to our programme for Government is the provision of high-quality affordable housing that our citizens can purchase or rent.  That needs to happen, particularly for the Deputy's generation.  Home ownership has slipped away from almost an entire generation of people.  The average age of a person buying his or her first home is now 35 or 36.  I want to see that trend reversed and that is why home ownership is an absolute priority for this Government and for me as Minister.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question and I look forward to working with her on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2020111200002#F01600","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1605139200,"counter":616,"content":"<p>We could go on for another hour but, unfortunately, with Covid restrictions we have vacate the room.
