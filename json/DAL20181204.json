While the Government's position has shifted, overall it has been mean-spirited and lacked any moral compass.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to hospices, the Taoiseach knows that many organisations are labelled \"section 39\" but, in essence, do the State's work in catering for people with disabilities and children with special needs.  We know that thousands of people across the country depend on such organisations for residential services, respite services, day care and support services, personal assistance, home care assistance and access to therapies.  For many of these people, even those services, for example, respite and access to therapies, are not fully adequate or sufficient.<\/p>  <p>  I am referring to organisations like Enable Ireland, Rehab, Acquired Brain Injury Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association at national level and, regionally, Ability West, the Western Care Association, the Kerry Parents and Friends Association and the St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville, which covers Limerick and Cork.  There simply would be no services for people with disabilities without those organisations.<\/p>  <p>  In research commissioned recently on behalf of these organisations under the title, Who Cares? Building a new relationship between the not-for-profit sector and the State 2018, the reality is brought home in terms of the financial crisis that such organisations are in - they are no longer sustainable financially - and the Government's lack of honesty in meeting the actual cost of services that are being delivered on the ground by the agencies.  This is important research and, in essence, it captures the crisis and the lack of honesty in the relationship between the Government and these agencies.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has compounded the crisis and made it far worse in respect of the restoration of pay for the workers in these organisations.  They are not getting a full restoration of pay.  There is a significant differential at the end of each month between such workers and workers in the general health service.<\/p><p>Why are those agencies and workers who look after people with disabilities and very sick people penalised so blatantly by Government through its pay policy?  Why are they discriminated against so much?  It suggests a morally bankrupt position for Government to adopt.  It places these agencies in financial peril and will result in the cutting of services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543932300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>In Ireland, we provide our health and social care through a number of different mechanisms.  Sometimes it is provided directly by the State through the HSE while at other times, it is provided through a section 38 body, which is a voluntary body.  St. Vincent's University Hospital, which is not too far from here, would be an obvious example where the staff are considered to be public servants but the body itself is not part of the public service.  Sometimes this care is provided through section 39 bodies, some of whom have been mentioned by the Deputy.  In these cases, the body receives some of its funding from the State and often receives some of it from other sources.  The people employed in these organisations are not public servants.  Sometimes care is provided through private contracts.  For example, most of our GP and dental services are provided by GPs and dentists who are self-employed and have staff who are not on public service contracts and are not part of the public service pay bill.  That is how we structure our health and social care services in Ireland.  We provide those services in lots of different ways - sometimes directly by the State through State employees, sometimes through private contractors like GPs and dentists who have their own employees, sometimes through section 38 bodies, and sometimes through section 39 bodies.  For better or for worse, that is the way it has grown up since the foundation of the State.<\/p>  <p>  There was a dispute about pay in section 39 bodies that went to the Workplace Relations Commission.  We have an agreement and I would expect the employers and the unions to honour that agreement.  I am sure they will.  I do not have the exact figures relating to funding in front of me.  I will dig them out.  Funding for section 39 bodies has increased for each of the past three years.  Funding for these bodies has increased at a higher rate than has funding for the HSE and its own services.  While HSE services got a certain increase, the section 39 bodies got a larger increase than the HSE, so the assessment offered by the Deputy does not really add up.  If the HSE bodies are getting less of an increase than the section 39 bodies, the section 39 bodies should be well able to afford any additional spending the HSE bodies are providing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400004#B00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1543932300,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach is not living in the land of reality with regard to these agencies.

I have met representatives of St Joseph's Foundation in Charleville, which has done heroic work for years.<\/p>  <p>  We all know about the history of the relationship between the State and these organisations.  The more recent history is that Government instructed the agencies to cut pay in line with the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation but when it came to the restoration of pay, these agencies were left out.  This was never an industrial relations issue.  The unions will look after their members but what they have not done is look after the agencies and they will not do so because it is not their remit.  Many posts will not benefit from pay restoration because workers who came in after the cuts do not get any restoration so the agencies get no funding for that.

We know from last week's homelessness figures that there are now more people homeless in the state than ever before.  We also know that the official figures actually understate the reality of homelessness across society.  The rough sleeper count, published yesterday, shows a 40% increase in the number sleeping rough since March, which is shocking.  It is no exaggeration to say hundreds of thousands of people across society are affected by the housing crisis.  Up and down the country, families are worried about whether they will have a roof over their heads come January.  People in the private rental sector are being hit time and again with rent increases which are still exorbitantly high, while long promised social housing is being constructed at a snail's pace.  House prices are out of control and, for young people, owning a home is a pipedream.  <\/p><p>The Taoiseach's response is to stick with the plan.  It may not have occurred to him, but his plan is not working.  In fact, he is failing spectacularly.  Last Saturday thousands of people took to the streets of this city to tell him that.  I think it is time he listened to them.  Last week the Central Bank stated to would-be homeowners who wish to get out of the high rental trap to wait and hang on for new homes to be built before trying to buy.  That would be prudent and worthy advice if houses were coming on stream and people were in a position to actually save a few bob.  Week in and week out, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and their colleagues state <i>ad nauseam<\/i>, both here and elsewhere, that people should simply wait, that the houses will arrive, yet we continue to witness homelessness and the housing crisis.  We have highfalutin guarantees that new homes will sort everything out, but that they will only arrive at some undefined point in the future.<\/p><p>The crisis is real.  It is in the here and now.  Frankly, people are fed up waiting for the Taoiseach to get his act together.  They are being screwed, day in, day out, with runaway rents and it seems the Government is incapable of taking meaningful action.  The Taoiseach seems to specialise in empty promises.  We need something tangible that will benefit the people who are struggling and need a break.  I put it to the Taoiseach that he should do something decent and constructive to cut people a bit of slack.  I suggest the introduce a three-year rent freeze and temporary tax relief for renters with immediate effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400005#C00400","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1543932900,"counter":15,"content":"<p>We are approaching Christmas time and the holiday season and people are looking forward to the Christmas holidays and spending time with their families, perhaps at home near the warmth of the fire.  Of course, when one thinks about that, one's thoughts inevitably turn to those who are less fortunate, those who do not have a home to go to, those without shelter who are exposed to the cold.  That is why the figures for rough sleepers produced yesterday were very disappointing.  They show that 156 people were sleeping rough on the particular night.<\/p><p>It is not the highest ever, by any means.  It was higher a year ago and, in fact, it was higher four years ago.  It represents an increase on the previous count in September.<\/p> <p> What do we want to do?  We want to make sure people have access to emergency accommodation this Christmas.  Now that beds are available for everyone who needs them, nobody has to sleep rough.  That is why we have set aside &euro;60 million in the budget for additional investment in emergency accommodation.  The first step is to get people into emergency accommodation.  After that, more permanent accommodation can be found for them.  An extra 203 beds will be put in place between now and the end of the year.  In fact, 51 of them are already in place.  The provision of 203 additional permanent beds and 130 contingency beds will ensure there is emergency accommodation for everyone who needs it this winter.<\/p> <p> We are continuing to work with the Peter McVerry Trust and other charities to advance the Housing First programme, which is all about getting secure tenancies for people who have been rough sleepers and are now in emergency accommodation.  When they are in secure tenancies, they will be given all the additional supports they need to hang on to their homes.  As the Deputy will be aware, rough sleeping is a complex social problem and is not just an issue of housing.  As it often involves issues like addiction, mental health and physical health, it can sometimes be hard to get people to come in and therefore it can be hard to help them, even though we do our best to do so.<\/p> <p> In terms of supply, I do not think it is a case of promises anymore.  The figures on supply are very positive.  According to the most recent set of numbers, 5,000 new houses and apartments were built in Ireland in the past three months.  Between 18,000 and 20,000 new homes have been built in Ireland this year.  Those are not just figures, as we can see by turning back to the theme of Christmas, which was raised by the Deputy.  This Christmas, approximately 20,000 people and their families will sit around a Christmas tree in new homes that did not exist this time a year ago.  It is possible that 60,000 or 70,000 people will spend this Christmas in a house or apartment that was not built this time last year.  We are going to need to ramp that up more and more next year until we get to the kind of figure - 30,000 or 40,000 - that is indicative of the level of housing construction that will be needed every year if we are to get on top of this crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400005#C00500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543933200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach's party has been in government for more than seven years.

Perhaps she would like people to forget, or not to know, that we spent five years getting the public finances back in order, reversing some of the awful cuts that were made in previous years to welfare and to people's pay and salaries and dealing with enormous levels of unemployment.<\/p><p>A set of figures came out today which shows that the rate of unemployment in Ireland is now at 5.3%, the lowest in ten years.

We spent the first five years really putting the country back together, getting the economy working again, getting people back to work, restoring their incomes and giving them hope again.  We have spent the past two years or perhaps a little more dealing with many of the legacy issues caused by the crisis.

We have an alternative proposal in the Finance Bill.  Rather than just having income tax cuts for people who are renting, we are making them for all workers because others struggle with other bills, not only those who are renting.  There are also people who are struggling to pay their mortgage, save for a deposit or with childcare costs, for example.

When the court case to try these crimes was concluded, Keith Burke was convicted of 23 of 39 sample charges of rape and buggery of the three children over a prolonged period between 2003 and 2007.  Significantly, we know all of this not from any internal examination by Tusla or the HSE but from \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" and because the children, now young adults, were forced to give evidence when Mr. Burke pleaded not guilty.  Consequent on the RT&Eacute; programme which has become a familiar theme in the D&aacute;il - a significant phenomenon in itself - questions were raised by other Deputies and me.  Many fine words were used, including \"courageous\" and \"brave\" when referring to the children who are now young women, as well as \"appalling\" and \"shocking\" when referring to the crimes perpetrated.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach commended the bravery of Rachel, Sarah and Amy in telling their stories and said it would help others to come forward.  They were fine words, but the reality has been confusion, obfuscation and delay.  The Taoiseach's approach to date has not only added to the confusion, but he is also actively standing over a system that is failing the young women and utterly unaccountable.  In one of his replies the Taoiseach stated an independent investigation would commence.  He then told us that it had commenced and that it was nearing completion.  He then told us that the fact there was a criminal trial in train impeded the investigation.  The latter point is completely unacceptable and was pointed to by HIQA in a report commissioned by the Minister, Deputy Zappone, which clearly stated it was imperative that Tusla did not allow a criminal investigation to impede its statutory duty to protect and safeguard children.  Two and half years later, we have no report, despite assurances that it would be published in October and November.  The Government is standing over a review mechanism which, using the most benign interpretation, is tardy and inefficient.  A more realistic and honest view is that the situation is perpetuating the abuse suffered by the children.  When will the report be published?  What is the reason for the delay?  <\/p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to reply in the context of what a former chairman of the United Nations Human Rights Committee stated - that it was time the State stopped its automatic response to every scandal, being first to deny, then delay, lie and cover up and eventually, if forced, throw some money at it in the hope it will go away.

Is it the Taoiseach; the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan; or the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross?  People are being checked in going to and coming from mass.  I am not blaming An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or individual superintendents because it is occurring across divisions and county boundaries.

Shops and restaurants located beside them are also closing.  Having two pints was the only social outlet for many.  They met in pubs to talk about farming, work or football, inquire about the health of neighbours or relatives who perhaps lived far away, or have an ordinary or usual conversation.

It used to be the case that 600 or 700 people died on the roads every year.  The figure is now between 100 and 200, which is still 100 or 200 too many.  We have both met the families of people who were killed on the road.  The Deputy knows how the loss of a loved one on the road hurts a whole family and how families grieve.  It is particularly the case at this time of year when people are thinking about the empty space around the dinner table.  That is the purpose of road traffic legislation.  We do not seek to discommode people or make their lives difficult.  We want to make the roads safer.  Roads in rural Ireland are still less safe, for many reasons.  Most deaths on the roads occur in rural areas.  The roads in urban areas are now much safer.<\/p>  <p>  The extra bus services were pressed for by Deputy Hayden and other Deputies, in co-operation with the Minister, Deputy Ross.  A call for funding was made.  Counties made bids for funding, with some bidding for more and some for less.  The new services are now in place throughout the country.  It will never be possible to provide a service from house to door, village or pub or to replace all of the journeys people could take if they could use their car.  However, it is possible to provide better bus services.  There was a competitive call and different amounts went to different counties.  I have no doubt that there will be further calls for funding in the future.  <\/p>  <p>  I am glad to hear that there has been an increase in the number of Garda checkpoints and that the Deputy has noticed them throughout the country.  We should not forget why they are needed.  It is to check for people who might have consumed alcohol or drugs who might injure or kill another citizen.  It is to check to see whether vehicles are taxed and insured.  They help to intercept and disrupt networks of burglars in travelling around the country to break into people's homes, take their possessions and sometimes occasion real harm.  They help to disrupt anyone involved in a criminal enterprise.  It is good that there are more Garda checkpoints.  It is a reflection of the fact that just last week the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exceeded 14,000 for the first time since 2012 when the Garda College in Templemore was reopened and we started to recruit garda&iacute; again.  The force now has more 14,000 members which people will notice while on the roads and in the streets.  The Garda presence will be much more visible and people will feel safer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400009#G00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1543934700,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Thankfully, the number of road deaths has gone down owning to myriad factors, including speed cameras and better roads.<\/p><p>We will, however, continue to have deaths because of the state of roads, with trees hanging out over them and falling on people.  People are being killed while cycling and walking because roads are not adequate for use by pedestrians late at night.  People are also being killed while riding motorcycles.  I am still asking the Taoiseach to provide the services he promised.  It was supposed to be no trouble at all to provide LocalLink services, but they have not been added to.  Even the ones that were promised are not being delivered.  That is the truth.  The purpose of this question is to see what we are going to do to help people in rural Ireland to get around.  They do not have the train, taxi or DART services that are available here.  There can be no checkpoints on roads around here.  If a garda was to stand there for five minutes, there would be a five-mile tailback.  It is very easy to have a checkpoint at a crossroads when people are going to mass on a Sunday morning, but I do not know what the purpose is, or on whose orders it is done.  Is it being directed by the Taoiseach, the Minister of Justice and Equality or the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross?  I appeal to the Taoiseach to answer this question.  It is happening across the boundaries of three counties and in the divisions of different superintendents; therefore, a direction is coming from the top.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400009#G00500","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543935000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that there are Garda checkpoints all over the country.

If there is anywhere where a checkpoint could cause a tailback, it is on such a busy road, yet there are checkpoints in those areas too for very good reasons.  Neither I nor the Ministers, Deputies Flanagan and Ross, order the setting up of checkpoints.  They are decisions for the Garda Commissioner, superintendents and inspectors in their particular areas, but I am not going to apologise for the fact that there are Garda checkpoints throughout the country.  The vast majority of law-abiding citizens want to see a more visible Garda presence.  They want to see garda&iacute; on the streets in their communities on bicycles and on foot.  They want to see Garda checkpoints because that is how crime is disrupted.  Particularly when we are trying to crack down on the scourge of burglaries in rural Ireland, we need a more active Garda presence on the roads to disrupt those who go into rural Ireland and people's homes to take their possessions and do them harm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400010#H00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1543935000,"counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400010#H00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1543935000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Today's business shall be No. <i>a<\/i>18, motion re opt-in under protocol of a measure in the area of asylum, migration and integration funds, referral to committee; No. 18, excess Vote in relation to 2016 - Vote 35; No. 18<i>a<\/i>, motion re parliamentary question rota swap; No. 38, statements on the report on the procurement process audit of the national broadband plan; No. 19, instruction to committee re Local Government Bill 2018; and No. 39, Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018 - Report Stage (resumed) and Final Stage.<\/p><p>Wednesdays' business shall be No. 39, Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018 - Report Stage (resumed) and Final Stage; No. 13, Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill 2018 - Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 1, European Investment Fund Agreement  Bill 2018 - Second Stage; and No. 2, Health insurance (Amendment) Bill 2018 - Second Stage. <\/p><p>Thursday's Business will be No. 19<i>a<\/i>, motion re opt-in under protocol of a measure in the area of asylum, migration and integration funds, back from committee; No. 3, Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill 2016 - amendments from the Seanad; No. 40, annual transitional statements on climate change; No. 41, Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018 - Order for Report Stage and Report and Final Stages; No. 13, Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill 2018 - Order for Second Stage and Second Stage (resumed); No. 1, European Investment Fund Agreement  Bill 2018 - Second Stage (resumed); and No. 2, Health insurance (Amendment) Bill 2018 - Second Stage (resumed).

It was shocking.<\/p>  <p>  It seems that the committee is doing good work and that it is coming to a conclusion.  Given that the Government is considering referendums next year on divorce and other matters, I am curious as to why the Seanad is not featuring in those plans.

Maybe the Taoiseach can encourage the Government members of the committee to attend and be constructive as regards the agenda.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach agree with me that the timescale exists for producing legislation on the Seanad that could lead to a constitutional amendment?  I am sorry, I did not mean a constitutional amendment, but a change in the Seanad's make-up, how it is selected and so on.  I do not know whether the Attorney General's office has examined the committee's work.

Perhaps the committee does, and I am sure that will be in the report.<\/p>  <p>  Second, I also have some reservations about retaining the different panels as they currently exist.  I understand that to change them would require a change in the Constitution, and that is not being proposed.  The last iteration of the Manning report that I saw would require pretty much everyone to register to vote again for the Seanad elections.  If we open up the franchise to everyone in the State or every citizen abroad, that would require a registration mechanism by which people would register to vote and would then pick a panel on which they wanted to vote, whether it was  the University of Dublin, NUI, cultural and educational, industrial and commercial, administrative or some other panel.  I think that could be quite a confusing exercise for people.  People, when they register to vote, tend to register to vote where they live for their local constituency.  Asking them to choose between a number of different panels when they register to vote could cause some confusion.  I also think the panels are out of date.  They do not really reflect 21st century society.  They derive from a papal encyclical in the 1930s that de Valera was very fond of.  It was sort of Catholic corporatism.  That is from where those particular panels arise.<\/p>  <p>  However, those are just my reservations.

In the significant amount of scholarship published in recent years, the consensus points to it being a war that was far from inevitable.  It followed an extended period of peace and growth in Europe and there was no compelling reason for war, even in terms of the values of the time.  Ultimately, what was seen was a lack of strong rules-based organisations that could ensure trust and co-operation between countries.  This remains a powerful lesson for today, one that, unfortunately, some parts of the English political class have chosen to ignore.  It is an interesting fact of history that those who fought in the two world wars were the biggest enthusiasts for what we now call the European Union.  Given the success of the commemorative programme of recent years and the significant level of public engagement, can the Taoiseach assure us that the commemoration's budget will remain intact?  Given the central role of our academic historians not only in researching the period but also in opening up scholarship to the public, will the Taoiseach reconsider the recent policy of that has seen a steady downgrading of the role of humanities research in the State's research strategy and, of greater significance, funding for postgraduate doctorates in the humanities?  A mechanism is available to facilitate greater scholarship in that area.  I established it in the late 1990s.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the Taoiseach's meetings in Finland, we welcome bilateral meetings with countries such as Finland that have always had very constructive relations with Ireland.  The trip had the added benefit for the Taoiseach of combining an official trip to Helsinki with the congress of the European People's Party, EPP, which happened to be held at the same time in the same city.<\/p>  <p>  Following his bilateral meeting with his EPP colleague, Prime Minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n, earlier this year, the Taoiseach told the House that we should be understanding of Prime Minister Orb&aacute;n's belief that he is protecting Hungary.  Does the Taoiseach still believe this?  He will have seen yesterday that a highly rated university has been driven out of Hungary because of the Orb&aacute;n Government's analysis and hysterical campaign against anything funded by George Soros.  The undertones of scapegoating, fearmongering and anti-Semitism are obvious.  Orb&aacute;n has also launched a campaign against the few pieces of the free media that are left and all non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that are not supportive of him.  He has even enacted legislation to ban state funding of gender studies in universities.  Is the Taoiseach aware of any more obvious violations of agreed EU values and rules?

There is a very obvious contradiction involving those of a federalist mindset who correctly cite the success of the European project as the world's greatest peace project, yet insist on the need for increased militarisation and, like the Taoiseach's friend, President Macron, the necessity of a European army.  The Taoiseach spoke to his counterpart in Finland which, like Ireland, is militarily neutral.  I put it to him, as Head of Government, that as this debate about the future of Europe unfolds, all of us who are in favour of military neutrality should protect that status and seek expression of it in the European treaties.  Structured co-operation, NATO and all the ambitions of the militarists are codified and found within the treaties.  Why do they not also feature our identity, ambition, distinct tradition and belief in the need for the European project to keep faith with the peace mission?

By imposing it on people suffering from poverty, precarious work and a series of austerity attacks, President Macron is making precisely the same mistake that was made in the aftermath of the First World War with the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed austerity on Germany with disastrous consequences.  If we want to avoid the disasters of the 1920s 1930s and 1940s, we must not attack ordinary people with regressive and unjust taxes and austerity measures.

Its impact and the changes that followed therefrom still affect us and echo in the politics of today.  Some good lessons were learned from the First World War.  There was a move away from monarchy towards republics in large parts of Europe.  There were at least attempts at multilateralism.  The establishment of the League of Nations after the First World War was a progressive step in the right direction.  Unfortunately, it did not succeed as an organisation, or certainly did not succeed in preventing the Second World War, but did form a template for the United Nations which came thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  Another result of the First World War was a growth in the belief that nation states should have self-determination and, after the First World War, there emerged new nation states across Europe, including our own.  Movements for disarmament also followed, as well as opposition to secret treaties.  Many of the lessons that were learned from the First World War were well learned and I would not like to see them forgotten.<\/p>  <p>  I think Prime Minister Orb&aacute;n believes what he is saying about the Central European University, CEU, in Hungary, but that is not to say that I agree with him and I do not.  I do not agree with him on quite a lot of issues, whether it is migration, academic freedom, press freedom, or the freedom of NGOs to be able to operate freely in a democratic society.  The loss of the Central European University would be a loss to Budapest and Hungary.  I understand it may be going to Vienna, where it is being welcomed by another of my European People's Party, EPP, colleagues, Chancellor Kurz.  The CEU will be Vienna's gain and Budapest's loss.<\/p>  <p>  On EU integration, I have said before on many occasions in this House that Ireland will not be joining NATO or a European army.  I believe Irish neutrality is an asset.  We are a small country and will never be a military power.  Any military contribution we would make to Europe's defence could only ever be very limited.  We can be powerful through our peacekeeping, foreign policy, international development aid and commitment to organisations like the United Nations.  That Ireland is not a member of a military alliance is an advantage for the reasons Deputy Burton articulated.  When it comes to the United Nations, for example, there is recognition that Ireland is a country with which other countries can identify, especially other island nations and nations that were colonised or a part of a larger nation.  For example, in peacekeeping operations, the fact that we are not part of a military alliance means we can go places where perhaps other countries do not go, or would not be accepted.<\/p>  <p>  I will have to double check, but I think our neutrality and non-alignment is already expressed in the treaties.

That was endorsed by a very large majority in this House.  That means Ireland participating in greater co-operation around security and defence with our European partners where we believe it makes sense to do so.  For example, that could be in areas such as peacekeeping.  Ireland participates in an EU mission in Mali which is an important contribution to trying to stabilise that part of the world.  The Irish Naval Service has participated in operations in the Mediterranean, particularly around the management of the migration issue on the central Mediterranean route.  We also need to co-operate on issues such as international terrorism, cybersecurity and other security threats that, quite frankly, no small country, or even big country, would be able to deal with on their own.  That is why it makes sense for us to co-operate in a structured way on security issues and we intend to do that.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies are aware, the yellow jacket protests in France were spurred by opposition to increased taxes on fuel.  Increasing taxes on fuel have benefits for the environment, pollution and health.  For example, we know that diesel causes damage to people's health because of the emissions of sulphur oxide, SOx, and nitrogen oxide, NOx particles.  If a tax causes people to buy or use less of something, in the same way as we tax cigarettes, for example, that can have environmental and health benefits and reduce pollution.<\/p>  <p>  The reaction in France is a lesson to us when we consider how to increase carbon tax over the next couple of years.  We have seen the French experience with increases in fuel taxes.  We have seen what happened in Australia, where public opposition to increased taxes on petrol, diesel and other fuels brought down a government and prime ministers.  We can see a model that may work being pursued in Canada, which is to bring in a carbon tax and price, but to rebate that to people in the form of tax credits or carbon dividends.<\/p><p>Essentially, the money that accrues from the introduction of a carbon tax is given back to people in another way.

Staff across several divisions of my Department contribute to the work on Brexit.  The international, EU and Northern Ireland division of the Department covers work on all international, EU, British-Irish and Northern Ireland affairs, including Brexit matters.  The economic division of the Department advises me on economic policy aimed at promoting sustainable economic growth, with a particular focus on jobs and competitiveness, including the possible economic impacts of Brexit.  To augment this work, the Department of the Taoiseach recently established a unit to work on Brexit preparedness and contingency planning and to assist a Secretaries General group that is overseeing ongoing work on national Brexit preparedness and contingency planning.  The staff in this unit focus on cross-Government co-ordination, planning and programme management and work closely with their colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the endorsement by the European Council of the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU and the approval of the political declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship.  The finalised agreement provides a basis by which we can avoid a hard Brexit, which would see the UK crash out of the EU with all the severe consequences that would imply.  Rejection pushes us all towards a no-deal Brexit, from which nobody would benefit.  Preparation and planning is ongoing across all Departments to deal with and plan for a range of Brexit scenarios, including a no-deal scenario.  As the T&aacute;naiste has previously stated, in a disorderly scenario the implementation of all planned arrangements would not be possible by 29 March 2019.  Therefore, we are also focusing on possible temporary solutions which could be rapidly implemented until more long-term arrangements could be put in place.  The whole-of-Government response is led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and underpinned by a comprehensive set of Government structures, which ensure all Departments and their agencies are engaging in detailed preparedness and contingency planning, including through the development of sectoral action plans.<\/p>  <p>  At several recent meetings, including one last week, the Government discussed Brexit preparedness and contingency planning and agreed a range of important actions for the necessary checks and controls for trade on an east-west basis.  For example, the Government sanctioned the recruitment of additional staff for customs and sanitary and phytosanitary controls, as well as information and communications technology and infrastructure actions at our ports and airports.  In a no-deal scenario, various actions could be employed, including accelerated recruitment and rapid redeployment of staff.  Many issues will need to be dealt with on an EU-wide basis.  The contingency action plan that was published by the European Commission recently covered eight particular areas.  The specific impact of Brexit on Ireland and Irish businesses was flagged in the Commission's communications.  Businesses and other affected sectors need to respond and prepare.  Assistance is available from the Government to help them.  The Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign was launched in September and several very successful outreach events have been held under this banner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400020#S00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1543940700,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.

I reiterate my concern that in the event of a hard Brexit, we will come under pressure from the EU to erect a border between the North and the South of this country.  While the Taoiseach has said he would not countenance that, we have heard slightly ambiguous statements from the T&aacute;naiste, who has said it might be difficult to avoid.  People need to know what the position is.  I certainly believe that under no circumstances should we countenance that, regardless of who we come under pressure from.  We should say we are not doing it and it will not happen.  We should make clear that we will not participate in any attempt to impose a border between North and South for any reason and under any circumstances.  I ask the Taoiseach to provide some clarity in that regard.  Is this something that is envisaged under the Government's contingency scenario planning?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400020#S01100","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1543941300,"counter":205,"content":"<p>We had the news today of the written judgment of the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice.  Does the Taoiseach feel it is potentially very beneficial to Ireland and people in the UK who may want a soft Brexit or a rethink in the form of a second referendum?  They are matters for the UK Government but they have an enormous influence on us.  I want to know what is the Taoiseach's view.  I have always thought that in the Brexit process, one of the things that should be explored is an extension of the Article 50 process.  Until the Advocate General's viewpoint, which we expect will be endorsed by the European Court of Justice, was announced this morning, the feeling was it might be difficult to do because it would require all 27 countries to allow for it.  It now seems to be potentially off the table.  Does the Taoiseach welcome it?  Does he feel it gives more flexibility to the Irish position?<\/p>  <p>  In terms of preparing for Brexit, people all around the country, particularly farmers, are scared about the loose references to the World Trade Organization, WTO, rules in the event of a hard Brexit.  As such, have we taken on experts in trade negotiations who are experienced on both the legal front and in the technicalities of trade negotiations?  We have not negotiated a trade agreement since we joined the EU and neither has the UK.  We need such expertise in the EU in the case of such an outcome.  Is the Taoiseach preparing for it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400021#T00100","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1543941300,"counter":206,"content":"<p>On the various information seminars, we will keep doing them all the way through to Brexit and perhaps beyond.  The suggestion I thought I heard from Deputy Martin was that the seminars should be all done and dusted by now.  It is not the case at all.  It has to be a continual process of informing business as the situation unfolds.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of percentages, all firms that need to be prepared should be prepared by 29 March but we need to acknowledge that all firms are different.  Some do not trade with the UK at all or do not trade much with it and some can shift operations.  We have to acknowledge that different companies need to be prepared to different extents and some do not need to be prepared at all if they are not trading with the United Kingdom.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of scenarios, we developed quite some time ago what we call the central case scenario.  It turned out to be something very close to what we now have with the withdrawal agreement.  The central case scenario says there will be a transition period of two years or more and when it is over there will be customs and regulatory checks east-west but not North-South.  That is the central case scenario we have prepared for.  We also prepared for a no deal scenario.  While the central case scenario and no deal scenario sound like two scenarios, the response is a graduation of one from the other.  That is how we have done the various scenario planning.  We have not made any contingency or scenario planning for a hard Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland or any associated physical infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of trade agreements, as we will stay members of the European Union, trade will continue to be a sole EU competence and therefore will only be negotiated by the European Commission.  We will not be negotiating our own trade agreements because we will be staying in the European Union.  We have people who are experts in trade already.  They are not negotiators because they will not be involved in any negotiations but they are experts in the rules and laws of trade.  They are in the Department and they come in very useful when it comes to examining, for example, the impact of EU trade deals on Ireland, whether they are CETA, EU-Japan, Mercosur or EU-Mexico deals, because we need to have people who understand the WTO, how trade works and international trade law to make sure our interests are protected when we plug into discussions around what those trade deals might look like.<\/p>  <p>  As was acknowledged, the report of the Advocate General is not an ECJ decision.  It is the opinion of the Advocate General which the ECJ usually, but not always, concurs with.  It says the Article 50 procedure could be withdrawn by the UK.  It could unilaterally decide to stay.  It would not have to renegotiate re-entry terms.  It is up to the UK.  It is a sovereign decision for it to make.  It has decided not to make that decision.  It has decided to respect the result of the referendum that occurred in the United Kingdom which was to leave.  It is still the case that an extension of Article 50 would require a unanimous vote of member states.  The difference is between the UK choosing to cancel Article 50, which it can do unilaterally, and seeking an extension which would require a vote of member states.  The report suggests if the UK was to withdraw from Article 50, it would have to be done in good faith; it could not be done on a tactical basis.  It could not invoke Article 50, withdraw it, revoke it again and then withdraw it on a tactical basis.<\/p>  <p>  On the roles of other parties, we have often spoken about the role of Sinn F&eacute;in and the fact it has seven MPs who could vote in the House of Commons if they chose to do so.  It is also the case that Fianna F&aacute;il has a sister party in the Liberal Democrats.  The Labour Party has a sister party in the British Labour Party.  I encourage leaders to engage with their counterparts in the UK because there are a number of votes coming up.  It is not simply just a vote on whether the House of Commons accepts the withdrawal agreement or not.  There will be other votes.  Some votes are being put down, particularly on the backstop.  I would not like to see a vote in the House of Commons specifically repudiating the backstop.  We know there cannot be a withdrawal agreement without the backstop.  It is important that the sister parties, whether the Liberal Democrats or the British Labour Party, understand that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400021#T00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1543941300,"counter":207,"content":"<p>What about the Tories?

I do not know.  I note the release of the results of the labour force survey for quarter 3 of 2018 by the CSO on Tuesday, 20 November.  Overall, the release is very positive.  Figures show employment continues to grow strongly with 66,700 jobs created in the year from quarter 3 of 2017 to quarter 3 of 2018, which brings total employment to 2,273,000.  The number of people in employment has increased in six of the eight regions in the year from quarter 3 of 2017 to quarter 3 of 2018.  The exception to this is the mid-west, which has remained static, and the Border region.<\/p><p>We want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth and thereby reduce regional disparities.  Strategic investments within the overarching national context, embodied by Project Ireland 2040, and actions focused on maximising the competitive advantages and potential of each of the regions are key to ensuring each region can contribute to and participate in Ireland's future national growth and sustain a higher standard of living.<br\/><br\/>Since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment across the State.  The figure is for the period from quarter 1 of 2015 to quarter 3 of 2018.  A total of 163,500 people in the regions outside Dublin entered employment in that period.  That represents a figure of over 63%, or three in five jobs created, for regions outside County Dublin during the period from quarter 1 of 2015 to quarter 3 of 2018.  The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative is a central pillar of the Government's ambition to create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, of which some 135,000 will be outside Dublin.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>A key objective of the initiative is to have a further 10% to 15% at work in each region by 2020, with the aim of reducing the unemployment rate in each region to within one percentage point of the national average.<br\/><br\/>Government policies are working but, of course, we always want to do more.  That is why in April this year I asked all Regional Action Plan for Jobs committees to start a process to refresh and refocus all regional plans to ensure their relevance and impact up to 2020.  The refresh and refocus will ensure the plans remain effective and continue to deliver jobs throughout the country.  It will ensure the plans can be sufficiently robust to address the challenges we face, including Brexit.  In October I met the chairpersons again to hear directly about the progress made to date.  All regions have established a project delivery team.  Each team has met to examine initial proposals for each region's strategic objectives and all regions have a working draft of their refreshed plans.<br\/><br\/>My Department is also working closely with the agencies, including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and local enterprise offices, and other relevant stakeholders.  Their ongoing regional activities will also be included in the plans.

In the Border region the employment gain from the third quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2018 was 0%.

Overall, three out of every five new jobs have been created outside Dublin since the Regional Action Plan for Jobs was launched in 2015 and we continue to see an increasing number of positive job announcements throughout the country.  I am altogether familiar with the Border region.  In the past year the rate of unemployment along the Border has dropped from 6.5% to 5.1%.  It is down from a high of 16.1% in 2012 and lower than the State average.  The number of unemployed persons in the Border region in quarter 3 of 2018 dropped to 9,500 people from 12,400.

The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, said Ireland was unbalanced.  We must accept that comment, given that 45% of GDP is generated inside the M50.  That is a clear indication that the country is grossly unbalanced.  It will tip into the Irish Sea if it continues to develop around the capital and on the east coast.  At the same time, there are large areas of the country where there has been zero growth in employment during a sustained period of growth nationally, which is an indictment.

Its objective is to identify immediate and longer-term measures which can address increasing costs while bearing in mind the need to maintain a stable insurance sector.  The first phase of this work involved an examination of the motor insurance sector.  The second phase involved an examination of the employer liability insurance and public liability insurance sectors.<\/p><p>The work of the cost of insurance working group is complemented by the work of the Personal Injuries Commission, PIC.  I was pleased to submit the second and final report of the PIC to the Government on 18 September 2018.  The publication of this report concluded the challenging work programme of the PIC since its establishment in January 2017 on foot of a recommendation in the cost of insurance working group motor report.<\/p><p>The benchmarking exercise, undertaken by independent consultants on behalf of the PIC and published in this second and final report, has revealed that the level of general damages for whiplash injuries in this jurisdiction runs at a multiple of typically 4.4 times that of our nearest neighbours, England and Wales.  This multiple is of such a magnitude that the PIC is satisfied that it calls for a response that is both effective and achievable in the shortest possible time.<\/p><p>The key recommendation in the report follows the example of judicial intervention which has occurred in Northern Ireland and in the UK, namely the introduction of judicial guidelines for judges.  The PIC believes that the imminent statutory establishment of the Irish Judicial Council provides a unique opportunity to seek and obtain guidance for judges in measuring general damages for personal injury.  Judicial guidelines should lead to greatly increased levels of consistency in awards, enable early resolution of claims and reduce costs.<\/p><p>I welcome the publication in November by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, of data on whiplash related injury compensation awards resulting from road traffic accidents.  The publication of these data delivers on a recommendation from the first report of the Personal Injuries Commission published in December 2017 and involved analysis of approximately 4,500 awards made in the first six months of 2018.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>The Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018, which is scheduled for Committee Stage this evening, is an important measure to encourage more personal injury claims to be settled within the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, process.  PIAB facilitates the objective assessment of damages at a much lower delivery cost and in a far shorter timeframe than through litigation.  PIAB processes claims within 7.3 months compared to several years for litigation.  Therefore, encouraging more claimants to finalise their cases through the PIAB model rather than resorting to litigation should lead to cost savings in the claims environment.  This is good for society as a whole as it delivers compensation more quickly, with lower costs and predictable outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400023#V00800","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1543942500,"counter":234,"content":"<p>We are primarily talking about people who are making fraudulent claims.

InterTradeIreland has a vital role to play as part of Ireland's Brexit response.  This additional funding will enable the body to meet demand in existing programmes, develop initiatives and support SMEs affected by Brexit.<br\/><br\/>The local enterprise offices are present in every single county and provide crucial supports for SMEs and start-ups throughout the country.  This year, I am allocating an additional &euro;5 million, which is an increase of 22% on 2018.

This will be a seminal 18 month project that will see a comprehensive review of the SME business ecosystem and policies, using OECD expertise in a structured and defined process.  The resulting recommendations and issues identified by the report will then form the basis of a long-term Department-led SME strategy for Ireland.  The delivery of the review document and the strategy roadmap will be completed by the OECD within 18 months of commencement.

This is because almost 70% of all new FDI in Ireland comes from existing IDA client companies already situated in the country.<\/p><p>As the evidence demonstrates, there has been a steady and positive increase in employment numbers in IDA Ireland client companies in Donegal in recent years.

This compares very favourably with the national average increase of 31% in FDI employment across that same period.

County Wexford forms part of the south-east regional action plan for jobs, which aims to achieve a 10% to 15% growth in employment over the period to 2020, as well as ensuring unemployment reduces to within at least one percentage point of the State average.<\/p><p>Since commencing the regional Action Plan for Jobs in 2015, good progress has been made on job creation in the south east, with 17,300 more people in employment in the region from the first quarter of 2015, baseline year, to the third quarter of 2018.  The unemployment rate in the south east at the third quarter of 2018 stands at 8.6%, down from 11.7 % in the first quarter of 2015. <\/p><p>There are 18 IDA Ireland client companies located in County Wexford employing a total of 2,948 people.  Foreign direct investment-supported employment in County Wexford has increased by 10% from 2016 to 2017.  IDA Ireland continues to work with its clients to identify opportunities for new investment or expansion in Wexford and the broader south east.  In doing so, IDA Ireland will draw the attention of investors to the region's particular strengths, including its ports and existing clusters of financial services, technology and high-value manufacturing firms.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland continues to support job creation in County Wexford, with client companies employing more than 4,670 people in the county.  Payments by Enterprise Ireland to client companies in the county in 2017 totalled &euro;2.16 million.  Significant investment announced in County Wexford includes the re-opening of Glanbia Ireland&rsquo;s Wexford cheese plant following a major capital investment programme.

In that regard in 2017, the LEO in Wexford supported 213 clients with 1,348 total jobs, which was a gross increase of 238 jobs on 2016.

Two weeks ago during Leaders' Questions I raised with the Taoiseach the ODCE report on the mishandling of the investigation into the chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, and his annual warehousing of personal loans from the bank.  I said I had seen the ODCE report and that it was a whitewash.  I wish to correct the D&aacute;il record.  It was not the original ODCE report that I had seen but a Government account of the investigative failures of the ODCE identified by Judge John Aylmer and the steps being taken to address them.  The Minister published that account today.  We saw it two weeks ago and I have read it twice.  I am sad to say it, but it is a whitewash.  In the introduction to the document the Minister wrote that the aim in publishing the account was to present the facts surrounding the investigative shortcomings identified by Judge Aylmer, learn from them and take measures to address them.  Where in the document is that done?  The document prepared by the Department that I have seen does not do that.<\/p>  <p>  The ODCE report on the collapse of the FitzPatrick trial was requested in May 2017 by the then Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation under section 955 of the Companies Act 2014 following a direct request from the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny.  Section 955 requires the director to give information to the Minister and, when requested, account to a committee of the Oireachtas.  This is a reporting requirement.  The Minister is now telling us that, owing to section 956 on confidential information, she does not have the power to publish the report.  I do not accept that.  Section 956 does not relate to reports requested under section 955; rather, it deals with protecting confidential information the director has accumulated while performing his or her functions which are set out in section 949.  The power contained in section 955 is not a function of the director but a reporting requirement.<\/p>  <p>  The ODCE report is 250 pages long.  It has been on the desk of various Ministers in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation for 17 months.  On the opening pages of the original report the Director of Corporate Enforcement wrote that no information or document had been omitted from it on the basis that it would prejudice the performance of any of his functions.  How can the Minister refuse to publish the report when the director has stated nothing in it would interfere with his functions?  I do not understand the Minister's argument.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400031#DD01200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1543947300,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400031#DD01300","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1543947300,"counter":346,"content":"<p>The way the Government has dealt with the issue raises many questions.

As legislators, we will be expected to sign off on a new body - a beefed up ODCE - in the near future, but how can we consider the new legislation when we cannot even see where the problems arose in the past?

One of the most complex and largest investigations in the history of the State commenced in 2008 with the investigation by the ODCE into Anglo Irish Bank.  The trial in the case ended when Judge Aylmer directed the acquittal of the defendant on all charges.  Following Judge Aylmer's ruling on 23 May 2017, the then Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation requested a report from the Director of Corporate Enforcement on the issues arising from the trial.  The report, to which the Deputy is referring, was delivered on 23 June 2017 to the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p>  <p>  There has been extensive engagement with the Office of the Attorney General on the publication of the report.  It was hoped initially that it would be possible to publish it.  However, prior to making a final decision on publication, further consideration had to be given to the confidentiality obligations concerning information in the possession of the director, as there was a public interest in ensuring ongoing and future investigations would not be compromised by the disclosure of details of an individual investigation and the investigative process.<\/p>  <p>  Owing to section 956 of the Companies Act 2014, I am prohibited from publishing reports prepared pursuant to section 955 of the Act.  While it is not possible to publish the report, I have this afternoon published an account of the investigative shortcomings identified by Judge Aylmer.  My aim in publishing the account is to set out the factors that led to the shortcomings in order that we can learn from them and take measures to address them.  The focus of the account is on the ODCE's role in the shortcomings identified, not on the other parties involved in the case.  In the interests of balance, it is important, however, to emphasise that the shortcomings in this instance should not overshadow the ODCE's track record in previous investigations and prosecutions which led to successful convictions.  I accept that the standard of investigation in this case fell below appropriate standards.  This happened between 2008 and 2012.  The judge's findings point to the need for a broader skills base, a greater range and depth of knowledge and experience within the office and a greater appreciation of the necessity to employ appropriate procedures and manage risk.<\/p>  <p>  Now that we know the factors that led to the shortcomings, our focus has shifted to ensuring we use the lessons of this investigation, note the steps already taken to address them and identify further measures to enhance the capacity of the ODCE to tackle corporate wrongdoing.  Since the time of the investigation, the director has implemented multiple reforms within the ODCE that address many of the issues that led to the investigative shortcomings outlined by Judge Aylmer.  The drafting of the companies (corporate enforcement authority) Bill to establish the ODCE as a stand-alone agency will build on these reforms and ensure the ODCE is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law.  Furthermore, as part of the process of preparing the Bill, any further power identified as a requirement for carrying out the functions of the agency will be considered, as appropriate.  I have secured an additional &euro;1 million for the ODCE in 2019 to assist in its transition to a stand-alone agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400031#DD01700","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1543947300,"counter":350,"content":"<p>The Minister's report does not give us the answers for which we are looking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400031#DD01800","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1543947300,"counter":351,"content":"<p>It does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400031#DD01900","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1543947300,"counter":352,"content":"<p>The Minister is defending the director, but I am not attacking him.

Not publishing it is not doing him any favours.  The Minister's report does not outline any of the investigative failures or shortcomings that Judge Aylmer identified.  I can tell the Minister that 15 pages of his report after he threw out the case are far more informative - 20 times more informative - than her account.  The Minister's report ignores the fact that there was a deliberate attempt to build the case rather than investigate it independently and impartially.  At this stage, I am convinced that we need a full independent inquiry if we are to get information and understanding and find out where we are going.  We are talking about forming a new entity.  That is fine.  I do not have a problem with that because we need to do something serious about tackling white-collar crime but it does not stack up for the Government to hide behind the Attorney General's advice and not publish the ODCE report.  I do not believe the Government can continue down this road without a full independent inquiry.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting that the House of Commons had a vote today about the British attorney general's legal advice.  The British Government has just been defeated and the British attorney general will be censured in the House of Commons for refusing to publish his legal advice regarding Brexit.

If we want transparency and openness about what happened since 2009 concerning how the FitzPatrick case was dealt with from start to finish, we need a full independent inquiry.  For starters, we need to see the publication of the ODCE's original report, all 235 pages of it.

Survival rates are 92% for prostate cancer, 83% for breast cancer and 63% for bowel cancer.  However, when it comes to lung cancer, the statistics are stark with a survival rate of 18%.  More people are killed by lung cancer than by any other cancer.  More people have died from lung cancer than have died from breast cancer and colorectal cancer combined.  It is the leading cause of cancer deaths in Ireland.  The lung cancer mortality rate in Irish women is the fourth highest in Europe - more than 50% above the European average - and is still increasing.  Cancer has overtaken heart disease as the most common cause of death in Ireland as the population grows.  This translates to 1,865 deaths per year.  The incidence of lung cancer is expected to increase dramatically by 119% in the next 25 or so years.<\/p>  <p>  There are very significant statistics relating to health inequalities in Ireland.  Lung cancer rates are 60% higher in socio-economically deprived groups than in the least deprived groups.  Survival rates are also significantly lower in poorer socio-economically groups than among the better off.  The statistic relating to urban and rural areas is interesting.  The rate among males in urban areas is 36% higher than it is in rural areas while the rate for women in urban areas is 38% than it is in rural areas.  We are talking about over 2,500 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed every year.  We know the economic cost but that does not take into account the cost to individuals and their families and loved ones when a diagnosis proves to be fatal.  Lung cancer research gets lower levels of funding compared to other common cancers.<\/p>  <p>  Research also shows that Ireland is falling behind other EU countries with regard to patients having timely access to the most innovative treatments.  For example, in 2016, only 20% of new cancer medicines that had been launched in the previous two years were available in Ireland.  The figure in Portugal was 40% while the figure in Germany was 76%.  Lung cancer has the fourth highest percentage of emergency presentations at 25% of all cases.  We know about the association with smoking but 20% of people with lung cancer will never have smoked.  We know early detection is vital.  Treatment can include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and cancer medicines.  There are new treatments.  Research indicates the potential of immuno-oncology to improve survival rates.  Immuno-oncology medicines can be used as first-line and second-line treatment, on their own or in combination with other treatments like chemotherapy.  There have been developments in biomarker testing, which means that doctors can identify which lung cancer patients are likely to benefit from these new immuno-oncology treatments.  Again, this is progress and Ireland needs to be part of it.  At the moment, we are falling behind other EU countries with regard to timely access to the most innovative techniques.  In fact, we are last out of 13 western European countries when it comes to bringing new cancer medicines to patients.  This is a shame when we think of the progress made with regard to breast cancer and prostate cancer.<\/p>  <p>  What is the Government planning to do to make sure those with lung cancer have access to the innovative new treatments, include immuno-oncology therapy and combination therapies?  These are the treatments that are making a difference to survival rates of those with lung cancer in the countries that offer those treatments.

I know she has been a strong advocate in respect of cancer in Ireland for many years.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on lung cancer.  On average, 2,500 patients are diagnosed with lung cancer in Ireland annually with over 1,800 deaths each year attributable to this disease.  However, much work has been done to address this.  Survival rates for lung cancer are improving.  In the last two decades, lung cancer five-year survival rates have increased from 8% to 16% in males and from 9% to 21% in females.<\/p>  <p>  Prevention is a cornerstone of the national cancer strategy for 2017 to 2026.  It is estimated that the proportion of cancers attributable to lifestyle and environmental risks that can be modified is in the region of 30% to 40%.  It is vital that we are effective in getting the message across to the population that each person can impact significantly on their level of risk in developing cancer.  Effective health promotion and disease prevention initiatives result in less chronic disease.  The Government has already initiated policy to improve our nation's health through the Healthy Ireland programme.  The Healthy Ireland programme takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and well-being with a focus on prevention.  With at least 85% of lung cancer attributable to smoking, Tobacco Free Ireland, the national tobacco control strategy, is an important initiative in reducing the incidence of lung cancer in Ireland.<\/p><p>It has the key goal of making Ireland tobacco free by 2025.  There is evidence that past changes in behaviour with regard to smoking have led to current better health for individuals and this is something which can be built on to promote further behavioural change.<\/p> <p> Increasing the number of cancers diagnosed at an early stage is a key aspect of the cancer strategy.  Cancers that are diagnosed at an earlier stage are generally more likely to lead to better treatment options and improve survival outcomes.  Raising awareness in people that unusual or persistent symptoms need to be checked out is a critical step in the early diagnoses of cancers.<\/p> <p> Recommendation seven of the national cancer strategy states that the HSE national cancer control programme, in partnership with the HSE's health and well-being directorate and voluntary sector, will develop a rolling programme of public awareness campaigns aimed at the early detection of specific cancers.  Work is now progressing on the development of such a campaign for lung cancer.<\/p> <p> Rapid access clinics for patients with suspected lung cancer have been established in eight designated cancer centres.  These clinics seek to ensure that lung cancer is diagnosed and patients enter treatment as soon as possible.  So far this year, 87% of patients referred to these clinics have been seen within ten days.  With the ongoing implementation of the national cancer strategy, I look forward to increasingly successful prevention measures for lung cancer with early diagnoses and effective treatment leading to further improvements for patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400032#EE01000","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543948500,"counter":366,"content":"<p>It is probably opportune that the Minister of State is taking this himself because of his own personal interest in this topic as a smoker.<\/p>  <p>  We have to acknowledge the different rates for those with lung cancer and I think stigma is an issue.

The stigma is also reflected in a survey which showed that 30% of those surveyed thought that non-smokers should have preferential treatment for lung cancer over smokers.  Is stigma preventing people from presenting earlier, especially in lower socioeconomic areas?  It is very serious because we know how vital early intervention is.<\/p>  <p>  Lung cancer needs to figure more prominently in the Healthy Ireland strategy.

I will make it brief and to the point.  We need to have ambition and vision for the greater metropolitan area of Cork.  We now have a situation where the south link road is effectively at capacity with about 87,000 vehicles using that stretch of road every day.  About 70,000 cars are using the Jack Lynch Tunnel every day.  The Minister will come back to me and point out that the Government is going to invest a large amount of money in the Dunkettle interchange.  Of course, that is not planning for the future, that is catching up with the present.  These issues are a result of the demand that is now placed on the Dunkettle interchange.  It is clear and obvious that Cork needs an outer, northern ring road and it needs to be planned.  Initial planning was sought for this a number of years ago, however it was shelved in the downturn.<\/p>  <p>  We are now in a strong upturn.  We need to put in place solid, coherent plans to address the issue of the imbalance in Cork city and the Munster region.  We need an outer, northern ring road from Killydonoghoe, north of the Glanmire bypass, stretching right across the periphery of the northern city, over Kerry Pike and down to Poulavone.  We should now bring about the plans that were there and enact them quickly to ensure sustainable planning and development is put in place that will not diminish the chances of us actually building a northern ring road.<\/p>  <p>  All of this is in the context of the expansion of the city boundary.  We are going to have all this particular area inside the city limits so it is appropriate now for the Minister to use his office to show his imagination and vision and his capacity to look beyond the local issues of the Stepaside Garda station and plan for real regional development.  The region and city is completely dependent on the tunnel at the moment.  If anything happens to it, or if there is a catastrophic accident in the tunnel, or it is closed for a long time because of maintenance, or if there was major structural damage done to the tunnel which meant it closed for a long time, the region would stop.  It is the only major arterial route across the River Lee from north to south.  The deep water port and the airport are in the south.  All the hospitals and universities are in the south, as is the institute of technology.  It is the gateway to the broader south-west region.  We are completely dependent on the tunnel for traversing from north to south.<\/p>  <p>  A northern ring route should be developed to ensure we are not dependent on the tunnel.  That would stimulate sustainable development over the short and medium term.  Nearly all of the industrial development in the city is now taking place south of the river.  It is almost impossible to get major multinationals or large companies to locate in the IDA centres on the northern side of the river.  Kilbarry is a ghost town.  There is now barley planted in it again.  It is one mile from Patrick Street and it is growing barley.  That is the contribution that park is making to development on the north side of the city.<\/p>  <p>  For many reasons, we need a northern ring route.  I implore and urge the Minister to be imaginative, like in the old days when he had the land use and transportation study, LUTS, which clearly marked out a vision for the future in planning and sustainable transport.  We need the Minister to step up to the plate and ensure that we revisit the national plan including the northern ring road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400033#FF00400","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1543948500,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to address this issue in the House.<\/p><p>As he is aware, the national development plan, which was published earlier this year in conjunction with the national planning framework as part of the Government's Project Ireland 2040 plan, sets out the major transport investments that are planned over the next ten years.  I understood from the Topical Issue matter that was furnished to me that the Deputy was seeking to discuss the need for me \"to carry out a full assessment of transport needs for the greater Cork metropolitan area in consultation with both local authorities and Transport Infrastructure Ireland\".  The Deputy will forgive me if I answer the question he tabled.<\/p> <p> The national development plan makes it clear that the Cork local authorities, in partnership with the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, are finalising a Cork metropolitan area transport strategy.  The national development plan includes a number of commitments in respect of transport in Cork.  These commitments will be included in the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy, which will contain proposals relating to all modes of transport, including road network improvements; a revised, more extensive and higher-capacity bus system; enhancements to the commuter rail service, including additional stations; a future light rail corridor; and a number of bus-based and rail-based park and ride sites.  The Deputy referred specifically to investment in roads.  The national development plan proposes various major roads projects for Cork, including the N20-M20 scheme, which will link the cities of Cork and Limerick with a high-quality transport corridor.  The Deputy mentioned the Cork north ring road, which will be examined as a part of the overall planning and design of the M20 scheme.  The M28 project between Cork and Ringaskiddy and the N8-N25-N40 Dunkettle interchange upgrade scheme are also being pursued.<\/p> <p> On the public transport side, the national development plan commits to the Cork BusConnects programme, which will deliver a revised bus network for Cork city.  It will comprise the delivery of crucial bus corridors, enhanced services, cashless fares and account-based ticketing.  As part of the delivery of this programme, a network of park and ride sites, serviced by the more efficient bus network, will be put in place.  The Cork BusConnects programme has enormous potential to transform the bus system in Cork radically by making it much more efficient, reliable and attractive to new passengers.  The national development plan also provides that the Cork transport strategy will include an evaluation of a light rail corridor to serve the increased population growth up to 2040 that is envisaged by the national planning framework.<\/p> <p> The objective of the Cork transport strategy will be to provide a long-term strategic planning framework for the integrated development of transport infrastructure and services in the Cork metropolitan area over the next two decades or so.  It will be used to inform transport investment levels and investment prioritisation over the longer and shorter terms.  It will also inform sustainable integrated land use and transport policy formulation at strategic and local levels.  The transport strategy is at an advanced stage of preparation.  I understand that a draft is expected to progress to public consultation early in 2019.  Feedback from the consultation process will be taken into consideration in the finalisation of the transport strategy for the Cork metropolitan area.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Southern Regional Assembly is finalising a draft regional spatial and economic strategy for public consultation.  Officials from the Department, the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland have worked closely with the regional assembly on the transport elements of the regional strategy.  The strategy will include a metropolitan area strategic plan for Cork, as set out in the national planning framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400033#FF00500","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543949100,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  There is a small problem here.  The northern ring road is mentioned on just one line of the national planning framework.  The plan talks about the development of a motorway linking Cork and Limerick, which we would all welcome.  The fact of the matter is that it is planned to build a motorway that will run into 19th century roads.  We have no proper orbital route on the north side of the city.  Such a route is needed for many logical reasons, most importantly, the greater development not just of the north side of Cork city but of the region as a whole.  The region depends completely on the tunnel as the only way of moving from north to south.  As I have said, all of the main infrastructure - the deep water ports and the airport - is in the southern part of the region.  If anything were to happen to the tunnel, it could have catastrophic consequences for the economic development and the continued growth of the area.  All of the Minister's eggs are in one basket.  If we are to be brave and visionary, we need to accept that a north ring road needs to be developed to link the Dublin Road to the Poulavone area of Ballincollig.  This is an essential infrastructural requirement for the greater good of the region and for the more balanced development of Cork city.  The Minister knows the city well.  Anyone who visits it will see quite clearly that the north side is unable to attract industry because of a lack of access.  It needs to be opened up.  I implore the Minister, in the interests of local and regional balance and for the sake of ensuring we do not continue to depend on the tunnel, to provide that the north ring road is included in any assessment of infrastructural development requirements in Cork in short and medium terms.

At the core of the convention is the realisation of rights that have long been denied to people with disabilities.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is at a standstill.

I am grateful to have the opportunity to update the House on progress to deliver on the rights contained in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities since it came into force in Ireland on 19 April 2018.  It is something of which we are all very proud in government.  It was ratified at the United Nations in New York and I attended to represent Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The topic is particularly timely, given that yesterday, 3 December, was International Day of Disabled Persons.  I attended a number of events with a lot of families and disabled people.  We are making good progress in making all of the convention&rsquo;s requirements operational in Ireland in an appropriate manner.  Considerable progress has been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s full implementation of the convention as set out in the 2015 roadmap.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 was reformed through a 2017 Act of the same name to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  <\/p>  <p>  Two further priority implementation issues were raised by the Deputies.  They are the enactment of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 and the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  I am pleased to announce a date for Committee Stage of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 has been set - 19 December - when it is proposed important amendments will be brought forward to enable an increase in the target for the employment of persons with disabilities in the public sector, from 3% to 6%, on a phased basis by 2024.  As the House is aware, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties.  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the decision support service within the Mental Health Commission, a body under the aegis of the Department of Health, must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.  Every effort is under way to ensure the decision support service will be ready for business as soon as possible.  While the director of the decision support service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act in early 2020, the situation will be kept under review as the preparatory work for implementation moves forward.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies spoke about resources.  Budget 2019 provides for an allocation of &euro;3 million in the Vote for the Department of Justice and Equality for the establishment of the decision support service.  A sum of &euro;3 million was also provided for the service in the Vote for the Department of Justice and Equality in 2018.

It is critical that Minister of State ensure Report and Final Stage will be scheduled as is humanly possible following the resumption of the D&aacute;il in January.  No dilly-dallying in taking those Stages on the floor of the D&aacute;il will be acceptable.  This is very important and I hope the Minister of State will afford himself the opportunity, in responding to me at the conclusion of the debate, to confirm that is exactly his intention.<\/p>  <p>  On the decision support service, it is absolutely unacceptable that we are looking at a situation where the main or critical elements of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act will be commenced in 2020.  That is not what we were told previously.  When officials from the Department of Justice and Equality appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality just over a year ago to discuss the legislation, we were told, to our shock and horror, that they would be commenced in 2019.  Now we are looking at their being commenced in 2020, not in the coming year, which is absolutely shameful.  Whatever the reasons for this protracted and further delay, the Minister of State is in the position to make sure it will continue no longer.

When he appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality 12 months ago this month, he indicated that the UNCRPD and the optional protocol would be ratified in tandem on the same day, but that has not happened.

I secured an additional &euro;150 million in budget 2019 for disability services.  I continue to drive through a wide range of practical reforms to improve the lives of people with disabilities and to focus on their ability.  We are making consistent moves toward the full implementation of all the requirements of the convention.  Considerable progress has been made this year and we have effective structures in place.  The structures include the national disability strategy steering group, assisted by the disability stakeholders group, which holds the Government to account.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is in the process of constituting its monitoring committee.  This will complete another piece in the jigsaw.<\/p> <p> Of course it is important that we acknowledge the need for services for people with disabilities.  I will set out five examples.  We have restored the carer's grant to &euro;1,700 for 101,000 families.  We have brought in the medical card extension for children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  A total of 11,000 children have benefited.  We have given an extra &euro;10 million through the Ability programme.  We gave an extra &euro;10 million in 2018 for the respite care houses.  The last of the 12 houses is being completed next week.  The past three budgets have seen a &euro;15 increase in the disability allowance.  We are moving along.  Do we want to move faster?

I look forward to working with colleagues, who I know have put considerable work into this area.<\/p>  <p>  I want to talk about the background to the Smyth report.  The report was before Government recently and has been published.  The background, as Deputies are aware, is that the national broadband plan is an ambitious plan.  It set out to ensure that every home, school and business in Ireland, regardless of how remote or rural, will have access to high-speed broadband.  In international terms this is a highly ambitious plan.  No one is to be left behind in terms of getting access to broadband.  The broadband specification set out, namely, a minimum of 30 megabits, will be considerably exceeded.  Indeed it was considerably exceeded by all three.  The plan aims to deliver fibre to the home in the great majority of cases.  It will be a high standard of broadband access.<\/p>  <p>  We all know from our lives about the importance of access to broadband.  We know about its impact on what people can do.  We know about the ease with which people can communicate, stay in touch and get options for business, leisure, social contacts and so on.<\/p>  <p>  The position is that the final tender was submitted to the Department on 18 September.  That is now under a process of detailed assessment and the assessment is continuing.  In parallel, the independent process auditor to the procurement process was asked to provide a report to the Taoiseach and me to assess whether the process has been compromised by meetings which took place between the former Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, and Mr. David McCourt.  Mr. Peter Smyth's primary role is as an independent consultant who has been contracted as process auditor in respect of the national broadband plan procurement process.  He was secured by an independent tender on the basis of which he was selected.  In that capacity he is required to audit the procurement process against the appropriate guidelines and processes.  The auditor is independent of the Department and in this capacity formally reports to the Secretary General as Accounting Officer for the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Last week the Government noted and accepted the conclusions of the independent auditor's report.  I imagine all those present have read the report.  Essentially, the auditor took four critical tests against which he judged what had occurred with regard to meetings, in particular meetings that were neither minuted nor where an independent person was in attendance.  The four tests are set out in page 16 of the report.  The independent auditor considered whether the former Minister was privy to any sensitive information that could have been of benefit to Granahan McCourt.  The second test was whether the former Minister took any decisions within the process that benefited Granahan McCourt.  The third test was whether the former Minister was in a position to influence changes in the tender documents.  The final test was whether the former Minister was in a position to influence the evaluation of the submissions.  Based on the consideration of these four elements, the independent process auditor was satisfied that the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, did not influence or seek to influence the conduct of the tender process in favour of Granahan McCourt or otherwise.<\/p>  <p>  The auditor went on in his general conclusions to say that the meetings between the former Minister and Mr. David McCourt gave cause for concern as they suggest an ongoing engagement outside of any formal need for them to engage with each other in the normal course of the Department business, including the business of the State-led intervention under the national broadband plan.  Mr. Smyth indicated that these meetings in and of themselves gave cause for concern.  However, when he considered them against the four tests and when he reviewed all the information to which he had access, including the decision register, the evolution of the tender documents, the evaluation process for the various submissions and the information that could have been available to the bidder through contact with the former Minster and so on, he drew the conclusion that he was satisfied that neither the former Minister nor Mr. McCourt had the opportunity to influence the conduct of the tender process in favour of Granahan McCourt or otherwise.  He also concluded that the decision of the former Minister to resign, thereby removing himself from the process, insulates the process from any apparent bias created by his engagements with Mr. McCourt.  Those are the important conclusions.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to comment on the overall procurement process.  The process auditor has had access to all the key documentation over the 2.5 years of his engagement with the project to date.  This has given him extensive knowledge of the practices, procedures and processes relating to this procurement.  In his role, he has found appropriate guidelines have been adhered to in the procurement process.  He has confirmed that the processes and decision-making are fair and objective and follow agreed processes.<\/p>  <p>  It is now my priority that the procurement process is brought to a conclusion in a fair and transparent manner.  I propose to revert to Government in the coming weeks with a recommendation.  In bringing this process to a close I recognise, as do all my colleagues in the House, the profound benefits that high-speed broadband will bring to our citizens, urban and rural, living and working in Ireland.  These benefits and opportunities are at the heart of why the national broadband plan exists and why the Government is determined to deliver it.  We have all had personal interactions with many people throughout the country, especially in rural areas, who have been seeking a solution to the issue of connectivity.  Digital connectivity has multiple positive impacts on the lives and livelihood of citizens throughout the country.  The objectives of the national broadband plan aim to ensure that high quality reliable and future-proofed connectivity is available to every home and every business nationwide.<\/p><p>Some 1.1 million people live in the areas covered by the State intervention.  The towns, villages, parishes and townlands are home to communities which need this service to thrive and prosper.  These are communities with many self-employed people engaged in running more than 44,000 small to medium enterprises and more than 55,000 farms.  The direct effect of the State investment will ensure that all citizens across the country will have the same access to quality, high-speed broadband.  People of all ages and backgrounds will benefit from the roll-out.  The benefits of access to high-speed broadband are as diverse as the people whose lives will be affected by this major advance in service.<\/p> <p> As people who already avail of this service know, high-speed broadband is a transformative tool and is essential for the operations, compliance and services of businesses in every corner of the State.  Access to reliable broadband services has the potential to support net job creation.  This will happen through the growth of existing enterprises and the formation of start-ups in areas that previously did not have access to high-speed broadband.  Farmers, for example, are already keenly aware of the benefits precision farming techniques can bring to their lifestyles and Iivelihoods.  Agricultural benefits can be realised now and in the future by the adoption of smart farming methods.  These methods can improve productivity and herd nutrition and allow for data-driven crop management, all of which lead to techniques that can reduce carbon emissions and improve environmental outcomes.<\/p> <p> Digital resources are increasingly becoming part of the day-to-day education system.  Using technology can benefit children in the school and at home, but children will require access to broadband in the home to fully avail of these resources.  There are 674 national schools in the State intervention area.  The national broadband plan will ensure that these children benefit from an equality of opportunity available to all pupils and students in the country.  <\/p> <p> I am conscious of the time remaining so I will short-circuit my remaining comments.  I have already outlined the benefits of the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  The Government's commitment to broadband has acted as a catalyst to the industry, which has responded in rolling out high-speed broadband.  The increase in commercial availability has been dramatic.  We have close to 75% coverage for commercial broadband.  The challenge relates to the 23% in the intervention area, which covers almost 96% of the land area of the State.  Providing equality of opportunity, to which the Government is very committed, is a challenging task.  I hope we can develop a proposal that will commend itself, but at this stage evaluations are continuing.  I hope they will conclude soon so that I can bring a recommendation to the Government shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400036#JJ00800","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543950900,"counter":398,"content":"<p>My understanding is that each side will have six minutes as part of a dialogue with the Minister.  I thank the Minister for outlining the importance of the national broadband plan.  We have been hearing about it since 2012 and we know how important it is.  The people who do not have broadband certainly know how important it is.  My motivation throughout this entire debacle has been to try to ensure we get a contractor that can provide the necessary service to those 542,000 homes.<\/p>  <p>  I want to understand the motivation of the bidder throughout its rather unusual interactions with the former Minister.  I cannot understand the necessity for all the meetings, phone calls and private dinners.  I am not raising any issue about the previous Minister on this, but I wonder what the motivation of the bidder was.  I have been concerned about it for some time.  Mr. Smyth, in his report, rather bizarrely looks at only one side of the equation.  He seeks to understand whether some influence has been exerted, and concludes that there was no influence exerted, nor could there have been, because he accepts that at three private meetings at least no discussions took place about the national broadband plan.  He relies on the statements of the bidder and the former Minister in that regard.  I do not know whether that took the form of a questionnaire or whether he had face-to-face meetings with those concerned to establish the facts about that.  Perhaps the Minister can advise us in that regard. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister stated that, in the four tests used by Mr. Smyth, all appropriate guidelines and procedures were considered.  I want to highlight one particular guideline.  The communication protocol between the Department and external bidders sets out the procedure very clearly under two headings.  Under the heading on canvassing, it sets out the prohibition that applies and states that direct or indirect canvassing by a bidder, consortium member, bidder member or their suppliers or advisers in relation to the project or the procurement, or any attempt to obtain information from any of the agents or employees of the Department, its political representatives or its appointed advisers concerning other bidders, or a solution to a final bid tender or procurement in general is prohibited.  It then provides a remedy for such action, stating that any breach of the section will entitle the Department to immediately disqualify the bidder concerned.<\/p>  <p>  If there was more than one bidder the Minister knows that its lawyers would be down in the courts now arguing that the remaining bidder, which has clearly breached canvassing rules, should be excluded from the process.  Given that at least one of these dinner meetings in Mr. McCourt's home took place while the two previous bidders were in the race, it is astonishing that Mr. Smyth did not recognise a significant breach of the rules set out in the communication protocol.  The same applies in respect of section 7 of that document, which deals with the separation of functions within the Department's divisional units.  It states that it is recognised that the day-to-day functions of the Department, in carrying out its remit, may involve engagement with stakeholders who are bidders in the process.  Mr. Smyth relies on that to suggest that some of the meetings were casual in nature.  While that is the case, there were three meetings that were not and could not come under this heading.  It then sets out the protocol to apply in respect of any such communications, namely, that officials in the Department will not at any time discuss the NBP procurement process outside the NBP team.  We have direct proof that this happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400037#KK00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1543950900,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time.

My point of view and that of my party is that we want the broadband plan to be rolled out yesterday.  It is supposed to be rolled out by 2020, but that commitment in the programme for Government is obviously dead.  I do not believe there was any intention on the part of the former Minister to gain personally from his meetings with Mr. McCourt.  However, it does show how easy it is for big businessmen and Ministers to meet and how often it happens.  As an observer of the process and seeing it at first hand, it certainly shocked me.  The problem with such meetings is that they show a certain panic on the part of the Government and departmental officials.  It illustrates the power of the one bidder who is left.  The Government has left the roll-out of the entire national broadband plan in the hands of one venture capitalist.  On the one hand, an American venture capitalist is the only bidder.  He can name his price, or the Government will lose him.  On the other hand, there is the French venture capitalist who owns Eir which was sold off by Fianna F&aacute;il in 1999.  That party owns a lot of the infrastructure on which it is to be rolled out.  The Government is trapped.  How is it going to find its way out?  Does it have a plan B?  Some have said in recent days that the process may collapse.  It is certainly shaky.  If it goes ahead as matters stand, it will be a shambles because of the way it has been compromised. <\/p>  <p>  There is one other thing I want to ask about.  Given the fact that the bidder had so much access to the Government and whoever else, do we have any idea if the taxpayer has been left exposed as a result?  We have heard figures of &euro;500 million and &euro;3 billion.  Where do Joe and Mary taxpayer stand in all of this?<\/p>  <p>  Six years ago we, in Sinn F&eacute;in, proposed an examination of the State infrastructure, the ESB network, the network of heavy duty cables across the State known as the backhaul system and the metropolitan area networks in 104 towns.  We proposed examining that infrastructure as the backbone of a publicly owned network.  Is the Government looking at it as a plan B?  <\/p>  <p>  Moreover, I want the Minister to address the issue of the contractor.  The bidder has changed substantially.  There were three parties involved in the process and the 300,000 premises that were easiest to reach were sold off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400038#LL00500","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1543951500,"counter":410,"content":"<p>The Minister will not have time to answer the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400038#LL00600","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1543951500,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Two parties walked and there is one consortium left.

I want to make it clear that it is the Department and not the Minister who is responsible for the governance and evaluation of the national broadband plan competitive dialogue procurement process.  On the conclusion of this evaluation, the Department makes a recommendation to the Minister, and the Minister then brings the matter to the Government for a decision.<\/p><p>It is important to put in context my engagements throughout this process.  During the debate here in this House last February, speaker after speaker highlighted the need to progress the project actively after Eir's withdrawal.  A member of the communications committee at the time said:<\/p><blockquote>It seems extraordinary that the tender has not yet been put in place.<br \/><br \/>It may be considered unfortunate to lose one bidder, but surely it is careless to lose two bidders.  What happens if we lose the third bidder?  What is plan B?<\/blockquote><p>He went on to say:<\/p><blockquote>I think this is a national emergency that requires emergency measures.  I hope the Minister will act accordingly.<\/blockquote><p>That is what I did - act accordingly to keep the remaining bidder at the table.  At no time did I interfere or try to interfere in the process to benefit any bidder.  I facilitated every meeting request from all the bidders in the dialogue process.  The fact is that I, as Minister, was kept at arm's length from the detail of the procurement process, and I was asked to be present at some pivotal points in the process on the request of my officials.  Such meetings were directed by officials both in terms of the briefings before such engagements and the meetings themselves.<\/p><p>The Smyth report shows I had 40 meetings with all the bidders since my appointment as Minister in May 2016.  If one browses through the lobbying register, it is clear that meetings between the telecoms industry and Members of this House happen regularly.  Just like Deputy Dooley and others in this House, my job required me to meet representatives of the telecoms industry because it is responsible for connecting every home, business and farm in the country in order that no one is left behind in this technological age.  Should we have a closed-door policy for Ministers and an open-door one for everyone else just for the sake of these optics?  As Mr. Smyth states in his report, the facts are that I did not have information available to me that was not already available to the bidder or bidders by virtue of the fact of it being a competitive dialogue process.  My only objective throughout has been to keep the bidders in the process - both Eir until the time of its withdrawal and Granahan McCourt-Enet-SSE subsequent to the withdrawal of Eir - in order to ensure that every citizen in the country was treated equally by delivering broadband to the 1.2 million people who are without this basic, vital service.<br\/><br\/>Some of my engagements with Mr. McCourt have been the subject of incomplete reporting in recent days.  Eight of the ten engagements I had with Mr. McCourt were when Granahan McCourt was the sole bidder in the process.  I did not discuss the procurement process at any of the dinner engagements with Mr. McCourt.  Furthermore, Mr. McCourt did not at any time canvass my support or seek to lobby or influence me on the procurement process.  I did not give preferential access to any bidder in the process.  By the time SIRO withdrew in September 2017, I had met the NBP participants on 23 occasions - ten times with SIRO, Vodafone and the ESB, six times with Eir and seven times with Enet-SSE.  When Eir withdrew from the process in late January 2018, I had met the remaining NBP participants on 17 occasions - nine times with Enet-SSE and eight times with Eir.  This included meetings on electricity policy with both the ESB and SSE.<br\/><br\/>In recent months, a theme of innuendo and aspersions inside and outside this Chamber has emerged which questions the capability of the last remaining bidder to deliver.  This is not for any of us to determine now.  That is the job of the 80-strong expert evaluation team.  We must ask, however, what is driving this narrative and for what gain.  Is it to collapse the plan altogether, perhaps?  It may have that desired effect, which would cause more heartache for 1.2 million people in rural Ireland.  I appeal to colleagues to let the evaluation team do its job.  Over the past 34 months, some of the most capable people in Europe, with experience in highly complex procurement projects, have been working on this project.  I reiterate that at no time did I interfere or try to interfere in the process to benefit any of the bidders, and the Peter Smyth report concludes this.<br\/><br\/>Finally, another voice from last February's D&aacute;il debate:<\/p><blockquote>The frustration on the ground is reaching boiling point...  If it is not delivered soon, the benefits may be lost forever as investment will not flow to rural and regional Ireland.  Successive Ministers have failed miserably to bring this crucial national project to completion.<\/blockquote><p>My only objective and goal as Minister was to bring this project to completion for the families, business owners, workers and farmers of rural Ireland, who have been waiting for far too long to become equal citizens in this digital age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400041#OO01900","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543953900,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I invite the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to bring the debate to a conclusion.

I do not know of any other country that has committed to this level of ambition.  I know of many that have fallen short of such a level of ambition.

Two of the amendments I propose to the Local Government Bill 2018 relate to the insertion of a new Part of the Bill dealing with plebiscites on directly elected mayors and consisting of seven sections, and a new Part dealing with urban areas and consisting of four sections.<\/p><p>In late September, the Government agreed in principle to the holding of plebiscites on directly elected mayors with executive powers for the cities and counties to which I referred at the same time as the local government elections in May 2019.

The date for holding the plebiscites is to be set by the Minister but the intention is that this would be in May 2019, the date of the local elections.  The plebiscites are to be conducted in accordance with regulations that will contain the usual provisions relating to ballot papers, returning officers, the taking of the poll, voting and counting of votes, etc., and will need to be approved by resolution of the Oireachtas.  The persons entitled to vote in the plebiscites will be those entitled to vote at local elections to Cork City Council, including those being transferred next year from the county to the city; Galway City Council and Galway County Council, in anticipation of a merger of these two local authorities in 2021; Limerick City and County Council; and Waterford City and County Council.  Information for voters, which is to be published and distributed by the relevant local authority at least 30 days before voting day, is to include a summary of the functions and office of directly elected mayors for local authorities concerned, the impact on the relevant local authorities, other statutory bodies, the estimated cost and resource implications, the possible advantages and disadvantages associated with the proposal, and any other information the Minister considers appropriate in guidelines to be issued to the authorities.  Within two years of the holding of plebiscites, the Minister must submit a report to the Oireachtas specifying either legislative proposals to establish the office of directly elected mayor for any of the local authority areas concerned or his or her reasons for not submitting such proposals.<\/p><p>Section 30 of the Local Government Bill removes the ministerial power to change local authority boundaries by order in circumstances where the local authorities concerned are not in agreement about the alteration.  As a result, where there is no agreement, future boundary alterations will be capable of being effected only by primary legislation, such as under this Bill in the case of Cork.<\/p> <p> In the context of continuing urban overspill across county boundaries, I propose to establish a mechanism for local authorities to work together to ensure the proper planning and development of certain cross-boundary urban areas.  The relevant provisions in a further new Part of the Bill require the establishment of urban area committees within six months of commencement of the legislation where at least 1,500 persons or 15% of the population of an urban centre are living in the administrative area of another local authority.  This will apply to towns and cities with a population of between 1,500 and 100,000.  Those towns to which this is applicable are Athlone, Bray, Carlow, Carrick-on-Shannon, Drogheda, Limerick, Portarlington and Waterford.  The urban area committee is to perform local area planning functions for the town or city and its contiguous areas as determined by the committee or, failing that, as ordered by the Minister.  Membership of the committee is to be equally drawn from both local authorities and is to consist of six councillors from the relevant local electoral areas, with three appointed by each local authority, plus the cathaoirleach of each of the local authorities.  It is also to include a minimum of two and a maximum of four non-voting members with relevant expertise in the areas of transport provision, infrastructure development, housing provision or business and trade.  Administrative support to the committee is to be provided by members of staff selected by the committee from nominations made by the two local authorities.  The main function of the committee will be the production of the local area plan for the cross-boundary urban area, including the appropriate zoning as an explicit function.  In the case of these areas, the development plan content for both local authorities will have to follow on from, and be consistent with, the local area plan that is made for the cross-boundary city or town and it will not be possible for either local authority to amend or revoke the local area plan approved by the committee.<\/p> <p> I also mentioned on 18 October that amendments relating to the placenames provisions of the local government code might also be brought forward if the urgency of progressing this Bill permitted.  I am proposing an amendment that repeals section 49 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 and restates the content of the repealed section in Irish and English.  Section 49 amended section 32(2) of the Official Languages Act 2003 for consistency with changes to Part 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 that were made under the previous section 48 of the 2011 Act.  It was, however, enacted in English only, whereas amendments to Acts enacted and enrolled in Irish are required to be bilingual.  It is proposed, therefore, to take the opportunity with this Bill to redo the 2011 provision in both languages, with a view to then commencing Part 18 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended.  This will facilitate the planned holding of a plebiscite by Sligo County Council on a proposal to change the placename of Inishcrone, or for some people, Enniscrone.<\/p> <p> I also bring to the attention of the House a further proposed amendment to the Bill, which is for the purpose of correcting errors in the title of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland in sections 2 and 13 of the Building Control Act 2007 that omitted the word \"the\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400042#PP00600","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543954500,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I will make some brief comments on the issues addressed by the Minister of State and the additional provisions that will go to committee in the proposed amendments.  These are different from the substance of the Bill that we discussed some weeks ago.  Any proposals which address the issue of rebalancing and enhancing powers for local government, in particular the elected members, or tackle challenging issues that have arisen in urban areas as a result of planning in recent years are to be welcomed.  Anything that moves beyond normal thinking must also be welcomed.  The Minister of State alluded to a number of challenging issues arising from urban sprawl across county boundaries.  Anything that can be done in that respect has to be welcomed, especially considering the &quot;Death of the Town&quot; headline that screamed from the front page of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>last Friday.  That provides an interesting backdrop to the deliberations on the remaining Stages of this Bill.  <\/p><p>Mr. Stephen Purcell, in his report for the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, concluded that a perfect storm was brewing in towns because of the impact of rents, commercial rates, out-of-town shopping retail centres, online shopping and, wait for it, the impact of the abolition of town councils.  The Minister of State will not agree with my view on the impact of that decision but, as the author of a detailed independent report commissioned by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland states, it impacted greatly on our towns.  Perhaps the Minister of State will reflect on that point, rather than slapping it down every time I mention it, because it certainly has merit, as Mr. Purcell noted.<\/p><p>The impact of online shopping featured prominently in that report and it has hit our main streets greatly.  This issue featured at a committee hearing in the House of Commons yesterday when the owner of Sports Direct, Mr. Mike Ashley, told Members of Parliament that the high streets in England, outside of the capital, are already dead.  There are major challenges that need to be tackled head on.  Anything we can do to promote urban spaces is to be welcomed.<\/p><p>On the composition of the proposed urban area committees, the non-voting members, who will not be elected members, will specialise in the areas of transport, housing, business and trade.  Imaginative thinking is to be welcomed if it brings a different discourse to what needs to happen.  There are challenges in the areas to which the Minister of State referred, including Athlone, Bray, Carlow and east Meath-Drogheda.  We need to ensure the living space of citizens in all counties is enhanced and they have access to good public transport, housing and urban spaces.  I hope that, as a result of these proposals, this will be an exciting time for local government and the discussions emanating from them will be positive.  <\/p><p>On the issue of directly elected mayors, I welcome the move as extremely positive for democracy in Ireland.  It will bring us into line with other democracies across the world, including countries in Europe and the United States.  Even the smallest local towns in the US have contests to elect a mayor and the office is not shared out by political parties as the spoils of war during the term of a council.  I hope the areas selected for the plebiscites, as outlined by the Minister of State, will be endorsed.  I also hope that the pilot project, when it is reviewed in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, will be considered for expansion to other major urban areas and that we can embrace this style of local government.<\/p><p>I look forward to the day when large urban towns, including my home town of Navan where I was privileged to be the mayor, Trim, Drogheda and Dundalk will also have directly elected mayors.  These should not be about someone having a title, wearing a gold chain or attending openings.  What is to be genuinely welcomed about the proposal is that the plebiscite will ask whether certain functions of the chief executives of the local authorities in question should be transferred to their cathaoirligh.  The Minister of State has spoken about this before.  He is passionate about the local government system and wants this debate to take place.  I hope change will be real and that it is embraced and endorsed and that there will be responsibility for local government.  I also hope that those who secure this responsibility recognise that they are answerable to the people in a real and meaningful way.  That will only be good for local governance.  The period ahead is an exciting one.  Its significance lies in the greater accountability it will deliver, with decisions being taken closer to the people.  That will be welcomed by citizens and I hope it is firmly endorsed.  When it comes to addressing these powers, I hope people understand that this will also increase their input into local government.<\/p><p>I welcome the amendments the Minister of State is bringing forward.  I look forward to the resultant discussions.  I hope the local government system will be further enhanced and strengthened.  The urban area committees will be very interesting for the counties impacted.  I hope those counties will recognise that this is an opportunity to address poor planning decisions.  They have not emanated from badness but naturally from the current system.  I hope we will be able to address some of the deficiencies present in larger urban areas and enhance living spaces for people through a diverse and different forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400043#QQ00200","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1543955100,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is sharing time with Deputy &Oacute; Broin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400044#RR00100","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1543955100,"counter":487,"content":"<p>In the context of rules and procedures, there is a certain irony in how the rules of this institution can work peculiarly.  Last week I was prevented from tabling an amendment to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2018 concerning the manner in which sexual assault trials were governed.  I will certainly be appealing against that decision.  In this instance, we practically have an entirely new Bill.  The Government has that ability, but it is a significant departure.  I appreciate that there is a timeline which has to be worked in terms of electoral registers.  I do not particularly want to see any delay in the Bill&rsquo;s progress because it has to be dealt with.  However, it is far from ideal that spokespersons on local government or Cork Members have to deal with 30 pages of amendments at such short notice.  I appreciate that the departmental officials have to do this.  However, for many of us, these are our local authorities.  The amendments concern the financial sustainability of our local authorities, with rules for development and local area plans.  We will have less than 48 hours in which to digest all of the amendments and then decide on positions on Committee Stage.  That is far from an ideal way of legislating and it puts us in a difficult position.  If we are to have directly elected mayors, they need to have real powers.  What is more, power does not need to be taken from councillors but from local authority chief executives.  My priority is to ensure both Cork local authorities are financially sustainable and have a clear manner of progressing.  I am not sure that the issue of city and county sheriffs has been properly addressed.  Their responsibilities are important in terms of the register.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill was published originally in August.  Both Cork local authorities prepared detailed submissions which they sent to Cork Deputies, the Minister of State and the Department.  They will not have an opportunity to respond to these significant amendments, not only on the plebiscites to be held and the urban area committees but also on the transition.  With some of the amendments I will agree, but with some I will not.  Ideally, they should have been dealt with in the Bill when it was published in August.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400044#RR00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1543955100,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening remarks.  Those of us on the housing committee take our legislative responsibilities seriously.  As the Minister of State knows, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the holding of plebiscites.  I acknowledge the fact that on Second Stage the Minister of State indicated that he would bring forward these proposals.  The problem is that we have been given five pages of amendments which essentially are a new Bill 48 hours before the committee will have a chance to discuss and vote on them.  That means that we have had no Second Stage debate on the substance of what is separate legislation.  Neither have we engaged in any pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p><p>Before we received the amendments, in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>yesterday Daniel McConnell had a story based on a leaked memo from the Cabinet in which the Attorney General expressed serious concern about them, allegedly on the grounds that it was not clear what the decision-making powers of the new mayors would be or what their relationship with existing councillors would be.  The same Cabinet memo highlights criticisms from the Minister for Finance who stated there were no costings associated with the amendments.  That is not intended as a criticism of the officials, but when Ministers put pressure on officials to produce complex legislation within short timelines, unfortunately, mistakes are made, as we have seen happen in the case of other legislation recently.  I am concerned that we are not being given sufficient time, particularly those of us who are new Members, to deal with these technical amendments.<\/p><p>I was previously a member of the Dublin elected mayors forum when the four Dublin local authorities examined the issue of a directly elected mayor for Dublin.  Some of the key issues centred on the powers and structures such a mayor would have, as well as costs.  Would powers be lost from local authorities as they devolved upwards?  Would powers be given to local government as they were devolved downwards from Government agencies?  From what I understand in talking to the Minister of State before today, there will be more legislation.  In some senses, we will be asked to take some important decisions at the committee tomorrow without having full information.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, we do not want to delay the substantive legislation tomorrow.  Members of the housing committee, whose job it is to scrutinise the Bill, will need a detailed briefing from departmental officials in advance of the committee session tomorrow which will allow us to tease it out.  It could be done in half an hour or 45 minutes and would allow us to go through all of the issues properly and would at least give us the benefit on Committee Stage of being able to debate and take decisions on them.  If the Minister of State gives us a commitment that we will at least have that additional preparation, we will certainly not stand in the way of the motion.<\/p><p>This is not to be partisan about the issues.  While we can have our political and policy arguments, it is our job at the committee to ensure the legislation will be right.  We take our scrutinising responsibilities seriously.  Producing substantial legislation at such short notice is not good practice.  I hope that when the Minister of State comes back next year with the next local government Bill and the substantive issues surrounding the powers of directly elected mayors, the costs and the relationship they will have with existing local authorities, we will not be in a similar position where, to meet a tight deadline, detailed amendments will be dropped in on Committee and Report Stages.  If the Minister of State is willing to give us that commitment, that we will receive a detailed briefing at some point tomorrow afternoon, we will certainly not stand in the way of the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400044#RR00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1543955100,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I have serious concerns about what is before us.  As has been said, effectively we have two large sections of amendments to the Bill that have nothing to do with its main substance.  Essentially, it is about the extension of the boundaries of Cork city and local authority arrangements for Galway.  Up to 128 amendments have been proposed, some of which are more detailed about the arrangements for Cork and the areas that will become part of the city which up to now have been part of the county.  That is fair enough.  However, in themselves they are quite detailed.  I would certainly like to have the opportunity to discuss them with my Cork colleagues before expressing a view on them.  I have the added difficulty that the Labour Party does not have any Member on the housing committee, meaning that we will not have an opportunity to vote on the amendments.  While we can attend, we cannot vote.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the amendments were brought forward because we needed more detail.  On Second Stage we all said we wanted to know more about the arrangements for the particular areas in Cork, but I am concerned about the other amendments.  I support the holding of a plebiscite on directly elected mayors.  I also support the concept of directly elected mayors.  In the limited time we have had to read what is before us, I thought I would get some idea from amendments Nos. 105 and 106 of the powers and functions directly elected mayors would have, as well as of their relationship with the chief executives of the local authorities.<\/p><p>However, the regulations only concern how to hold the plebiscite, including people's right to vote and the normal arrangements that are put in place for any election.  As far as I can see, nothing tells us exactly what the powers will be.  Surely that is crucial.  In my understanding, the whole point of having a directly elected mayor is to reorganise the relative powers between the executive and the elected members, but all I can see is amendment No. 109, which reads:<\/p><blockquote>The Minister shall, in respect of each administrative area in respect of which a plebiscite is held in accordance with this Part and not later than 2 years from the day appointed under <i>subsection (2) <\/i>of <i>section 33<\/i>, prepare and submit to both Houses of the Oireachtas either--(a) a report specifying proposals for the enactment of a law providing for a directly elected mayor for such administrative area, or<br \/><br \/>(b) a report specifying the reasons for his or her not preparing and submitting a report under <i>paragraph (a)<\/i>.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>I assume the latter provision is because, since we cannot predict the result of a plebiscite, a mayor may not necessarily be appointed.  It seems that the Minister will make all of the decisions.  There is to be consultation and so on, but I am not sure that we will be doing our job as Members of the House if we just let this pass through without any understanding of what the mayor's powers or role will be.<br\/><br\/>The process is even more complicated in counties, albeit not so much in Cork, which will just entail the city.  In Limerick, Waterford and Galway, the people who will be taking part in a plebiscite will be from the administrative areas of the council of the city and county of Limerick, the council of the city and county of Waterford and, because those authorities have not been brought together yet, the council of the city of Galway and the council of the county of Galway.  There will be just one directly elected mayor for large county areas and cities in those counties.  That raises issues.  I expressed my concern on Second Stage that there could be a mayor from, for example, the back end of the county in Limerick representing the city.  I have nothing against the back end of the county, but mayors from other places normally represent large municipal areas, which will not be the case in this context.  As such, we have every right to have concerns about the powers and role of the directly elected mayor.<br\/><br\/>The next part relates to places where urban areas extend into other counties.  Limerick is included in this.  Obviously, I know more about Limerick than I do about the other areas.  I would like to know more about how this will work.  In Limerick, for example, there are two housing estates very close to where I live, but they are just over the other side of the river in County Clare.  I assume that that area is the main part that will be transferred to Limerick.  However, they are in County Clare currently and have been part of local area plans that are linked to Clare villages close by.  This was an issue at the time of the original proposals to extend the boundary, which were strongly resisted by people in County Clare but supported by some of those living in the housing estates immediately adjacent to the city because they had mostly come from the city.  The interaction between such areas and the parts of the counties that are adjacent to them pose difficult questions.  Many issues need to be teased out in this regard.<br\/><br\/>While I have many concerns about the Bill, the one matter I do not have a problem with is amending the error in the title of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, but that is hardly the most significant element of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire stated, I am not sure how appropriate it is that we should be sending to Committee Stage a Bill that substantially differs from the Bill that we debated on Second Stage and to which we had given some thought.  We now have little time to give to the two sections that have been attached to it.  There has been much debate in recent years about the issue of directly elected mayors and much support for it.  Ironically, a great deal of that support has been in the Dublin area, which is not included in this legislation and has been postponed to a later date.  Given that there is a question of democratic representation at local level anyway, this significant issue deserves much more scrutiny than it will get on Committee Stage tomorrow if we use this mismatched approach to deal with what is almost a new Bill.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State has been asked to give a briefing, which I hope will extend beyond the members of the committee to anyone who wants to attend.  I would have preferred more time.  Does it have to go to the committee tomorrow?  Can we not take longer?  We have very little time to examine it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400044#RR00400","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543955700,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I join in the criticism of Deputies being asked to make so many decisions on so much in such little time.  Obviously, the clock is ticking on getting this business done.  The problem rests with the slow pace in getting matters to this point.<\/p>  <p>  I am not going to comment on the issue of directly elected mayors now as I will make my comments at some other time.  In the time available to me before the next debate commences, I will focus on issues relating to the boundary changes in Cork and the staffing levels in the two local authorities that are to be newly constituted there.  My understanding is that negotiations are taking place between the city and the county, with a focus on determining how many whole-time equivalent positions serve the transition areas and transferring that number over.  The negotiations were to have been completed by now, but I understand that there may be white smoke halfway through the first quarter of the new year.  I am concerned that the original deadlines have not been met.  The time for concluding the negotiations and then seeking expressions of interest in February will not make matters impossible, but it will be tight, given that the new arrangements will come into place at the end of May or beginning of June.  I will be watching the new deadlines like a hawk.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise a number of points about the fire service, including the Cork city fire service.  Its staffing level stands at 140, with operational firefighter numbers the same today as they were in 1975.  The Minister of State has raised his eyebrow, but that information comes from a reliable source.  International best practice calls for 1.031 firefighters per 1,000 people.  Under a section 85 agreement dating to 1999, the city fire service has duties and responsibilities that extend into the county, including the transition areas that are being transferred into the city, but they are the responsibilities of a backup service for the county fire service, which has lead responsibility in those areas.  It is not good enough to say that the Cork city fire service has responsibility for those transition areas in any case, given that there will be an increase in the level of responsibility from backup service to lead service.<\/p><p>If the numbers were to remain at 140 with the extra population coming into the city as a result of the transfer, the number of firefighters per 1,000 of the population would fall to 0:66, which is a bit higher than Poland and a bit lower than Slovakia.  It is too low and is unacceptable.  I am not in favour of boosting the city's numbers at the expense of the county and leaving fire services in the county short.  What should be looked at here is an increase in the number of firefighters for services that are already depleted by austerity and that have been stretched in recent years.  I want to register that a dip in the numbers in the city fire service to a ratio somewhere between that of Poland and that of Slovakia is not acceptable.  I do not think it would be acceptable to firefighters or the people in the area.  I stress that I am not in favour of strengthening one at the expense of the other.  Recruitment is something that needs to be looked at.  I was going to make some points about the electoral register and directly elected mayors but time is ticking and we have another important debate tonight so I will save those points for another day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400045#SS00200","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543956300,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I am perplexed by the rush to introduce this in this manner.  Concerns have been expressed by various Deputies.  I will not repeat them.  I agree with them.  My interest in this Bill concerns the proposal to amalgamate Galway city and county, which takes up three or four lines in the Bill.  The rest of it concerns Cork.  On top of that, and I will return to that point, we are now being asked to look at an entirely new Bill in this manner.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that a briefing should be given but it should be given to all of us.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies and I met with the Minister of State and his officials.  I was horrified by the lack of understanding of Galway city and county and the fact that the proposal to amalgamate them was based simply on the logic that bigger is better.  It completely ignored the interim report.  It took the one recommendation that they should be merged and ignored what was set out - the conditions precedent, which said that staffing and resources had to be looked at prior to any merger.  In the Minister of State's speech, we were told about directly elected mayors, about which I will keep an open mind.  It involves Limerick and Galway city and county.  It is in anticipation of the merger of the two local authorities.  I have tabled an amendment.  I understand Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, Grealish and Fitzpatrick have tabled amendments to remove the proposed merger between the city and county.  Is the Minister of State going to ignore that and just go right ahead?  Is that what democracy means?  Is the Minister of State going to listen to us?  I am a committed Galwegian.  I love my city and want it to grow and develop but I fundamentally object to the notion that bigger is better when it is not based on any evidence.  The Minister of State may recall the packed meeting in the audiovisual room only two weeks ago involving a presentation where we were to make our decisions based on evidence.  Evidence has gone out the window with regard to this and we have nebulous concepts like bigger is better when we know that is not true.  I have already mentioned the Lisbon Treaty, which contains a commitment to making decisions closer to the people on the ground and not removing them.  Yet we are going ahead with this.  We started off with a Bill where the Cork boundary was to be extended, which is a matter for the Cork people to look at.  Galway was stuck in with two or three lines telling us that bigger is better and that we were going to take the first step, ignoring the interim report and the vast majority of elected Members on the ground.  We come in tonight and get the Minister of State's speech and the amendments, which I have not had a chance to go through in detail.  The Minister of State is asking us to do this and for what?<\/p>  <p>  I will speak about Galway.  One major problem is the excessive power in the hands of management - unelected people.  The second major problem is the lack of oversight by the Department regarding the lack of a master plan in Galway.  We have higgledy-piggledy developer-led development, no master plan and no oversight by the Department.  The former Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, agreed with me when I stated during Leaders' Questions that Galway has returned to developer-led development.  The site at Ceannt Station is over 14 acres, eight of which are being developed by a person on behalf of Ceannt Station completely in isolation from the public lands in the docks and the other public lands in Galway.  The Government seems to think this is okay.  I ask myself why I talk about this and go into the minutiae of it when the major problems in Galway are lack of democracy; the fact that when decisions are made by local councillors, they are ignored; a major housing crisis; and a major traffic problem.  All of these problems have solutions.  We have proposed solutions.  I do not come in here and object for the sake of objecting.  I come in here with solutions relating to Galway.  A total of 22,000 people signed a petition.  I am actually underestimating the number.  I collected the signatures with a committed number of people on the ground, most of whom are non-political, that said we should not put in another road and we should look at public transport, including light rail, particularly in the context of Galway, which has an opportunity to be a thriving but green city.  What do we get?  We get ignored and told that it is not possible.<\/p>  <p>  Park and ride has never been implemented.  We put it in our city development plan in 2005 and it has never been rolled out while traffic congestion builds up.  Until this year, we had not built a single local authority house since 2009.  These are the real problems on the ground.  I will not go into the hospitals issue; it is for another day.  Yet the Minister of State has us looking at a Bill that has metamorphosed into a completely different Bill and is asking us to approve it and push forward to committee level as quickly as possible.  This is not democracy.  This is a diversion from the real problems on the ground but, most importantly, it is an undermining of democracy at local level that will put more and more power into the hands of unelected officials in the guise of directly elected mayors.  I am particularly upset when something is done under false pretences.  We are talking about directly elected mayors but there is no mention of the powers they might have or how they might interact with the system on the ground.  I have the greatest of concerns about these proposals and I do not think this is the way to proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018120400046#TT00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1543956300,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I agree with the previous speaker.  There is not one shred of democracy in this Bill.  The proposed boundary changes will have a detrimental effect on the county of Cork.  The loss of revenue from areas such as Glanmire, Blarney and Ballincollig will result in a significant drain of revenue from the county in the long term.  I represent rural areas in west Cork, some of which are the most disadvantaged in the country.  We cannot afford any loss of revenue in the long term.  The proposed transfer of a large area from Cork County Council to Cork City Council is a land grab that will have a significant detrimental effect on Cork County Council.  I believe the Blarney Tower and adjacent hinterlands should remain within the Cork County Council area and not be transferred to the city.  This would result in a population of 6,357 people remaining within the county.  One only has to look at the quality of our roads, particularly in west Cork.
