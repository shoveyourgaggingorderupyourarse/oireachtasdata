This was distributed across five diverse expenditure programmes of varying size.  The largest expenditure programme related to energy, accounting for &euro;204 million, or 48%, of the total spent in 2020.  A total of &euro;127 million was expended on energy efficiency programmes promoted by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, a decrease of 16% when compared with the expenditure outturn in 2019.  The 2020 energy programme also includes expenditure of &euro;50 million for the purchase of statistical transfers from other EU member states as a result of a shortfall in the achievement of Ireland's 2020 obligations under the renewable energy directive.  Provision has been made in the 2021 Estimate for further statistical transfer purchases.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure on the communications programme in 2020 was just under &euro;89 million, which was significantly less than the amount provided for the year of almost &euro;158 million.  Expenditure on the information and communications technology programme, at &euro;53 million, was only around half the level provided for, due to delayed deployment of the national broadband plan, NBP, network.  Given the scale of the plan, it would be useful for the Department to consider giving it its own subhead in the future.<\/p> <p>  The Department spent more than &euro;81 million of voted funds on the environment and waste management programme in 2020.  More than half of the voted expenditure went to support the operations of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  In addition to the voted expenditure, the Department spent just under &euro;17 million on environmental projects and initiatives from the separate environment fund in 2020.  The Department spent almost &euro;33 million under the inland fisheries programme and just over &euro;21 million on a range of services covered by the natural resources programme.<\/p> <p>  Receipts that could be used by the Department to support its voted expenditure amounted to &euro;13 million in 2020.  The surplus remaining unspent at year end was just over &euro;101 million.  With the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department was able to carry over &euro;38 million in unspent capital funding to 2021.  The balance of &euro;63 million was surrendered to the Exchequer.  In addition, the Department transferred directly to the Exchequer &euro;123 million it received in regard to the operations of the EU emissions trading system, as disclosed in note 4.3.<\/p> <p>  Members may wish to note that the Department was responsible for the oversight of a broad range of public sector bodies, including regulators and a number of major commercial State bodies that do not receive ongoing grant funding.  The bodies are listed in an appendix to the appropriation account.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 9 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2019 reports on the findings of an examination of the costs associated with landfill remediation.  Landfill is no longer used as a general strategy for waste disposal and, at the end of 2019, just three landfill sites continued in operation.  However, historical sites continue to pose environmental risks and may require monitoring and expensive remediation.  Costs incurred by the Vote associated with landfill remediation amounted to &euro;12 million in 2020.<\/p> <p>  As at July 2020, a total of 611 landfill sites had been identified in the State.  They comprise 117 sites licensed and regulated by the EPA since March 1997 and 494 unregulated landfill sites recorded on a national register.  More than 70% of the unregulated sites are pre-1997 local authority-operated landfills, approximately 21% are privately operated sites and just over 8% are identified illegal landfill sites.<\/p> <p>  The EPA monitors environmental risk factors on an ongoing basis at the 117 landfill sites it regulates.  The agency does not monitor environmental risk factors at the unregulated landfills but has a role in authorising proposed plans for their remediation.  At the time the report was being completed, 152 sites operated by local authorities pre-March 1997 had been assessed as being of either moderate or high risk for the environment.  Remediation plans to address the environmental risks identified had been submitted to the EPA in respect of 19% of those sites, and certificates of authorisation to commence remediation had been issued in respect of only 11, or 7% of the total.<\/p> <p>  By the end of 2019, the Department had provided more than &euro;158 million under a grant scheme for assisting remediation of 122 landfill sites.  This included &euro;52 million contributed from the Vote for the remediation of a site at Haulbowline Island in Cork Harbour.  An additional &euro;25 million was spent on this project under the marine Vote.  The Department had spent &euro;33.5 million on the remediation of two large landfill sites, at Kerdiffstown in Kildare and Kilconnell in Galway, and further significant expenditure was anticipated.  Both of those landfill sites were formerly privately operated under EPA licences but are now being managed by the respective local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Financial provision arrangements as part of EPA licensing of private operators are intended to ensure there will be sufficient resources available, without recourse to public funds, to pay for restoration and aftercare costs when landfill sites close, or when pollution incidents occur during operation.<\/p><p>Financial provision arrangements as part of EPA licensing of private operators are intended to ensure that there will be sufficient resources available, without recourse to public funds, to pay for restoration and aftercare costs when landfill sites close or when pollution incidents occur during operation.  Kilconnell landfill is an example of where the financial provision arrangement in place failed to provide the funds required to meet closure and aftercare costs.  Instead, the Department has had to fund substantial costs associated with the closure, remediation and ongoing monitoring of the site.<\/p><p> The report includes recommendations for the Department to review the governance and oversight arrangements for landfill sites, ensure the completion of outstanding risk assessments for all sites and develop medium-term estimates of the future costs associated with landfill remediation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#A00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

As the committee will be aware, the Department in its current form was established following the reconfiguration of a number of Departments by Government in June 2020, and a transfer of functions order was made in September 2020 formally assigning the broadcasting and media functions to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. The 2020 income and expenditure relating to those functions are included in the appropriation account for that Department in Vote 33.<\/p> <p>  Total gross expenditure under the Vote in 2020 amounted to &euro;428 million, some 21% or &euro;113 million below the budgetary allocation of &euro;541 million, which included capital carryover.  The Covid-19 pandemic impacted expenditure across all programme areas of the Department in 2020, and, in particular, the communications and energy programmes, which had savings of &euro;69 million and &euro;14 million, respectively.  The impact of the pandemic is also reflected in reduced output and spend across these programmes in 2021.<\/p> <p>  The Department and its agencies played an important role throughout the pandemic by ensuring the continuity of critical infrastructure and by putting in place measures to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on businesses and individuals.  Staff in the Department continued to deliver on major business priorities during 2020, some of which are set out in the briefing note provided to the committee, with a more comprehensive list of activity and outputs contained in the Department&rsquo;s annual report for 2020, which has been published.<\/p> <p>  Our agencies also played a key role in supporting businesses and citizens.  An Post, for example, kept its network of more than 900 post offices open, fulfilling an important commercial and social role to communities.  ComReg worked closely with telecommunications operators to ensure that the necessary measures and plans were put in place by networks to manage and handle the surge in voice and data traffic with offices, schools and third-level institutions shut and those activities taking place in the home.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, put temporary measures in place to strengthen the protections in place for energy consumers.<\/p> <p>  The Department secured additional funding in 2020 for the trading online voucher scheme as part of the Government&rsquo;s Covid-19 business supports package for small businesses.  This was to meet the increased demand from businesses that found themselves unable to trade physically and had to move their businesses online.  In 2020, &euro;21 million was spent on the scheme, of which &euro;18.5 million can be directly attributed as Covid-19-related spend.  Approximately 13,000 vouchers, which is ten times the number approved in 2019, were awarded and more than 28,000 small businesses benefitted from the training, advice and support provided by local enterprise offices, LEO, as part of the scheme.  Usage of eircode postcodes, which had been trending significantly upwards in recent years, jumped significantly in 2020 to almost 28 million look-ups compared to 19 million in 2019.  A significant part of this increase is a result of the shift to online shopping last year.  We have seen a further significant increase of 24% over the first eight months of 2021.<\/p> <p>  The year 2020, which was the first year of the national broadband plan, NBP, contract, saw a significant level of mobilisation activity by National Broadband Ireland, NBI, including recruitment of personnel, procurement of materials and contractors, installation of equipment in exchanges, building IT systems to support the network and undertaking surveys and designs, which were progressed right across the country to inform the build programme, resulting in the first homes being connected to the new fibre network in January of this year in County Cork.<\/p> <p>  The roll-out of the NBP has, however, been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  While telecommunications activity was deemed essential work under Covid-19, activities relating to network build generally involve multiple-person crews.  The onset of significant Covid-19 case numbers and the implications for close contacts severely impacted NBI&rsquo;s ability to have crews operating during certain periods in 2020 and 2021.<\/p> <p>  The Department has worked closely with NBI to put a remedial plan in place to address delays experienced to the NBP roll-out.  Under this plan, NBI is implementing a number of measures to help lessen the impact, including increasing the level of throughput in the eir make-ready programme and bringing additional resources into NBI and its subcontractors.<\/p> <p>  As of 1 October this year, more than 257,000 premises have been surveyed and build works involving more than 108,000 premises are ongoing across the country.  There are now more than 250 staff employed directly by NBI, along with more than 850 contractors throughout the country working on the network design and roll-out.  In addition, 379 broadband connection points have been installed by NBI, including 141 primary schools.  By the end of this year, NBI has forecast that almost 60,000 homes will have been passed and will be able to connect to the network.<\/p> <p>  Works under the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, energy schemes were also impacted by Covid-19 restrictions, particularly between March and June 2020, when activity paused in line with public health and Government guidelines.  Almost &euro;79 million was spent on energy efficiency measures through grants to more than 17,600 homes, 39 community-based projects and 1,615 households at risk of energy poverty.  The first auctions under the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, took place in July 2020 and 68 new renewable energy projects, equating to almost 1,100 MW of new electricity generation, received letters of offer.  The Department opened a call for applications to the just transition fund in June 2020 and provisional funding offers were announced in November last year.  While spend in 2020 was low, funding of &euro;30 million has been allocated to more than 60 projects throughout the region in the private sector, local authorities and communities.<\/p> <p>  Some &euro;48 million was provided to the EPA and &euro;23 million to local authorities for waste management programmes, including &euro;10 million provided through the environment fund.  A Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy was launched in September 2020 as Ireland&rsquo;s new roadmap for waste planning and management.  The plan shifts focus away from waste disposal and looks instead at how we can preserve resources by creating a circular economy.<\/p> <p>  A sum of &euro;12 million was provided in 2020 for landfill remediation.  As set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s chapter, the landfill remediation programme was set up in 2006 to address the findings of the 2005 European Court of Justice, ECJ, judgment against Ireland.  Fifteen years on from that judgment, we are now in a very different context in terms of our waste management performance.<\/p> <p>  The ECJ case itself was closed in 2015 as Ireland was considered to have made sufficient progress in implementing a programme of measures agreed with the European Commission.  There are now just three active landfills in Ireland that accept municipal waste, down from 126 at the time the proceedings were first brought by the Commission.  Our recycling rate was less than 5% in 1998 but now stands at approximately 40%, and 92% of municipal waste was sent to landfill  whereas only 14% was landfilled in 2018.  Having been found to be breach of our core obligations under the waste framework directive, we are now meeting or are on course to meet all of our EU objectives in this area.<\/p> <p>  Since the 2019 Comptroller and Auditor General chapter, important structural and administrative changes have been applied to the management and governance of the landfill remediation programme and these will deliver results in a more streamlined and accountable manner in the coming years.  In 2020, for the first time, expenditure under the scheme exceeded the budget allocated. The Comptroller and Auditor General made three recommendations in his report and implementing measures to address the recommendations are being incorporated into the management of the programme.<\/p> <p>  I look forward to assisting the committee members with any questions they may have today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Griffin.

What the Deputy has described is the evolution of cyberpolicy.  It is an evolution.  We are moving through phases where we are seeing significant activity in this sector.  We will take whatever measures are required to ensure that the State, the operators of State infrastructure, private citizens and private businesses are protected to the greatest extent possible in dealing with the issues that we have to contend with, not just in light of the HSE attack but in light of broader issues more generally in cyberspace, such as the types of threats that are emerging.<\/p> <p>  To revert to the Deputy&rsquo;s previous question, in 2020 a particular vulnerability arose during the massive shift from office-based and business-based work to the home.  A significant degree of disruption was caused to how businesses functioned.  We saw a rapid, significant increase in cyber-incidents right across the State.

We have moved from 126 landfills to 43, have remediated 46 sites and have spent &euro;170 million on that activity.  As rightly pointed out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the chapter presented this morning, there is a great deal more work to be done.  Looking at where we were when the Comptroller and Auditor General issued his report, which I think was September 2020, 21 final certificates of authorisation have issued from the Environmental Protection Agency, which is a further eight, four draft certificates of authorisation decisions are due in 2021, 24 certificates of authorisation applications are pending final decision and a further 20 are expected to be submitted in the coming months.  Progress is being made, but there is a great deal of work to do to address that outstanding issue.  The other important bit is the work identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General as needing to be done, including risk assessments to be undertaken and certificates of authorisation to be prepared by the EPA.  We have put in place a procurement framework, valued at &euro;7 million over a three to four-year period.  This will allow local authorities to draw down from the framework and to point to the sites in their areas in respect of which, based on the section 22 register, they have concerns.  They can then do the risk assessment, identify the nature of the risk as being low, medium or high and identify the nature of the works, if any, to remediate so that we can constantly over the next few years move through the process, park the ones that do not represent a risk and focus the resources of the State on remediation of the balance of those that are still causing a problem from an environmental perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#E01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#E02000","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Verona Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#E02100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Good morning everybody.

The design of the network means ensuring all the equipment is in place, as well as the requisite design of the pole and duct network.

When we are satisfied on an independent level that the design is fit for purpose, that situation is then also certified by an independent certifier who is qualified in that business.

Every month that NBI is delayed in meeting its targets will mean less revenue coming into the business and that will result in its profits being lower.  In addition, the working capital requirements of the company are more severe and they need to reach those requirements.  NBI will therefore face significant business implications if there are delays with this build, as well as the contractual implications.  The other key performance indicator that we have for NBI measures network performance.  It includes any outages, on a BCP, for example.

On 15 September there were 23,000, according to the CEO of National Broadband Ireland.  There are now 27,000.  We have clarified this today.  The target is 60,000 so there are 33,000 premises to be connected, or to be passed, between now and the end of the year.  This would seem to be ambitious.  I hope it happens.  Similar to the previous speaker, I desperately want to see the broadband plan rolled out.  Laois and Offaly are crying out for it.  Many commuters go up and down the M7 every day who could be working from home.  They need to be working from home for a number of reasons, such as to get away from long commutes and to decrease their carbon emissions.<\/p> <p>  At present, 60,000 is the target.  It looks like we will come in at roughly half of what the original target was.  There was a period of time that the company could not work because of Covid.  I contest this because telecommunications was one of the areas that was exempt.  The real reason was that many of the operatives and subcontractors involved were from another country.

Several years ago, the former Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, told me on the floor of the D&aacute;il when replying to a question on this that stringent penalties would be imposed.  What I am hearing this morning is that if NBI does not get to the 60,000 it will not get paid.  The point is that it can move at its own pace if there is no other penalty.  I was given to believe, and the greater world out there believes, that there were going to be stringent penalties.  There is huge concern about this not just among Members of the Oireachtas but in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It outlined clearly what its concerns are.  I want to clarify this with a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer.  Apart from not being paid for work not done, in other words if it does not get 60,000 done it will not get paid for the full 60,000, is there another financial penalty?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#N01800","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634200200,"counter":279,"content":"<p>It is not a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer but it will be a brief answer.  There are three stages when we look at this.  It will get paid for what it has built.  The impact, as Mr. Mulligan described earlier, is that work continues and it has to fund additional working capital.  It also loses out on revenues to the company.  I do not want to call this a penalty but it is a consequence and it is a significant consequence for the company.  The second point Mr. Mulligan mentioned is that there are delay payments.  These delay payments are applicable from the first day of the third contract year and will be applied where there is a delay in achieving build-related milestones.<\/p> <p>  Looking back at the transcript, a Deputy used the analogy of a concessionaire running a road and getting hit with penalties for closing down one of the lanes.  These are the types of penalties that arise when connecting and passing.  These are real penalties.  There are 17 key performance indicators.  These include the time required to connect premises, minimum upload and download speeds, the number of faults, the time taken to repair them, price and service availability.  There is a suite of penalties and consequences across the lifetime of the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#N01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":280,"content":"<p>The only penalty financially is that the company does not get paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#N02000","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634200200,"counter":281,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#N02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":282,"content":"<p>If a carpenter doing work in a house starts and does a bit of it and then goes away and comes back, and keeps coming and going over a period of time so that two weeks' work takes the better part of a year, that carpenter will not get paid until the job is finished.

He and I discussed this matter a couple of years ago, along with Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, on 3 April 2019, issued observations and memos for the Minister's attention.  I have copies in front of me.  The Department set out its concerns.  The document I have to hand, from Mr. Robert Watt and Mr. Brendan Ellison, is one with which Mr. Mulligan will be familiar.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe strongly recommend against approval of the appointment of the preferred bidder to the current NBP procurement process on the grounds of: cost and affordability, impact on the National Development Plan and on projects forgone as a result, value for money and specifically uncertain benefits, unprecedented risk for the Exchequer and compatibility with [the spatial strategy] Project Ireland 2040. <\/blockquote> <p>It also states the Department believed significant progress could be made with an alternative approach.  Basically, it was saying other providers were already in the field in a lot of the relevant localities.  I am familiar with some of them in Laois&ndash;Offaly.  They were out there providing wireless broadband before the Department was.  The two officials mentioned the cost and set out a chart on it.  The document stated, &quot;This is a more prudent approach to a long-term investment of this nature compared with committing to a 25 year contract which, by its nature, does not have the same flexibilities.&quot;  They set out what this entailed.  Basically, it was providing a spine.<\/p><p>The document states, &quot;In terms of value for money, we have major concerns in relation to the credibility of the [cost-benefit analysis] for the National Broadband Plan&quot;.  At the time, a sum of up to &euro;3 billion was being mentioned.  The document also states, &quot;Furthermore, under this proposal the State will not own the asset, despite investing up to &euro;3 billion in it (as compared with a private sector equity investment risk of only [the wording here is blacked out]&quot;.  It goes on to state, &quot;The lack of a competitive process in arriving at the final bid is also a real concern for the Department&quot;.  It outlines the risks to the Exchequer: &quot;[W]e believe that the State is being asked to take on unprecedented risk associated with this project&quot;.  It claims the State was being asked to commit nearly &euro;3 billion, which was to provide returns to the private operator and owner of the asset, while the latter was risking only a given amount of equity.  This amount is blacked out in the document.  At the time, the amount was reckoned to be around &euro;250 million.  The document states the private operator, for the given amount of equity, &quot;will own the entire asset while accepting the State has mechanism to safeguard&quot;.  The document also sets out what its authors believe was an alternative approach and, towards the end, questions why the likes of the ESB were not already being used more.  Could Mr. Cleary state whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform still stands over that memo of 3 April 2019?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#O00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634200200,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I am happy to respond to that.

Does Mr. Griffin not feel that where there are difficult or contentious decisions, the Department and taxpayer are outnumbered?  Mr. Griffin knows how it works at a board meeting.

Some &euro;21 million was spent in 2020 and 13,000 vouchers were awarded.  I highlighted that figure because that scheme, and how quickly it was administered by the Department, was appreciated by so many businesses, as I am sure Mr. Griffin will appreciate.  In addition, the work of the local enterprise offices in my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, the phenomenal roll-out of that programme and how well it was received by businesses, should not go unnoticed here today because it was invaluable to many businesses to get them online.<\/p> <p>  I will return to the landfill issue.  We spoke about it previously but did not have enough time.  I asked about the &euro;6.1 million allocated to the environmental fund to local authorities to support waste enforcement services anti-dumping initiatives.  How is that being monitored by the Department?  I can only imagine when the Department divested the landfill issue to each local authority it was probably a little weight off the shoulders but, ultimately, that needs to be monitored to ensure the fund is being utilised correctly and we are seeing value for money on that aspect.

I am none the wiser.  Serious concerns have been raised by many Members in recent times about the oversight of universities and other educational institutions.  It ranges from academic attendance to partnerships with private companies that act against the public interest.  These institutions have a huge influence on society, and they are publicly funded.  We must ensure there is no negative influence in State-funded education.  Educational institutions also receive huge amounts of money from the Exchequer.  The sum of &euro;3.3 billion was received last year.<\/p> <p>  The partnership between UCD and Tullow Oil is particularly concerning.  Tullow Oil paid UCD &euro;2 million to put on short courses for regulators in some African and South American countries.  These courses have the stated focus of professional development of academics and technical professionals.  We are effectively using the brand of UCD to do that work for Tullow Oil and it is a State-funded brand.  The course, as it is described, has all sorts of intersections with regulatory bodies and State-related entities.  I have serious concerns over a potential conflict of interest.  How much influence did Tullow Oil have on the course content?  What is the curriculum and who wrote it?  I do not think it is appropriate for companies to use the good name of a public State-funded university to influence regulators.  That is different from particular companies having interaction with universities.  This is a completely funded course.  I suggest that we need to have a meeting with UCD and perhaps the HEA.  There are similar courses in TCD for example.  This is simply not acceptable.  There is no extra information given.

We need to invite the HEA to a meeting because, although we are discussing an individual institution, this could be happening at a number of institutions around the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#Z01600","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I take the Chair's point about Tullow Oil and there are a number of examples of partnerships between UCD and the companies that are involved in the Irish Centre for Research in Applied Geophysics, iCRAG.

As the Committee on Public Accounts, it is public funding that we must examine, but if a company is funding a course that is directly involved in an area that the company has an interest in and that is its main line of business, which is energy or oil in this case, we should examine it in detail.

No. 813C is dated 30 September and is a request to the committee from mise as our Chair to consider making inquiries with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners regarding the recent tax settlement with a company called Perrigo, which concerned the tax treatment of income arising from the sale of intellectual property.  It has been reported that the settlement was agreed at &euro;297 million.  Revenue's original tax bill for Perrigo was &euro;1.64 billion, which I understand was the largest tax bill ever issued by Revenue.  The settlement represents a reduction of over &euro;1.3 billion.  To assist the committee in understanding the settlement, I propose that we write to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to request a detailed note setting out the rationale for the settlement, how it was arrived at and how Revenue was satisfied to settle for &euro;1.3 billion less than its initial assessment.  While we understand that, for various reasons, Revenue might not be able to get 100% of a tax bill, this was a major write-off.  Why did it settle for that?  I also suggest that we write to the Tax Appeals Commission for its take on the matter, as it may have had a role in this.<\/p> <p>  To go from &euro;1.64 billion to &euro;297 million represents an 84% write-off for Perrigo.  How did that come about?  It was originally the largest tax bill in the State's history.  The State is under the spotlight in terms of our corporation tax rates and collection rate.  While progress is being made in that regard and, regardless of the fact that many of us do not like it, we will now be tied to a rate of 15% under the OECD's proposal, the question over what we are collecting is the greater issue.  To go from &euro;1.64 billion to less than &euro;300 million is a major reduction by any standard.  Many PAYE workers would love to have such a reduction.  Does any member wish to comment on this matter or propose an action?  I suggest that we write to Revenue and the Tax Appeals Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#AA00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I would be happy with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#AA00600","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>We will write to them.<\/p> <p>  We will move on to our work programme.

The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications appeared before us at today's meeting.  During that, there was a discussion with the programme manager of the national broadband plan.  His broadband actually dropped; his connection collapsed in the middle of the meeting.

The senior official should have been in Adelaide Road or on the grounds of the Houses of the Oireachtas if he were joining remotely, or preferably sitting in one of the seats in the committee room.  I propose to ask the clerk to the committee that every effort should be made to have witnesses attend on site.  If they are not on site, they should be at their headquarters, be that a Government Department or an agency.  They should at least be in their organisation's headquarters with a good connection to the Internet.
