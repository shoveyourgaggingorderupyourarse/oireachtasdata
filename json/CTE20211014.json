This was distributed across five diverse expenditure programmes of varying size.  The largest expenditure programme related to energy, accounting for &euro;204 million, or 48%, of the total spent in 2020.  A total of &euro;127 million was expended on energy efficiency programmes promoted by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, a decrease of 16% when compared with the expenditure outturn in 2019.  The 2020 energy programme also includes expenditure of &euro;50 million for the purchase of statistical transfers from other EU member states as a result of a shortfall in the achievement of Ireland's 2020 obligations under the renewable energy directive.  Provision has been made in the 2021 Estimate for further statistical transfer purchases.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure on the communications programme in 2020 was just under &euro;89 million, which was significantly less than the amount provided for the year of almost &euro;158 million.  Expenditure on the information and communications technology programme, at &euro;53 million, was only around half the level provided for, due to delayed deployment of the national broadband plan, NBP, network.  Given the scale of the plan, it would be useful for the Department to consider giving it its own subhead in the future.<\/p> <p>  The Department spent more than &euro;81 million of voted funds on the environment and waste management programme in 2020.  More than half of the voted expenditure went to support the operations of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  In addition to the voted expenditure, the Department spent just under &euro;17 million on environmental projects and initiatives from the separate environment fund in 2020.  The Department spent almost &euro;33 million under the inland fisheries programme and just over &euro;21 million on a range of services covered by the natural resources programme.<\/p> <p>  Receipts that could be used by the Department to support its voted expenditure amounted to &euro;13 million in 2020.  The surplus remaining unspent at year end was just over &euro;101 million.  With the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department was able to carry over &euro;38 million in unspent capital funding to 2021.  The balance of &euro;63 million was surrendered to the Exchequer.  In addition, the Department transferred directly to the Exchequer &euro;123 million it received in regard to the operations of the EU emissions trading system, as disclosed in note 4.3.<\/p> <p>  Members may wish to note that the Department was responsible for the oversight of a broad range of public sector bodies, including regulators and a number of major commercial State bodies that do not receive ongoing grant funding.  The bodies are listed in an appendix to the appropriation account.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 9 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2019 reports on the findings of an examination of the costs associated with landfill remediation.  Landfill is no longer used as a general strategy for waste disposal and, at the end of 2019, just three landfill sites continued in operation.  However, historical sites continue to pose environmental risks and may require monitoring and expensive remediation.  Costs incurred by the Vote associated with landfill remediation amounted to &euro;12 million in 2020.<\/p> <p>  As at July 2020, a total of 611 landfill sites had been identified in the State.  They comprise 117 sites licensed and regulated by the EPA since March 1997 and 494 unregulated landfill sites recorded on a national register.  More than 70% of the unregulated sites are pre-1997 local authority-operated landfills, approximately 21% are privately operated sites and just over 8% are identified illegal landfill sites.<\/p> <p>  The EPA monitors environmental risk factors on an ongoing basis at the 117 landfill sites it regulates.  The agency does not monitor environmental risk factors at the unregulated landfills but has a role in authorising proposed plans for their remediation.  At the time the report was being completed, 152 sites operated by local authorities pre-March 1997 had been assessed as being of either moderate or high risk for the environment.  Remediation plans to address the environmental risks identified had been submitted to the EPA in respect of 19% of those sites, and certificates of authorisation to commence remediation had been issued in respect of only 11, or 7% of the total.<\/p> <p>  By the end of 2019, the Department had provided more than &euro;158 million under a grant scheme for assisting remediation of 122 landfill sites.  This included &euro;52 million contributed from the Vote for the remediation of a site at Haulbowline Island in Cork Harbour.  An additional &euro;25 million was spent on this project under the marine Vote.  The Department had spent &euro;33.5 million on the remediation of two large landfill sites, at Kerdiffstown in Kildare and Kilconnell in Galway, and further significant expenditure was anticipated.  Both of those landfill sites were formerly privately operated under EPA licences but are now being managed by the respective local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Financial provision arrangements as part of EPA licensing of private operators are intended to ensure there will be sufficient resources available, without recourse to public funds, to pay for restoration and aftercare costs when landfill sites close, or when pollution incidents occur during operation.<\/p><p>Financial provision arrangements as part of EPA licensing of private operators are intended to ensure that there will be sufficient resources available, without recourse to public funds, to pay for restoration and aftercare costs when landfill sites close or when pollution incidents occur during operation.  Kilconnell landfill is an example of where the financial provision arrangement in place failed to provide the funds required to meet closure and aftercare costs.  Instead, the Department has had to fund substantial costs associated with the closure, remediation and ongoing monitoring of the site.<\/p><p> The report includes recommendations for the Department to review the governance and oversight arrangements for landfill sites, ensure the completion of outstanding risk assessments for all sites and develop medium-term estimates of the future costs associated with landfill remediation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#A00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

As the committee will be aware, the Department in its current form was established following the reconfiguration of a number of Departments by Government in June 2020, and a transfer of functions order was made in September 2020 formally assigning the broadcasting and media functions to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. The 2020 income and expenditure relating to those functions are included in the appropriation account for that Department in Vote 33.<\/p> <p>  Total gross expenditure under the Vote in 2020 amounted to &euro;428 million, some 21% or &euro;113 million below the budgetary allocation of &euro;541 million, which included capital carryover.  The Covid-19 pandemic impacted expenditure across all programme areas of the Department in 2020, and, in particular, the communications and energy programmes, which had savings of &euro;69 million and &euro;14 million, respectively.  The impact of the pandemic is also reflected in reduced output and spend across these programmes in 2021.<\/p> <p>  The Department and its agencies played an important role throughout the pandemic by ensuring the continuity of critical infrastructure and by putting in place measures to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on businesses and individuals.  Staff in the Department continued to deliver on major business priorities during 2020, some of which are set out in the briefing note provided to the committee, with a more comprehensive list of activity and outputs contained in the Department&rsquo;s annual report for 2020, which has been published.<\/p> <p>  Our agencies also played a key role in supporting businesses and citizens.  An Post, for example, kept its network of more than 900 post offices open, fulfilling an important commercial and social role to communities.  ComReg worked closely with telecommunications operators to ensure that the necessary measures and plans were put in place by networks to manage and handle the surge in voice and data traffic with offices, schools and third-level institutions shut and those activities taking place in the home.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, put temporary measures in place to strengthen the protections in place for energy consumers.<\/p> <p>  The Department secured additional funding in 2020 for the trading online voucher scheme as part of the Government&rsquo;s Covid-19 business supports package for small businesses.  This was to meet the increased demand from businesses that found themselves unable to trade physically and had to move their businesses online.  In 2020, &euro;21 million was spent on the scheme, of which &euro;18.5 million can be directly attributed as Covid-19-related spend.  Approximately 13,000 vouchers, which is ten times the number approved in 2019, were awarded and more than 28,000 small businesses benefitted from the training, advice and support provided by local enterprise offices, LEO, as part of the scheme.  Usage of eircode postcodes, which had been trending significantly upwards in recent years, jumped significantly in 2020 to almost 28 million look-ups compared to 19 million in 2019.  A significant part of this increase is a result of the shift to online shopping last year.  We have seen a further significant increase of 24% over the first eight months of 2021.<\/p> <p>  The year 2020, which was the first year of the national broadband plan, NBP, contract, saw a significant level of mobilisation activity by National Broadband Ireland, NBI, including recruitment of personnel, procurement of materials and contractors, installation of equipment in exchanges, building IT systems to support the network and undertaking surveys and designs, which were progressed right across the country to inform the build programme, resulting in the first homes being connected to the new fibre network in January of this year in County Cork.<\/p> <p>  The roll-out of the NBP has, however, been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  While telecommunications activity was deemed essential work under Covid-19, activities relating to network build generally involve multiple-person crews.  The onset of significant Covid-19 case numbers and the implications for close contacts severely impacted NBI&rsquo;s ability to have crews operating during certain periods in 2020 and 2021.<\/p> <p>  The Department has worked closely with NBI to put a remedial plan in place to address delays experienced to the NBP roll-out.  Under this plan, NBI is implementing a number of measures to help lessen the impact, including increasing the level of throughput in the eir make-ready programme and bringing additional resources into NBI and its subcontractors.<\/p> <p>  As of 1 October this year, more than 257,000 premises have been surveyed and build works involving more than 108,000 premises are ongoing across the country.  There are now more than 250 staff employed directly by NBI, along with more than 850 contractors throughout the country working on the network design and roll-out.  In addition, 379 broadband connection points have been installed by NBI, including 141 primary schools.  By the end of this year, NBI has forecast that almost 60,000 homes will have been passed and will be able to connect to the network.<\/p> <p>  Works under the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, energy schemes were also impacted by Covid-19 restrictions, particularly between March and June 2020, when activity paused in line with public health and Government guidelines.  Almost &euro;79 million was spent on energy efficiency measures through grants to more than 17,600 homes, 39 community-based projects and 1,615 households at risk of energy poverty.  The first auctions under the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, took place in July 2020 and 68 new renewable energy projects, equating to almost 1,100 MW of new electricity generation, received letters of offer.  The Department opened a call for applications to the just transition fund in June 2020 and provisional funding offers were announced in November last year.  While spend in 2020 was low, funding of &euro;30 million has been allocated to more than 60 projects throughout the region in the private sector, local authorities and communities.<\/p> <p>  Some &euro;48 million was provided to the EPA and &euro;23 million to local authorities for waste management programmes, including &euro;10 million provided through the environment fund.  A Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy was launched in September 2020 as Ireland&rsquo;s new roadmap for waste planning and management.  The plan shifts focus away from waste disposal and looks instead at how we can preserve resources by creating a circular economy.<\/p> <p>  A sum of &euro;12 million was provided in 2020 for landfill remediation.  As set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s chapter, the landfill remediation programme was set up in 2006 to address the findings of the 2005 European Court of Justice, ECJ, judgment against Ireland.  Fifteen years on from that judgment, we are now in a very different context in terms of our waste management performance.<\/p> <p>  The ECJ case itself was closed in 2015 as Ireland was considered to have made sufficient progress in implementing a programme of measures agreed with the European Commission.  There are now just three active landfills in Ireland that accept municipal waste, down from 126 at the time the proceedings were first brought by the Commission.  Our recycling rate was less than 5% in 1998 but now stands at approximately 40%, and 92% of municipal waste was sent to landfill  whereas only 14% was landfilled in 2018.  Having been found to be breach of our core obligations under the waste framework directive, we are now meeting or are on course to meet all of our EU objectives in this area.<\/p> <p>  Since the 2019 Comptroller and Auditor General chapter, important structural and administrative changes have been applied to the management and governance of the landfill remediation programme and these will deliver results in a more streamlined and accountable manner in the coming years.  In 2020, for the first time, expenditure under the scheme exceeded the budget allocated. The Comptroller and Auditor General made three recommendations in his report and implementing measures to address the recommendations are being incorporated into the management of the programme.<\/p> <p>  I look forward to assisting the committee members with any questions they may have today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Griffin.

What the Deputy has described is the evolution of cyberpolicy.  It is an evolution.  We are moving through phases where we are seeing significant activity in this sector.  We will take whatever measures are required to ensure that the State, the operators of State infrastructure, private citizens and private businesses are protected to the greatest extent possible in dealing with the issues that we have to contend with, not just in light of the HSE attack but in light of broader issues more generally in cyberspace, such as the types of threats that are emerging.<\/p> <p>  To revert to the Deputy&rsquo;s previous question, in 2020 a particular vulnerability arose during the massive shift from office-based and business-based work to the home.  A significant degree of disruption was caused to how businesses functioned.  We saw a rapid, significant increase in cyber-incidents right across the State.

We have moved from 126 landfills to 43, have remediated 46 sites and have spent &euro;170 million on that activity.  As rightly pointed out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the chapter presented this morning, there is a great deal more work to be done.  Looking at where we were when the Comptroller and Auditor General issued his report, which I think was September 2020, 21 final certificates of authorisation have issued from the Environmental Protection Agency, which is a further eight, four draft certificates of authorisation decisions are due in 2021, 24 certificates of authorisation applications are pending final decision and a further 20 are expected to be submitted in the coming months.  Progress is being made, but there is a great deal of work to do to address that outstanding issue.  The other important bit is the work identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General as needing to be done, including risk assessments to be undertaken and certificates of authorisation to be prepared by the EPA.  We have put in place a procurement framework, valued at &euro;7 million over a three to four-year period.  This will allow local authorities to draw down from the framework and to point to the sites in their areas in respect of which, based on the section 22 register, they have concerns.  They can then do the risk assessment, identify the nature of the risk as being low, medium or high and identify the nature of the works, if any, to remediate so that we can constantly over the next few years move through the process, park the ones that do not represent a risk and focus the resources of the State on remediation of the balance of those that are still causing a problem from an environmental perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#E01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#E02000","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Verona Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#E02100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Good morning everybody.

The design of the network means ensuring all the equipment is in place, as well as the requisite design of the pole and duct network.

When we are satisfied on an independent level that the design is fit for purpose, that situation is then also certified by an independent certifier who is qualified in that business.

Every month that NBI is delayed in meeting its targets will mean less revenue coming into the business and that will result in its profits being lower.  In addition, the working capital requirements of the company are more severe and they need to reach those requirements.  NBI will therefore face significant business implications if there are delays with this build, as well as the contractual implications.  The other key performance indicator that we have for NBI measures network performance.  It includes any outages, on a BCP, for example.

On 15 September there were 23,000, according to the CEO of National Broadband Ireland.  There are now 27,000.  We have clarified this today.  The target is 60,000 so there are 33,000 premises to be connected, or to be passed, between now and the end of the year.  This would seem to be ambitious.  I hope it happens.  Similar to the previous speaker, I desperately want to see the broadband plan rolled out.  Laois and Offaly are crying out for it.  Many commuters go up and down the M7 every day who could be working from home.  They need to be working from home for a number of reasons, such as to get away from long commutes and to decrease their carbon emissions.<\/p> <p>  At present, 60,000 is the target.  It looks like we will come in at roughly half of what the original target was.  There was a period of time that the company could not work because of Covid.  I contest this because telecommunications was one of the areas that was exempt.  The real reason was that many of the operatives and subcontractors involved were from another country.

Several years ago, the former Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, told me on the floor of the D&aacute;il when replying to a question on this that stringent penalties would be imposed.  What I am hearing this morning is that if NBI does not get to the 60,000 it will not get paid.  The point is that it can move at its own pace if there is no other penalty.  I was given to believe, and the greater world out there believes, that there were going to be stringent penalties.  There is huge concern about this not just among Members of the Oireachtas but in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It outlined clearly what its concerns are.  I want to clarify this with a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer.  Apart from not being paid for work not done, in other words if it does not get 60,000 done it will not get paid for the full 60,000, is there another financial penalty?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#N01800","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634200200,"counter":279,"content":"<p>It is not a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer but it will be a brief answer.  There are three stages when we look at this.  It will get paid for what it has built.  The impact, as Mr. Mulligan described earlier, is that work continues and it has to fund additional working capital.  It also loses out on revenues to the company.  I do not want to call this a penalty but it is a consequence and it is a significant consequence for the company.  The second point Mr. Mulligan mentioned is that there are delay payments.  These delay payments are applicable from the first day of the third contract year and will be applied where there is a delay in achieving build-related milestones.<\/p> <p>  Looking back at the transcript, a Deputy used the analogy of a concessionaire running a road and getting hit with penalties for closing down one of the lanes.  These are the types of penalties that arise when connecting and passing.  These are real penalties.  There are 17 key performance indicators.  These include the time required to connect premises, minimum upload and download speeds, the number of faults, the time taken to repair them, price and service availability.  There is a suite of penalties and consequences across the lifetime of the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#N01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":280,"content":"<p>The only penalty financially is that the company does not get paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#N02000","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634200200,"counter":281,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#N02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":282,"content":"<p>If a carpenter doing work in a house starts and does a bit of it and then goes away and comes back, and keeps coming and going over a period of time so that two weeks' work takes the better part of a year, that carpenter will not get paid until the job is finished.

He and I discussed this matter a couple of years ago, along with Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, on 3 April 2019, issued observations and memos for the Minister's attention.  I have copies in front of me.  The Department set out its concerns.  The document I have to hand, from Mr. Robert Watt and Mr. Brendan Ellison, is one with which Mr. Mulligan will be familiar.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe strongly recommend against approval of the appointment of the preferred bidder to the current NBP procurement process on the grounds of: cost and affordability, impact on the National Development Plan and on projects forgone as a result, value for money and specifically uncertain benefits, unprecedented risk for the Exchequer and compatibility with [the spatial strategy] Project Ireland 2040. <\/blockquote> <p>It also states the Department believed significant progress could be made with an alternative approach.  Basically, it was saying other providers were already in the field in a lot of the relevant localities.  I am familiar with some of them in Laois&ndash;Offaly.  They were out there providing wireless broadband before the Department was.  The two officials mentioned the cost and set out a chart on it.  The document stated, &quot;This is a more prudent approach to a long-term investment of this nature compared with committing to a 25 year contract which, by its nature, does not have the same flexibilities.&quot;  They set out what this entailed.  Basically, it was providing a spine.<\/p><p>The document states, &quot;In terms of value for money, we have major concerns in relation to the credibility of the [cost-benefit analysis] for the National Broadband Plan&quot;.  At the time, a sum of up to &euro;3 billion was being mentioned.  The document also states, &quot;Furthermore, under this proposal the State will not own the asset, despite investing up to &euro;3 billion in it (as compared with a private sector equity investment risk of only [the wording here is blacked out]&quot;.  It goes on to state, &quot;The lack of a competitive process in arriving at the final bid is also a real concern for the Department&quot;.  It outlines the risks to the Exchequer: &quot;[W]e believe that the State is being asked to take on unprecedented risk associated with this project&quot;.  It claims the State was being asked to commit nearly &euro;3 billion, which was to provide returns to the private operator and owner of the asset, while the latter was risking only a given amount of equity.  This amount is blacked out in the document.  At the time, the amount was reckoned to be around &euro;250 million.  The document states the private operator, for the given amount of equity, &quot;will own the entire asset while accepting the State has mechanism to safeguard&quot;.  The document also sets out what its authors believe was an alternative approach and, towards the end, questions why the likes of the ESB were not already being used more.  Could Mr. Cleary state whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform still stands over that memo of 3 April 2019?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#O00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634200200,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I am happy to respond to that.

Does Mr. Griffin not feel that where there are difficult or contentious decisions, the Department and taxpayer are outnumbered?  Mr. Griffin knows how it works at a board meeting.

Some &euro;21 million was spent in 2020 and 13,000 vouchers were awarded.  I highlighted that figure because that scheme, and how quickly it was administered by the Department, was appreciated by so many businesses, as I am sure Mr. Griffin will appreciate.  In addition, the work of the local enterprise offices in my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, the phenomenal roll-out of that programme and how well it was received by businesses, should not go unnoticed here today because it was invaluable to many businesses to get them online.<\/p> <p>  I will return to the landfill issue.  We spoke about it previously but did not have enough time.  I asked about the &euro;6.1 million allocated to the environmental fund to local authorities to support waste enforcement services anti-dumping initiatives.  How is that being monitored by the Department?  I can only imagine when the Department divested the landfill issue to each local authority it was probably a little weight off the shoulders but, ultimately, that needs to be monitored to ensure the fund is being utilised correctly and we are seeing value for money on that aspect.

I am none the wiser.  Serious concerns have been raised by many Members in recent times about the oversight of universities and other educational institutions.  It ranges from academic attendance to partnerships with private companies that act against the public interest.  These institutions have a huge influence on society, and they are publicly funded.  We must ensure there is no negative influence in State-funded education.  Educational institutions also receive huge amounts of money from the Exchequer.  The sum of &euro;3.3 billion was received last year.<\/p> <p>  The partnership between UCD and Tullow Oil is particularly concerning.  Tullow Oil paid UCD &euro;2 million to put on short courses for regulators in some African and South American countries.  These courses have the stated focus of professional development of academics and technical professionals.  We are effectively using the brand of UCD to do that work for Tullow Oil and it is a State-funded brand.  The course, as it is described, has all sorts of intersections with regulatory bodies and State-related entities.  I have serious concerns over a potential conflict of interest.  How much influence did Tullow Oil have on the course content?  What is the curriculum and who wrote it?  I do not think it is appropriate for companies to use the good name of a public State-funded university to influence regulators.  That is different from particular companies having interaction with universities.  This is a completely funded course.  I suggest that we need to have a meeting with UCD and perhaps the HEA.  There are similar courses in TCD for example.  This is simply not acceptable.  There is no extra information given.

No. 813C is dated 30 September and is a request to the committee from mise as our Chair to consider making inquiries with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners regarding the recent tax settlement with a company called Perrigo, which concerned the tax treatment of income arising from the sale of intellectual property.  It has been reported that the settlement was agreed at &euro;297 million.  Revenue's original tax bill for Perrigo was &euro;1.64 billion, which I understand was the largest tax bill ever issued by Revenue.  The settlement represents a reduction of over &euro;1.3 billion.  To assist the committee in understanding the settlement, I propose that we write to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to request a detailed note setting out the rationale for the settlement, how it was arrived at and how Revenue was satisfied to settle for &euro;1.3 billion less than its initial assessment.  While we understand that, for various reasons, Revenue might not be able to get 100% of a tax bill, this was a major write-off.  Why did it settle for that?  I also suggest that we write to the Tax Appeals Commission for its take on the matter, as it may have had a role in this.<\/p> <p>  To go from &euro;1.64 billion to &euro;297 million represents an 84% write-off for Perrigo.  How did that come about?  It was originally the largest tax bill in the State's history.  The State is under the spotlight in terms of our corporation tax rates and collection rate.  While progress is being made in that regard and, regardless of the fact that many of us do not like it, we will now be tied to a rate of 15% under the OECD's proposal, the question over what we are collecting is the greater issue.  To go from &euro;1.64 billion to less than &euro;300 million is a major reduction by any standard.  Many PAYE workers would love to have such a reduction.  Does any member wish to comment on this matter or propose an action?  I suggest that we write to Revenue and the Tax Appeals Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#AA00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I would be happy with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021101400002#AA00600","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1634200200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>We will write to them.<\/p> <p>  We will move on to our work programme.

I am the chief executive of the environmental charity VOICE Ireland, one of the leading national environmental charities advocating for waste prevention through reuse, repair, repurpose and reimagining.  We have many campaigns, including Conscious Cup, We Choose Reuse, Sick of Plastic, Return For Change and Picker Pals.  We are also active in the development of policy at both national and EU level.<\/p> <p>  I would like to give the committee our impression of the heads of the circular economy Bill.  While there are many good provisions, we would like more ambition to embrace new business models and ways of consumption, moving away from our current disposable economy.  We can no longer rely on industry to do the right thing.  Over the past three years we have seen our packaging waste exceed 1 million tonnes.  This is increasing each year and is expected to be even higher due to Covid.  We cannot recycle our way out of this mountain of waste and this Bill can provide the direction we need to change how we consume.  As many members said at the latest committee session, producers must take responsibility for designing out waste in products and packaging.  They must also invest in new service models.  We cannot be content with supermarkets offering new compostable shopping bags or bags made from recycled plastic.  This is just nibbling around the edges.  <\/p> <p>  Some in industry tell us that they are only responding to what their customers want.  Customers want convenience, which means more prepared meals and more packaging but which came first?  Was it providing packaging for perfect produce or the supermarkets making us want that?  Supermarkets have conditioned us to choose pre-packaged items in a predetermined amount.  Shoppers often do not have the ability to select the quantity they need and are forced to buy bags of carrots that they may never use.  If they are able to buy loose fruit or vegetables, it is normally much more expensive per kilo to have the privilege of buying only what they want.  I was in Supervalu the other day and a bag of carrots was 50 cent per kilo while loose carrots were &euro;1.50 per kilo.  Are we not sick of seeing all our food wrapped in plastic?  <\/p> <p>  Businesses will not change unless our politicians are brave enough to demand new systems.<\/p><p>I worked on Capitol Hill for several years in the 1990s and I cannot tell the committee how many times businesses told me the legislation we were proposing would put them out of business.  Needless to say, they found a way to change their systems for the better and comply with the law.  We need to build back better.  Extracting resources and making and disposing of stuff takes up nearly 50% of our carbon budget and contributes to over 90% of our biodiversity loss.<\/p><p> My mantra, which I say all the time, is \"buy the product, not the packaging\".  Consumers should have the choice when shopping to bring their own container or bag, rent or borrow one or pay for a disposable one.  The last option will be achieved through the proposed levies.  However, we need retail to change its infrastructure to offer reuse and refill opportunities and make it mainstream.  This is being done in zero waste shops around the country, but as Senator Pauline O'Reilly mentioned last time, we should not have to go to many shops to reduce our waste.  By making refill and reuse mainstream, we make it much easier for the consumer to shop more sustainably.  France has mandated that all supermarkets larger than 400 sq. m must allocate 20% of floor space to reuse and refillables.  Items that can be refilled include cleaning products, dry goods, oils, vinegars, nuts, spices, etc.<\/p><p> Catering also must do its part.  The waste action plan calls for a ban on the unnecessary use of disposables in eat-in restaurants as well in closed-loop large-scale events, such as concerts and sports events.  This mandate should be in the Bill or included in subsequent regulation.  As of 2024, Portugal will require the use of reusables for in-house consumption in restaurants.  I have witnessed first-hand a food hall containing about 25 restaurants in Lisbon where all the plates, cups, glasses and cutlery were reusable and collected to be washed and used again.<\/p><p> We need to tackle takeaways and meal deliveries.  Other countries have piloted reusable containers where the container has a deposit that is returned once the container is returned.  The container is then washed and redistributed to the business to be used again.  Standardised containers, pooling arrangements, reverse logistics and industrial washing facility infrastructure can be developed throughout the country.  However, to achieve economies of scale and create a level playing field, all takeaways and delivery services must comply so we do not have any freeloaders.  Developing such a system creates local jobs through delivery, washing and logistics instead of buying cheap packaging from abroad.<\/p><p> We agree with Deputy Bruton that sectoral roadmaps for packaging, textiles, food waste, electronic waste and other streams must be developed with strong reuse, repair and waste prevention targets.  Additionally, there are further demands from the environmental community.  First, make it mandatory for the Minister to set reuse and repair targets, set bans and impose levies instead of saying he or she \"may\" do so.  Second, impose a tax on virgin plastic to boost viability and take-up of recycled plastic resins, as is done in Italy, Spain and the UK.  On the other side of the coin, we call for zero VAT for repaired or reused items as VAT has already been paid when they were first sold.  Third is truth in labelling.  The statute must declare that containers that claim to be compostable or biodegradable must use one label, \"compostable\", that meets the EN 13432 standard, which means that the product breaks down to its original constituents within 12 weeks in an industrial composting facility.  Right now there is a plethora of labels, which is confusing for the consumer. <\/p><p> Fourth, ban the use of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS, which are forever chemicals, in food contact materials, including food packaging.  In a report done by CHEM Trust in the UK, many plant fibre compostable food packagings contain PFAS to create a waterproof and greaseproof barrier.  PFAS is the stuff used in Teflon.  VOICE has just conducted a test of 11 brands of compostable or paper-based packaging commonly used in Ireland and all of them exceeded the limits for allowable PFAS amounts.  The bowl I am holding, which I had a colleague of mine find in the D&aacute;il canteen, was one of the highest rated for PFAS, at 12 times the allowable amount.  The sad thing is that this bowl advertised that it is fully compostable and meets the EN 13432 standard.  Not only is it touching the food we eat, but it goes to composting facilities, where it breaks down and remains in compost that is used on farmers&rsquo; fields.  I would like our PFAS report to be admitted to the record.  Denmark, last year, and California, just recently, have both banned PFAS in food contact material and we call for a similar ban in Ireland.  It is interesting that in Denmark MacDonald's and other companies have been able to switch to non-PFAS materials.<\/p><p> Fifth, demand that supermarkets larger than 400 sq. m devote 20% of their shopping areas towards primary refill and reuse packaging.  Sixth, demand that in-house consumption of food and drink as well as large closed-loop events provide reuseable cutlery, cups and delft.  Seven, require takeaways and food delivery services to offer reuse options and, where it is not offered, the consumer can bring their own container or purchase a disposable one.  Eighth, provide liability relief for repaired and reused items to encourage the repair and sharing economy.  Some initiatives such as the repair caf&eacute; and ClonBike, a bike sharing scheme, have had to discontinue due to the inability to secure insurance.  At least allow individuals to bring their own containers and if they do, create a personal acceptance of liability should they get sick from a reusable container they did not wash.  Ninth, we call for the more frequent review of the food waste prevention roadmap to see if interventions are effective and for interim annual targets to ensure that we meet the 50% reduction target.<\/p><p> Tenth, we call on Government entities to ban the purchase and use of any disposable single-use cup, plate or cutlery.  Reusable options must be provided.  Thus the Government will lead by example and create the momentum for reuse infrastructure to be established.  In the D&aacute;il, Members have many disposable items.  Some are compostable or recyclable.  I do not know if they are being put in the right bin.  Get rid of those, lead by example and use reuse options.  These are some of our suggestions and I look forward to working with members as this Bill progresses.  I am open to any questions members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mindy O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":455,"content":"<p>If members are agreeable, we can put the PFAS report on the website and attach it as an appendix to our pre-legislative report.

I thank the committee for this opportunity to participate in the development of the circular economy Bill.<br\/><br\/>I work as policy officer at the European Environmental Bureau, EEB.  The EEB is the EU&rsquo;s largest federation of environmental NGOs.  We support our 170-plus members in advocating for environmental protection and justice.  We have eight members in Ireland, including Friends of the Irish Environment, Zero Waste Alliance Ireland, the Irish Environmental Network and VOICE, which is represented by Ms O'Brien who just made her excellent statement.  I have familiarised myself with the committee's work in this area and consulted our members.  <br\/><br\/>The Bill is welcome and I hope it is adopted.  I will focus my statement on interesting practice from across the EU and developments in Brussels.  Targets were raised in the last meeting.  Knowing the extraction of natural resources causes more than 90% of biodiversity loss and at least 50% of greenhouse gas emissions, the most important thing the circular economy can achieve is to reduce our consumption of natural resources.  Ireland does not report on material footprint in its national statistics and does not have detailed material flow accounts.  Without this capacity it will be difficult to measure the circular economy in a holistic way.  The European Commission will this autumn add material footprint to its monitoring framework, making reporting on this indicator mandatory.  The Netherlands, who several Deputies already regarded as a leader for circular economy, have set a target to reduce their material footprint by 50% by 2030.  Even if Ireland may not be ready for a target, why not establish the necessary statistical capacity and commit to political debate on consumption targets in the future?<br\/><br\/>As noted in Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s very good report, Ireland has one of the highest levels of municipal waste in Europe.  At above 600 kg <i>per capita<\/i>, it is almost a quarter above the European average.  In Brussels, revised packaging legislation is expected to be proposed next spring.  Policy options being discussed include reuse targets for products like drinks and takeaway food.  Alongside a headline target on reducing consumption, I encourage members to consider targets on waste prevention and reuse, notably for food, packaging and municipal waste.  We already have some of these in other EU countries.<br\/><br\/>Targets will not achieve themselves. The Bill seems very focused on waste and more could be said about the enabling factors of the circular economy.<\/p><p>As I said in the previous meeting, I would not rely too much on EU Single Market measures.  I will give an example.  While the recent eco-design provisions adopted for white goods may help to make washing machines technically repairable, they do not address the cost of repair or the need for making the repair market competitive, including for independent operators and repair cafes.  The circular economy will require local labour to reuse, repair and refurbish.  Sadly, hours of Irish labour are more expensive than the latest gadgets on Amazon.  Ireland will need all the tools at its disposal to nudge the economy away from its linear model.  On fiscal incentives, the EU has no competency, but you can introduce differential VAT rates, or a tax shift from labour to resource this practice.  Belgium and Finland have included subsidies in their government programmes.  A number of states, such as Germany and Austria, have also introduced repair bonuses, where up to 50% of the cost of repair is reimbursed to citizens, with a cap of &euro;100.  Italy and France have also been increasingly targeting multinationals that blatantly build obsolescence into their business models.  Italian competition authorities fined a major printer manufacturer &euro;10 million for blocking cartridge reuse, and France has made obsolescence and the destruction of unsold goods illegal.<\/p><p> Extended producer responsibility, EPR, can also be a more effective tool in financing the circular economy.  Although I welcome that Ireland will introduce a modulation of EPR fees to support recycling, EPR should also enable reuse and repair.  The French solidarity reuse fund earmarks 5% of EPR revenues for reuse and social economy actors.  Ireland its own social economy initiatives, including good ones like Rediscover Fashion in Dublin.  Such small-scale projects will always need support, as they cannot compete with fast fashion and goods bought online.  One of our members has also raised concerns about the amount of recyclable waste covered by the EPR which is still being diverted to cement kilns and incinerators.  I am also curious about how Ireland&rsquo;s awaited deposit return scheme, DRS, will fit into the Bill.  When is this system expected to be implemented?  Will it also enable reuse?<\/p><p> I will conclude by making some challenging points to reflect on.  The first is about mining.  Part 5 of the Bill, which relates to natural resources, is welcome.  As well as preventing the extraction of coal and shale, how can the Bill ensure the recovery of other resources is prioritised over virgin extraction?  For example, the EPA estimates that there are 75 million tonnes of untapped secondary mineral resources in Ireland.  Lastly, with a view to COP26, how can embedded initiative products better be accounted for in climate policy, such as throughput printing of products, or providing credits for waste prevention?  I thank the committee for its time and I am happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Pierre Schweitzer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I will now invite members to indicate to ask questions.

The first question is to Ms O'Brien.  I would like to get an understanding of how prescriptive legislation should seek to be in some of these areas.  Should we consider giving the Minister enabling powers so that in the future as opportunities evolve, measures can be introduced with regard to virgin plastic, requirements regarding supermarket space, or packaging alternatives etc.?  How far can we go in initiating legislation now?  I wonder if there are models of legislation around the labeling issue.  When one raises labeling, one is generally told that Ireland cannot have its own labeling regime.  I wonder if we were to try to designate what defines \"compostable\", in the way that Ms O'Brien is suggesting, would we run into difficulties with European law?  Would we be better off setting non-legislative ambition in these areas as a way of prodding sectoral change?<\/p> <p>  My second question is to Mr. Schweitzer.  I would be interested to hear how France outlawed obsolescence.  It strikes me as a difficult concept to catch and to create a legal structure around.  I would be interested to know how that was done.  He also raised the concept of a rebate funded by the sector for repair.  Again, how was that done?  Is that within existing producer responsibility schemes?  Was that done in some other fashion?   My questions are on the &ldquo;how to&rdquo; of some of Mr. Schweitzer's points and whether they have evolved through law and regulation leading in this way.  Does one set out detailed law, or does one do these sorts of things through negotiation with the sector and by leading an evolution in that way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#C00300","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I would love to see all sorts of targets in there, but I do not know if that would be feasible here.  I know from my experience in the US Congress that one should never legislate for the current government; instead, one should future-proof legislation.  I would like to see language such as the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; put in place targets and levies, rather than a &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  That needs to be researched a little bit more.  We would love to see high targets for reuse.  If we do not set high targets for reuse, it will not happen.  I also do not want to see a reuse target of 2% or waste prevention target of 2%.  If one does not put a target on specific sectors or businesses, it is not going to be done.<\/p> <p>  In the last six years, the waste management plans had a waste reduction target of 2% but we increased waste over that timeframe.  If one does not mandate certain entities to do it, they will not do it.  I will leave it up to the legislators to decide whether the best approach is by statutory instrument or in primary legislation.  I am not sure, but I have read through the Waste Management Act.  I have seen many powers that the Minister &ldquo;can&rdquo; do but has not done.  When I was working in the US Congress, they were reviewing something from the US Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  It gave the US EPA a lot of discretion to do things.  However, what happened was that the US EPA did none of it.  Therefore, in the legislation, they changed all the instances of &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I would like it to be mandatory that these things will be done.<\/p> <p>   On the compostablity standard, there is no real definition of &ldquo;compostable&rdquo;.  The main criteria is the standard EN 13432.  At the moment, some forks and some cutlery are labelled &ldquo;degradable&rdquo;.  Some of them say &ldquo;biodegradable&rdquo;.  I am biodegradable.  Anything is biodegradable.  However, the standard EN 13432 means that the product has to break down within 12 weeks in a composting facility.  Many manufacturers are taking advantage and consumers are confused.  Consumers see the &ldquo;biodegradable&rdquo; label and think it means they can put it into the compost bin.  However, it is a term of art.  We need one standard and one terminology for the Irish way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mindy O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Can Ireland do that on its own?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#C00500","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":462,"content":"<p>Yes.

On the first one regarding the French waste law, I understand prohibition of obsolescence was introduced into French waste law.  There have been some difficulties with implementing this law because it is something that is quite difficult to define.  According to our members in France, the definition of obsolescence is quite important and in France they define obsolescence based on two points.  First is the deliberate effort of the manufacturer to shorten the life of the product, and second is they do so deliberately in search of profit.  Recent attempts to prosecute companies - there have been some attempts already to apply the law - have been unsuccessful because it has been very difficult to prove these two points.  The definition of obsolescence is very difficult.  That is the feedback we have had.  Nonetheless it gives potential, and even if it is something very difficult to do, it can be quite an important symbolic legal action.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's question on the rebate, I have to double-check this but I know that, both in Austria and Germany, it has been done at the regional level, the state level.  In Austria it is managed by the state but I need to check where the revenues from it come and I am happy to submit some evidence from that later on.<\/p> <p>  On compostability, I am sorry, this is not my area of expertise but I am sure one of my colleagues will be able to help the Deputy on this to identify the practices in other member states.  I can confirm what Senator Boylan said about the possibility of having labelling which differs from other member states on the basis she described.  France has also recently introduced the repairability label for a few product groups, including smartphones, laptops, lawnmowers and I am forgetting one but they have done something similar on labelling there where they have something different from other EU member states.  I can confirm that is possible to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Pierre Schweitzer"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":471,"content":"<p>In European experience has a provision such as comply or explain ever been used in these areas, where a general obligation can be created but for a number of years there is an option of not complying but offering an explanation as to why it has not been possible?

The information they have given so far is incredibly valuable and very practical.  I also thank Deputy Bruton for making suggestions in regard to witnesses.<\/p> <p>  Several years ago when I was starting to get into zero waste in a big way, there was one shop in Ireland I could think of which was zero waste.  That has changed and now there are many places throughout Ireland doing that.  It is still a lifestyle that people choose, for environmental reasons mostly, and that is what we need to change.  I met a young woman with no children who said she was spending every waking moment trying to make decisions about the types of choices she had, such as how to feed herself and so forth.  We cannot operate like that.  This Bill is a good step along the way.<\/p> <p>  I agree with some of the comments around changing the language from \"may\" to \"shall\", and the officials took that on board last time.  As I said in regard to the climate action Bill, we made some changes to the language because of our recommendations as a committee, and we want to ensure future governments are obligated to hit targets.<\/p> <p>  That point made by Ms O'Brien about targets is an important one because you will miss targets unless you deal with some of the underlying issues that make it impossible to reach them.  One of those is the finance around it.  Having repair caf&eacute;s is quite difficult with insurance and so on.  It is practically impossible as a layperson who is not involved in an industry to run repair caf&eacute;s.  Could I have the witnesses' thoughts around the financial things we need to put in place?  Zero VAT is very important.  An Mheitheal Rothar in Galway raised this as an issue, that it is not viable as a business and therefore relies on grants to be able to run its operation as a social enterprise.<\/p> <p>  One of the main issues with compostability is that while people may sell things that are compostable, quite apart from the labelling and the different types of products that are used, the lack of compost facilities close to where people purchase the compostable items is a major issue.  It means dumping in inappropriate facilities.  Is there something we can put in policy that means you cannot sell these items unless you also have some facility to ensure people compost?<\/p> <p>  The last point is on incineration.  Do the witnesses think that language needs to be changed in the Bill to ensure there is no leniency in regard to companies that might be using incineration for their waste?  I brought this up last time.<\/p><p>It is nearly impossible for repair cafes to get insurance.  VOICE has got insurance for repair cafes, but we are one of the only organisations that have them.  I probably should not say it but we have lent our name to different repair cafes so they can fall under our insurance.  It does not cover the repair of electronics.  We cannot find any insurance for the repair of electronics.  It has been impossible to run these for that reason.<\/p><p> For finance, 0% VAT is essential.  Right now, if your CD player - I do not know if anyone uses them anymore - or DVD player breaks down, it is cheaper to buy a new one than repair it.  I suggest 0% VAT or even tax credits for companies that buy refurbished or repaired items.  I bought a used computer and still had to pay VAT on it.  Maybe offer a tax credit to encourage the take-up of that.<\/p><p> On compostables and facilities for collection, I worry about compostables.  It is referred to as \"unfortunate substitution\" because you are going from one single use to another single use.  I read a statistic from a life cycle assessment of reusables.  I would also like that to go on the record.  I have two reports I would like to submit.  It stated that 3 billion trees are logged every year globally in order to produce paper packaging and 6.5 million are used to make coffee cups alone.  If we move from one single use to another, we are still extracting resources.<\/p><p> Instead of going down that route, it is much better to move towards reusables.  Reusables, for environmental and economic reasons, beat single use every time.  In terms of facilities to collect compostables, there might be a use for compostables for pre-made sandwiches.  Put them in compostable packaging and provide street bins to collect the food and the packaging at the same time.  A huge public awareness campaign would be required because when people are out and about, they put things wherever they see a bin.  They do not care.  I have gone to many festivals to monitor bins and I know that you have to tackle people to put things in the right bin.<\/p><p> The Senator said if compostable packaging is offered, there should be facilities.  The problem is if you are getting compostable, you are often leaving.  Even if the bins are there, you are down the street somewhere else when you finish the product.  I worry about the switch to compostable products.  We need to use reusables and push that.  It is called \"unfortunate substitution\".<\/p><p> On incineration, is the Senator talking about the levies on incineration?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#D01000","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I am talking about the levies.

There is a potential to think about how the fees collected in the EPR system are used.  We already have EPR systems for waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, and packaging and will eventually, maybe, for textiles.  Given the French example of saving 5% of the funds for reuse, this means 95% of the financing is going to, at best, recycling.  There are huge amounts of funds in the EPR system for these product groups.  Unless they are directed towards reuse and remanufacturing, the best you can hope to achieve is recycling.  There is much improvement to be attained there but it will not go beyond that.<\/p> <p>  The other area I wanted to make a point on in my statement but did not have time was public procurement.  There is a big potential through public procurement to leverage remanufacturing.  For example, imagine if all Irish schools remanufactured electronics.

I have some comments and two or three questions I can identify readily from the contributions.<\/p> <p>  In the context of Ms O'Brien's comment on the fact we cannot rely on supermarkets to do the right thing and as to whether we are being preconditioned, I completely agree with that sentiment.  She gave the example of inappropriate weights being offered for sale to a person who might know specifically how much loose vegetables they need to buy but are not given the option to do so.  The bigger problem is where people are given the opportunity to buy individual items, but there is a differential price involved.  The person is paying more, sometimes far more, for less weight.  There is a requirement for us to look at that.  I have noted some retailers are doing the right thing in that context, but not all.  It is something we in this House need to work on.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Brien provided the example of France and the fact that a certain percentage is provided if the facility is larger than 400 sq. m.  That is a good idea.  Certain retailers are doing or at least trialling it.  All supermarkets, regardless of their size, need to take this sort of thing on board.  While I appreciate that 400 sq. m is not the largest, there are other facilities that can provide that sort of service in terms of dispensing with packaging, reusing or refilling.  Would there be an angle for us to look at all retailers and what they are selling?<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Brien's remark regarding VAT rates on repaired items on which VAT has already been paid is a valuable one.  I had not considered that and think it should be taken up with the Department of Finance.  On truth in labelling, I could not agree more.  It has been referenced that a body of work is being undertaken but it is something we need to take a lead on.<\/p><p>I do not think we should wait for others or the EU to take steps. We should be doing it ourselves.<\/p><p> The witnesses introduced the idea of PFAS.  I had never heard of it before, so I hope they will forgive my ignorance.  The report will be lodged on the website but I would appreciate it if they would give a quick overview of PFAS and its effect.<\/p><p> What do the witnesses believe will be the benefit of financial incentives for recycling?  We are improving rates of recycling in recent years and there is a return to the deposit and return scheme, DRS.  I have no particular difficulty with that but I wonder whether the witnesses have a view on it.<\/p><p> France and Italy were mentioned in terms of their competition and markets authorities fining companies which blatantly built-in obsolescence into their business models.  There was the example of Italy fining an ink cartridge firm, I presume that is because it was blocking cartridge reuse.  Are the witnesses aware of firms doing such things in the Irish context?  I am not sure I would know where to start, other than going to the consumer protection authority to make the inquiry.  <\/p><p> What is the witnesses' view of polystyrene foam being used in packaging for most electrical goods?  There are alternatives but when it comes to large heavy white electrical goods, is there an alternative because the ultimate aim of this committee, and this and future Governments, would be to ban polystyrene foam outright?  Are there biodegradable, reusable or sustainable alternatives to that?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#E01000","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":485,"content":"<p>The witnesses will be doing well to answer all those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#F00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":486,"content":"<p>There is a lot there.  If we could do all retailers with reuse-refill, that would be fabulous.  I would be on board with that.  PFAS are forever chemicals.  The Deputy might have seen a film called \"Dark Waters\" with Mark Ruffalo.  The PFAS which is used for Teflon pans or Gore-Tex is used to create a waterproof or oilproof barrier so they do not break down and they bioaccumulate.  They are tied to liver damage, cardiovascular endocrine and immune system damage, cause decreased fertility and lower birth rate.  Not only are you eating it but if it goes to a composting facility, it goes into the compost and then onto land and into plants.  There is a lot of PFAS in drinking water too.  It is everywhere.  We need to try and reduce it as much as we can.  There is no reason to use it in packaging and they have found they can take it out.  PFAS is something that I found out about around ten months ago.  It is like whack-a-mole trying to figure out what they are doing next.<\/p> <p>  We have been pushing for a DRS system for bottles and cans for years.  Originally, we were looking for glass to be included as well but our glass recycling rate is probably around 87% or 88% so we are actually doing quite well.  We are pushing for regulations which have not been signed yet.  I have been told they will be signed next week and will be up and running by the end of next year.  We are pushing for the reuse element.  I would rather have reuse for glass bottles and reuse for plastic bottles than recycling.  We are already doing okay with glass but if we could do more reuse, and identify where we can do more reuse for containers.  I was in Louth a couple of days ago at Holy Milk, run by the Byrne family.  They sell reusable milk bottles.  They have a vending machine and you buy the bottle for &euro;3.50 or bring your own and then the milk is &euro;1.15 and is right from the cow.  There is another one in Meath.  So there is a vending machine for milk and we can reuse bottles for sparking water and water as well.  <\/p> <p>  I think polystyrene packaging is terrible.  I would love to get rid of it.  A colleague, Karin Dubsky, who has been in this area for ages, has been trying to get this out of fish boxes because it breaks into tiny balls and goes everywhere.  If we could get rid of it, including in the fishing gear, that would be wonderful.  There is a type of mushroom that can be used for padding for those goods.  Smurfit has been working on paper packaging that gives the protection.  I think you could use paper and mushrooms as an alternative to polystyrene.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mindy O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I think DRS is very good, even if just for single use.  Many European member states have realised that it is very difficult, nearly impossible, to reach the 90% collection target for these kinds of products without DRS.  DRS ensures that you have a quality waste so that quality plastics like PET are not mixed with other materials and it means that you can have quite high quality PET recycling.  There is definitely a benefit and I do not want to criticise it.  What I was saying is that it will not go beyond this and we will not reach the reuse for these systems unless that is pursued.<\/p> <p>  On competition, I will not criticise the companies but it is well-known that the main market is based on selling printers and very expensive cartridges and that the cartridges have chips, that mean where there used to be a high street trade in refilling the cartridges, this no longer exists and the cartridges are sold to consumers at a very high price.  I can share the decision by the Italian competition authority with the Deputy but it is up to the committee to investigate this kind of practice.  It exists in other sectors as well.  I am happy to share the information with the Deputy.  <\/p> <p>  On polystyrene, I know one company that makes reusable packaging for white goods but they remain very niche in the market.

It has been informative.  I have a couple of points.  I am glad Ms O'Brien said she would rather not have compostable be the minimum for use because she is correct that things do not get composted.  Nothing in the Leinster House complex gets composted.  I have come from the European Parliament where thousands of people work and the canteens there reuse.  People pay a &euro;2 deposit when purchasing lunch and they can be collected and brought back in bulk, or returned on the same day.  It works.  IKEA is a perfect example.  Thousands of people go through the doors of IKEA and it does not use disposable tableware but plates, cups and glasses.  It can be done when there is the will to do it.<\/p> <p>  Could Mr. Schweitzer elaborate on the point he made about Ireland not collecting the data on material flow?  The OECD has been doing work on this since 2004.  For the benefit of members of the committee, why is that important to do?  We should move towards targets similar to those the Dutch and the Finns have.  I agree with the point around the 20% of supermarket space for 400 sq. m.  I would love to see reuse and refillable in every shop but I am thinking of the example of off-licences and the kickback over having those doors in place.  Have either Ms O'Brien or Mr. Schweitzer heard what the reaction was is French supermarkets to implementing that rule?  Was there much of a kickback from the supermarkets?  Should we just push ahead with it because of what we learned from implementing the alcohol rules?<\/p> <p>  Another point is relates to the potential for job creation, not just in developing our own recycling processing, but, more important, around reuse and the collecting and cleaning.  There is great potential for job creation which the witnesses may wish to comment on.<\/p> <p>  Finally, we talked about glass with Voice Ireland and we still think glass should be in the deposit return scheme even though we have high rates of glass recycling.  That is because there is an added benefit for anybody who walks their dog or goes along beaches or local football pitches, as broken glass is a major problem for them.  There is an antisocial element to it.  A deposit on glass bottles is more likely to address that issue, as well as the recycling.  I 100% agree with reuse.  There is a great example of a craft beer company and the bottles that are created.  While the initial outlay on the bottle is more expensive for the craft brewers, it reduces costs in the long run because they can reuse those bottles.<\/p> <p>  Those are just a couple of comments.  The questions were whether the witnesses know of any kickback from supermarkets and, for Mr. Schweitzer, why the material footprint so important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#G00700","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>First, the Senator is sorely missed in Brussels and many people were very happy with her work there.  On the material footprint, the point is that the existing indicator, which EUROSTAT asked for and all member states support, is domestic material consumption.  Importantly, this misses the embedded materials in imported goods.  This is quite a technical point.  Most European countries import most of their materials from outside Europe or from other countries.  This means that when the overall consumption of natural resources is assessed, this embedded impact is missed and this is quite critical for products like electronics or more or less any manufactured good where there is a kind of trail in the supply chain of moving material.  The indicator that covers this most holistically is material footprint and for now, from what I understand, only a few member states are reporting on this.  I think there are 11.  I understand Ireland is not reporting on it but it is widely agreed to be the best indicator for consumption.  A slightly critical point on the indicator is it is quite crude because it refers to tonnes of material and obviously we cannot compare a tonne of sand to a tonne of gold as they have their independent impacts.  When we are talking about consumption we need other indicators to support it as well, like impact indicators or the water or land footprint.  Thus it can help to give you a good overview of the level of consumption in your economy but it is not a silver bullet.<\/p> <p>  I want to come back to the question about incentives from Deputy Alan Farrell.  I will give one negative example of incentives.  In Belgium, we have a system of green vouchers, which encourages people to buy energy-efficient electronics.  Some studies on this showed a kind of rebound effect whereby many people were buying green-based credits to buy additional appliances rather than replacing their old ones.  In practice they ended up with two refrigerators running rather than one.  The example of the rebates in Austria may be more interesting because they focus on reuse.  That was just to give an example of how measures might not always work in the way one desires so be wary of how these kinds of incentives are designed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Pierre Schweitzer"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>On the kickback from supermarkets in France, it is a new provision so I do not know but it is in law.

We have asked for a trigger to be put into the regulations that if recycling falls below a certain level, glass would be included.  We already have the infrastructure.  The problem is if we put glass in, I fear this DRS will linger on and that we will not get it in place.  In Scotland, they really fought for glass.  They have been fighting it for four years and they still do not have it in place.  That is my fear because I would like this to be in place by next year.<\/p> <p>  On reuse, Oregon has been a great example.  As members can tell, I am not from here.  I am from Michigan.  I grew up with a DRS.  It was in our constitution back in the 1970s.  I think Oregon was after us.  I do not know which came first but in Oregon it was always a single-use DRS but now it has turned its system into reuse for microbreweries.  It established washing systems and agreed a standardised bottle.  The only thing that changes is the label.  The bottle can be used 50 times and it is a much better scenario.  We have spoken to the Irish Beverage Council.  It does not want to do it.  The council was saying to me the microbrewery business is quite small and they are moving more towards cans now.<\/p><p>I would like further research to be done in order to see where reuse could really have an impact.

As a society, we really need to start consuming more and give up our addiction to economic growth, as I am always saying.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Schweitzer raised some excellent points that I agree with.  The non-recycled plastic packaging levy is being paid from the general budget.  That is crazy when the polluter pays or, in this case, the producer pays model is a far better and more sustainable option.  I agree with Mr. Schweitzer about the tax being placed on virgin plastics, but I have a simple question for him.  What is the position with the Right to Repair campaign?  It is such a great idea.  The work Mr. Schweitzer is doing is clearly excellent.  I mentioned it to a few people in the constituency yesterday after reading Mr. Schweitzer's opening statement.  These people would have been climate aware and anxious to do their bit but they had never heard of it.  They were delighted to hear about it.  I would like if we could see more about how to get this into the regular media, not just specialist media.  Maybe Mr. Schweitzer could tell us how quickly the campaign communications are going around that.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Brien gave an excellent presentation.  I have very few questions.  I agree so much with what she said.  We need a radical change away from our current disposable economy.  We cannot recycle our way out of this climate crisis.  As Ms O'Brien stated, we need real leadership on this matter.  What she said about paying a premium for buying only what we need or want is spot on.  When I lived abroad, I never did a big shop.  I lived in Spain for five years and we never did a big shop.  We did a local shop all the time.  I am only thinking about it now.  I never took the car to the shop either because it was within walking distance and you would buy what you needed that day.  You were buying fresh produce and there was very little waste.  You were not finding things at the back of the fridge that were going off.<\/p> <p>  I also liked what Ms O'Brien said about the forever chemicals.  It is frightening.  Senator Boylan spoke of the compostables stuff we are using in the canteen here in Leinster House.  We should be doing something about this.  For the past few months, now that we are back here, I have been thinking that it is an awful pity that if you are getting a takeaway lunch, there is nowhere to compost any of the products that make it up.  Now, however, I am glad that there is nowhere to deposit them.  They should be going in the bin.<\/p> <p>  I always worry that we are consuming too much.  We cannot recycle our way out of this.  The rate we are consuming at is totally unsustainable.  That is the real elephant in the room.  I would be grateful if Ms O'Brien could expand on what she was saying about her work on Capitol Hill.  She said people would say that they could not do that and then, as we saw through this Covid crisis as well, what they say cannot be done can actually be done very quickly when there is a crisis, and we are in a crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#H00700","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I certainly agree with Deputy Cronin's suggestion that we let the Oireachtas Service know about the PFAS issue that Ms O'Brien has highlighted to us.

First, the Deputy raised the point - it was in my reference statement but I did not read it out - about the own resources plastics tax from the EU.  To be honest, I am quite surprised that, as far as I am aware, almost all European member states are paying this - what I consider to be an environmental levy - from their general budgets rather than charging the amount for the non-recycled plastic packaging waste to the producers or the industry linked to the products involved.  It is a bit of a scandal, if you ask me.

I thank Deputy Cronin for raising the matter.  The campaign is going well, I would say, because there is more and more attention in non-EU countries of right to repair.  The biggest challenge has been to engage independent repair shops in the campaign.  It is not because they are not interested, because the ones we speak to are very interested.  It is actually because they struggle to have time because they really are working on such a margin.  The amount of time that they can give to repairing phones and laptops and the turnaround that they have to have for a product they repair each day means they have limited time to engage in policy action.  We would welcome to hear from any independent repair shops that are interested in right to repair because we are slowly building this network.

In terms of the D&aacute;il, we approached the D&aacute;il - Voice did - earlier this year.  After speaking to Senator Boylan about reuse, we tried to get a proposal together for the D&aacute;il to get rid of all the disposables and go for reuse.  It went along great and then it stopped.  I do not know where that is, but if the Deputy can push it forward, we would love to do a pilot with the D&aacute;il to have all reusables here and even have a reverse vending machine to educate how the DRS will work.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Capitol Hill, it was back in the 1990s.  I remember them coming in, talking about energy efficiency standards or fuel efficiency standards and stating that they could not possibly do that, but they did.  I remember one company came in and actually exceeded the standards.  Then they used that.  They wanted increased standards because they were already there.  They wanted their competition to be behind the eight ball.  They were saying that they thought the standards should be really high because they had already achieved them.  Industry can do a lot more.  They are giving themselves short shrift not thinking that they can.<\/p><p>It is reported that small businesses can save up to $322,000 per annum through reuse.  Reuse reduces waste costs.  Businesses never think about the purchase of disposables.  That costs a great deal of money.  If they invest in reusables, the water, the energy and the staff are negligible, so they can save money.  They just need to give it a try.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#H01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mindy O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Brien.

They are very helpful in terms of the committee's work-through of this legislation, which is really important.<\/p> <p>  The scale of the challenge was mentioned.  There are many like-minded people on this committee, but I wonder sometimes about the barriers to the implementation of this type of measure.  As mentioned earlier, there is a cohort out there who are completely on board and doing this stuff already, but is only a tin percentage of people.  How do we scale up in terms of the population as a whole?  In her opening statement, Ms O'Brien mentioned convenience and what creates it.  Does she have an opinion on how we can scale up reuse and on the piece in terms of convenience?  The latter is a reality in terms of the type of lives people live.  In Ireland, one needs two people in employment to purchase a house.  Those who have children are juggling much of the time.  People are back commuting having not had to do so for more than a year.  <\/p> <p>  We need to get this legislation right.  There are elements of it on which we need to hear from the witnesses and others to make it stronger.  In the Irish experience and in the international experience, are there other elements that need to come with this in terms of work-life balance, a four-day working week, public awareness and so on?  What other elements need to come with this measure to create the environment where these types of system changes can happen?  I accept that is a broad question.<\/p> <p>  The other piece for Ms O'Brien and Mr. Schweitzer is the role of the State and its agencies in terms of being a leader in this area.  I worked in the health service for a long time.  The opportunity there to be a leader in terms of managing waste is massive in terms of the &euro;22 billion budget and the level of consumption in terms of disposables.  I worked in laboratories, where the amount of waste generated was incredible.  Is there an opportunity for the State to be a leader in this area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#J00300","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":517,"content":"<p>In terms of convenience, I agree with the Deputy.  We are preaching to the converted.  Many people will say they do not want plastic packaging.  I ran into a friend recently.  She had just purchased oranges that were packaged in a plastic bag.  When I asked her why she had not bought loose oranges she told me that the packaged ones cost 25 cents less and then she ran away from me.  She knew she should have purchased the unpackaged oranges, but it was more convenient to just grab the packaged ones.  It is very convenient to just grab a bag of onions or apples.  We need to make reuse and refill convenient.  I have given this a great deal of thought.  In zero waste shops one can bring one's own container and refill it, but have to weigh the container and then refill it.  It is a process.  We need products to be pre-filled in reusable containers.  When one buys the product you pay for the container initially, but one can then bring it back to shop and have it replaced with a new container.  The shop will then have the used container washed and put back into use.  It will not be on the consumer to wash it; that will be done by the company.  When people are going for a coffee they often forget to bring their cups and so they opt for disposables.  We need cups that can be rented.  One buys it and return it.  We need agreement on a standardised cup.  Instead of putting a cup into a rubbish bin, one would return it to, say, Starbucks or Insomnia, where it would be washed and returned to the pooling system.  We need to make it easy.  Likewise for takeaways.  I was in Howth on the bank holiday in June, where I saw a lot of compostable packaging and paper bags being disposed of in normal rubbish bins.  The containers I am holding up are reusable polypropylene containers.  They can be used hundreds of times.  They are really good in-wash and they are easily stacked.  In one of the towns in San Francisco, instead of having rubbish bins on the street they have used container bins.  People throw the used containers into the bin and they are then picked up and sent to the industrial washing facility and returned to the caf&eacute;s to be used again.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right that we need to make reusable more convenient so that is almost the same experience.

I do not know how well this has worked because it is a very challenging thing to do.  We spend a lot of time telling consumers that they need to change the way they consume, but even public procurement Departments have a tough job in identifying what is the most sustainable choice when it comes to fitting out an office space or buying equipment.  For this reason, there needs to be some investment in the human resources in public procurement such that we would have people trained in sustainable purchasing.  We need to have sustainable contracts, but one really needs people trained in buying sustainably and setting up sustainable systems.  It is not something that is straightforward, but the State, in terms of its budget, clearly has a role to play.  <\/p> <p>  Something should also be set for corporate procurement.  When it comes to public private partnerships and the competition between the public and the private sector, the private sector also has a role to play.  When it comes to transport and education more often than not it is private companies who are competing and offering these services.  They should also play their role in purchasing sustainably.  They are also major buyers of products.  It is important not to forget that side.  Municipalities are already under pressure with their budgets, whereas there are many big companies who are also providing public services who should also follow these rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Pierre Schweitzer"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Schweitzer.<\/p><p>I want to follow on from Deputy O'Rourke's question.

The Deputy mentioned that he worked in our health service, which, in the course of its work, generates a lot of waste.

On procurement, one of the first things we need to get right is the requirement to include quality criteria.  Both price and quality must be considered, rather than the approach of only going after the lowest price as the first choice.  I must express an interest in this regard in that I have brought forward legislation pushing for the price-quality ratio approach and the insertion of quality criteria.  Having quality criteria will allow us not only to set minimum standards but to award bidders who go above and beyond in taking the standards further than what we might look to as a minimum.<\/p> <p>  I am particularly interested in the health and food consumption area.  One of the key issues that arises in this regard is hygiene and sterilisation.  I have heard interesting things about industrial washing and other alternatives to intensive packaging in terms of the sterile requirement in the health area.  There are areas of health plastics need, such as in the disability sector, which are ongoing and will continue.  In both food and health, there is a heavy reliance on plastic packaging for reasons of sterile assurance.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by what the witnesses said about industrial washing.  In terms of the service coming to Ireland, and looking to services that are operating elsewhere, how can we ensure such services are just not just available on contract to large-scale manufacturers of particular items - milk and water were mentioned - but are also accessible on a small scale?  I am thinking, for example, of the local food shop that wants to recycle the juice bottles it sells every day, usually to the same customers.  The packaging of that kind of takeaway food could be replaced by something that can be sterilised and reused.  I am very interested in any supplementary information the witnesses might have on industrial washing.<\/p> <p>  Much of the focus in these discussions tends to be on the waste aspect but I want to roll it back to the production side.  The key point in this regard relates to the question of obsolescence and irresponsible production.  Mr. Schweitzer mentioned in his presentation that Italy has successfully fined a company for breaches in this area.  While there has been a difficulty with the definitions in France, it would be useful to hear how it worked out in Italy and what we can learn from that.  I would also like to hear his thoughts on how we can get a measure like a restriction on obsolescence right.  If there is too much of a bar to prove bad intent, do we instead need to look at something like, where we are systematically seeing a product that is reaching the end of its user life after two or three years, that would be a signal?  If companies are complained to a certain number of times about the same flaw in a design product and they do not respond, does that become evidence of a failure to address obsolescence?  I am trying to see how we might deal with that aspect, because it is key.<\/p> <p>  Another area that is crucial is our consumption of precious minerals and resources.  When we look to the other end of the value chain, the damage done in terms of mineral extraction is immense.  There are aspects of mineral extraction referred to in the Bill.  Do we need an extra level, such as a disincentive relating to reckless or excessive use of the kinds of minerals and other things that are going into our microchips and so forth?  Currently, the European Union seems to be heavily weighted towards a focus on the waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEE, directive, which applies to white goods and electrical disposables recycling.  Facilities for the disposals of such products are available right across Ireland.  However, this approach is very much about products that reach the end of their working life in somebody's kitchen and are then sent straight to recycling.  Is there potential to use that existing infrastructure to insert greater monitoring of obsolescence where it is observed, for instance, that too many of the same items are turning up?  Is there scope for further repair or reuse incentives to be incorporated into the system?  There might be a need for a much higher levy on the excessive use of minerals that are extracted.  I would appreciate the witnesses' thoughts on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#K00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":526,"content":"<p>Regarding industrial washing, I understand equipment is being purchased by the Department and there will be a Government-owned washing facility.

A key point in this regard is that we need to standardise packaging to ensure that whatever is used in a small shop, for example, can also be used in a large shop and can subsequently be sent anywhere.

It used to be that when one bought a product, the disposal or recycling fee was set out separately, but it is now incorporated into the price.  The WEEE system has potential for a much better repair element but, right now, the stuff is just being chucked into large containers, damaging it in the process and leaving no possibility of repair.  We need a better collection process in order that some of the items disposed of under the WEEE process can be repaired rather than recycled.  Repair is higher on the waste hierarchy than recycling.<\/p> <p>  Monitoring obsolescence is not my area of expertise.  Mr. Schweitzer might comment on that.  Many of the precious metals used in microchips are coming from war-torn areas.  I do not know how that can be resolved.

I strongly refute that and am happy to submit evidence on it.  In fact, many reusable materials like glass and steel can be washed in industrial washing facilities at very high temperatures - much higher than the temperatures possible with most single-use materials &ndash; which shows there is a possibility for them to be just as, if not more, hygienically clean than the single-use options.  As I said, I am happy to submit evidence on this.  Our partners at Zero Waste Europe have collected a significant amount of information on the topic.<\/p> <p>  I have an English translation of the Italian ruling the Senator referred to, which I am happy to share with her, but I do not know the particulars about how the authorities there managed to prosecute the company in question.

I understand the minimum period in the EU is two years but there is the possibility to extend it to three.<\/p><p>There is a burden of proof, which describes the amount of time consumers have to prove that the fault in the product is due to the manufacture.  This can also be extended to two years.  This is something to look into because it at least extends slightly the period of time in which consumers have some control over the products they own.  Admittedly, however, this is only a three-year period and many products, if we think about laptops or washing machines, should really last much longer than this.  It is, however, something that could be worth looking at.<\/p><p> Mineral extraction is a very important topic because if we think about the transition we all need to make time now in moving towards climate neutrality, we will need an awful lot of minerals and materials to produce renewable energy batteries and electrification.

I get the sense from my colleagues on the committee that we could spend all day talking about it.  The whole topic is fascinating because of the breadth of issues it covers.  I note both witnesses stated they watched the committee's discussion last week.  From my perspective, and as Senator Higgins just said, this is about manufacturing.  We want to reduce the volume of unnecessary waste at whatever stage of its life it is discarded and, hopefully, reuse it in many different ways.  If that is not the case, we need to ensure that the manufacturing industry is thinking about the longevity of the product it is manufacturing and, ultimately, how it can be reused, recycled or repurposed.  I would like to hear both witnesses' thoughts on how, in the circular economy, we can tackle that aspect in the proposed legislation, bearing in mind that, realistically, much of the stuff we are talking about is probably imported.  While it may be a moot point for some manufacturers, those that are located here would have to abide by that.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the witnesses' comments about strengthening the wording.  I believe Senator Pauline O'Reilly spoke about this last week and I totally agree.  We owe it to the next generation and the generations that come after it to ensure this is strengthened.  Ms O'Brien made the point that legislation must be for down the road; it is not for the here and now.  This committee, of all the committees in the Oireachtas, is of that view.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Brien also mentioned setting a percentage target for achieving this.  I would be interested to hear, for instance, about manufacturing and reusing or repurposing products.  Ms O'Brien said initially that she did not want a paltry target of 2%.  I ask both witnesses to talk us through the various elements and what kinds of targets they believe we need to aim for to make meaningful change.<\/p> <p>  The other aspect I would like to touch on is contamination.  By and large, the majority of people, regardless of their family make-up or product consumption, are eager to play their part.  Unfortunately, contamination is not necessarily an act they are carrying out on purpose.  Some of this is the result of misinformation.  We are all aware of what kinds of plastics can be recycled.  Contamination happens across the board, be it in what we would call our general waste bin or our compostable and recycling bins.  That must be tackled, so we will have to be strong on education and fund it in the legislation.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of contamination, Ms O'Brien spoke correctly about the lack of compostability of some products that are labelled as such.  That is a broad issue to discuss but she is right.  The Houses of the Oireachtas should be leaders in that.  I hope that VOICE Ireland will continue its engagement with the Houses of the Oireachtas to try to tackle that issue.<\/p> <p>  I will address a few other points made by Ms O'Brien.  I note she is from Michigan.  I am not sure which part but I must commend her on that.  That is good news and I would like to hear more about it.  She mentioned people who retain products.  She is speaking to somebody who has a cupboard full of plastic containers that are kept for lunch boxes and God knows what else.  Friends slag me over the number of Calpol medicine spoons I keep.  I do not know how sick I going to be but I retain these things for a long time.  What that points out, however, is the volume of excess products that we collect, which could either go for recycling or be repurposed at home.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Brien mentioned that \"producers must take responsibility for designing out waste in products and packaging.\"  I mentioned the medicine spoons purely as an example for people who may be viewing this debate.  We do not have an option to buy the product in question without a plastic spoon.  That is where we need to get to with this legislation.  Ms O'Brien also mentioned her friend with bananas in a bag.  I wonder if she is still a friend after Ms O'Brien accosted her in the shop.  As Ms O'Brien said, however, her friend made a comment about the cost and said it was cheaper to go for that option.  As with our discussions on previous legislation about just transition, we must look at the cost of this.  Single individuals and the elderly try to buy as few products as possible to ensure the products stay fresh but sometimes that is simply not an option.  We need to look at that.<\/p> <p>  Senator Higgins's made a point about the waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, return scheme, which has been a resounding success.  If we were to model our circular economy on that system, I believe it would work very well.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Schweitzer said he watched our discussion last week and I commend him on doing so.  Will he elaborate a little on extended producer responsibility?  Touching on what I was saying earlier about manufacturing, I believe that is something we need to examine further.  I might come back in later on the deposit return scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#L00500","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  In terms of targets, if we just say we want a 3% reuse target and do not say, \"You have to do that\", or \"This is how you do it\", it will be the tragedy of the commons as no one will do it or take responsibility.  What I could see is that in different sectors, for instance, hospitality, all restaurants that offer in-house dining must have reusable options 75% of the time or a takeaway service must have 50% reusable containers by 2030.<\/p><p>We need to have a target per sector and maybe ramp it up over a period of years, such as having a 50% target for fruit and vegetables package-free and 50% of cosmetics.  We may want to be that detailed because if we are not, we are going to have free riders, and if no one has to take responsibility, then no one will.  That is the one concern I have.<\/p><p> In terms of contamination, in 2017 we did the recycling ambassadors programme, where we launched the first recycling list.  We had 30 ambassadors throughout the country and it was funded by the Department.  We ran 700 recycling workshops throughout the country and reached 25,000 people face to face.  Everyone said it was fantastic.  They thanked us and said it really explains things and takes the mystery out of what goes into what bin.  We could do something similar again but, for me, contamination is not only food, it is also putting the wrong material in the wrong bin.  That also goes back to the producers in that they need to simplify their packaging.  There are laminates which have multilayers, and even the punnets for products like tomatoes have plastic which looks like polyethylene terephthalate, PET, but it actually has two or three layers and might have PET, then polypropylene or something else between it, which might be cheaper.  We need to simplify the packaging to make it easier.<\/p><p> I know many people look at the waste industry and blame it for not being able to recycle.  In fact, it is the producers who are putting this there and the waste industry is trying to figure out what to do with it.  Not only is it the contamination of food but the wrong material is going in there.<\/p><p> In terms of cost, I agree with the Deputy.  I referred to prepackaged goods.

There is a lot happening in this area in terms of what the European Commission is doing on the sustainable products initiative at the moment.  However, there are also some big challenges, and one of them is about implementation of compliance.  There is a big difficulty in following up with manufacturers and also the challenge of imported goods from overseas and online sales, and how we can tackle those aspects.

Having an Irish diplomat there to promote reuse and repair requirements for electronics would be a welcome presence.<\/p> <p>  On targets, in particular the overall target which I mentioned in regard to material footprint, there is some scientific research on this, for example, from the International Resource Panel, but the level which is seen, from looking at different papers, is around a 60% reduction in material footprint.  That is quite a vast reduction, when we think about it, but it is akin to the kind of level of ambition we need when we are talking about carbon neutrality in the economy, if we consider that 50% of emissions come from materials.  There is a close relationship in this regard.<\/p> <p>  On EPR, there is a difference between the concept of extended producer responsibility and the EPR that is actually happening.  What is happening on the ground has progressed over the years.  We saw that, at the beginning, it was enough to see the waste disappear from our front door, then it became about recycling targets, but now it is more about the overall externalities from the materials and also reducing the overall throughput of materials.  We need to rethink how this tool is being used as the quite sizeable amount of funds which it collects can enable the circular economy.  It is not straightforward because there is a whole infrastructure surrounding those systems.  There are interests and companies have invested a lot of money in the infrastructure which exists, so it is not an easy topic.  There is clearly some work to be done because, from the waste perspective, that is where the money is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Pierre Schweitzer"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":538,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#M00500","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Devlin.

I had originally put my hand up to come in about obsolescence because I had forgotten to mention it the first time around, and Deputy Devlin mentioned it, as did Senator Higgins.  There must be a lot of scope in consumer protection.  It seems some of the failures and some of the cases that have failed are around proving that the materials used were going to become obsolete, as opposed to really looking at the length of warranties and what can be done there, so we are actually putting the onus for innovation onto the companies if it is the case that the rights sit with the consumer.<\/p> <p>  I thought the point made by Ms O'Brien in regard to leasing was an interesting one.  We spoke a lot last week about the sharing economy, which has not really come up today.  This is something I passionately believe can develop and can also build community, because we do not need to own everything and we actually use most things very rarely.  If we look around our houses, they are stuffed to the gills with things we might use once a year, for example, something to take the air out of a radiator.  I brought up the example of a shovel last week because I rarely use a shovel, but I have one.  There seems to be no overall policy around developing an app or something in the digital sphere to develop a sharing economy because we need a large number of people using it for this to develop.  Any thoughts the witnesses might have or any international comparators would be very useful.<\/p><p> The final important point relating to the circular economy is rainwater harvesting.  I do not know if this is the place to bring it up but if we are not to discuss it now, we need to find a place to discuss it because, in consumption generally and in manufacturing, water is one of the great by-products that we dump, yet we do little rainwater harvesting here considering the volume of rain we have.

The examples I gave about the sale of goods directive and the role of the competition authorities could be interesting to explore.  I cannot think of other examples off the top of my head but I will try to come back to the Senator on that.<\/p> <p>  On the point about the sharing economy, I agree there is a lot of potential.  Personally, I use a tool library in Belgium, which gives me access to an amazing array of tools at very low cost.  I use it maybe once a year so it does not make sense for me to own any of them.  That is a great initiative.  However, there are also bad examples of the sharing economy and we should not just assume that the sharing economy is always more resource efficient.  If we think about Airbnb, for example, it has given people access to spaces all over the world for a low cost, it has encouraged tourism on a scale that many of us have benefited from and enjoyed, but it is also had a material impact.  If we think about scooters, and I am sure there are some in cities in Ireland, all of the studies I have seen have said they have very short lives, they are unrepairable and the batteries are not necessarily replaced and not always recycled.  They are also serviced by people with very poor contract conditions and low wages.  We cannot make the assumption that the sharing economy, especially when it is on a platform basis, will necessarily result in resource savings.  Yes, there is a lot of potential but it needs to be under the right conditions.<\/p> <p>  I do not have a comment on rainwater harvesting, which is not my area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Pierre Schweitzer"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":548,"content":"<p>On the sharing economy, there is great potential.  We trialled a library of things four years ago with the Dublin Food Co-op for its reuse month, so it was only for a month.  We had anything from knitting needles onwards but, because of insurance liability issues, we could not have any electrical goods, which was a real lost opportunity.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Senator.  The problem we had is that people had to drive quite a distance to go to the library of things.  I would like to have an online mapping exercise.  I always thought it would be a great app if I knew, in my estate, who had a ladder, who had wheelbarrow or who had a tool, and I could go to No. 24 and get a drill or go to No. 15 to get a ladder, and we could share items within the community.  I was thinking about going door-to-door to try to track it.  That would be wonderful and the question is whether people will use it.  A platform called Trello tried to do an online version but that was for money.  This can also be linked in with the civic amenities sites and there could be a sharing tool library, or it could even be linked to the actual libraries.  For example, could libraries be extended to not only lend out books but to lend out other items as well?<\/p> <p>  It all comes down to liability insurance for electrical items.  Liability seems to be an issue throughout the circular economy, from the donation of food to reuse and repair.  We need to do something about liability and that is the one area I want to emphasise.<\/p> <p>  In terms of rainwater harvesting, I used to sit on the water forum and this was a big issue for some of the folks.  It should become part of the building requirements, and building regulations should include rainwater harvesting.  We need to become more future-proofed because we just do not know what is going to happen.  Places are going to get drier, in particular Dublin.  I have two water butts in my back garden.  It would be a lot easier if that was incorporated into building systems.  In addition, for new builds, in regard to using rainwater for non-potable uses, such as washing clothes and toilets, it is much easier to build that in when the house is being built, rather than trying to retrofit it later.  In drier areas, that definitely might be something to look into.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021101400002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Mindy O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":549,"content":"<p>Senator O'Reilly is keen that we have a discussion on rainwater harvesting at some point, so we will keep that in mind.<\/p> <p>  O the issue of resource efficiency, one of the reasons we have the Bill in process is climate change and there is a related reason for controlling the volume of disposable waste that we generate.

As the Chairman said, many of these items from developing countries are cheaper and possibly poorly made, but that gives them a competitive edge against internal companies that are doing better or are more resource efficient.

First, it gives people a financial incentive to bring their bottles and cans back.  Second, those products come in a clean stream.  The Deputy was talking about contamination but when it comes in a clean stream it is much easier to recycle.  I was at the Shabra recycling facility in Monaghan.  It takes a lot of the plastics from Panda Waste and Thorntons Recycling and makes it into plastic pellets.  I went up there to look at its processes.  All the stuff goes to plants and goes through all the different permutations to separate all our green bin waste and it is baled up and sent up there.  There is about 30% contamination in our green bins and it goes up there but it still has about 15% contamination because when they compact the things together the plastic goes into some aluminium or steel and they cannot separate it so that has to go out.  If those items can be collected separately it is a much better way to recycle.  We have to reach a 90% collection target for plastic bottles under the single use plastic directive.  That target is there and that is the only way we will reach it.  Additionally, under the single use plastic directive there is a requirement for beverage companies to have 30% recycled content in their bottles.  They are trying to figure out where they can get clean recycled PET and they get it from countries with a DRS.  The beverage companies that were so opposed to a DRS in the past are now supporting it because they need to get that recycled material.  The only people who have been against it have been those in the waste industry because they see that they are losing some of the valuable material that is going into the bins as it will be siphoned off through the DRS.  If we can simplify the packaging for other items that will raise the material value of other waste.

I do not know if we are able to bring in someone from Irish Water, the county council or both to try to resolve the situation.  In 2004, Mr. Coskeran and the council came to an agreement that once all the servicing was done, the council would take the estate in question in charge.  A similar situation is happening across the country but this is the petition we have in front of us.

I am deeply committed to advocating for myself and others who have disabilities.  Today, I hope to raise awareness of the importance of changing places facilities and how it meets a basic need, and right, for persons with disabilities to be included in every aspect of society.<\/p> <p>  I would like to give the committee a brief background.  Almost ten years ago, in 2012, a young disability advocate, Ailis Healy, supported by her mother, Ann Healy, set up a Facebook page to highlight the lack of appropriate changing facilities in Ireland after becoming aware of the Changing Places lobbying movement that was taking place in the UK, and realising this could provide a solution to allow her equal access to everyday activities.  Ann Healy is one of the founders of the Changing Places Ireland working group.  From the first meeting in November 2014, this group focused on introducing changing places toilet facilities to public places such as shopping centres, libraries, and sporting arenas across the country.<\/p> <p>  Changing Places Ireland now consists of people with disabilities, parents, and organisations working in the disability space, including the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Central Remedial Clinic, the Irish Wheelchair Association, Enable Ireland, Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland, InterAcT at Trinity College Dublin and Inclusion Ireland.  The groups has worked tirelessly and there are now 17 changing places toilet facilities in the country.  Sadly, this reflects poorly on Ireland as England has over 1,600 changing places facilities and new legislation will make changing places toilets mandatory there in new public buildings from 2021.<\/p> <p>  Changing places toilet facilities are designed to provide access to localities and enhance the dignity, health, safety and comfort of someone who may need extra support and additional equipment during personal care tasks.  Changing places toilet facilities also offer added safety and support features for assistants.  When I became involved with the Changing Places Ireland committee, I had been an activist for this cause for some time.  I had done many radio interviews raising awareness and I presented at a national sharing day for the HSE on the importance of these facilities.  I have dreams and aspirations.  Having a disability does not mean these aspirations are less important than those of anyone else listening today.  I would like to meet a partner, go to the cinema or nightclub with my friends, meet up with my family members and their children in restaurants or plan a weekend away.  I would like to do ordinary things in ordinary places.  Without access to facilities like changing places, I am excluded from living a full and equal life as a valued citizen.  As a woman in my own right, I want to maximise my independence and be included in my local community.<\/p> <p>  The world has experienced restrictions for the past two years due to Covid-19.  People found it very difficult and their mental health suffered.  I and others like me have lived with restrictions all our lives.  I have not had the opportunity to access my local school for my education.  I was excluded from further education and society in general due to lack of accessible facilities, of which the basic one is to use a toilet.  The Government needs to recognise the importance of access for people with disabilities and give support to legislation and funding.  It should now follow the example of England and change Irish building regulations to make such toilets mandatory in certain public buildings.<\/p> <p>  I am involved in a Government working group that involves the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and other stakeholders.  This group was established in December 2020 to examine the provision of a changing places toilet in certain buildings.<\/p><p>It has been a wonderful experience so far.  I have been included at every step of the process.  Mr. Paul McDermott from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has been respectful and inclusive of people with disabilities and he values our opinions.<\/p><p> Following a lot of consultation and meetings which I participated in, the working group has now recommended the types and sizes of buildings where a changing places toilet should be required, along with the technical requirements, that is, equipment, room size and layout.<\/p><p> The proposals of the working group will require changes to the Building Regulations 1997 to 2021 and to Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use.  This process has been inclusive from the beginning and our voices have been heard.<\/p><p> Draft documents from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage have been finalised.  A focus group of people with disabilities and I have been consulted about the easy read document before it goes to public consultation for which it is almost ready.<\/p><p> This progress is very welcome; we are delighted that the voice of people with disabilities is part of this process, and we continue to advocate for this essential change in the year ahead.  The aim of our campaign is to promote the inclusion of people through providing changing places toilet facilities nationwide in places accessed by the public.  Thousands of people need changing places toilet facilities to go about their daily lives undertaking the day-to-day activities that many people take for granted.  Without changing places toilet facilities available throughout the country people with disabilities like myself are denied a basic human right and continue to be excluded from everyday life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Smith","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Smith.

Believe it or not, and it is a surprise to many people, Part M of the building regulations only requires housing to be visitable for a wheelchair user but not liveable, that is, where you must provide access to a habitable room and a toilet at entry level, and all you have to do is consider a three-bedroom semi-detached house with a small toilet under the stairs and the bedrooms upstairs - visitable but not liveable.  A consequence of Part M is the lack of availability of wheelchair liveable social housing and private housing in the community, resulting in wheelchair users being homeless, involuntarily living with family and friends, in nursing homes as the Ombudsman referred to, and not having control over their lives as well as not having choices equal to others in society.<\/p> <p>  This review of Part M that we are calling for should take the form of a public consultation process so that disabled people in the first instance, together with disability organisations and sectoral partners, and all people impacted by the lack of suitable wheelchair liveable housing, can have their voices heard.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Wheelchar Association is a community of people with physical disabilities across Ireland in every community founded on the belief that everyone should be able to live a life of choice and equality.  The services we provide support people with physical disabilities to live independently, and our campaigns demand equal rights and opportunities for people with physical disabilities.  The work of the association is underpinned by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which was ratified by Ireland in 2018.  Article 19, in particular, recognises the right of disabled people to live in the community and to have the opportunity to choose their place of residence - not have it forced on them.  Furthermore, Article 28 includes the right of disabled people to access public housing programmes.<\/p> <p>  People who have a mobility impairment and who are, or who may become, full-time wheelchair users require appropriately designed and future-proofed housing that is located within mixed tenure sustainable housing developments not set apart; housing that is perceived to be safe and in a location of people's choosing; and, housing situated in close proximity to services, transport, and family and friends.  Unfortunately, new dwellings are merely designed to be visitable under Ireland's building regulations.<\/p> <p>  For example, earlier this year, following a campaign which we ran called Think Ahead, Think Housing, we were contacted by a developer inquiring about our interest in purchasing 16 new apartments proposed to be built in an existing development in Dublin because we are an approved housing body as well.  The existing impressive development had six blocks of apartments with more than 100 apartments in total, all of which were compliant with the Part M of the building regulations and all of them one bedroom apartments. There was also a primary care centre on site and plans for a nursing home, which was about to start, and retail units.  It was a lovely development.  Planning permission was granted for a further 16 apartments, the ones in this case which the developer was offering the Irish Wheelchar Association, all of which also were one bedroom Part M apartments.  Effectively, the whole development excluded wheelchair users, other than if they wanted to visit, of course.  They brought us to another site, which also was a lovely site and strategically located, and the planning application was for the same - more than 100 one bedroom Part M apartments also.  These also were totally exclusive.<\/p> <p>  According to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission report, \"Discrimination and Inequality in Housing in Ireland, June 2018\", people with disabilities are more than twice as likely to report discrimination relating to housing; over 1.6 times more likely to live in poor conditions such as damp housing, lacking central heating or in neighbourhoods where there are issues; and, more than one in four homeless people has a disability.<\/p> <p>  Technical guidance documents were first introduced in 1991 to provide guidance, in this case, with respect to Part M of the building regulations.  Originally the guidance had an emphasis on disability but did not include dwellings.  There was a review in 2000, and it was expanded to include dwellings making them visitable but did not provide information on designing homes for people using wheelchairs or lifetime adaptable housing.<\/p> <p>  Part M was further expanded in 2010 - which is the current one we have - to include some sensory impairments and catered for age, size, and disability with reference only to universal design, but there were many areas of accessibility, including universal design, which were not addressed in this review at the time.<\/p> <p>  Visitable dwellings are the mandatory baseline for developers.  That is what they must adhere to when constructing housing units in Ireland under the building regulations - only visitable.<\/p><p>In the UK, which Ms Smith referred to earlier, there are three standards, namely, visitable dwellings, accessible and adaptable dwellings, and wheelchair user dwellings.  We fall well short of the UK.  The aim of the new Government housing policy Housing for All is that, \"Everyone in the State should have access to a home to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and in the right place, offering a high quality of life.\"  If social and private houses continue to be built to the current building regulations standards of Part M, there will be no provision made for wheelchair-liveable homes and local government will have to continue to retrofit the existing stock, including new houses, and will also have to increase the budget for the disabled persons housing grant.  I think we would all agree that this is a foolish and false economy.  The Government must review Part M of the building regulations to ensure wheelchair-liveable homes are included in the 9,500 new homes that are planned annually for the next five years.  What an opportunity that is.  Money does not seem to be an issue but Part M is very clearly a barrier to wheelchair-liveable houses across Ireland.  The cost of building homes to a higher accessibility standard is lower at design stage than having to retrofit at a later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Cunningham","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present today.  My name is Bernadette Egan.  I am a registered architect, a member of the universal design task force and an elected council member of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland.  I hold a master of laws degree in international and comparative disability law and policy.  I am here today on a personal basis as I am a disabled person with lived experience of the accessibility of the built environment.  My submission includes a brief outline of my own experiences, the challenges of the built environment, and my recommendations for implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, regarding Article 9 on accessibility.<\/p> <p>  Some time ago, I, like many architects, designed for compliance with the building regulations Part M, access and use, from 2010, believing it would ensure \"Adequate provision ... for people to access and use a building, its facilities and its environs.\"  It all seemed to make sense and as a busy architect, I did not question it.  Then one day, my circumstances changed and I gained a new perspective.  I joined the 1 billion disabled people worldwide, including 640,000 in Ireland, which is currently the worse country in western Europe to be disabled.  What had made sense suddenly became nonsense.  I discovered the hard way that the built environment is not adequately accessible at all.  Life became a daily obstacle course, and instead of going about my business like everyone else, I face difficulties with the activities of living that most people take for granted.  I need to confront a whole range of issues to shop for food, visit a bank, attend a meeting, have lunch in a restaurant, use a toilet or socialise in a bar.  I lost my human rights and became a second-class citizen.  Will the entrance door be too heavy and awkward to open, or is the platform lift out of order?  Will I need to search for a key for the \"accessible\" toilet?  Will it be too small for my motorised wheelchair?  Will I need to jostle the bins or will I get hit over the head by a loose drop-down rail?  If there is a fire, will I wait for someone to try to find me and slide me on a deckchair down a steep staircase?  These are just a small sample of the questions I need to answer before leaving home as I mentally map out my day.  As an architect, I feel let down and betrayed by the built environment that surrounds me.<\/p> <p>  Disability is part of humanity.  Despite the first accessibility standards being created in the USA in 1961, they were not introduced in Ireland until 1992.  Today, despite extensive legislation and policy, the lack of accessibility of the built environment is widespread.  The biggest challenge disabled people encounter arises from attitudinal barriers, not from their impairments, as there is a common misunderstanding that buildings are accessible.  There is also an unspoken assumption that accessible buildings are difficult and expensive to build, but this is not necessarily the case.  As far back as 1993, the Council of Europe said that \"A complete change in attitude must be achieved in order that disabilities are property recognized and integrated into the discipline of building\".  In 1996, it was recommended that the Government appoint a national committee to monitor progress of access to the physical environment, ensuring enforcement of Part M and that universal design, UD, becomes the overarching principle to guide all relevant legislation, policy and practice.  In a 2007 report, the Government committed to developing and enforcing higher accessibility standards.  It emphasised that any revision to Part M would need to be comprehensive and address poor compliance, \"current loopholes, minimum design criteria and inconsistencies\" with houses being \"habitable\" rather than merely \"visitable\".  However, none of these proposals happened.  In 2014, the UNCRPD committee clarified that denial of access to the physical environment is a clearly defined prohibited act of discrimination.  In 2018, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission reported discrimination against disabled people accessing housing.  Disabled people in Ireland are prevented from enjoying some of their fundamental human rights, such as the right to live independently, seek employment, or enjoy culture and leisure, as they continue to be left out of society by exclusive building design that does not consider users' age, size and ability.  An accessible built environment is simply better for everyone, whether disabled or not.<\/p> <p>  The UNCRPD sets out legal duties from a human rights perspective, with disabled people treated on an equal basis with others.  I have completed a 16,000-word research paper that identified relevant legislation and policy, examined the four main challenges to accessibility and explored Norway as a case study and possible template for Ireland.  I made several recommendations.  First, human rights need to become part of the design process from the beginning.  Universal design must form part of the project quality assurance, with essential reviews and inspections, ensuring that accessibility is fully addressed throughout buildings' life cycles.  Second, the world's only statutory centre of excellence in universal design, CEUD, at the National Disability Authority should fulfil its full statutory role and be developed and expanded with disabled people to become a global leader promoting a positive international image of a progressive, inclusive country and ensuring an accessible built environment for all.  Third, the NDA needs to fulfil its full statutory role and become an independent monitoring body of the accessibility of the built environment, together with the establishment of a new enforcement mechanism with dedicated funding, time-specific deadlines and appropriate sanctions.  Fourth, Part M should be thoroughly revised and updated with the participation of disabled people.  There needs to be just one clear set of legally enforceable accessibility standards with legislation, education and training to implement this effectively.  Fifth, a specific national built environment accessibility advisory committee must be established to successfully progress accessibility with a high level of engagement with the disabled community.  \"Nothing about us without us\" is the disabled community's slogan and its effective and meaningful participation and involvement is mandatory as there is no substitution for lived experience.  Sixth, the centre of excellence in universal design must fulfil its statutory remit and universal design must be put on the curricula of vocational and third level institutions as a mandatory subject in the schools of built architecture, as well as being at the centre of courses and activities provided for the continuing professional development of all built environment practitioners.  Seventh, the CEUD should fulfil its statutory remit with a national awareness campaign to promote and highlight universal design and the right of disabled people to access the built environment, and disabled people could effectively deliver disability awareness training.  Eighth, the optional protocol must be ratified as soon as possible so that disabled people have an essential international redress mechanism.<\/p> <p>  Fulfilling the legitimate human right of disabled people to access and use the built environment will lead to essential improvements in the well-being of the entire population.  Designing for diversity is simply designing for equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernadette Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":641,"content":"<p>I thank everybody for their opening remarks.

Mr. Cunningham feels that the standards should be higher.  I note that the target seems to be 30% for all new dwellings to incorporate universal design.  I wish to ask the witnesses representing the Irish Wheelchair Association two quick questions about that.  Is that happening, and what percentage do they feel it should be at?  Thirty per cent seems pretty low to me.<\/p><p> What Ms Egan said about the Norwegian experience sounds really interesting, and it sounds like she has done quite a lot of research and comparisons on it.  Could she give the committee further information on that or perhaps send us on a copy of what she has pulled together on it?  I was quite struck by two things she said.  The main thrust of her contribution seemed to be that there is discrimination in respect of rights through building design.  That is a really clear and powerful statement.  One thing she said - I wrote it down - was that accessible built design is better for everyone, whether disabled or not.  That is very powerful and sums up exactly what all the witnesses and all the members of the committee are trying to achieve.<\/p><p> As for Ms Smith's contribution, I am quite familiar with Changing Places Ireland.  Councillor Vicki Casserly has done an awful lot of work on that in our local authority, South Dublin County Council, and we are delighted to have a recently installed changing places facility there.  This policy needs to be implemented nationwide.  I would like to hear how Ms Smith feels about the possibility of changing places toilet facilities being made mandatory nationwide in a similar way to England, which I think has already done that.  Ms Smith alluded to places where the facilities have worked well.<\/p><p> Maybe I could get just those three questions answered.

There was a question about the 30% and whether it is being delivered.  The one fact we have from experience is the shortage of delivery.  There are some houses delivered.  Going back to need, however, we actually do not know what the need is.  Again, that is a result of the blind eye to disability over the decades.  We know from the 2020 summary of housing assessment need, which is collated by all the local authorities, that 8% of the need is for people with disabilities, but how many of them require wheelchair-liveable housing is not known.  The figures do not exist.  They are divided into physical, sensory, intellectual, mental health and so on in terms of disability, but there could be people under the physical disability section who do not use wheelchairs and many people in the intellectual disability section who use wheelchairs and require liveable housing in that sense.  That is a big problem.<\/p> <p>  Another challenge for us all is the people who are not planning ahead.  We see from the analysis from the Housing Agency that the length of time people are on waiting lists has increased for people with disabilities.  You could be five years, ten years or more waiting for a house, so there is a long time waiting.  We in the Irish Wheelchair Association have run a campaign this year called Think Ahead, Think Housing because of the under-representation of people with disabilities on the approved housing list and because people do not tend to plan ahead sufficiently in the knowledge that they could be waiting five years or ten years.  Many people wait until they need a house.  To give the committee one example, we have met with the HSE and are working with a local authority on a housing development very successfully and very positively.  We will have a percentage of wheelchair-accessible houses within that development, although maybe only about six, to put it in context.  We linked in with the HSE in that case to plan for the personal supports that are required.  This was recently - about one or two months ago, maybe.  Immediately, the HSE identified 22 people who required wheelchair-liveable housing that it was providing in its services.  We asked whether they were approved for social housing and whether they had applied.  Nobody knew.  They went and checked.  Twenty-one of the 22 people had not applied for social housing and they needed it.

The need is there; it is not being met.  People are homeless, they are living with their parents and they do not have control over their lives.

If my turn on the housing list comes, I have to get an occupational therapy report and the house is designed specific to my needs, which may be only an en suite bathroom, but the rest of the house would not necessarily be accessible to everybody.  It is a matter of the responses at the spoke level.  There are no houses there for turnaround if people decide to move from Galway to Dublin or look for employment or go to college or whatever other changes.  There are no options there for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Cunningham"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":648,"content":"<p>Does anybody else want to come in on Deputy Higgins's points?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#E00600","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":649,"content":"<p>Yes.  I will discuss them briefly.  As for the Norway case study I looked at, I looked at many countries and Norway actively promotes the universal design concept and practice and recognises universal design as an expression of a value put on equality in society.  It has also been part of Norway's national policies and strategies, included in 63 laws and regulations and encompassed in practice in several sectors of society.  It is both an enforceable legal standard and a minimum standard.  There are a lot of lessons to be learned from Norway.  I can send the committee on lots of information.  There are good things and also difficulties Norway has in achieving what it wants to do, so it is an interesting case to look at.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Higgins commented on accessibility being for everyone.  Today we are talking about disability but, clearly, a cross-sector of society needs an accessible built environment.  Whether it is a woman with a child, a man pushing a buggy or older people with crutches, various people across the board have various impairments over their lifetimes, and it is important that everything is accessible to everyone on an equal basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernadette Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":650,"content":"<p>Ms Smith, do you want to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#E00800","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":651,"content":"<p>Ms Smith and I, as her advocate, will both answer that question if that is okay.

During Covid, when many public toilets were closed, we all experienced a bit of what Ms Smith experiences daily.  Anytime we went out, even to do the shopping, we had to plan to make sure we would not be caught short.  We got a bit of an understanding of what Ms Smith goes through.  I congratulate her on her work.  From reading some of the information she provided to us, it is outrageous that people have to be changed on the floor of a toilet.  No one would want to imagine lying on the floor, in even the cleanest public toilet, for any reason.  It is essential that all public buildings, going forward, include changing places toilets as mandatory.<\/p> <p>  Following on from Deputy Higgins's question, Mr. Cunningham said he was unsure as to the need for wheelchair accessible homes.  Coming at this matter from the other angle, what is the supply of wheelchair accessible homes in both the private market, to rent and buy, and the local authorities?  Do we know how many people are in need of these?  Considering the number of people under the age of 65 years in nursing homes and living in congregated settings, when it is proposed to move them into community housing - many of them will need wheelchair accessible homes.  Will it be possible to meet that need?<\/p> <p>  Do developers and architects understand the ethos of universal design?  Is there national consistency in the implementation of accessible housing?  Alternatively, does the interpretation exist that only the minimum needs to be done?  If this is the case, is that due to a lack of understanding, for financial reasons or otherwise?  That question is directed to the IWA, or Ms Egan can answer it as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#F00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":655,"content":"<p>Who wishes to respond to Deputy Tully?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#F00300","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":656,"content":"<p>I will answer some of those questions.  The Deputy asked about the availability of accessible liveable homes in local authorities and on the private market.  The simple answer is that the supply is not there.  We did a project during the week using <i>daft.ie<\/i>to see what wheelchair liveable houses are available.  We are delighted to see a filter on Daft to search for wheelchair accessible houses and I will go through some examples, of which there were quite a few available.  In Cork, there are nine properties available to rent, including six two-storey houses, two small apartments and one large apartment that costs &euro;2,000 a month to rent.  The six two-storey houses and the small apartments are not wheelchair liveable.  There were 24 houses available to buy in Cork advertised as wheelchair liveable houses.  They include 21 two-storey houses that are not wheelchair liveable, one bungalow at &euro;300,000, and two small apartments that are not wheelchair liveable.  When we looked at photographs of the houses, it was apparent they were not wheelchair liveable.  The situation is similar in Cork city.  Two apartments were listed as wheelchair accessible for rent at present for &euro;2,485 and &euro;3,485 per month.  There are ten houses available to buy, including seven two-storey houses that are not wheelchair liveable.  There is one ground floor apartment with steps up to the front door that is advertised as wheelchair accessible.  The shower is over the bath which is not wheelchair liveable.<br\/><br\/>I could go through the whole list across the country.  Members know this is happening in their own counties.  It is not the fault of <i>daft.ie<\/i>,, the seller or the buyer.  It is the fault of the building regulations because they do not provide guidance for wheelchair liveable houses.  The basic necessity should be that they are wheelchair liveable, meaning a wheelchair can get in the front door.  People might say a house is wheelchair accessible when in fact it is not.  Every area must be accessible to wheelchair users.  If a mother is in a wheelchair, she needs to be able to get into the house, go into her kitchen and cook her children's dinner, get into the utility to do the washing, and get into all the bedrooms just like any mother would.  If people here - God forbid - had to use a wheelchair tomorrow morning, would they be able to live in the house they live in today?  I would not be able to.  I would probably have to put a bed into the living room, which happens in many cases.  For permanent wheelchair users, houses are not designed to be wheelchair liveable and we need to change that.  We need a review of the building regulations so that there is a stock of wheelchair liveable houses available in local authorities and the private sector to provide people with choices.  I will hand over to Mr. O'Herlihy to answer some of the Deputy's other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosaleen Lally"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I will answer the Deputy's question on whether designers and developers are implementing universal design houses.  At present, as Mr. Cunningham and Ms Lally have said, designers, architects and builders are designing houses to meet the requirements of Part M of the second schedule of the building regulations.  Most designers will use technical guidance document M, TGDM, and the guidance in TGDM 2010 only requires the dwelling to be visitable.  This means that a person can approach the main entrance to a house, go into a habitable room, such as a living or dining room, and there is a requirement that a small WC is provided, generally on the ground floor, which a wheelchair user can use.  In principal, houses are designed to allow someone come to a house to have a cup of tea or sit in the living room and socialise etc.  Unfortunately, the designers and developers will only design to meet the requirements of the building regulations and use the minimum guidance, unless otherwise advised.  There seems to be confusion between the local authorities and the approved housing bodies on what levels of universal design should be achieved when going beyond the minimum requirements of the building regulation.<\/p> <p>  I have seen situations in which a designer or developer seeks advice, and we ask what advice the local authority has given on what standards or what guidance should be used.  Unfortunately, the local authorities themselves do not know and are unable to give substantial guidance.  There is no consistency among local authorities on what guidance should be used for addressing universal design.  To sum the situation up, designers and developers will only meet the requirements of Part M of the regulations, and they will use technical guidance document M, which only provides for visitable housing.  It does not mean we will create wheelchair accessible houses or adaptable houses in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin O'Herlihy"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":658,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Cunningham.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#F00600","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":659,"content":"<p>A retired colleague rang me recently from Carlow to tell me that his daughter queued for and bought a house based on the plans, without having seen it.<\/p><p>That is what is happening for many people, and it is, as Mr. O'Herlihy said, at just the basic requirement.  That is a private purchase.  When it comes to social housing, very often developers have a big tract of land, they get planning permission for development, potentially they could build the houses as well, and then they sell them to an approved housing provider, as its part in housing, which just takes what is going, so there is no inclusion for wheelchair-accessible housing on that front.  That has a big impact.  It is different if an approved housing body is designing and building itself, but even when it is doing that and it has its own design team, it is the building regulations it refers to.<\/p><p> On the question around nursing homes, as members will be aware, the Ombudsman report Wasted Lives came out recently and it was so upsetting to watch and to listen to the videos and voices of the experiences of people who were interviewed in nursing homes at the time.  It took the wind out of me.  In that report the HSE confirmed it was supporting 1,300 people under the age of 65 in to live in private nursing homes.  There is a piece of work being done on that at the moment.  We are involved with the HSE in a working group to try to work out pathways going forward.  However, you can have all the meetings in the world you want, but unless the building regulations are changed, the houses will not be there other than on a bespoke basis for meeting people.  If every one of the 1,300 people wanted to get out of the nursing home, what would that say?<\/p><p> To make that more concrete, a recent example, and she has agreed to our sharing the story, is a 48-year-old lady who had a stroke when she was 40.  She spent the past seven years or more in a nursing home with people who had dementia and with older people.  She spent most of her time in her room.  The reason she was there was because there were no alternatives for her and she had no family in the area either.  By chance one of our houses became vacant.  It was fully wheelchair-accessible.  She has been a tenant there for the past number of months.<\/p><p> I had the privilege of meeting this lady last month.  One of the questions I asked her was what difference this had made to her life?  The response was, the silence - just the silence, with no bells ringing, no doors banging, no trolleys in the corridor, and no staff or other residents shouting in the corridors.  Imagine that the silence was the biggest difference in having a home of your own.<\/p><p> Another question I asked was what was her favourite part of the house?  She pointed to the kitchen, saying she can cook her favourite food, which is waffles, when she wants and how she wants.  The third thing that was so obvious from her experience was that she had a dog.  The love and friendship between the two of them, you would nearly bring it home with you.  Ms Lally would have had discussions with her before the house came along and she was on about this dog, and Ms Lally said to forget about the dog until we got the house.  That is how basic it is.<\/p><p> That lady spent seven years in a nursing home because there was no available wheelchair-accessible housing for her to have a life.

The clients will only go for compliance with building regulations.  That is the minimum standard and the benchmark people have to design to.  It is mainly in the private sector but obviously in the public sector as well where the financial impact of design is huge.  Without the change in building regulations, as Mr. Cunningham said, it is not going to happen, no matter how much wishful thinking we have or how many teachers in universal design we have.  If it is not put down in the regulations, then it will not happen, unfortunately.<\/p> <p>  I wish to confirm what Ms Lally said about the huge misconception about accessibility and what is an accessible building and accessible housing.  There is no advertising standard across the board.  As you can see on Daft, they have a tick box.  Anyone can tick a box.  I have actually visited some of these properties and you can barely get in the front door.  Some even have steps even though they are supposed to be accessible.  People do not understand what accessible is.  They do not have the lived experience of the space required to let wheelchair users such as me know how that impacts on moving around in a property or in a house.

I had to step out for ten minutes.  I hope I do not repeat a previous question.  My first question is for Changing Places Ireland, and I thank Ms Richardson for highlighting the importance of fully accessible facilities and their impact on the quality of life for disabled people.  It is too easily overlooked to realise how limiting it is to live with uncertainty of access to such basic facilities.  The State has buildings in every community, from libraries to social welfare offices and health centres, and I have been pushing the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, to provide fully accessible changing places toilets in all of these public buildings.  The Minister has referred me to the working group to examine the provision for changing places toilets in certain buildings.  What can we do as public representatives to make the biggest difference in drastically increasing changing places toilet facilities?  Does Ms Richardson think is it legislation similar to England, or is it the Government making a priority that is the biggest barrier?<\/p> <p>  The second question is for the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I thank the witnesses for highlighting the shortcomings in current regulations.  The majority of people do not know and would be shocked to learn that regulations only require houses to be visitable for wheelchair users, and not liveable.  It is unbelievable that such discriminatory regulations were put in place.  As the witnesses highlighted, it is extremely pressing in terms of plans for new housing.  Unfortunately, the Government's Housing for All plan is light on addressing the needs of disabled people.  I am worried that talks of reviews will only result in absolutely necessary changes being pushed into the future.

Building on comments from Ms Egan and others concerning how we can look at updating the regulations and guidance, the first thing would be recognising the importance of consultation and identifying the barriers faced by people with disabilities.

It would then be necessary, and important, to review the guidance in line with international good practice to address universal design, again building on what Ms Egan said previously.<\/p> <p>  In addition, when we are revising the guidelines, we must move away from just having visitable housing.  We must think about adaptable housing and housing which is fully wheelchair accessible.  In turn, that process would lead to a revision of the planning policy and frameworks governing how we are going to implement changes and ensure that we have sufficient adaptable or wheelchair-accessible housing in Cork, Galway, Limerick etc.  This undertaking is not just about revising the technical guidance and updating the building regulations.  We must also look at the entire surrounding planning policy and frameworks as well.<\/p> <p>  We must also examine aspects such as training and awareness.  How are we going to roll out national training and awareness to ensure that this programme is rolled out effectively?  Then, we must also look at things like monitoring and enforcement to ensure that we are getting housing which is fully accessible.  This is a process, therefore, but it is also about updating the technical guidance documents and regulations in line with international good practice.

Language is so powerful that it moves mountains.  In our conversations, we are hearing about topics such as extra space, additional costs, value for money and special needs.  The houses we are talking about are not a luxury but a requirement.  This is about designing space to meet people&rsquo;s requirements.  If anybody who does not have a disability went to buy or rent a house and then found that the house had no front door and it was necessary to go in the window, would we accept that?  In that scenario, would we call a special house one that has a front door and where it would not be necessary to climb in the window?  We could think of a situation where the gate was blocked up either in this comparative context.  These are simple things, but I encourage everybody to look at the language used and to challenge such language when it comes up.  This is not about special needs and it is not about luxuries.  It is about designing to meet people&rsquo;s requirements so they can live their lives.<\/p> <p>  I encourage everybody - including myself, because this is where my learning has come from during my 17 years with the Irish Wheelchair Association - to get to know people with disabilities.  Doing that could include going, or trying to go, on a bus journey with people who have disabilities or visiting people in their homes to see what they can and cannot access, if people are willing to share their experience.  That would enable people to get a sense of the lived experience and it should be done at all levels.  I would start with ensuring that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and everybody else involved in housing had that experience.  There is nothing like the human experience to touch someone and to impact change.<\/p> <p>  A movement is emerging here across the disability sector.  We are building a campaign, an alliance across the disability sector, centred on calling for a review of Part M of the building regulations.  It is being led by Ms Lally.  She has already met with many of the disability organisations, including physical, sensory and intellectual groups, to explore us coming together before the end of this year and into the new year to try to drive this change.  We encourage anyone interested in supporting that campaign to get involved when it begins.  We must drive this change, because it is not going to happen otherwise.  I have been told that we are involved in a cost-benefit analysis process now that is examining universal design with the National Disability Authority.  I have also been told, however, that there has been talk of this having been going on for years but nothing is happening.  Our initiative is concerned with driving that change.<\/p> <p>  Turning to what standards are required, many different standards already exist.  Part M of the building regulations is one example.  The Irish Wheelchair Association, however, has its own best practice access guidelines.  Those are available on our website.  Our guidelines probably exceed many of the existing standards, but they are based on the lived experience of people with disabilities.  They cover all aspects of the built environment, from ATM machines, to section 10 on housing, to ramps and all that.  Those guidelines are available on our website and represent the standards that we would be advocating for.  We are seeking a review of the existing standards, and everybody here is saying the key aspect in this regard is the public consultation.  That would allow us to hear from people with disabilities and other people impacted so the right decisions can be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Cunningham"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I call Ms Merrigan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#H00900","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":673,"content":"<p>To address Deputy Cairns's question about what we can do, we have not talked about the cost of changing places facilities.

Many of the buildings and bathroom facilities already exist.  It is not therefore a mad amount of money that we are talking about in this regard.  There must be a will to do this, however, and there definitely is, but it exists in pockets.  The will is not there at the highest levels and it is not consistent.  Certain supermarkets and chains are working on this issue, but they are not telling anyone openly what they are doing.  Certain county councils are also better than others.

There are many women and men interested in this debate.

We are talking about basic equipment and a space of 12 sq. m.  As Mr. Cunningham pointed out, it is about housing and accessibility but, for us, it is literally about a toilet.  In 2021 in Ireland, it sometimes feels as if we are going backwards regarding disability and rights, especially human rights.

Certainly I, in a motorised chair, would not have been able to use that changing place.  Therefore, it is important that the process be correct and that disabled people be consulted very much at the beginning to make sure it works.

I support the call for Part M to be reviewed and reconsidered.  I am very glad to hear there is significant progress on changing places but, having worked in the construction industry, I believe there is an institutional lag or resistance to changing regulations for fear it will disrupt an already broken housing sector.  This committee has to have a role in making the case for change.  We have to position this as central to an equal and just society.  We will all have to consider how we can stand with the witnesses on this because the argument will not necessarily be easy.<\/p> <p>  I have several specific questions, including building regulations.  I will be happy to hear from whoever wants to respond to them.  I want to start first with the building regulations aspect.  Was it Mr. O'Herlihy who said we need a review of Part M but that we will also need to consider matters such as development plans and ministerial circulars?  Everything considered during the planning permission process will have to be examined eventually.  Does anyone have an opinion on whether Part M is enough?  I am interested in the intersection of part M with other regulations, such as part B, which covers fire regulations.  There has been some relaxing of some fire regulations, including in respect of the removal of sprinkler requirements and changes to landings and stairs, presumably to encourage developers by increasing profitability.  That is the only impetus I can see behind the changes.  Does anyone have a view on how Part B intersects with Part M?<\/p> <p>  I completely agree with Mr. Cunningham that moving towards a universal model of housing and building design would mean better generational access to housing in general.  We all go through times in life when we need different types of housing.  A basic level of universal design would make matters much easier for people.  Do any of the witnesses wish to refer to generational living?<\/p> <p>  This brings us to the issue of nursing homes, which has been raised several times this morning, and also to the issue of people with disabilities living in them.  I am under the impression that there currently is no statutory guidance given on the design of buildings that specifically cater for people with additional or different needs.  I presume there is a role for statutory guidance on facilities such as schools and nursing homes, in connection with which we consider the issue of universal design.<\/p> <p>  I have had an argument about the cost of construction.  Maybe Ms Egan or Mr. O'Herlihy could talk about this.  We have had a lot of conversation on the building in of environmental aspects.  The cost from the design stage usually tends to be between 1% and 2%, but the cost to retrofit is many multiples of that.  I can only assume it is the same for universal design or adaptation.  Importantly in respect of cost&ndash;benefit analyses, it would be cheaper for the State to build proper universal-design dwellings and public buildings rather than addressing the issue after the fact.  That would represent better value for money for the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>  My final question is for Ms Egan because she is connected to the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland.  The original legislation framework for building regulations included an independent oversight body to consider changes to and the development of building regulations.  The body was made up of stakeholders and experts in the field.  In the past decade, it has been removed and responsibility is now completely in-house within the Department.  Does Ms Egan believe we need a stand-alone, independent oversight body for building regulations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#J00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":677,"content":"<p>There are many detailed questions.  I will start with the one on universal design and the requirements under the building regulations.  When the building regulations were updated in 2010, Part M1 removed the reference to people with disabilities.  Therefore, the current M1 requirement states: \"Adequate provision shall be made for people to access and use a building, its facilities and its environs.\"  The reference to people means people of all ages, sizes and abilities.  The technical guidance document for Part M states the requirements under the part aim to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of buildings, but also that the requirements are based on the principle of universal design.  Unfortunately, the guidance that accompanies the regulation is still very much focused on some basic disability requirements, and it does not address universal design in its totality.  That is a major gap.  That is why everyone is here today saying that technical guidance needs to be updated and amended to address universal design principles in the design and construction of a building.<\/p> <p>  To add to the point Ms Egan made some minutes ago, to achieve universal design in the built environment we have to ensure that, at all stages of design and construction projects, universal design is being addressed.  That goes from the tendering stage, when the client is writing a brief, to all stages of planning, design, detailed design, construction and handover.  Unless we address that in the building industry, we will never fully achieve universally designed buildings.  It is about the process but it is also about ensuring the guidance in place addresses universal design, not just basic disability requirements.  Since 2000, the requirement under Part M has been based on the universal design approach but, unfortunately, the guidance needs to be updated to meet that.<\/p> <p>  On the second point, we have 12 building regulations in Ireland, ranging from Part A to Part M.  Reference was made to Part B, on fire safety, but we could also be considering Part K, which deals with matters such as guarding, rails and safety.<\/p><p>Part G looks at hygiene.  Other building regulations could be strengthened or incorporate more information around universal design.  In some projects that we work on, the fire consultant looks after Part B and the accessibility consultant looks after Part M.  There can be discrepancies in the design.  If there was a review of all of the building regulations, part of that could examine how other regulations may need to be considered to determine whether there are gaps in universal design.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin O'Herlihy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":679,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Herlihy might want to clarify what I am about to say.

We are concentrating a lot on building regulations in this meeting, but there is also other equality legislation such as the Equal Status Acts.<\/p> <p>  There is also an onus on people to have accessible buildings.  It is not just about an end product with the building regulations.  One of the points I have made is that it is very important that we have one set of guidelines.

Yet again, it has been a powerful engagement.  As part of this theme, there is nothing like the lived experience to bring home the gaps in equality across all aspects of our society.<\/p> <p>  Last week a witness used the term \"ableist privilege\".  I cannot help but sit and think that this is another example of ableist privilege.  It would appear, at a very basic level, that some sort of checklist was created and the view was that if we ticked all of the boxes we will have done enough, rather than making a seismic and paradigm shift as a society to ensure all of our society should be inclusive.<\/p> <p>  I am very struck by the words of Ms Smith about being able or unable to do ordinary things in ordinary places.  For me, that is the strongest message across this meeting.  There must be an ability to do ordinary things in ordinary places at all times.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that this committee will take a mandate from all of the witnesses to start hammering the drum very loudly regarding the regulations.  That is not enough.  It is only one aspect of this.  We have talked about the census and lack of metrics.  I would be a little bit concerned that if we were to put a question into the census we would end up with an answer that means a percentage of our population would be catered for in a percentage way, rather than moving to a position whereby all of society must always be inclusive and accessible.  We should not think that the only disability issue or lack of planning for everyone involves inclusion.  I would value some guidance on that. <\/p> <p>  Witnesses spoke about minimum standards.  Mr. O'Herlihy and Mr. Cunningham spoke about the publication of the guidelines and said there is a minimum and maximum or a stepped level of provision.  From that point of view, would it be useful to have one level of provision that should be inclusive?  Knowing that there will be bespoke additions for individuals moving into accommodation, should we put in place a mechanism that meets those particular bespoke needs while ensuring there are no cost implications for the person who needs to access such accommodation?  How do we ensure that the position is the most inclusive possible?<\/p> <p>  Ms Smith touched on the Equal Status Acts.  I am an employment services lawyer by trade and have brought cases under the Equal Status Acts on a number of occasions.  The nature of the Acts is access to a service and whether someone, by implication, is discriminated against or there is secondary discrimination.  Have there been any successful prosecutions with regard to the lack of toilet facilities or facilities in the likes of supermarkets and public spaces that are privately owned and controlled?<\/p> <p>  My main question relates to Norway.  Was there a time when it was where we are now?  What was the transition to where it is now?  Was it always inclusive at an incremental level and has simply now achieved a very high benchmark?  I am curious to know what sort of transition period we are talking about.  There is an historical background and structures within our society that would take quite some time to move across.  Can anything be learned from the Norway experience that could accelerate that and which we as a committee can advocate for?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#K00700","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I will go back to the question on statistics and how we view them.  The census is one way of giving us some information on the percentage of people who are wheelchair users.  That would not only be about housing.  It could be brought to all areas of the census so we have more information on employment, transport and everything else that is covered within the census, though it is only one piece of it.<\/p> <p>  The other piece goes back to the point made previously, which is that we do not, even within the local authorities, have an understanding of how many wheelchair users are in need of housing, unless a retrospective piece of work is done.  We also need local authorities to take into account future needs and a rolling stock.  Once we know that a housing authority has 50 people in its area right now who need wheelchair accessible accommodation, we should also know what that figure will look like in five or ten years' time so those people are not waiting ten years for their houses.  There has to be a level of rolling stock added to whatever the percentage of need is, but we need a starting point.  We do not have that as yet in order to have a real understanding of the need. <\/p> <p>  Somebody else might want to add to the issue of 100% universal design, which the NDA has also spoken about it.  Within that 100%, there would be a percentage of houses that are at the plus-plus stage.  That goes back to what the need is and the rolling stock.

It is difficult to take cases in Ireland since litigation is expensive and puts many people off.  There is also the stress factor, which makes it very difficult to take cases.  Cases are sometimes negotiated and are not published, which means accessing who took those cases is another issue.  If they do not have success in domestic law, the optional protocol is not yet ratified and that is also an issue in seeking international redress.<\/p> <p>  Norway has been at the forefront of accessibility issues since the 1960s.  As I mentioned, we only really got our accessibility standards going in the mid-1990s, so we are quite a few decades behind in some ways.  There were issues in the 1980s.  A Norwegian architect, Kare Adler, claimed that the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights also applied to disabled people and their right to access the built environment, but this was laughed at by an audience during a lecture.  The Norwegians have also had issues with trying to get accessibility standards accepted and built.  They also brought in the first lifespan dwelling in the 1960s and were looking at universally designed housing back then.  They have been very much at the forefront and policies and systems are now built into their legislation.  I will send the Senator some information about that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Hourigan's question was about the cost of construction and the price differential between putting universal design at the forefront of development or retrofitting it later.  The cost at the beginning seems a lot at the time, but it will always be better than retrofitting adaptations later.  It is also important to say that it is not part of the planning process at the moment.  We need to bring accessibility into the planning process at a very early stage so it is not just tacked on later when things go to tender or construction drawings are made.  It should be there at the beginning of a project at planning stage, and accessibility or equality statements submitted as part of that, so it is actually thought of at that level.  There will not then be issues with retrofitting and such things later, which will only have a cost-benefit analysis.  The NDA is doing work on that cost-benefit analysis so there might be information published about that in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernadette Egan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":689,"content":"<p>Everyone agrees there has to be a basic level of accessibility across society.

Information is power and knowledge; it helps us to plan.  The fact that at a basic level the local authorities do not know the number of wheelchair accessible houses required needs to be fixed.  We are talking about it for a long time.  That retrospective piece on the current approvals needs to be fixed, especially in the context of the new housing application form.  There is no reason, at the beginning of 2022, we should not have a very clear picture of how many wheelchair accessible houses are required throughout the county in every local authority.  That information should then inform the decisions around planning applications and developments from approved housing bodies and private developers. <\/p> <p>  One point that is always good to bear in mind is that wheelchair accessible housing is not wheelchair exclusive housing.

For example, in London in 2004, a target was set that 10% of all houses would be wheelchair accessible and that figure has reached approximately 8%.  They have gone some way down the line to allowing people choice and offering flexibility for people in the housing market.  From 2018 in the UK, as part of its national planning policy framework, there was a requirement on all local authorities to plan a mix of housing based on current and future demographics, market trends, meeting the needs of different groups within the community and including people with disabilities.  It now gives all local authorities an onus to identify what targets they would need to put in place for wheelchair-accessible housing, whether it is through voluntary bodies or private developers.  This also allows local authorities to put conditions on planning applications and specify what percentage of accessible housing is needed.  We can talk about visible, adaptable and fully wheelchair-accessible standards.<\/p> <p>  The Senator made another point about making public buildings accessible.  We mentioned the Equal Status Acts and although we are trying to make buildings accessible, we are also trying to ensure the services provided within those buildings are accessible.  That relates to reasonable accommodation and avoiding discrimination towards people with disabilities.  We have had a Disability Act since 2005 and it contains a number of key clauses relating only to the public sector, although they are important.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned complaints and there is a mechanism in the Disability Act whereby every public body, Department and local authority in Ireland must appoint an inquiry officer to deal with complaints from people with disabilities who feel there has been a breach in the Disability Act.  When the Disability Act was introduced in 2005, it required that six Departments would create a sectoral plan, with one of those from what is now the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  One of the main elements of that sectoral plan - a ten-year action plan on how accessibility could be improved in Ireland - was the provision to encourage and facilitate access to the appropriate housing and accommodation needs of people with disabilities.  We are 16 years on from that but there does not seem to be many complaints being made by people with disabilities that they do not have access to housing.  One of the reasons for this is that people are unaware they can make that type of complaint through the provisions of the Disability Act to an inquiry officer in the local authority.

We are building the \"Think Ahead, Think Housing\" campaign and calling for 7% of all houses to be wheelchair accessible and the rest of all houses, public and private, to be lifetime adaptable houses.  Perhaps in Dublin there may be a need for a higher percentage but as a baseline we are calling for 7%.  In Belmullet someone might not have the same need as in Dublin.  There would be a balance across the board but this goes to the rolling stock and providing people with a choice as to where they want to live.<\/p> <p>  I have a quick example.  A lady we work with in Belmullet is lucky enough to live in one of our wheelchair-accessible houses.  She loves going to Dublin a couple of times a year to visit her sister, nieces and nephews.  She leaves here at 6 a.m. and a personal assistant brings her to the train in Castlebar.  When she arrives in Dublin she meets the wheelchair-accessible taxi that she has booked because she is really organised.  That brings her to her sister's house.  As a result of the Part M regulations introduced some years ago, she can come into the house, visit her sister, have a cup of tea and play with the kids.  She then has to book into a hotel or stay at the IWA Carmel Fallon Centre, which she often does.  She cannot stay with her sister or have that holiday experience of having her nieces and nephews coming into her bedroom when she wakes up.  That is a human right and it is not good enough that she cannot experience it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosaleen Lally"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I thank everybody for their contributions.

It would eliminate the need for so many people to be applying for the grant.<\/p><p> One thing to be mindful of is that retrofitting a house may suit one person but, as Ms Egan said, people may have different requirements in the design of their houses.  It would, for example, be different for someone who is ambulant compared to someone who is in a wheelchair.  That is important.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about the difference between an adaptable and a wheelchair-accessible house.  Adaptable houses are sometimes called lifetime homes.  They allow people to stay in their homes as they age and acquire a disability.  The whole idea of a lifetime home is that it is easily adapted to meet the changing needs of someone as they go through life.  When the house is being built, for example, it would be important to ensure that one of the downstairs rooms has plumbing so it could be easily changed from a living room to an accessible bedroom.  Another approach might be to design a storage area within the house where a platform lift could be put in.  That is important.  Lifetime homes may not be easily adapted to become fully wheelchair accessible but they would offer people a choice to move into a house they could easily adapt to meet their needs as they age or acquire a disability and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin O'Herlihy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":703,"content":"<p>The housing adaptation grant is a valuable resource for keeping people in their homes but there are two problems with it.  The first is that the limit of &euro;30,000 is totally out of kilter with building costs at the moment.  We were supporting a person who wanted to stay in their home because the alternative was to become homeless and go on the council's housing list.  After going to tender for an en suite bedroom and a few smaller adaptations, the person was quoted &euro;63,000, while the grant was a maximum of &euro;30,000.  The person concerned happened to be in the fortunate and exceptional position of being able to pay &euro;30,000 and we paid the rest.  She was able to go ahead with the work.  The alternative, in the absence of the grant, was homelessness.<\/p> <p>  I raised this matter at a national committee recently and was a bit taken aback by the response, which was that if we raise the limit of the grants, we would be able to give out fewer grants, as if that was relevant.  This is about meeting individual needs.  <\/p> <p>  The second point relates to how means are assessed for the grant.  It takes into account all the household income.  Consider a family in which a child has a disability and is living with his parents.  He may inherit the house or perhaps he is just living in it for the next ten years.  If his brother happens to be 18 or 19, still lives in the house and has a job, the brother's salary is taken into account in the means test.  That makes no sense.  The adaptation is not for the brother, or the parents, it is for the person with a disability to live a more independent life.  Those two things need to change.  In a way, we are blue in the face calling for those changes but nothing is happening.  The alternative is that people go on the approved housing list and look for a new house instead of facing a cost of &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021101400002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Cunningham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":704,"content":"<p>Mr. Cunningham has covered the points.

I was interested in some of the questions put by Deputy Hourigan, which were key and went to the core of the issue.  We must recognise that not only have we not progressed as we should have in terms of universal design and standards, but there is active pressure to roll back on standards.  We need to be clear about that and I hope we, as a committee, can be strong in pressing against that.  What we have heard about the cost is interesting.  It is striking that the costs of retrofitting or adapting are much higher than the cost of getting it right in the first place.  I am very passionate about public procurement and how we do that.  It seems as if it does not make sense.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cunningham referred to people for whom adaptation is being put out of reach and who then find themselves on the list for an approved housing body.  We also know, as Mr. Cunningham said in his opening statement, that people end up in residential care, with all of the costs associated with it, because of poor design from the outset.  <\/p> <p>  I appreciate the 7% figure and the idea of lifetime adaptable houses everywhere.  I am concerned that lifetime adaptable homes need to be built to a high standard to ensure people do not face quotes of &euro;63,000.  How do we ensure a high standard of universal design and lifetime adaptable homes?<\/p> <p>  I am also conscious of other areas of building.  Fire safety has been mentioned.  Corridors are now longer.  Studio apartments have shrunk by 27%.  Corners are being cut in student accommodation.  Our guests have concerns about the general housing stock, in all its different forms, and the fact that some requirements are being diluted, which will make houses much harder to adapt in the future.  That is a concern I have.  Our guests have given detailed input today and could follow up on those matters.  Mr. O'Herlihy gave us some good specifics in writing.  The committee needs to press for standards, not just under Part M but right across the sets of standards.  That will be important.<\/p> <p>  Public procurement and capital expenditure are the biggest pieces involved and I would love to hear comments on those issues.  We have been waiting a long time but we are now at a key point.  Some &euro;116 billion is about to be spent on capital infrastructure, much of it on buildings.  Public procurement will be happening as part of that capital expenditure.  How crucial is it that we do not conduct public procurement based solely on the standards we have now but instead build in the expectation that if we do revise Part M, as we must, and raise the building standards, any buildings that are being built will be required to meet those higher Part M standards?  That is important because a lot of funding is going into the building of new and affordable housing in line with the housing strategy.  We must ensure that the building that will happen in the next year or two will meet the higher standards, rather than us raising the standards in two years' time, having already committed to &euro;50 billion worth of building under old, poor standards.<\/p> <p>   It is also crucial that we apply the same to public standards.  Schools and residential centres were mentioned but I am also concerned about community centres, public spaces, new shared public spaces, new amenities, theatres and all of the stuff of life.  Anything that is getting funding under the national development plan and the new capital expenditure programme should meet universal standards.  I am conscious that we have focused on wheelchair access and other things.  Do our guests have any comments on universal design, Irish sign language and addressing the needs of those who are deaf or those with impaired sight?  I know Ms Egan is working in the area of universal design.  Does she feel those issues are being incorporated sufficiently into the universal design frameworks?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Ms Richardson.  It sounds like a considerable amount of thought has gone into the strategy around Changing Places Ireland.  Ms Richardson rightly said that not hundreds but thousands of people need these places.  There has been a long development process that is now going out to public consultation.  How important is it that after public consultation, we do not start piloting new places but instead have a fast roll-out to scale across the country?<\/p><p>There is one thing that I sometimes worry about.  We can consult on something and plan it but even though we know it will work and is needed, we start piloting.  It is like we pilot back to an early stage.

Reference was made to procurement.  Section 27 of the Disability Act requires that all public bodies would write accessibility into public procurement tendering exercises. We need to ensure that we do not just specify Part M of the building regulations as the requirement to be met as we strive towards universal design.  We have, for example, the national guidelines, Building for Everyone: A Universal Design Approach.  There are other international standards around creating universally designed buildings and we use these on some of the projects we work on.  As part of the public procurement of all of these new capital infrastructure projects, we must ensure that universal design is written into the brief and assessed as part of the actual awarding of the contract.<\/p> <p>  We need to ensure that universal design is benchmarked at all stages over the project including: writing the project brief; the feasibility; the planning; the design; the construction; and the hand over.  That is very important to see how we are benchmarking projects to ensure that we are achieving universal design at all stages.<\/p> <p>  We must also ensure that we are designing beyond minimum practice.  We are talking about changing places today in the context of the importance of having these in public buildings, schools, healthcare facilities and so on, but what about meeting the needs of people who may have neurodiversity impairments?

There is a piece here in the regarding the urgency involved.  The Senator referred to pilots.  The urgency is now.  As each of us sits here on our screens, there are people in nursing homes who do not have silence and space or who cannot get their own waffles and so on.  There are people who are living on couches and who do not have control over their lives because they are living with elderly parents, and there are others who do not have their own homes.  The urgency is now.<br\/><br\/>On procurement, we are an approved housing body and we specialise in wheelchair accessible housing.  We try to have the housing in integrated environments and in communities, as opposed to being set aside.  Recently, we bought a number of apartments out in the community - we find them on <i>daft.ie<\/i>- and we go as accessible as we can.  We get a 100% funding from the capital assistance scheme, CAS, for the acquisition.  Then, because the housing is not designed for each user, we also put in a separate application for adapting the units.  One apartment comes to mind.  The price to buy was &euro;175,000.  I believe that the adaptations came in at approximately &euro;40,000.  These were the minimum adaptations required in order that somebody could move into the apartment.  The tenant who is in the apartment now must also apply for a further housing adaptation grant.  The first adaptation grant was part of the CAS funding.  Now the person involved has to apply to the local authority for the adaptation grant because there is a narrow corridor from the living area to the bedroom and because the door into the bathroom is on the right-hand side of this, the tenant cannot take the corner because his wheelchair is wider than other chairs.  As well as issue with the doors and the frames, his fingers that are getting caught in this door.  So, there was the acquisition price, the adaptation price, the professional fees for the architects and others, there is the cost for the tendering process because it must go through e-tenders, and then there is a follow-up where we must go for a further housing adaptation grant to make it liveable, and it is still not up to the standard one would require.  There is a huge waste of money in this process, and yet we are talking about value for money and extra space.  There is a contradiction.

I am joined by my colleagues from the EPA, Dr. Michelle Minihan, Mr. Noel Byrne and Ms Mary Gurrie.  They are all senior managers dealing with water issues in the EPA.<\/p> <p>  My opening statement addresses briefly the current status of water quality generally in Ireland and the associated pressures, the current environmental priorities with regard to wastewater treatment, the current challenges in the provision of drinking water services, and more specifically, the recent failures at drinking water treatment plants in Ballymore Eustace and Gorey.  All of that summary information is available for members' convenience.  In the interests of time I will move to page 7 of the opening statement, from where I believe the committee will be interested to receive an EPA perspective and update on the recent drinking water quality incidents at the Ballymore Eustace and Gorey water treatment plants.<\/p> <p>  The Ballymore Eustace plant is the largest drinking water treatment plant in the country, serving approximately 877,000 consumers across Kildare, Meath and Dublin city and county and producing up to approximately 320 megalitres of treated drinking water per day.  At 11.30 a.m. on Tuesday, 1 September, Irish Water informed the EPA of an alum dosage incident at the plant, which occurred on 20 August, 12 days earlier, but had only come to Irish Water&rsquo;s attention the previous day.  The EPA, accompanied by representatives of the HSE, conducted an audit of the plant on 9 September with the purpose of establishing the facts of the incident, the corrective actions taken following the incident and to verify the performance of the Ballymore Eustace water treatment plant once corrective actions had been taken.  The root cause of the incident was a mechanical pump failure that took a number of hours to fix, as well as an issue with the chlorine dosing system.  The impacts included the following: the Cryptosporidium treatment barrier was compromised for up to ten hours; there was ineffective disinfection of water when turbidity rose significantly; there was inadequate disinfection of water due to low chlorine levels in the final water for up to six hours; and there was a plug of inadequately treated water in the network for up to four days after the incident.<\/p> <p>  The Gorey Creagh water treatment plant serves 7,241 consumers in County Wexford.  At 6 p.m. on Thursday, 26 August, Irish Water informed the EPA of an incident where inadequately disinfected water went into supply from the Creagh water treatment plant over the period from 19-24 August, seven days after the incident commenced.<\/p><p>The EPA undertook a virtual audit of the Creagh water treatment plant on 7 September and an on-site audit on 16 September to establish the full facts of the incident and the corrective actions taken following it and to verify the performance of the Creagh water treatment plant once corrective actions had been taken.<\/p><p> The root cause was a power failure on the evening of the 19 August which caused the chlorine pump to fail, compromising the disinfection system at the plant.  In parallel, over the weekend of 21 August, there was heavy rainfall which resulted in a deterioration of the water quality of the River Bann, which supplies the Creagh plant.  The impacts were that the cryptosporidium treatment barrier was compromised for up to five days and that there was inadequate disinfection of water due to there being little or no chlorine in the final water for up to five days  The HSE advised during both audits that in late August and September many people in the locality became ill and were confirmed to have infections of VTEC, which is a form of E. coli, campylobacter, cryptosporidium, Giardia, shigella and rotavirus, with a number of people also being hospitalised.<\/p><p> There were common audit findings at both Ballymore Eustace and Gorey.  The audits the EPA undertook identified Irish Water&rsquo;s failings in managerial oversight in delivering on its role to supply safe and secure drinking water from Ballymore Eustace and Gorey.  This was evidenced at local authority level through failings in operational control and responsiveness.  The common issues identified include: a basic lack of awareness and understanding amongst operational and management staff as to the significance of the incidents and their impact on the drinking water quality and risk to public health; a lack of awareness of the requirement to communicate and escalate such an incident to Irish Water, thereby preventing the opportunity to assess the need for a boil water notice and to protect public health; a lack of critical alarm settings to inform operators of deteriorating water quality; an absence of documented alarm or incident response procedures; and no automatic shutdown of the plant in the event that critical alarms were activated.<\/p><p> The EPA published its audit reports on its website yesterday and made a number of recommendations which Irish Water will need to address to the satisfaction of the agency.  Based on the significant findings of these audits, the EPA instructed Irish Water to take a number of immediate actions to ensure that these risks are not prevalent across all drinking water plants and to assess the performance of those plants.  These actions include: an audit of all Irish Water plants, starting with the largest top 20 supplies by population, to ensure that staff were appropriately trained in incident awareness, response, reporting and escalation; a review of critical alarm and shutdown settings to ensure public health is protected; and engagement with senior management in local authorities to highlight the failings of recent incidents and measures necessary to prevent these happening again.  The EPA is meeting Irish Water weekly to assess progress on actioning the items I have outlined.  As part of the EPA audit programme, independent audits are being completed at the larger plants, focusing on incident management and critical alarm provisions.<\/p><p> I will emphasise the main issues highlighted by these incidents.  The EPA has described these incidents as an abject failure of managerial oversight, operational control and responsiveness by Irish Water and the local authorities in terms of their respective roles to deliver safe and secure drinking water.  While Irish Water has the primary responsibility for the safety of the water supply, the failure to report incidents between the local authorities and Irish Water prevented a timely risk assessment of the incidents and resulted in unacceptable delays in notifying the EPA and the HSE.  These unacceptable delays in reporting, and, in particular, the failure to consult with the HSE as to the risk to public health during the incidents meant that there was no opportunity to issue a boil water notice to approximately 900,000 consumers of both supplies, which would have served to protect public health until issues at the plants were resolved satisfactorily.<\/p><p> Additional unreported incidents were uncovered by EPA inspectors during the auditing process, which supports the EPA&rsquo;s view of incident management by Irish Water and local authorities and their seriousness as a risk to public health.  Unfortunately, these incidents are not isolated and have been evident in other audits conducted in other parts of the country.  It is clear to the EPA that the current arrangements for the delivery of safe drinking water in terms of managerial oversight, operational control and responsiveness are not working satisfactorily and are placing unacceptable risk on public health by failing to ensure safe and secure drinking water.  While the EPA is aware of the ongoing work towards the transformation of Irish Water to a national water services utility by 2023, immediate significant improvement in the provision of water services by Irish Water and local authorities operating under the current service level agreement is required to ensure the public is provided with safe and secure drinking water and that public health is protected.<\/p><p> I assure the committee that the EPA will continue to monitor and report on water quality, to provide regulatory oversight of Irish Water and to work closely with the HSE and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage with the primary objective of ensuring the protection of human health and the environment.  I thank members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021101400002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ryan.

If I continue for too long, I hope somebody will cut me off.<\/p> <p>  The two incidents that have been outlined and the audit that has been completed demonstrate circumstances in which there was a really significant risk to public health.  With regard to the incidents at Gorey and Ballymore Eustace, in addition to the previous incident at the Leixlip plant and the incident that endangered the Liffey swim in 2019, Irish Water says that these were down to people management at the plants.  It has put them down to mechanical error compounded by human error.  I have visited Ballymore Eustace and I know many of the people who work in that plant.  The structures put in place between Irish Water and local authorities have had a profound impact in hollowing out much of the expertise in respect of water that previously existed in local authorities as these people moved to Irish Water.  There are also employment issues, which have had a significant impact on the security of employment for people on the local authority side of things.  Can Irish Water stand over its assertion that this was all down to staffing and the expertise of the operators of the plan given that it has ultimate responsibility for water quality and the strategic management of the public water supply?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021101400002#B00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":726,"content":"<p>With regard to both of the incidents, in addition to the incident in Leixlip the Vice Chairman mentioned, the root cause analysis came down to issues around mechanical failures, lack of training and failures to escalate.

Therefore, arrangements need to be put in place and working appropriately which ensure that, when incidents occur in plants, they are escalated so that action can be taken.  The two incidents in question, those in Gorey and Ballymore Eustace, occurred as a result of preventable issues.

I am sure it was due to the time pressures Dr. Ryan faced in making his contribution but I note that much of what was in the opening statement provided to us between pages 2 and 6, which contains information on lots of positive progress in the water and wastewater areas, was not touched on.  I am not for one second suggesting that everything is rosy in the garden, but it is important to say that, according to Dr. Ryan's statement, there has been a reduction of 16, from 28 to 12, in the number of large towns and cities that failed to meet the standards under the wastewater treatment directive.  Priority areas for wastewater treatment systems have decreased from 148 to 97.  Importantly, Dr. Ryan also said the quality of public drinking water remains exceptionally high in Ireland, with 99.9% compliance with microbiological parameters and 99.6% compliance within chemical parameters in 2019.  Those are positive things.  Are there updated figures for those parameters for 2020?<\/p><p>I have a further question relating to the Creagh water treatment plant issue, which obviously caused a great deal of concern and anger.  I refer to the main incident, which resulted in the hospitalisation of people.  The EPA's presentation stated that there was no chlorination between 19 and 24 August.  I wish to ask about the situation during 28 to 30 August.  In the report on the virtual audit of the plant, finding No. 1 states that inadequately disinfected water entered the Gorey supply system between those dates.  However, the report later notes that Wexford County Council and Irish Water stated that disinfection was adequate during this period.  Those statements are contradictory in nature.  Following the audits and investigations at the Creagh water treatment plant, and the evidence provided by the council, is the EPA satisfied that between 28 and 30 August - I am not referring to the initial period of 18 to 24 August - the water that entered the supply system was adequately disinfected? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021101400002#C02200","speaker":"1647","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":750,"content":"<p>I will take the first part of the Senator's question and my colleague, Dr. Minihan, will deal with the issue of timing in regard to the Creagh disinfection piece.  We are still working on the latest data about the drinking water quality report for 2020.  It will be finalised in the coming month or so.  I therefore do not have the updated figures for 2020 to present today.  The Senator is correct, and it is contained in our opening statement, that there are many positives to point out in the developments in drinking water quality and infrastructure provision.  We are looking at the new plant in Stillorgan and the development in Vartry, and now we are looking at the Leixlip plant coming off the remedial action list.  They are all positive developments that mean supplies to 500,000 people are at risk, as opposed to more than 1 million people this time last year.  That is moving in the right direction, although we have a long way to go in that regard.

When Irish Water representatives came before this committee, they made the point that there are 800 water treatment plants around the country and that they could not know exactly what was happening in each plant.  Ballymore Eustace is the largest water treatment plant in Ireland and serves 750,000 people in the greater Dublin area, Kildare and Meath, as well as businesses.<\/p><p>The fact that the audit of the Ballymore Eustace plant found that chlorine levels were below standard when the facility was operating normally, and that Irish Water was unaware of this until the EPA raised this matter, is a significant finding.  In addition, it is significant that the Irish Water&rsquo;s national disinfectant programme failed to identify this deficiency and that these incidents were not isolated.  The audit report states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt appears that [the] monitoring data was not assessed by Dublin City Council or Irish Water to provide insight into operations at the plant, in particular the issue of intermittent drops in chlorine levels. This identifies a lack of oversight by management in Dublin City Council and Irish Water. <\/blockquote> <p>It is a serious issue that the monitoring and data compilation has been done but no one seems to have been assessing the results.  If Irish Water had ensured someone was assessing it, that would have been picked up as an issue.  Is there any insight into why Irish Water or Dublin City Council did not assess the collected data?  This is quite different from the issues Irish Water brought to our attention when it came before this committee.<\/p><p>Will the EPA do a follow-up audit and, if so, when?  I note from the audit report that will be an answer in writing from Irish Water on 12 November, however, will there be a follow-up audit at a later point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021101400002#D01300","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":762,"content":"<p>On the Deputy&rsquo;s final point, we meet with Irish Water about these issues weekly.

The site specific target is put in place so that there is an abundance of safety to ensure adequate disinfection under all conditions, including water temperature, changes in pH etc.  That is something Irish Water was not aware of until we raised it.  The Deputy rightly pointed out that our audit report referred to the fact that the national disinfection programme had assessed and surveyed the Ballymore Eustace plant site in 2019 and had not identified this.  That observation in our audit report points to and identifies a lack of management oversight by Irish Water in the operation of the plant.<\/p> <p>  Additionally, during the audit it became clear the staff on site were aware of the intermittent chlorine drops and were trying to manage the problem, but it had not been escalated or reported to Irish Water for it to support, assist and intervene, if necessary.  On the operational monitoring, which is ongoing daily at a number of plants that serve the greater Dublin area, when we received the information following the audit, we found the daily samples were pointing to lower than normal chlorine levels in the treated water leaving the plant.

I will start with one of the few key positive messages in the report, which is outlined on page 6 of the submission.  It was not in Dr. Ryan's address, but it was referenced thereafter.  I will refer to it more for the benefit of the public than for any other reason.  According to the report, the overall quality of public drinking water remained high in 2019, with 99.9% compliance with microbiological standards and 99.6% compliance with chemical parameters.  Of course, boil water notices are in place and have been issued in recent years.  In an average year, how does our experience of boil water notices compare with the international average?<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their explanation of the mechanical pump failure at Ballymore Eustace, which serves many of my constituents in Clondalkin, Rathcoole, Saggart, Newcastle and Brittas, and their outline of the audit findings following the Ballymore Eustace and Gorey incidents.  There is a great deal of cause for concern in their report.  These are serious public health matters and incidents, and according to the EPA's findings, they were preventable.  That is what makes this the biggest failure of all but, in fairness, something that can also be cured a little more easily.  Managerial oversight and the escalation path and emergency response, or the lack thereof, seem to be the two key contributors to these incidents.  If we can take any good news from this, it is that both can be acted on quickly.  Managerial oversight can be tackled relatively quickly and effectively through training, change management and process amendments, and business continuity planning, BCP, can help with the mapping out of a better escalation path and emergency responses, graded according to the seriousness of incidents that arise.  I was in the corporate sector before I became a Deputy.  There, BCP meetings were a critical and routine part of business as usual.  BCP should be a priority for Irish Water and the focus of routine meetings between Irish Water, the relevant local authorities and the EPA.  Is that happening?  The witnesses mentioned the EPA was meeting weekly with Irish Water, but has BCP been incorporated into the EPA's day-to-day or week-to-week business?<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that the EPA has compiled an action plan to resolve the issues it has uncovered, but will the witnesses outline what specific changes have happened since then to mitigate against these issues arising in future?

The issue of water quality has been raised at this committee numerous times.  The greatest obstacle I have found is the connection and communication between Irish Water, local authorities and local representatives.  On a positive note, my meeting with Irish Water yesterday was the most positive meeting I have ever had with it since becoming a Deputy.  It was able to give me a roadmap of various projects that were ongoing or had already happened.  We have had a boil notice in Fedamore for nearly a year and a half, but Irish Water was able to provide me with a programme of when the works would be finished.<\/p> <p>  This is an important issue.  The connection must not just be between Irish Water and local authorities, but also with local representatives, by whom I mean councillors and Deputies, so that we can get the message to the people on the ground who are asking the questions and give them a roadmap.  At our meeting, we were able to discuss how Irish Water had told this committee that it was going to sort out the issue in the next couple of weeks.  When we went through each project, though, Irish Water showed us that it could not meet the targets it had set.  I would prefer to hear targets that can be met rather than spin and everything going around in circles.<\/p> <p>  Collaboration between local authorities, Irish Water and public representatives is the way forward for any project.  Funding to carry out projects must also be made available.  For example, Askeaton has been waiting for a sewerage plant going on 33 years.  We are now being told that the project is not included in the budgets up to 2024 but that it will be in the 2025 budget.  At least I have been given a year for the project to happen.  Regarding water supplies in Fedamore, I have been told that Irish Water has hopes for the first quarter of next year.  Due to boil notices, having fresh water in their houses is costing families in Fedamore &euro;50.  At a time when the cost of living has gone through the roof, spending an extra &euro;50 just to be able to drink water, plus the extra &euro;50 on fuel, does not make sense.<\/p> <p>  I would like projects to be more transparent, proper dates to be targeted and proper funding to be in place so that Irish Water can carry out the works.

In recent years, we have called out delays and slippages with timelines.  This is why we have said Irish Water needs to get to a point where it can reduce as much as possible the uncertainty around its project planning so that we have realistic targets to work towards.  In the planned raw sewage infrastructural projects, timelines have slipped over the past 12 months.  Even if they are now stable, we will still have raw sewage discharging into the environment up to 2025 in many cases and, in some cases, up to 2027.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, if we have realistic and concrete targets to work towards, it represents a substantial improvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021101400002#E01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":780,"content":"<p>I thank the officials for their time.  It is always good to have an opportunity to talk to the EPA.  I have been working with water issues for a long time now.  It is a basic human right but unfortunately, as a very wealthy developed country, we do not seem to have got it right.  Even though there are a lot of places where the water is good, there is a huge issue with the confidence people have in water, hence 1 million plastic bottles of water are bought every day because people do not have the confidence to drink their tap water.  I would love to hear if we are going to do anything about that and promote the fact that water is safe to drink in many places.  There is obviously miscommunication around that when the whole country is buying bottled water every day.<\/p> <p>  The third cycle of the EU water framework directive is due and local authorities must feed into that national strategy.  I worry about the lack of staff and the lack of time local authority staff have to do all the things they are asked to do, on top of feeding into the framework directive and having it properly done.  I think Clare County Council has only four staff working full-time.  They have to do everything from dealing with pollution complaints to planning applications, farm inspections, forestry applications and inspections for the national inspection plan for domestic wastewater.  They work on all those things and I do not see how it can all be done in a way the EPA can trust as being of the good quality we need if we are serious about having this proper plan to get things right.  There is also the polluter pays principle but how can the polluter pay if we cannot find the polluter because we are understaffed and under-resourced?  There were many sweeping statements about blaming certain sections of society, such as all farmers and random things like that, when we really need to hold it down to the specific polluters and ensure they are punished.  However, if we are not resourcing authorities appropriately that will not be done and then we will just have division between people and in communities instead.<\/p> <p>  We also want to have rural and regional rebalancing in Ireland.  Now more than ever people will be able to have opportunities to work remotely.  In order to be able to do that we need more water infrastructure that is done well so we can have serviced sites in our villages and towns to bring life back into those places.  I would love to know what work is being done on that or how the EPA feels about that being able to happen politically if we do not have the infrastructure being built in time.  I could name three or four villages in my county where we smell sewage every day and it has been going on for 30 years.  In 2021 that is not good enough anymore.  The EPA  is the regulatory body over Irish Water and the local authorities so I guess it is on the agency to see what we need to do, ask for it and get it because the other bodies I mentioned are under the agency, if the officials know what I mean.  I would like to hear the officials' thoughts on that and on how we are going to move forward to become a place where people have trust and faith in water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021101400002#F00100","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":781,"content":"<p>I advise the Senator there are just two minutes left in the slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021101400002#F00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":782,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

The primary role of the EPA is to set out what the environmental parameters are.

It is also about minimising harmful disinfectant by-products.  These are what we call the trihalomethanes.  Eliminating lead from our networks is another aspect, as is preventing pesticides from entering our systems.  On the drinking water side, these are the priorities we advocate which are incorporated into the infrastructural spending plans of Irish Water, which are financed by Government and will be rolled out over the next few years.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, on the wastewater side our role is again to identify what the priorities are so they can be incorporated into Irish Water's investment plans.  On that side, we are talking about ensuring Ireland complies with the urban wastewater treatment directive, that there is the elimination of discharges of raw sewage into the environment, that inland and coastal waterways at risk from urban wastewater discharges are protected and that the non-compliant wastewater collection systems are dealt with.  The latter is a massive issue for the next number of years.

I commend him and all the team on that work as well as the information provided today.<\/p> <p>  I have two sets of questions.  The first focuses specifically on the detail of the EPA report with respect to events in Ballymore Eustace and Gorey.  The last time the officials were in talking to us about similar issues was back at the end of 2019 on foot of the boil water notice affecting 600,000 households in Dublin following the problems in the Leixlip plant.  Notwithstanding the very specific technical differences, are there any comparisons or parallels between what has happened recently in the two plants and what happened back in 2019?  I ask because a programme of work was agreed with Irish Water and the local authorities post 2019 to address those issues.  I am interested to know whether that work was done correctly, and if some of it was not might it have led to the problems we have experienced most recently.  I am aware that with Leixlip there was a 51-minute delay before the alarms were noticed, etc. but I am very keen to hear the officials' thoughts on that.<\/p> <p>  The second question relates to the updates the agency publishes regularly on wastewater treatment plants, drinking water quality and in particular those plants or areas - I think we may be down to 19 - that are subject to the European Court of Justice enforcement action.  The officials have outlined some of the progress and the agency's 2020 report on drinking water is coming out soon.  Will Dr. Ryan comment more specifically on whether he is satisfied with the speed of that progress?  I ask because it seems every time we have Irish Water in, the date for the resolution of all these issues is pushed further out.  Irish Water blames planning among other things.  Is Dr. Ryan satisfied the speed of resolution for these matters is satisfactory?  Maybe he can speak specifically to the two areas of drinking water and wastewater treatment.

One of the main differences though was that in Leixlip, because of the time factor, there was an opportunity to respond, risk assess and put in place what was a very significant boil water notice on over 600,000 people at the time, and all the inconvenience it caused people.  There was that opportunity to put in place measures that help people protect themselves.  The difference here is similar issues arose but they were not escalated until after the incidents, so unsafe drinking water was put into the system and then we had the illnesses we saw in Gorey.  Thus they were very similar issues with different outcomes.<\/p><p>I will turn to my colleague, Mr. Byrne, to talk about wastewater and where we are in terms of the pace of infrastructural developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021101400002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":787,"content":"<p>I will touch first on the infringement.  In 2019, Ireland was found to be non-compliant with 28 agglomerations as part of the infringement case.  There are still 13 of those on the EPA's priority list.  We have highlighted those and they need to be addressed to bring them into compliance with the directive.<\/p> <p>  The EPA has highlighted in a report the concerns over delays.  We have seen that and it is something we particularly want Irish Water to address.<\/p> <p>  As for addressing the underlying causes of the delays, what we have noticed is that generally these are nearly in the pre-construction phase.  Once Irish Water gets a plant to the construction point, you do not see the delays after that.  It is the pre-construction phase.  It is in the early phases.  For example, Ringsend, which should have been compliant with the directive pre-2000 and is so late getting to the compliance stage, will achieve compliance in 2023.  We will report, it is hoped, a full-year compliance for 2024 and that will achieve the directive compliance.  Arklow, from a treatment plant perspective, should be done by 2025.<\/p> <p>  In the infringement case, we have a number of networks.  They will be slower.  The networks are looking at drainage area plans to address the issues in the networks.  They are currently assessing the problem, but once they get to understand what the problem is, they will have to look at what steps need to be taken to address those issues and bring those up to a satisfactory standard to ensure the sewage is collected, brought to the treatment plant and adequately treated at that stage.<\/p> <p>  It definitely is a significant issue.  It is something we have highlighted.  What we have said to Irish Water is that it needs to look at the underlying causes of these delays in all of these pre-construction cases.  They are not all necessarily linked to planning or compulsory purchase orders, CPOs.  That is what needs to be looked at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021101400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":788,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the briefing.

The Deputy made reference to 2007.  The cryptosporidium outbreak in Galway in 2007 was what brought about the introduction of the EPA's remedial action list.  At the time, in 2008, at its birth, there were 300 plus water supplies on the remedial action list.  Over time, the number has reduced significantly.  That is obviously a measure of the progress that has been made.  There were 141 sites on the remedial action list when Irish Water came into being in 2014 and we have seen that list gradually reduce over time.  At the end of 2020, there were 46 supplies on our remedial action list.  At our most recently quarter update at the end of July 2021, that number had climbed somewhat to 53 water supplies.  Therefore, there is a slight movement upwards of the numbers on our remedial action list.<\/p> <p>  On how the cryptosporidium gets into our water supplies, it is important to understand that 80% of our drinking water sources are well water sources or surface waters, such as rivers and lakes.  Those rivers and lakes are open to exposure from either animal or human waste and can become contaminated with parasites such as cryptosporidium and giardia that can make people ill.  What is important is that the water treatment plant recognises the level of contamination and is appropriately equipped to deal with the contamination in the well water so that it has a treatment process in place that is controlled and verifiable either to remove or inactivate the cryptosporidium or giardia that can make people ill.  That covers off that bit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021101400002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michelle Minihan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634166000,"counter":790,"content":"<p>On the capacity register, have the witnesses got eyes on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021101400002#G00800","speaker":"1574"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":791,"content":"<p>I will speak to that, if that is okay.

Returning to Dr. Ryan's comments with respect to comparisons between Leixlip and the recent incidents, he stated that similar issues arose but were not escalated.  The non-escalation is what potentially made the more recent ones more significant.  Part of my original question was about a series of actions which Irish Water and the local authorities were meant to take after Leixlip, and it seems that, in fact, not only were there serious issues and similar issues arising but also there was no escalation or notification more recently.  That suggests, at least in these incidents, things were somewhat worse.  Will Dr. Ryan talk us through in a little more detail what the similar issues were and whether he has any concerns that the programme of work that was agreed by Irish Water and the local authorities post 2019 is unsatisfactory?  That is materially relevant to whether the programme of work they have agreed will do what is required.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the enforcement actions, could I clarify if it was said that whereas when the EPA last reported in 2019 there were 28 agglomerations, that is down to 13?  From the EPA's estimation, when will those 13 be fully in compliance if everything goes as the agency is being told?  I am also interested that it was stated it is not believed all of the pre-construction problems are planning.  Perhaps it could be itemised what it is believed some of the others might be because when we raise it with Irish Water, its representatives seem to suggest planning is the only or primary one.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the appendix A priority areas in the EPA annual urban wastewater treatment report, the most recent report I have in front of me indicated there were 113 areas where improvements needed to be made.  Will Dr. Ryan give us an update on progress with respect to that, both in terms of the number and the overall progress?  Likewise, I appreciate the new equivalent drinking water report is coming out soon, but I would appreciated it even if Dr. Ryan could give us some indication or preview of the improvements on that front that we can expect in the report when it is published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021101400002#G01400","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":797,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for his questions.

It was the same piece of equipment that failed in Leixlip two years ago.  While equipment can fail in Ballymore Eustace and in Leixlip, they responded to fix the mechanical issue but the difference this time in Ballymore Eustace was that there was not an awareness or appreciation of the impact of the failure of the alum dosing pump.  It took a number of hours to fix.  The plant operators responded immediately to the alarms to fix it but there was not an awareness or understanding within the plant of the implications of that alum dosing pump failure for drinking water quality.  When the incident in Leixlip happened in October 2019, the operators responded, shut down the plant and they brought the plant back into production under the protection of a boil water notice because that was what the risk assessment determined was appropriate to protect public health and keep water in supply.  The difference in Ballymore Eustace was that a risk assessment was not undertaken, and there was not an opportunity for the HSE to be consulted, the EPA to be informed and the boil water notice to be put in place.  Our reports and letters to the Minister and to Irish Water have pointed out that this highlights that the lessons from Leixlip have not been learned or taken on board.  At the time of Leixlip we highlighted the importance of ensuring that alarms were responded to and incidents were escalated in a timely manner and that fail-safes such as automatic shutdowns of the plant were put in place if water quality incidents could not be addressed in a timely manner.

What did not work was that it was not understood or comprehended that there was a corresponding increase in torpidities across the filters because of the almost 4.5-hour period where the alum dosing was not at its optimum level.  That had a knock-on effect on the filters, which caused the cryptosporidium treatment barrier to be compromised and also resulted in inadequate disinfections.

Taking the Ballymore Eustace plant as a particular example, because it serves nearly 700,000 people in Dublin city, does the EPA have any concerns about the threat that could be posed to the water supply of the city by a deliberate attempt to poison the water source or by an attempt to take it offline by way of a terrorist act?

Irish Water investigates these misconnections, particularly where they give rise to issues, such as bathing water or water quality issues.  There are ongoing investigations.  The drainage area plan assessments are looking at the full network catchments and the sewerage plan in the city.  They look at each element to see if there are misconnections and to find them.  They then make sure that those connections are put into the sewerage and not into the clean water drains, if it is the case that that is happening.  If the Deputy is interested in any of the drainage area plans, I suggest that he should speak to Irish Water.  It has all the plans mapped out for different areas of cities and towns.  If the Deputy is interested in a particular area of a city, he can get that information and see where the assessment is at, what the condition of the sewer is and whether there is an issue of misconnection.  In some areas there are issues of misconnection.

The EPA has an oversight role in terms of classifying bathing waters and publishing an annual report on their quality.  We also manage <i>beaches.ie<\/i>, which provides up-to-date information.<br\/><br\/>Overall, Ireland's bathing water quality is good and we have a large number of excellent beaches in terms of water quality, but all of our beaches are susceptible to pollution events, particularly after heavy rainfalls, from wastewater, animal run-off or other factors.  For example, misconnections can often be a problem.  In Dublin Bay, Merrion beach was unfortunately declassified a number of years ago and Sandymount was at poor water quality status for a number of years.  A task force involving the local authorities, Irish Water and some other stakeholders, such as the HSE and the Department, has been set up to examine the problem, get to its root causes and put solutions in place.  That has been progressing in terms of identifying the causes of the problems that are impacting on bathing water quality at those beaches.  I hope that we will see quality improve over time.  We have many beaches in Dublin that have excellent water quality, which is great to see, and it is important that we maintain and protect them, try to reduce the number of incidents and manage them when they do happen so that the health of bathers is protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021101400002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Gurrie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634166000,"counter":826,"content":"<p>There are 13 agglomerations on our priority list that still have to achieve compliance.  We are told that Ringsend will achieve compliance by mid-2023.  From the plant's perspective, Arklow will be 2025.  That should be the last treatment plant to reach compliance.  Networks may take a bit longer.  Currently, a drainage area plan assessment is being undertaken in respect of a number of them.  It will take some time to complete.  It will identify the actions that are needed to ensure that all of the sewage is collected in compliance with Article 3 of the directive.  All of the details in respect of those sites are on the priority action list on our website.  If the Deputy wants more specifics on any site, he will find them there.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was on the progress being made with our priority areas list.  As he rightly stated, it contained 113 priority areas last year.  In 2017, that figure was 148.  It is now down to 97.  Since 2017, a third of sites have come off the list.  That is good progress.  However, we are seeing issues on the list.  For example, there are significant delays at a number of sites, particularly those dealing with raw sewage.  By 2023, 28 were meant to have achieved treatment.  Due to the past 12 months, that target is now down to just 14.  The delays are causing a significant knock-on effect.  There are 29 agglomerations on the list that we do not yet have plans for and that are not included in the current investment plan.  These cover areas where there is pressure on water quality.
