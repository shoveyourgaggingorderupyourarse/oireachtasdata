It focuses not exclusively on general apprenticeships but on cross-Border apprenticeships.  This follows on from someone in Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast, QUB, sending me a copy of a speech delivered in that university by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris.  It was an impressive speech, which I acknowledge.  The speech was given in the context of the one island approach, which is something the Government has promoted.  The policy is being driven by the Taoiseach and he is very committed to it.<\/p> <p>This issue centres on how we can use cross-Border connectivity and synergies and relationships in respect of developing an apprenticeship programme that spans the two jurisdictions.  I acknowledge the enormous work that went into the apprenticeship action plan drawn up by the Minister.  When he puts his mind to anything, he is driven, committed and determined.  I acknowledge that as well.  In all his announcements in this context since, and particularly in his speech in QUB, he has talked about his ambition to create an additional 10,000 new apprenticeship places every year up to 2025.<\/p> <p>I was particularly interested in his reference, and I am particularly interested in hearing more about this detail if it is not available today, to a new funding call under the PEACE PLUS programme to do with collaboration for cross-Border apprenticeships.  He is committed to doing this and to sourcing the funding for this programme.  There is great potential for this type of programme.  We must work together and encourage apprenticeships.  I am old enough to remember when people left the tech with a group certificate and other people laughed at them.  Those people with the group certificate went on, walked around and met construction workers, tilers, electricians, plasterers and stonemasons to beg for an apprenticeship, or to serve their time with them, as it was then called.  Indeed, apprentices then did not get very much money.  Most of them, however, went on to be successful entrepreneurs and businesspeople in the construction sector.  Therefore, I value and respect apprenticeships.  We learn at different levels.  We are not all academic and we can also learn through a hands-on approach on-site, be that in stonemasonry, construction, glazing or whatever.  A noble way to learn a trade and a profession is to serve time with a master of a craft.  It enables people to have a craft and a skill that they can use to bring in an income for themselves and their family.  Equally, it allows people to contribute to meeting a need.<\/p> <p>In that regard, we are aware that we have a real issue with a shortage of construction workers and, therefore, I wish to examine the issues relating to work-based learning on-site.  We all acknowledge its importance.  I also wish to have a greater focus placed on supporting apprenticeships, as well as on providing greater support for employers in this context and on how we can match apprenticeships with employers.  More important, however, is the question of how we can address the current shortage of skills, particularly in the construction sector and, specifically, in retrofitting.  We need apprenticeships in these areas now.  It is all good news in respect of the apprenticeship programme for the Government.  The PEACE PLUS initiative for cross-Border collaboration on apprenticeships, North and South, is exciting.  This is how we have to build relationships between the North and South.  We must find common needs and common issues and work with them.  I do not doubt the Minister&rsquo;s commitment in this regard.<\/p> <p>I ask that the Minister of State bring back to the Minister an issue to be reviewed in the context of apprenticeships, which is the green certificate in the context of agricultural training.  There is a great shortage of people in the agricultural sector.  I spoke about Teagasc and agricultural training here some months ago.  I received an email from a woman who had major concerns regarding her apprenticeship with Teagasc, where she was serving her green certificate time.  We have issues in this regard, and we must continuously evaluate apprenticeship programmes.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House, and if he could shed some light on these issues, or perhaps send on some follow-up information, that would be very helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#A00600","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his question on these important issues for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.

Ireland operates as a small, open economy and the ability of our graduate apprentices to operate on an international stage is to be encouraged.  The opportunity for international mobility as a component of apprenticeships programmes will be piloted during the lifetime of this plan, either in the workplace or in education and training institutions.  The Government's commitment to cross-Border apprenticeships is reaffirmed in the revised National Development Plan, NDP, 2021 to 2030, which sets out an enhanced level of ambition for collaborative cross-Border public investment to build a more connected, prosperous and sustainable island for all the communities and traditions that share the island.<\/p><p>Under the NDP, the Government, through the Department, will work with our Northern Ireland and UK counterparts and other education and research stakeholders to support more strategic co-operation, realise more opportunities and shape further and higher education and research sectors that will meet the needs and capacity of this shared island into the future.  This will include enhanced co-operation on higher and further education through collaborative approaches to programmes such as developing cross-Border apprenticeships.<\/p><p>A programme area skills development strategy is being developed as part of the PEACE PLUS programme strategy.  This is aimed at delivering economic regeneration and transformation and identifying areas for investment.  It will help to address evident skills gaps and result in increased productivity and employment as well as cross-Border labour mobility.  It will also enable cross-Border collaboration between education and training-based providers to address existing and emerging skills gaps and opportunities for reskilling in key disciplines such as ICT and digital, science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics, or STEAM, the green economy, entrepreneurship, leadership and management, among other key areas, and promote uptake of apprentices in key areas such as ICT.<\/p><p>We will shortly launch a new funding call for PEACE PLUS, with collaboration on cross-Border apprenticeships as part of that.  Working together, we have already identified one area, construction, where we can look to collaborate.  We will explore this in detail in 2023.<\/p><p>Apprenticeships are a demand-driven, employer-led offering based on a contract of employment between the apprentice and the employer.  The number of apprenticeships in any specific sector is, therefore, determined directly by employer provision.  The Department is working with SOLAS examining the demand for construction workers between now and 2030.<\/p><p>The Senator spoke about difficulties with green certificates for agricultural training days.  I will raise that matter with the Minister.<\/p><p>In recent years, the annual intake in construction-related apprenticeships has been steadily increasing.  In 2020, there was a total of 3,370 construction apprenticeship registrations.  This rose by 60% to 5,400 construction apprenticeship registrations in 2021 and to date in 2022, there have been 2,137 such registrations.  As I said, when I visit community training centres they have useful trades.  I hope they make plenty of money because they are providing a great resource to an ever-growing Irish economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#A00700","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed response.

That is important and I am delighted to hear it.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State also mentioned healthcare assistant practitioners, of which we have a shortage.  That is a noble profession with skills and we need to acknowledge and support them with respect to training and pay.<\/p> <p>Before coming to the House, I had a call from a person in the construction education sector who told me there were now approximately 9,000 students doing leaving certificate construction studies.  I do not want to hold the individual in question to that exact number.  These students chose to do construction studies at secondary level, which indicates there is an interest.  I ask that we ascertain whether students leaving secondary school having taken construction studies are being matched up to apprenticeships.  It is not a question of it being a job.

There are also discussions between officials at the Department and counterparts in the Department of Health, the HSE and Tusla on the development of other apprenticeship programmes in the healthcare sector.  Among the 65 apprenticeships currently available, 25 are craft-related and, more specifically, include housing, retrofitting-related programmes, green skills activities relating to a range of construction and engineering-related programmes, including plumbing, carpentry and joinery, and the recently launched wind turbine maintenance technician programme.

As legislators, we have even more of responsibility in that regard.<\/p> <p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party stood before the people at the previous two general elections on a manifesto of An Ireland for All.  People with disabilities deserve the same opportunities and have absolutely the same right to reach their full potential as any other member of society.  We need to deliver for them and we are failing them badly.  Access to adequate and appropriate medical and therapeutic supports is a vital necessity for many people living with disabilities.  Without adequate access many people will simply not achieve their potential.  We all know the importance of all early intervention in helping children learn the very basic skills many take for granted, such as crawling, walking and speaking.  The first four years of life are so important and when children do not automatically develop those skills, they need help and support through State intervention to ensure they do.  There is nothing more heartwarming than a parent or a sibling seeing a child taking a step or putting a few words together for the first time.  In my experience families will go to the ends of the earth to do what they can but they cannot do it alone.  They need help and support and they must be provided by the State.<\/p> <p>I am regularly contacted by people in my area of south Kildare who have been waiting up to 18 months to gain access to the Kildare and West Wicklow children's disability network team, CDNT.

Let us call the child John.  John's mother noticed as early as his first birthday that he was missing milestones, was concerned about this and raised the matter with her doctor.  Due to Covid-19, nothing was done.  She continued to monitor him and raised the red flag periodically.  It was only when she was in with her doctor for a routine pregnancy check-up on her next child that she mentioned it again.  At that point John was referred to a new paediatric doctor.  The child was accepted by the CDNT but there is currently an 18-month waiting list.  In subsequent conversations with the staff on the CDNT, however, who bear no fault in this scenario and are going over and above their duties in supporting families, the mother was informed there is no guarantee the child would be accepted.<\/p><p>To this day, at more than four years old, John is still non-verbal.  He has had no proper assessment or help.  He is to enter his second year of preschool in September and his family will need to begin the process of primary school applications from October 2022.  His mother has been informed he will not be accepted in mainstream classes if he is non-verbal and she cannot apply for a school place in an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, class without a full report to state he requires it.<\/p><p>What is John or his mother meant to do?

I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability matters, Deputy Anne Rabbitte.<\/p> <p>The Government remains firmly committed to ensuring the provision of the best possible health and social care services for both children and adults with special needs, whether they are therapy supports, respite, residential care or day services.  The Government recognises that children's disability services face significant challenges to provide services in a timely and effective manner.  The Minister of State is fully committed to the development and enhancement of children's disability services through the implementation of the progressing disability services, PDS, programme.  She recognises this change programme has been challenging for many stakeholders and, in particular, the families of children who require these services urgently.  As the Senator will be aware, the Minister of State has met many families and listened to their concerns first-hand to ascertain the issues and drive solutions.<\/p> <p>I assure the Senator significant efforts are being made by the HSE to reduce waiting times for children who require all therapy supports, and that objective is a key component of the PDS programme.  The full reconfiguration of children's disability services in the children's disability network teams, with a total of 91 CDNTs across nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs, is a positive step.  It allows CDNTs to move towards the family-centred practice at the heart of phase 2.<\/p> <p>It must be acknowledged that there have been significant challenges in certain parts of the country with the implementation of the PDS programme.  There is a challenging environment related to recruitment and retention of staff working in CDNTs, which is affecting the level of service provided in a significant number of teams across the country.  However, this is not a resource issue and the Government has provided funding since 2019 to allow the HSE to employ an additional 475 whole-time equivalent posts to increase the capacity of all 91 CDNTs.<\/p> <p>The HSE is proactively pursuing a range of options regarding the recruitment of additional staff for the CDNTs and in the first instance this comprised national and international recruitment campaigns to attract those health professionals currently in short supply.  In addition, the HSE is exploring options such as sponsorship and expanded use of assistant grades.<\/p> <p>I assure the Senator that both the Government and the HSE remains committed to the delivery of appropriate services for children with disabilities and they will work with families and staff to develop services that meet their needs.  Having regard to the issue she raised, the HSE has advised that local disability services have allocated development posts for this year to each of the three Kildare CDNTs.  In addition, in conjunction with lead agencies, it has commenced a consortium-based recruitment initiative to explore UK and overseas recruitment, if necessary, to fill all development, vacant and maternity posts that it has until now been unsuccessful in filling from recent domestic recruitment campaigns.<\/p> <p>The Senator spoke about parents waiting for 18 months and this is seemingly far too long.

We are very much aware that these are significant developments but the 1997 Act - I spent the weekend reading it and it is exceptionally boring legislation - never put a definitive timeline on when a decision on these applications would be made.  I am aware of cases where it was seven, eight or nine years after the application was first made that a decision was issued.  There is a need to review the Act in order to put more definitive timelines in place and to strengthen the line of communications between the community and the Department so that everyone can be part of the process and we can have a strong aquaculture network.

In the case of fin fish, the timeframe for public and statutory consultation is eight weeks.

Further factors that can impact the time taken to process an application include the requirement for an appropriate assessment if the application is within a Natura 2000 area; whether the application is required to be accompanied by an environmental impact statement or environmental impact assessment report; consideration of any submissions or observations raised during the public consultation period; and the need for additional underwater or archaeological assessments and the likes.<\/p><p>Once the Minister has made a determination in respect of an application, the legislation requires that the decision be published within 28 days.  The Department places the reasons for the determination on the website of the Department and places a notice in the newspaper in which the applicant placed the application notice.  Notice of the foreshore licensing determination is also placed in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>.<\/p><p>The legislation provides for an appeals mechanism.  Within one month of the date of publication of the decision, interested parties can lodge an appeal to the aquaculture licences appeals board, ALAB, which is an independent statutory body.  The timelines relating to the appeals process are a matter for ALAB.  Foreshore licenses may also be appealed by way of judicial review.<\/p><p>It is important that the Senator is aware of the complex nature of the licensing process and the various statutory steps that must be adhered to.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, recently launched phase 1 of the new state-of-the-art aquaculture information management system.  The online viewer was developed in collaboration with the Marine Institute as part of phase 1 of this project which will develop an overall aquaculture management information system for aquaculture licences in Ireland.  This delivers on the Government's commitment to the further implementation of the recommendations of the aquaculture licence review group.  It is the first step in digitising the aquaculture licensing application process.  The Department continually monitors all its services, including the licensing of aquaculture activities, to ensure we provide an efficient service to our customers while ensuring our environmental and legal obligations are adhered to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#D00200","speaker":"1586"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response in respect of the developments in the licensing system.

That is a positive step forward because, previously, those making submissions had to post them to Clonakilty.  The digitisation of the system is very important.<\/p> <p>The core of the problem, however, is that there is no definitive timeline for when applications will be adjudicated on.  In the case of an application in respect of an industrial or housing development, for example, the local authority has to go through the same issues but there are definitive timelines in place in respect of making a decision.  For example, the local authority is obliged to have corresponded with the public and the applicant within six months of the application.  There is not the same type of timeline tied into these aquaculture applications.  If anything, they are so open-ended that the general public may forget about them because so many years have passed since the application was made.  The public may be of the view that the applicants have withdrawn the application or moved on to other things.  The 1997 Act needs to be considered in the context of tightening the timelines so that communities can have a definitive timeline in respect of when these applications will be adjudicated upon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#D00300","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for highlighting those specific points.  He makes a valid point.  Notwithstanding all the timelines I outlined, he pointed to an understandable concern among local communities.  If a process is taking as long to come through as the one in Kinsale to which he referred, the community would be justified in feeling frustrated.  As he stated, it is important to keep the focus on that.  It is a complex process.  I outlined clearly in my initial response the challenges that are involved.  As a State and a State body, we have to ensure we do that right.  I take on board the points raised by the Senator and I will bring them back to the Department.<\/p> <p>As regards the review group, it identified as a key priority the backlog that existed in aquaculture licence applications at the time.  That backlog fed into some of the time delays referred to by the Senator.  The backlog in shellfish aquaculture licence applications has effectively been eliminated as an issue affecting the industry and work is being prioritised to address outstanding renewal applications in fin fish aquaculture.  The further implementation of the licensing review group report forms an important part of the programme for Government.  <\/p> <p>With the indulgence of the Acting Chairperson, I will refer to phase 2.  Our focus and attention is now on phase 2, which has been developed in 24 months.  It involved the development of a fully online system through which applicants for licences can submit all documents and supporting data electronically.  The system will be fully integrated with other systems.  Its delivery will create a one-stop shop for aquaculture licence applications, a process that will significantly reduce the administrative burden.  That is at the nub of the problem raised by the Senator.  Phase 2 can deliver a much more streamlined process.  It is a key step in delivering on our commitments under the programme for Government to further implement the recommendations of the independent aquaculture licensing review group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#D00400","speaker":"1586"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Schemes","time":1657098000,"counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#E00050"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, to the House.  I am pleased to share my time this morning with Senator Burke.  The issue we are raising is the ongoing campaign by T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme to make changes to how they operate.  On Monday night, Senator Burke and I attended a meeting in the TF Royal Hotel in Castlebar.  It was attended by more than 450 members of schemes from throughout County Mayo, local councillors and Oireachtas Members from the county.  The changes announced in recent weeks, in particular the abolition of the six-year rule, have been very much welcomed by scheme operators and those on the schemes.  There is still some way to go.  We are looking for an expansion of or flexibility in the eligibility criteria.  I will give an example.  Only one person can access a scheme under a herd number.  If a niece or nephew is working with a farmer he or she cannot access the scheme.  This does not make sense.  We need to get people onto these schemes.<\/p> <p>Another key issue is the top-up payment.  It may come as a shock to many people that they only receive &euro;22.50 as a top-up to their social welfare payment.  By any standard this is a very low level of pay for the work that is done.  What has been requested by T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme is that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, engage with and meet them to discuss the outstanding issues and matters to be resolved.  This includes increasing the top-up payment, particularly as we head towards budget 2023.  There is extra money in the budget package to cater for requests such as this.  We ask that the eligibility criteria be expanded and that greater flexibility be allowed in the operation of the schemes.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State is from a rural area and knows these schemes are vital.  They are part of the fabric of rural Ireland.  There are jobs in communities that simply would not get done were it not for these schemes.  As the saying goes, we do not know what we have until it is gone.  If people were not operating on these schemes many jobs would not get done.  They mow the local GAA pitches.  They keep them ready for the under-fives teams up to the senior teams.  They keep the local community halls open.  They look after the graveyards.  These are all jobs that local authorities do not have the resources or the manpower and womanpower to do.  The local schemes pick up the slack and bridge the gap the State does not fill.  It is vital that we ensure the long-term sustainability and viability of the schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#E00100","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Chambers for sharing her time.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Senator Chambers has outlined in detail the case and what took place at the very large meeting in Castlebar last Monday.  There is no need to go over the case that Senator Chambers made.  The Minister of State is only too well aware of the work carried out by the schemes on football, hurling and soccer fields and graveyards.  Even at funerals we can see that participants in the schemes regulate traffic.  It is great when we go to a funeral and we can see it is taking place in an orderly fashion and drivers are told where to park.  They also assist Tidy Towns to keep towns and villages clean.<\/p> <p>At the meeting we were presented with a leaflet on what was being sought.  In particular, people want to engage with the Minister and the Department on what they need.  I will give the Minister of State a copy of what they gave us on the night.  The top-up payment of &euro;22.50 for the rural social scheme is very little for 19.5 hours work and the great work people do in the community.  Who would go out to work for &euro;22.50 for 19.5 hours other than those who love what they do and love helping the community?  That is what these people do and it is what they are about.

At present there are some 27,000 people and 1,649 supervisors employed on the three main schemes.  Overall, these schemes have a budget allocation of &euro;540 million in 2022.<\/p> <p>Work schemes such as T&uacute;s and community employment are positive initiatives that enable the long-term unemployed to make a contribution to their communities while upskilling for prospective future employment.  The rural social scheme provides farmers and fishers with income support while they also make a contribution to their community.  At present, there are more than 10,000 places supported on T&uacute;s and rural social schemes, with a budget of more than &euro;160 million available to support the schemes in 2022.<\/p> <p>I agree with the Senators and we are all hugely impressed with the range and value of the work undertaken by the participants on these schemes, whether with Tidy Towns or the GAA or in childcare.  We would all notice a sizeable difference to our communities were these schemes and their participants not working.  Recognising the work and acknowledging the challenges that face these schemes, on 21 December, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, announced reforms to the rural social scheme and the community employment scheme to improve the operation and further support these schemes that maintain vital services to communities.  These changes included a provision to allow community employment and rural social scheme participants who reach 60 years of age to remain on both schemes until they reach State pension age, along with a number of other changes to reduce the numbers exiting schemes while improving the referral process.<\/p> <p>While these changes have helped, recruitment to schemes to fill all vacancies remains a challenge with vacancies in schemes at present.  Recent positive employment trends, with the reduction in unemployment and in the number of long-term unemployed, are having an impact on recruitment to these schemes.  It means there is a smaller pool of candidates to fill available places.  These challenges are similar to those facing employers in the open labour market.  To further assist schemes to maintain services in this tight labour market, last week the Minister and Minister of State announced additional measures.  These will improve recruitment and remove the six-year time limit on the rural social scheme for all participants, while continuing the practice whereby placements can be extended until suitable replacements are available to fill vacancies.  These reforms will ensure that schemes have sufficient participants to continue to deliver services throughout the county in urban and rural areas.<\/p> <p>The Department recently reviewed the means assessment disregards for farm assist, which is the main qualifying payment for the rural social scheme.  As part of this review process, it was recommended to provide for extensive expansion of the list of agri-environmental schemes that qualify towards income disregards.  These measures have been implemented from June 2022.<\/p> <p>I understand that last year, the Minister and Minister of State introduced the employment support services operation forum where they, along with departmental officials, meet representatives from community employment, the job initiative scheme, the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s.  This forum now meets three to four times a year, with the next meeting due to be held very shortly.  The operational forum provides a valuable opportunity to discuss operational issues that arise on the schemes and impact on service delivery in the communities.  The Minister and Minister of State find the meetings to be extremely informative and a very worthwhile opportunity for constructive exchanges of views and ideas.  They also interact regularly with schemes at ground level by visiting and engaging with them throughout the country.<\/p> <p>The funding of any potential payment increases for rural social scheme and T&uacute;s participants is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will need to be considered in the wider economic and budgetary context.  I assure both Senators that I will ensure the points raised this morning will be relayed to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, and, with regard to the top-up payment, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#E00300","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

He has been doing tremendous work since taking office in building trade relations and expanding Ireland's trade opportunities, which bring employment.  I want to discuss the Intreo office on the Navan Road, which served people in the Dublin 7 area who find themselves without employment.  While I welcome the Minister of State's presence, it is disappointing that neither the Minister for Social Protection nor the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works found time to come to the House to address this issue.<\/p> <p>The Intreo office for Dublin 7 was an important office for those who need it, for those who find themselves having to turn to the State in a time of need.  That office was closed unannounced and unceremoniously back in April.  There were 40 or 50 people working there, which reflects how busy the office was, and there were no fewer than ten community welfare officers.  That shows the type of need for that office in that area.  The staff have been relocated to Parnell Street in the centre of town.<\/p> <p>The clients who went to that office on a daily and weekly basis have been left with the option of going into town, dealing with queries online or dialling a phone number that just goes unanswered.  We have a large elderly community in Dublin 7 and many of them are not online.  It is not reasonable for them to be expected to either hang on a phone all day for no answer, to be told to go online as they do not have access and they are not digitally literate, or to truck into town to Parnell Street.  There is very little parking on Parnell Street.  The Dublin 7 Intreo office on the Navan Road had parking and could accommodate people who have limited mobility and who depend on a car or on a loved one to bring them to the office.<\/p> <p>What I am hoping to get today for the people of Dublin 7 is an answer from either the Minister for Social Protection or the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, which manages the building, on a date for a reopening of that office.  I hope they have sent the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, with some good news for the people of the area.  I know from hearing from people on a daily basis that it is creating great inconvenience for them.  On top of the great inconvenience and upset, it is also a huge waste of State resources.  That office is in a brand new building and it is lying vacant.  I do not understand why any Department would leave an office like that lying vacant, with no date for putting it back into productive use.  I hope they have sent the Minister of State with some good news for the people of Dublin 7 and I look forward to his reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#F00400","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The Minister for Social Protection sends her apologies as she could not be here today.<\/p> <p>Significant maintenance and upgrade work to the Intreo centre on the Navan Road, Cabra, Dublin 7, had been scheduled for 2022.  Plans were put in place for staff to transfer to other Intreo centres for the duration of the work, with arrangements made for customers to be served by King&rsquo;s Inns Intreo centre, Parnell Street.  The work originally planned was premised on no significant changes being made to the services being provided by the Navan Road Intreo centre, the way those services are delivered and the layout of the building.  The Senator, like all of us, will be aware of the significant increase in construction and maintenance costs in recent months, including in building supplies.  It was decided, therefore, before finalising the works contract, to review the future use of the building at Navan Road to ensure efficient and effective use of resources.<\/p> <p>As has been the case with other organisations and services, many customers of the Department of Social Protection have moved to accessing departmental services online over the past two years.  This has largely been in response to the social distancing implications brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, despite the fact Intreo centres remained open to the public throughout the pandemic.  This had reduced the footfall into the Navan Road centre, including a significant decrease in the attendance of casual customers.<\/p> <p>A comprehensive review was undertaken in 2021 of all services and activities delivered by the Department's network of local offices with the purpose of determining the best future operating models for delivering these services and activities.  The review identified that significant portions of work that had previously taken place in Intreo centres had been moved to alternative work streams, with the most significant being the processing of payments by the national processing team and the handling of phone and electronic contacts by the national Intreo contact centre.  The review also identified substantial benefits for standardising and streamlining work previously replicated across the different local divisions.<\/p> <p>As a result of this review, dedicated work streams have been created for control operations, the community welfare service and the employment operations, which includes activation, community employment, T&uacute;s and employer engagement.  The impact of these changes and the new redistribution of work has given an opportunity for the division of staff working in Intreo offices to focus on vital customer-facing services, front-office services, information services, client identity services, claims maintenance, front-office control, day-to-day branch office interactions and facilities management.  With regard to the layout of the Department&rsquo;s Intreo centres, this means that instead of large waiting areas with rows of seats and multiple hatches, the Department will be providing self-service zones with interactive touchscreens, child-friendly spaces and autism-supportive sensory rooms.  The layout will reflect the fact many customers will be there by appointment and, therefore, will not need to queue.  The work in the Navan Road Intreo centre had been planned some time ago and it was considered appropriate to pause the works while further consideration was given to the optimal use of the building.<\/p> <p>That is the reply I have been asked to share with the Senator today.

As we know, artificial intelligence and machine learning are transformative technologies and are about solving very complex issues.  We are already seeing it happening in everything from legal contracts being checked to identifying pieces of music or of birdsong, and it is being used in drone and machine delivery of food.  Even yesterday, the most recent announcement about the Dublin MetroLink referred to it being an automated train system with trains driven by artificial intelligence, AI, machine learning.<\/p> <p>I have no doubt we will see robots using AI machine learning and 3-D printers to deliver homes.  It is interesting that while some of this new world fills us with fear, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs reported two weeks ago that the deployment of AI will not result in any job losses but that we need to adapt and change as a society to avail of the opportunities it presents. <\/p> <p>I was very happy to see the publication in July last year of the strategy, AI - Here for Good: A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland.  The concern when a strategy is published is that it will be left on a shelf and no progress will be made.  I am aware, however, that the Minister of State has appointed a national AI ambassador and set up the enterprise digital advisory forum.  In addition, in a very welcome step, he set up the digital transition fund which will support business in adapting and using AI.  I know that there also are plans to engage with young people.<\/p> <p>Key in terms of Government strategy, and this was signalled in the AI strategy, has to be the building of trust among people.  We have seen in recent years fears, unfounded in many cases, being built up by small groups around science and technology.  I am speaking here about anti-vaxxers and anti-5G groups.  It is essential, therefore, that the Government take an active role in ensuring that people understand the potential of AI and the opportunities it presents.  That is not just a challenge for Government.  Business, higher education and others also have a responsibility to inform the public debate on this.<\/p> <p>I note the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs recommended two weeks ago that we should have a new AI apprenticeship.  I would certainly like to see that.  The expert group also recommended that a free AI course be made available for all citizens so that they can learn how to more effectively use and deploy AI and also simply understand how it operates.<\/p> <p>The Government approach in the AI strategy, which I welcome, is very much based on human rights and ethics.  This has to be a whole-of-government approach.  We can deploy AI in a clever way, for instance, in meeting some of our climate change targets in agriculture.  If we use AI effectively, we could ensure the effective use of agricultural resources and monitor soil and animals.<\/p> <p>I am concerned about moves to introduce facial recognition technology, even in these Houses.  Facial recognition technology can be used for good.  For instance, in India up to 10,000 children who were missing were identified using facial recognition technology.  In contrast, however, we have China, which has effectively become a surveillance society through the use of facial recognition technology.  It is important that if we deploy this technology, it is done with full public consultation and informed by human rights and ethics.<\/p> <p>I am a little concerned that the Department of Justice intends to roll out its own AI strategy.  The use of AI or facial recognition technology could be welcome in fighting crime but it is essential that it adhere to the terms of the Government strategy, with a particular emphasis, obviously, on ethics and the protection of human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#G00500","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Malcolm Byrne for raising this issue.  I know he has a great interest in this area and all new and emerging technologies.  As alluded to by the Senator, in July last year, the Taoiseach and I launched AI - Here for Good: A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland.  The strategy sets out how Ireland can be an international leader in using Al to benefit our economy and society, through a people-centred, ethical approach to its development, adoption and use, as the Senator said.   It presents an integrated framework to manage the expected beneficial socioeconomic opportunities that Al presents.  We have paid particular attention to the ethical and societal aspects of Al, highlighting both the benefits and possible risks of Al technologies.<\/p> <p>The national strategy is aligned with the evolving EU and OECD policy direction of ensuring both an ecosystem of excellence and an ecosystem of trust.  The strategy is in favour of a governance and regulatory framework that avoids setting unnecessary barriers to responsible innovation.  At the same time, the governance and regulatory framework needs to be robust enough that it can build trust in the ethical use of Al. <\/p> <p>On a regulatory front, work is under way at European level on an Al Act, which will set harmonised rules for the development, placement on the market and use of Al systems.  Crucial to this is a proportionate risk-based approach.  Certain particularly harmful Al practices are prohibited as contravening European Union values, while specific restrictions and safeguards are proposed on certain uses in areas such as recruitment, health, welfare and law enforcement, including remote biometric identification systems.<\/p> <p>Al applications, such as facial recognition technology, may have a role to play, for example, in some specific cases of law enforcement.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Robert Troy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, it is my firm belief we need to have regulatory structures in place to ensure its safe deployment.<\/p><p>As the transformative potential of artificial intelligence, AI, becomes clearer, so too do the risks posed by the use of unethical, unsafe or insecure AI systems.

As AI becomes more and more part of our daily lives, it is important public trust, knowledge and engagement with AI is built and maintained.  To that end, I appointed an AI ambassador who will lead a national conversation to ensure we demystify AI but also to make sure everybody is aware and understands the great opportunities and benefits AI can bring to society and to the economy. <\/p><p>I also appointed an Enterprise Digital Advisory Forum, which will support and advise Government in driving the digitalisation of enterprise across Ireland, including the uptake of AI by businesses.  The Senator mentioned the digital fund we announced a few weeks ago.  Officials in my Department are working with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Inclusion and Youth and planning a national youth assembly on AI to ensure our youth have an input in the future direction of AI.  <\/p><p>Last month CeADAR, the centre for AI and applied data analytics, took another step closer to becoming a designated European digital innovation hub, which will serve as the national first-stop shop for AI transformation in SMEs and public organisations.  Last month, the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, and I welcomed the publication of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, to which the Senator alluded.

It is always good to see people who want to see democracy in action.  I support the Order of Business as outlined by the Deputy Leader but there are a few things I want to bring up.  First, it was a very good announcement last night regarding the extra &euro;100 towards back-to-school costs.  We all know the implications to parents of an impending September and it is a very difficult time of the year.  Barnardos and the Irish League of Credit Unions have done excellent work in that regard through their surveys.  Added to this is free transport, which is another great development, and the extra hot meals for 60,000 children - an investment of &euro;67 million.  There is still more to go and I appeal to the Ministers for Education, Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, when they are speaking about back to school costs, to look at raising the capitation allowance for students and finally get rid of the dreaded voluntary contribution.<\/p> <p>That brings to mind the parent and student school charter legislation, which went through both Houses in 2019 and has not been implemented yet.  This is excellent legislation that will give parents and students the opportunity to discuss costs in schools with school authorities and the management board.  I ask the Deputy Leader if she could put pressure on the Minister in terms of getting this implemented and finding out the delay in it.<\/p> <p>I also raise the issue of pension abatements.  This policy was originally designed to stop highly paid civil servants and politicians from retiring during the financial crises in 2011 with sizeable pensions and lumps sums and then returning the public sector.  I appreciate my colleague, Senator Craughwell, has also raised this many times.  However, it is negatively affecting those who are not so highly paid, particularly those from the Army who have left and gone back into other jobs.  Ex-Defence Forces personnel, who would never have earned a lot in the first place and would not have a big pension, are getting caught in this system.  We need to look at it and make sure there is equity there.  If people wish to work and continue working, we should be able to support them without them being financially penalised.<\/p> <p>A tweet from Dr. Mary Wingfield caught my eye yesterday.  Dr. Wingfield was in Milan at the European Atlas of Fertility Treatment Policies.  Ireland is practically at the very bottom of the list.  We are 40th out of 43 countries, which is absolutely shocking.  We know according to data that one in every six couples has fertility problems.  We absolutely need to help to support them.  I acknowledge the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, has opened five out of six fertility hubs promised and the remaining one will be open in Nenagh at the end of this year, but the elephant in the room is IVF.  There has to be an absolute commitment from this Government to support financially IVF for couples and that should be made in the budget.  I echo that call.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#K00300","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 2 be amended by the deletion of all words after \"12.45 p.m.\" and the substitution of the following: \"and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, adjourn after two hours\".

It was interesting to hear Senator O'Loughlin welcoming people to the Visitors Gallery, as indeed do I, and commenting on how desirable it is that people see democracy in action, when this very day we have a Government using its two thirds majority in the Seanad to spit in the face of our democracy by proposing, yet again, the disgraceful use of the tactic of the guillotine to prevent the full discussion of legislation in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#K00400","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#K00500","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I am talking about Bills as important as the Electoral Reform Bill, to which I have one amendment and my colleagues, including the university Senators, have amendments, and the very important Higher Education Authority Bill, about which the university Senators have major concerns which are reflected in amendments we have proposed, amendments which will probably not get heard because the Government wants to ram through legislation at the end of term because it has not being doing its job properly up to now instead of allowing legislation the time it needs to be properly discussed.<\/p> <p>I mention another example of the lack of respect for democracy.  Today, we have the launch of a report from the Joint Committee on International Surrogacy.  My colleague, Senator Keogan, who wanted to present a minority report but was not facilitated in doing so, points out that none of the potential witnesses who had valid dissenting views and questions about commercial surrogacy to put to the committee was allowed to participate.  They were purposely and tactically excluded.  It seems to me that surrogacy is one of those issues where we increasingly have government by media.  There is a one-sided, soft-focused presentation on radio, but one would expect the national Parliament, Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann, to make sure there would be thorough and fair scrutiny in its Chamber debates and in its committee.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Chambers and I had our disagreements on the Oireachtas all-party committee on the eighth amendment.

That has not happened with the Joint Committee on International Surrogacy.  In fact, the only public thing we have seen from it so far was the disgraceful treatment of my colleague, Senator Keogan, by fellow Senators and by Deputies.  She was effectively bullied for having a different view and communicating it respectfully.  That is a stain on our democracy.  The Oireachtas must rise to the challenge we face in these times.  We cannot be the place where dissenting voices get cancelled.  We have to be the remedy to that problem in our society by insisting that people who have mandates of various kinds get to represent the views of their electorate fully and thoroughly.  That starts with not guillotining legislation and continues with committees being ready to hear different points of view instead of just coming with one-sided reports and recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#K00600","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I concur with the statements on guillotining and cutting off debates.  It seems to happen every year as if we did not know the summer recess was going to come and we suddenly have to hurtle through business.<\/p> <p>Today at 12 noon outside the gates of Leinster House, Equality for Children and a number of other organisations including the National Infertility Support Information Network, LGBT Ireland, and the Independent Living Movement Ireland are calling on us to stand with their families.  Currently, in Ireland, thousands of children are being denied the right to have their families legally recognised.  I am sure many of us will be in the Chamber at that time but if anyone is not, those groups will be outside the gates.<\/p> <p>The majority of LGBTQI+ couples and approximately one in six Irish heterosexual couples require assisted human reproduction, AHR, treatment to be able to conceive a child.  However, most children born through this treatment are left in an uncertain legal position without any functioning legal framework to establish a legal parent-child relationship with both of their parents.  This has many practical impacts for the children of these families in areas such as birth registration, citizenship provisions, childcare, education provision, access to social welfare, succession and inheritance rights among other things.  The Government has published a report on children's rights and best interests in the context of AHR.  It was written by the Special Rapporteur for Child Protection, Professor Conor O'Mahony, who recently said he will not seek another term.  I acknowledge the work he has done on this.  If adopted, the recommendations contained in this report would address numerous legislative gaps that prevent children conceived through AHR from having a legal parent-child relationship with both the parents who love and care for them on a daily basis.  The groups outside the gates are calling on the Government and the Minister for Health to immediately adopt and implement these recommendations.<\/p> <p>The report provides clear, practical solutions that uphold the rights and best interests of children, including their right to family life, identity and non-discrimination.  It recognises the reality of AHR treatment.  It also addresses the need to take into account the circumstances of individual children, including those who have been born, in order that they can establish a legal parental relationship to the parents who love and care for them daily.  It highlights the need to provide comprehensive legislation in a wide range of areas, including addressing the gaps left in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022.<\/p> <p>The report acknowledges the distress caused to children born through AHR and their families due to the absence of appropriate legislation.  Children have been left in a vulnerable legal position for lengthy periods due to the failure of the Oireachtas to legislate and address their status.  Significantly, the report recognises the uneven impact this has had on children conceived outside clinical settings and born to LGBT parents who cannot rely on the presumption of paternity and maternity as opposite-sex couples can.  This goes against a significant pillar of our campaign for and belief in equality for children.  I draw Senators' attention to the protest outside Leinster House today and request that we get a move on that legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#L00200","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I concur with the comments made about the guillotine.  It is shocking in our democracy and should not be allowed.  I want to raise the progress of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 progress through this House.  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, stated that he now believes it will be impossible to progress the Bill through all Stages in the Seanad before the recess.  It is hard to express how I feel about this development.  I welcome his commitment to examine the points raised by Deputies Ward, Cairns and others during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the D&aacute;il.  As they have pointed out, the Bill is deeply flawed in several crucial ways.  Its exclusion of people formerly detained under the Mental Health Act is deeply discriminatory, as is the exclusion of 16- and 17-year-olds who are allowed to make decisions about their physical health but not their mental health.  I hope that these issues are addressed by Government amendments or that Opposition amendments are accepted.  However, I am crucially aware of the harm that this delay will cause.  The legislation is supposed to replace the deeply flawed wardship system.  While it is delayed people are being taken into wardship and are being denied this opportunity of supported decision-making that will better vindicate their rights and autonomy.  If the Bill is to be delayed until after the recess, then we need a commitment that it will be passed before the budget.<\/p> <p>I want to make a broader point about the legislative process.  This Government has taken on responsibility for delivering legislation on legacy issues and other important, emotionally charged topics.  That is a difficult task and much of it has been led by the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, who undoubtedly has a difficult job, but whether it is the records Bill, the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 or the Institutional Burials Bill 2022, there seems to be a pattern of inconsistent and inadequate engagement with stakeholders.  These are issues of tremendous significance, and many courageous and dedicated individuals and organisations have spent significant time and effort campaigning on these issues.  Our legislative process is supposed to ensure they feel included and understood, yet they continuously experience disappointment and dissatisfaction with the process.  This failure needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>As legislators, we should be led by the people who are affected by the decisions we make.  There are many reasons this is not the case such as the complexity of legislation, the opacity of the drafting process and the uneven rhythm of the legislative process.  Mostly it feels like very little is happening on a given issue and then the process unfolds so quickly that it is difficult to make one&rsquo;s voice heard.  I do not have the answer to this problem but it is an issue that degrades our democracy and dilutes the wealth of knowledge, experience and insight that campaigners and civil society share with us.

It was a very welcome initiative to see both the social and the environmental organisations come together to call for a true just transition.  We know that 29% of Irish households are currently living in energy poverty.  That is the highest number that has ever been recorded.  Average household energy Bills have increased by &euro;1,100 in one year and the rising costs of energy continue to disproportionately impact households in the bottom 20% of the income distribution, who spend a higher percentage of their income on energy.<\/p> <p>We had an issue with energy poverty in this country long before the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis.  We heard today from civil society groups such as Age Action, Community Law &amp;amp; Mediation, Disability Federation Ireland, the European Anti-Poverty Network, Friends of the Earth, Irish Rural Link, the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, Social Justice Ireland, the Think-tank for Action on Social Change and Threshold that the current system of addressing climate change and energy poverty is deeply unfair and that unless we have a system whereby we reduce our carbon emissions through a retrofitting programme that will also reduce energy poverty, all we are doing is transferring wealth up in society to those who can afford to retrofit their homes and put in heat pumps while the rest of society is left behind.  It is a very important message and I thank the colleagues who came to hear it.<\/p> <p>The energy poverty strategy lapsed in 2019, which shows that it is not a priority for this Government.  I do not know how many times I have raised it in this House.  A report by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said that we did not have the data to see what sort of social impact our retrofitting scheme was having on households.  I encourage everybody, especially coming up to the early budget, to read this document and the joint statement and to look very closely at the solutions they are putting forward.  Nobody is saying we do not have to meet our climate targets, but we have to do it in a fair way.

I wonder if we forget those Irishmen and Irishwomen who travelled, particularly to the UK, during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s with shovels and nothing else.  Quite a number of them live a very lonely existence today.  Is it terrible to ask RT&Eacute; to maintain the long-wave channel?  I have seen the arguments.  People ask why do they not log-on to their mobile phones and why do they not go onto the Internet.  These are simple people who went to the UK, many of them sending home fivers, tenners and &pound;15 a week to educate those of us who stayed at home or to keep those of us who lived in Ireland in body and soul.  I would like this House to use all of its powers to ask RT&Eacute; to maintain that channel for a period of time and I would ask the Cathaoirleach to row in behind that.<\/p><p>There has been some discussion this morning on the surrogacy report published.

I disagree with many people in this House but I defend every person in this House's right to say what he or she wants, when he or she wants, and how he or she wants.

We met with the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan, the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland.  One common theme that has come up over the past couple of meetings in particular is the issue of the summer provision.  We have a situation at present where a significant number of special schools in the country are not providing the summer provision.  In fact, the children whom the summer provision was set up for in the first instance three-to-four years ago are the ones who are not getting it and they are the children who are most in need.<\/p> <p>There are parents struggling to get teachers and special needs assistants to do the home provision.  The reason we set it up was to look after those children with high needs and they are now not getting the provision.  We need to look at it, if it is not too late, for the last two weeks of July.  Every special school in the country should be compelled to provide the provision.  We need to look at what they have done in Newbridge about which I spoke to Senator Wall yesterday where the four schools in the town have come together and each year at least one of the schools will provide that provision to make sure that the children in that area get what they are entitled to, what they need and what they deserve.<\/p> <p>I also want to raise the issue of the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA.  It is an issue I have raised regularly here over the past 12 months.  The governance review report was published following the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, of which I am a member, asking the IABA to come in to the committee to tell us that there as was nothing wrong with the association.  The report has 64 recommendations, none of which refer to the people who are in charge of the sport who have been in the public domain for a long number of years.<\/p> <p>If we are to move on with the sport and with the IABA, we need to do it by removing those who are in charge of the association.  We saw 30 volunteers suspended last year in the middle of elections, the results of which still have not been announced despite the vote having taken place.  All 30 of those won their case when they had to go at their own expense to defend themselves through Sport Dispute Solutions Ireland.  That result has never been published because the IABA does not want it published.<\/p> <p>We had the situation in the past three weeks where the issue with regard to the Bernard Dunne case and two directors was put before the IABA internal disciplinary committee of three independent solicitors.  It has been in the media over the past 12 to 18 months.  That result has never been published but the result is that unanimously those two individuals won their case and it was thrown out.  There is a vote this weekend in relation to this review and I believe, for boxing to move forward, we need to remove those who have been at the helm of this organisation for the past eight or nine years and have been at the root of many of the problems within the association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#N00200","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I want to raise the issue about the retirement of senior members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Last week, with only a week's notice, a private company, Dublin Coach, announced it would suspend its 307-308 bus service, which goes from Limerick city centre to the University of Limerick and on to Annacotty.  To explain, Castletroy, which this bus service serves, is one of the fastest growing areas, not only in Munster but in the country.  This is shocking news because students and families depend on these services.<\/p> <p>Here is the point.  I am making a clear call this morning to Bus &Eacute;ireann to step in and expand its services to include Newtown and the route from Monaleen school to Supervalu.  The difficult is that when one raises issues with Bus &Eacute;ireann, it immediately refers one on to the National Transport Authority.  Everybody here knows there is no comeback from the National Transport Authority.  It is literally throwing a request into a black hole.  It is not good enough.<\/p> <p>People want accountability.  I want Bus &Eacute;ireann to respond to the need that people in Castletroy have and the service gap there is now to increase services for families and students to ensure that people do not have to take their cars when going to university and when going into Limerick city centre.  I also want to see an expansion of services to the greater Castleconnell area, which makes perfect sense as well.  We could take hundreds of cars off the road each morning if we had a regular service in Castleconnell instead of the three-hourly service that we have at present.<\/p> <p>My problem, frankly, is how do we get the attention, not only of Bus &Eacute;ireann but of the National Transport Authority.  I have heard other Senators complain about this in the past.  I want a debate about it.  Right now, the National Transport Authority is simply not accountable in terms of reasonable requests about expansion of services.  We cannot wait for years.  What we need is a guarantee from Bus &Eacute;ireann that before September comes we will see an expansion of its services to take up the gaps in the market that now exist and ensure that we have decent bus services so that people in Castletroy and the wider Limerick area do not have to rely on private car transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#N00400","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Carrigy about his concerns with regard to the Irish Athletic Boxing Association.

She is also seeking the establishment of a comprehensive EU mental health strategy and for minimum requirements for teleworking across the EU to be defined.  This is crucial because, while we want to discuss well-being, the impact of working online has to be considered.  In many cases, it is non-stop and 24-7.  When it comes to mental health and the digital world of work, we want to support people being able to work from home.  We in the regions know how important it is that people do not have to commute for several hours to get to work.

Some changes were made on foot of speaking to Senator Ruane, as well as Senator Higgins, who is not here but who was speaking to the Leader.  Changes were made to the schedule but I accept that not all the changes that were requested were made.  Out of respect for Members, I wanted to be honest about where things were at and what we were dealing with.<\/p> <p>On the contributions on the Oder of Business, Senator O'Loughlin welcomed the significant investment announced yesterday by the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, in respect of the cost of going back to school.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is a particular pinch point for many families.  Those costs are accruing and being incurred now by families.  There will be an additional &euro;100 payment under the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  An extra &euro;67 million has been allocated for that scheme.  Some 60,000 children will also benefit from extra school meals.<\/p><p>I take on board the Senator's comments around the need to increase the capitation grant and to remove the voluntary contribution which, as we know, is not voluntary in many schools.  Anecdotally, we hear evidence that some schools put pressure on parents to pay that voluntary contribution in the full knowledge they cannot afford it.  We ask schools to be mindful of that, particularly in the context of the situation with which we are dealing.<\/p><p>I also take on board the Senator's comments about pension abatements.  It is an issue Senator Craughwell has raised on many occasions.  That would be an appropriate Commencement matter if the Senator would like to raise it.<\/p><p>The Senator also raised the issue of funding for IVF, which is a matter many Senators have raised, and the need to provide funding in budget 2023 to assist families that require IVF treatment.  We know that the World Health Organization classifies infertility as a disease.  It is one of the only diseases that we do not financially support individuals to deal with and get the treatment they need.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen asked for an amendment to No. 2, which I will not be able to accept.  I do, however, take on board his comments.  He spoke in particular about the Joint Committee on International Surrogacy, as did Senators Clifford-Lee and Craughwell.  Senator Craughwell referenced Senator Keogan in his contribution.  I was not present at the proceedings to which the Senators referred.  I know there have been some difficulties at the committee.  I agree with the points made by Senator Craughwell, albeit we were not a party to those proceedings.  It is important that all views are accommodated in both Houses and at committee meetings.  Senator Mullen spoke about the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of which he and I were members.  We had many debates that were quite fiery and where we disagreed.  We were on completely opposite sides.  It is important that all views are accommodated and listened to and that all debate is respectful.  I take on board Senator Ruane's comments that we should never seek to upset individuals, committee members or witnesses.  All debate should be respectful.  I am always mindful that if we were to go back 40 years, the views that I hold on the eighth amendment and abortion services would probably not have been facilitated to the extent they are today.  It is important that we accommodate people's views.  Even though I am in the majority today, that may not be the case at a time in the future so it is important that we ensure a balance.  We do not know at what stage things might change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#O01300","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>On a point of order, there were no difficulties about how the committee business was done.

There are families still awaiting support.  I know Senator Clifford-Lee also spoke those issues.  Many of us are tied up today but perhaps as many Senators as possible could get out there, wish the protestors well and thank them for making the time to come to Leinster House and make us aware of those issues.<\/p> <p>Senator Black asked about the timeline for a Bill.

A Commencement matter might be best because that is quite a specific question.<\/p> <p>Senator Clifford-Lee welcomed the report of the surrogacy committee, which I have dealt with.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell has proposed an amendment to No. 3.

I take on board his comments.<\/p> <p>Senator Carrigy spoke as a member of the newly formed Joint Committee on Autism.  He spoke about the issue of summer provision which has come up on many occasions.  I suggest he submits a Commencement matter in that regard as it is quite a specific issue.<\/p> <p>Senator Lombard spoke about the retirement age for senior garda&iacute; and the brain drain that happens when we lose senior personnel.  He has requested a debate, which we will try to arrange for the autumn session.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan spoke about the local issue of bus services in Limerick.  I have not been briefed about Dublin Coach, the private bus operator that has removed services.  I suggest the Senator contacts the Minister for Transport directly or submits a Commencement matter to seek further detail on that specific local issue.<\/p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about the Ahare River in north Wexford.  He has asked for the support and assistance of the Office of Public Works because there is a flooding issue.  I suggest he submits a Commencement matter on the topic, which is quite specific.  I have not been briefed on the details of the issue.  I take on board his comments about the Irish Athletic Boxing Association.  There are ongoing issues in respect of that organisation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, is doing a lot of work in that space.  <\/p> <p>Travel costs for public sector workers are becoming a serious issue.  As Members will be aware, approximately 80 cent is paid for a certain number of kilometres but that payment falls if somebody travels further.  The travel and subsistence allowance is not even covering the costs of public workers who are on the road as part of their jobs.  The costs of getting to work and doing the job are not covered.  Fuel prices have doubled.  For example, staff who are doing inspections for the Health and Safety Authority are on the road three to five days a week.  Their travel costs are not covering the cost of doing their jobs.  That needs to be addressed.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is mindful that any response cannot relate only to pay and that there are other areas where pressures on workers can be alleviated and the Government can assist with cost-of-living issues.<\/p> <p>Senator Dolan spoke about mental health and the work being done in the European Parliament.  It is not a competency of the European Parliament but at the same time, it is important that it is mindful of that important overarching work.  We have a lot of work to do domestically on mental health.  We are in a far better place than we were ten years ago and have come a long way.  I commend Maria Walsh MEP on her work in that area.  It is an important area of work to continue to highlight and to give a voice to those people.<\/p> <p>I am not in a position to accept Senator Boyhan's amendment to No. 4.  I take on board his comments about city and county councillors and the removal of those councillors from the boards of educational institutions.  They will be in a position to apply for those positions but it is not the same as having a set place for those councillors.  I have yet to hear the rationale or logic behind that decision.  Local elected members have a mandate to represent their local areas.  That is an important perspective to have on the board of a university or college that is operating in a municipal district or local authority area.  Members are representing the views of the locality and the people in the area in which the college is operating.  Theirs are important voices and I am not sure that has been properly considered by the Minister.  The Senator's views are agreed with across the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#P00600","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Senator Mullen has moved an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That in respect of No. 2, all words after \"12.45 p.m.\" be substituted by the following. \"and the proceedings thereon shall if not previously concluded, adjourn after two hours\".\"  Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#P00700","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#P00750","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"vote","time":1657098000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 14; N\u00edl, 19.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Michael McDowell and R\u00f3n\u00e1n Mullen; N\u00edl, Senators Lisa Chambers and Tim Lombard.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#P00800","aye":["1632","1634","1635","1645","1657","1660","1662","1663","1664","1669","1673","1688","1681","1683"],"nay":["1629","1633","1638","1639","1642","1643","1646","1648","1651","1653","1654","1656","1666","1667","1670","1671","1674","1692","1694"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Senator McDowell has moved an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That the proposal re No. 3 be substituted by the following, \"to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2 and that the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be adjourned after four hours\".\"  Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#S00100","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#S00200","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"vote","time":1657098000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 14; N\u00edl, 20.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Gerard P.

Again, because time is unnecessarily constrained, I will be brief.  On the very first day of the last Oireachtas, we moved a Bill for Seanad reform.  That was back in 2016.  We were asked by the then Government, which included one of the parties still currently in government, to suspend our Bill so we would have a cross-party group who would work together in a committee to come up with cross-party legislation.<\/p> <p>A number of us who are here in this House, from all parties, including Senators Warfield, McDowell, Cassells, me and others, worked for hours and hours over eight months to develop legislation which was then voted on and agreed as cross-party legislation.  We delivered that to the Government, which promptly parked it.<\/p> <p>Coming into this Oireachtas, we were told again that progress would be made.  When we brought back that cross-party, agreed legislation on Seanad reform, we were told that these issues would be addressed as part of the Electoral Reform Bill - that was where it would be coming through, that is where action would be taken, that is where progress would be made.  Again, we have been disappointed and despite the fact there are a vast number of last-minute amendments on all kinds of issues that have been added into this Electoral Reform Bill, there is nothing about Seanad reform.<\/p> <p>I will not go through each of the amendments in turn because my colleague has done so.  These amendments would at least start preparing the ground for some of the measures in that agreed Seanad reform legislation, including things like preparing the register and preparing measures around nominations.  At a very minimum, amendment No. 54 simply asks that we would have, within 12 months, a report outlining exactly how long-promised Seanad reform was going to come about.<\/p> <p>I sometimes get tired of people saying the Seanad will not reform because it cannot reform.  The Seanad is very willing to reform itself and Members of this Seanad have been passionate about driving through reform.  Let us be very clear that it is the Government that has been blocking it systematically all the way.  Will the Minister of State at least agree to amendment No. 54, which makes a commitment that, within 12 months, clear measures would be put forward on how to deliver the promise from two different Governments to implement the Manning report?  If not, will the Minister of State support the Seanad reform Bill, if we bring it forward collectively together, since the Government has not chosen to take action on this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#W00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>This is a subject which is very close to my heart.  When Members rise on the business of the House, they have some small amount of time, some three to six minutes or thereabouts, to express themselves on the issue.  It is well worthwhile to elaborate on what Senator Higgins has just said.<\/p> <p>The history of this is as follows, and let it be stitched into the record of this House.  At a time when his leadership of the Fine Gael Party was under strong pressure, the then leader of the party, Enda Kenny, fearing a heave, decided to come up with a gimmick.  The gimmick he decided to come up with was to announce, without any internal discussion whatsoever in the party, at a party dinner - I think it was in Citywest - that he was going to propose the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Many people in Fine Gael were astonished and shocked at this stunt, which it was, but that was his proposal.<\/p> <p>When he got into government, he duly prepared legislation to mutilate our Constitution, to leave large holes in it, to take away the supervisory role of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, to scrap completely the idea of a second House and to amend the present Constitution, which at least gives this House a right of veto over any proposal to abandon our veto in the European Union.  All of that was to be swept away in order to satisfy the gimmicky stunt of abolition, which he had come up with without any pre-thought or pre-discussion.<\/p> <p>Let us remember what happened then.  The people of Ireland were told it was important to get rid of this House because it would save &euro;25 million per annum.  Of course, that was an inflated figure but it does not matter as that was what was run up on lampposts all over the country.  A cynical campaign was then launched to abolish Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I participated, with other people, in its defence on television, and I was at that stage not a Member of the Oireachtas at all.  I recall that the late Senator Feargal Quinn asked me to come and speak to Senators from right across the political spectrum in this House at a meeting he convened to discuss the proposal.  We had a discussion and many of the people who were Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann came along and expressed complete horror at the consequences of abolishing Seanad &Eacute;ireann as proposed.  Feargal Quinn, Katherine Zappone, who was then a Member of the House, Noel Whelan, former Senator Joe O'Toole and myself all got together to establish a group called Democracy Matters.  It successfully contested a referendum, in combination with the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, which opposed the proposal.<\/p> <p>The people of Ireland rejected the proposal to abolish Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The Taoiseach at the time, Enda Kenny, referred to the result as \"a wallop\".  It was a well-deserved smack across the face for the cynicism that had brought him to that point.  Let us be clear about what happened after that.  I should say that in the course of the campaign, he had said that if the people voted to retain it, he would not reform it at all.  He did not want the people to have that option of thinking it could be reformed.  However, he then did yet another U-turn and decided that he was going to institute a reform process.  He invited former Senator Maurice Manning to examine the whole process of reform without a further constitutional amendment, which he did.  I was very honoured to be asked by Joe O'Toole and Maurice Manning to assist them with the drafting of their report and to show what could be done within the terms of the present Constitution to make the election of this House more democratic.<\/p> <p>Having established this group, Mr. Kenny then went on to have another election, where he said that implementation of the Manning report would be part of the Government programme, and this was in combination with the Labour Party.  Having done that, he did precisely nothing - he did not lift a finger to bring that about.  Katherine Zappone, who was then a Government Minister in that Administration, pressed strongly at Cabinet that something should be done about this.  Eventually, there was a change of leader in Fine Gael and Deputy Leo Varadkar succeeded Enda Kenny.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the meantime, Senator Feargal Quinn had asked me to stand for the NUI constituency because he wanted to retire from politics.  To progress the Seanad reform project, it was agreed that an implementation group would be established.  The group was established and, as Senator Higgins said, it was all-party.  We set for ourselves, and we were given, terms of reference that were demanding.  Within eight months, we had to produce the legislation to give effect to the Manning report and to make any recommendations for its amendment to make it more acceptable.  We did all that work, and we went through every aspect of electing the Seanad.  Due to other things, there was quite a controversy about who should chair the group, but eventually it chose me as its chairperson.  I will not go into what the then Minister, former Deputy Shane Ross, did or did not attempt to do in respect of that matter.  <\/p><p>In the end, however, we produced our report.  More important than that, though, we decided that we would not just produce a report that could lie on some politician&rsquo;s table.  We asked for, and we were given, a professional parliamentary draftsman to embody our proposals in draft legislation.  The cost of doing that was borne by the Taoiseach's Department, with the agreement of the then Taoiseach, and present T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar.  We worked might and main to meet our deadlines.  It was a thoroughly democratic and inclusive process.  We listened to everybody and everybody participated.  Nobody was excluded or stigmatised as a minority person.  Everyone was free to participate in the production of the report.  We presented it, and I duly sent it to the Taoiseach in time and with the draft Bill attached to it.<\/p><p>Nothing happened for a couple of months.  Disturbed by that, I went to see the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, in his office to ask him what he intended to do in respect of the whole process of Seanad reform.  I want this House to know that he told me that he had no intention whatsoever of moving the legislation in the D&aacute;il, that he himself had supported the abolition of the Seanad and that the most he would do for the legislation, which was, of course, a sentence of death, was to allow a free vote on it if it was put forward by somebody else.  That is what the then Taoiseach said.  It was pretty cynical stuff.  As Senator Higgins said, we had worked for eight months.  We had done our level best to bring about a situation which I will describe as follows.<\/p><p>This House now has 43 Members elected by approximately 1,200 people, that is, county and city councillors, incoming Members of the Oireachtas and outgoing Senators.  In the Constitution, there is already provision for the franchise for the higher education seats in the Seanad, one of which I am honoured to occupy for the time being, to be widened to include other institutions apart from just the NUI colleges and Trinity College Dublin.  By the way, the Supreme Court has also accepted for consideration an appeal in litigation to consider whether there is a constitutional obligation to do something about the change in the Constitution that was made to allow for the extension of this higher education franchise.  Whether that litigation succeeds or not, and I doubt whether it is likely to do so in the courts, if we were to go down the road of allowing every higher education graduate in this country to have a vote, including those from the technological universities, the institutes of technology and all the established universities, the situation then, depending on what criteria were selected, would be that we would have an electorate of approximately 900,000 to perhaps 1,100,000 people.  They would be entitled to vote for six seats in this House, based on the increasing rate of participation in third level education.<\/p><p>Of course, that situation would leave out everybody without a university or third-level degree, including those people who are being encouraged by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and others, to take up apprenticeships.  It would exclude people who have never gone to university, people who have gone to work in businesses and people who have never been employed.  It would leave out a huge range of people.  People who came to Ireland with foreign university degrees would also have no say in the election of this House in such a situation, even if they became Irish citizens.  Of the 5.5 million people in the country now, or whatever the figure is, the situation I have described would leave about 80% of Irish people with no vote for these six higher education seats in the Seanad.  As time goes on, about 10% to 20% of people might have a vote on that panel.  Such a situation would also mean, however, that the other 43 seats would continue to be elected by roughly one thousandth of the electorate who would be voting for the six higher education seats.  If we were to say that there are approximately 1.2 million people eligible to vote for the six seats and then 1,200 councillors voting for the other 43 seats in this House, we get to that rough ratio of one in 1,000.  It would mean that a county councillor's vote would be worth 1,000 times any other citizen's vote to establish this House.<\/p><p>Our group came up with the simple proposal that, without changing the Constitution, it was quite lawful to extend the franchise to citizens who wished to be registered to vote in areas such as agriculture and the environment, culture and education, administration or industrial and commercial matters, if they were qualified on the higher education panels, however extended.  That proposal would ensure that everybody would be able to opt to have a vote in an area of interest to constitute Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  That is a radical proposal, but it is not all that radical when we think about it.  In fact, it is worthy of a republic that every one of its citizens should be regarded as equally entitled, in some respect, to participate in the selection of the Upper House.<\/p><p>People who vote for Senator Higgins and for me, who are a small minority, should not be a privileged few.  Everybody should have the right to vote in this context, if they chose to do so.  Many university graduates never even register to vote and those registers are hopelessly out of date and messy to function with.  In the context of our group's proposal, however, everybody was to have an opportunity to have some input into the constitution of this House.<\/p><p>This is the situation embodied in the legislation we brought before this House.  It was drafted at the Government&rsquo;s expense.  Despite the cynical game playing that went on to leave it on the shelf as soon as it was drafted, the legislation was drafted with the intention I spoke of and to bring all that about.  It was presented in this House by its proponents.  This Government, which had flooded the House with its own appointees and that had scrapped the idea that people from Northern Ireland or the diaspora would be included among the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees, was so anxious to fill up available candidacies in marginal seats that it simply was not even willing to allow the Bill that we put before this House to progress.  The Government put down an amendment to the proposal for the Second Stage reading of the Bill to postpone it for 12 months.  That period has now well and truly elapsed.  It elapsed during the Covid-19 period.<\/p><p>I will record what happened then.  I have the greatest respect for the Minister of State, and I know he is sincere in this matter.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It became clear he proposed to stall the legislative process for the Bill, with the Government having paid for its drafting.  Let us remember exactly what happened then.  He made it clear to this House he would come back with his own proposals, and the deadline passed more than a year ago.  It may have passed 14 months ago now and it was a deadline he set for himself to formulate proposals for reform.  I spoke to him about the matter because he contacted me and wanted to explain his position.  He told me he would do the following.  He said he would not consult everybody again but would set up a committee of Members of the Oireachtas from the Government parties, which are Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, to come up with their variant of the Manning report and associated proposals.  He told me the committee would meet in rapid order and have its conclusions ready by the early autumn of last year.<\/p><p>I have duly inquired of all Government parties whether anybody has ever heard of a proposal to do that or have such a group or meetings.  It has not happened.  Of course, I was sold a pup, having meekly made an assumption.  I indicated to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, at the time that I took in good faith what he said to the House were his instructions as to the Minister's intention.  I still believe the Minister of State acted in good faith and he believed the undertakings his senior Minister made to this House.<\/p><p>The Minister has not delivered, however, and he has never even bothered to lift the phone to explain why he has not delivered.  He never established that group and, as cynically as the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, simply ignored the matter and come up with the notion that, somehow, this legislation had to be prioritised over it.  There is no reason they should not proceed in tandem or this legislation could not have paved the way for Seanad reform.  There is not even a hint of Seanad reform in the legislation, and from this I draw the fair deduction, in fairness to the Government parties, that they do not intend to lift a finger to reform this House during this session.<\/p><p>I know the Green Party asked for Seanad reform to be included in the negotiations for the formation of the current Government and it was pl&aacute;m&aacute;sed too.  It seems to have fallen for the idea that something would be done but we would not have the recommendations of the Manning report brought into law in the form proposed in the legislation.<\/p><p>I put on record that what the Government has contrived to do is keep this House exactly as it was and offer no reform of any kind whatever.  It will continue the position where 1,200 people will elect 43 Members of this House and toy around with that process.  Senator Malcolm Byrne has toyed with legislation to extend the university franchise.  I realise the generosity of his spirit but I wonder how it is he could not think about expanding his own electorate in an equal way.  As I have said, the result is a two-tier society where on an entirely artificial basis people who hold certain diplomas from certain educational bodies would be given the opportunity to elect Members to six seats.  In any view of the matter, for the foreseeable future they are a small minority of the total population of the country.<\/p><p>I am a university Senator and the legislation we put forward respected that referendum result, doing its best to implement the outcome by putting up two models for consideration, both a majority and minority perspective.  The former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, recently spoke about the idea of directly elected mayors and his comments made much sense.  From what I can see is happening in Limerick, a job specification is being prepared that for a five-year term will make no difference at all.  The chief executive of Limerick City and County Council is to be redesignated the director general so the Custom House rule will continue to exist no matter what.<\/p><p>Mr. Ahern criticised the directly elected mayor proposal, making the point very simply that people would be elected as personality or single-issue candidates etc. and they would have to carry out a very complex function.  He implied the whole thing would be a sham.  He told the citizens' assembly that was his view and, God bless him, there is much to be said for the views he expressed.  If there are 1.2 million people addressing one ballot paper, or even if that is divided into two or three ballot papers, in order to elect six Senators, it would have the same effect.  One would have to be a household name to the power of n to have any chance to get elected in a single national constituency of 1.2 million people.  I do not know who would be elected but the process would certainly not be in the tradition of Garrett FitzGerald, John Kelly, Feargal Quinn and the others of the same ilk, such as James Dooge.  These were people who came from the university sector and brought that third level education perspective to debates.<\/p><p>I will not comment on the Order of Business that we had the dispute about today.  It now appears the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, having come here to say he would not guillotine anything and that he would give us as much time as we wanted, has told the Leader that his Bill to reform the third level sector must be rushed through effectively today and in one more day in four hours.  That is the kind of attitude we have, although it is a slightly irrelevant point.<\/p><p>The history of Fine Gael in particular with regard to Seanad reform has been shameful and cynical.  First, the party proposed to abolish the Seanad without any internal party discussion.  It sought to set up the Manning committee and the implementation group before, in private, saying there was no intention to do anything about it.  It is cynical and the public is entitled to know about it.  I could be given two or three minutes on the Order of Business to make these comments but I needed a bit more time.  The only time I am getting is through the amendments of Senator Higgins.  She would concur with me that the picture I have painted is a fair and reasonable one and not overly dramatised.  The depth of cynicism I have encountered on this is shocking.<\/p><p>A party that does this deserves bad luck and the way opinion polls are going, it will get that bad luck.  There shall be other people who may take the matter more seriously than the party has up to now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#W00300","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>We are moving beyond being relevant to the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#Y00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I strongly support the amendment before the House and the number of amendments that Senator Higgins and others have tabled in order to bring this back on the agenda.

I will make a general point on the discussion we have had.  I wholeheartedly support the notion of Seanad reform.  There was not a commitment to it in the programme for the Government.  It is a three-party programme for Government negotiated with three parties in good faith.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, gave a commitment to examine the issue further and I will be happy to take up that matter with my colleague.<\/p> <p>Our imperative here is to get this legislation passed.  It is critically important we establish the electoral commission from which will stem significant political reform and wider participation of the public and minority groups, in particular, in our democratic processes and system, about which Senator McDowell has spoken so eloquently.  I appreciate the frustration he expressed but, from the Government&rsquo;s perspective, it is critically important to get the commission established and have the legislation passed.<\/p> <p>I will speak to amendments Nos. 25, 36, 40, 53, 54 and 62 tabled by Senators Higgins, Ruane, Flynn and Black, which are in respect of the franchise for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Amendments Nos. 25, 36 and 40 propose to give an coimisi&uacute;n new additional functions in reviewing the electoral system, constituencies and franchise for Seanad &Eacute;ireann as well as the criteria by which the Taoiseach may nominate a person as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  While I understand the motivations for these amendments, I cannot accept them.<\/p> <p>The approach to the initial functions of an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in is balanced.  It brings in established functions that are relatively self-contained from the outset, as well as a significant suite of new functions, namely, the new research, advisory and public education function, online political advertising and oversight of the electoral register.  These initial functions give an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in a solid foundation and allow it to build up its organisational and operational capacity gradually.  In addition, we will benefit from having an coimisi&uacute;n up and running, while at the same time making the preparations for new additional functions to be transferred.  I am of the view that an coimisi&uacute;n is taking on a significant number of both new and existing electoral functions from the outset.  I am mindful of the need for an coimisi&uacute;n to get established and build up organisational capacity.  I do not intend to add to these functions at the present time.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 53 seeks to establish an electoral register for Seanad &Eacute;ireann, which would be maintained by an coimisi&uacute;n, and proposes to extend the franchise for the Seanad to Irish citizens who are resident in Ireland, citizens residing outside the State who hold a current and valid passport, to those entitled to Irish citizenship in Northern Ireland and to citizens holding a requisite qualification and who are graduates of an institution of higher education in this State as well as serving Members of the D&aacute;il, Members of the outgoing Seanad and serving members of local authorities.  This would mean the Seanad would have a significantly wider franchise than is in place for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  At a D&aacute;il election, only Irish and British citizens ordinarily resident in a constituency who are aged 18 or over can vote.  This amendment would create dual registers, one held by an coimisi&uacute;n and the other held by local authorities.  This is unnecessary duplication and would require careful consideration.<\/p> <p>As the Senators are aware, Part 3 provides for significant modernisation of the electoral registration process.  It would be prudent to allow this modernisation work to be completed.  For the foregoing reasons, I must oppose amendment No. 53.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 54 requires the Minister to submit a report to the Houses of the Oireachtas within 12 months of the passing of the Act outlining measures taken to reform the electoral franchise for the vocational panels and for universities constituencies of the Seanad as well as the criteria applied to the nomination of Members for Seanad &Eacute;ireann under Article 18 of the Constitution.  The Bill does not provide that the Minister would have a role in reporting to the Oireachtas on electoral matters.  In fact, with the establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in, we will now have an independent statutory body which can made recommendations and provide advice regarding electoral matters.  This is specifically provided for in Chapter 9 of Part 2 of the Bill, which sets out in detail the research, advisory and voter education functions of an coimisi&uacute;n.  I do not propose to depart from the general principles set out in the Bill regarding research and advice on electoral matters and I am therefore not in a position to accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 62 seeks to amend section 94 of the existing Bill and to allow a registration authority to enter the name of a person on the pending electoral list in the register of electors of a constituency of Seanad &Eacute;ireann in the scenario where the franchise for such elections is extended.  Section 94 provides for the preregistration of 16- and 17-year-olds on the pending electors list and the inclusion of these persons on the register when they turn 18 years.  Currently, registration authorities do not manage the electoral register for Seanad &Eacute;ireann elections.  I note this proposed amendment is framed on a conditional basis to provide for a circumstance in which the franchise for such elections has been extended.  The extension of the franchise in elections for Seanad &Eacute;ireann would in itself require legislation to have effect.  That would be the appropriate time for this type of arrangement or similar to be considered.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#Z00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I am less confident following the Minister of State's reply given we have been told there are so many functions for the new electoral commission that it cannot take on the Seanad.  There is not even a promise that the commission will engage with this issue.  Rather, we are being told the reform of the Seanad franchise is not even being considered as part of the agenda for the electoral commission.  That completely contradicts much of what we have heard.<\/p> <p>I will not reiterate everything we have heard about the pretty shameful timeline and various obfuscations in regard to this but I will make one point.  When we had the first referendum in 1979, people voted to extend the franchise of the university electorate.  We have now had two referendums.  When people voted to retain the Seanad, we had people who did not have a vote in the Seanad voting to maintain it because they recognised the crucial role it plays in dealing with legislation in this State.  It was an expression of choice by the public, every voter in this country, in a referendum indicating they wanted the Seanad and to have a say in it.  The title of that campaign was \"Open it, Don't close it\".  Every Seanad since has been in place on sufferance of the fact that the public gave a mandate for reform.  To move past that, glibly dismiss it, put it on the long finger and say the Government has loads of issues to deal with when all kinds of other issues have been added to the electoral commission&rsquo;s work, including the running of lotteries, is unacceptable.  To say that one half of the legislative process in the Oireachtas and making sure every person in Ireland has a vote and say in who represents them in these crucial discussions is not a priority and should not even be on the agenda for the new electoral commission is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>I urge the Minister of State to look to the other amendments to the section.  He has brought forward amendments.  There would be no delay to the passage of the legislation if, for example, he were to bring forward an amendment at least setting out a pathway to Seanad reform.  If this Bill passes without any reference to Seanad reform, that will be a mark on the Government and one to be remembered and noted.  I am very disappointed we do not have progress on this.  I may seek to change the functions I would give to the electoral commission on Report Stage, and I will reserve that right.  The functions, as I have set them out, are constructive.

The Minister has acknowledged a fact and anomaly that the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, acknowledged as a major problem as recently as a couple of months ago.  The failure to address that in this Bill has been used as a justification for allowing the same mistake to be made again in the brand new legislation that is the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022.

Some of them relate to very important issues, such as media manipulation and the use of social media.  However, the Leader of this House stood up to propose, without any notice to the Opposition Whips, Leaders or anybody else, that a two-hour period was being provided for a discussion of all of the amendments, both Opposition and Government.

It is important that we ensure we are expanding our democracy and expanding access to, awareness of and participation in our democracy.  I should note that we have other amendments which I will bring forward on Report Stage and I hope to get to discuss today.  They look to strengthen some of the measures in terms of gender equality in both representation and participation in electoral processes.  Of course I strongly support the amendments put forward earlier in this debate with regard to voting at 16.  As part of an expansion of the franchise, and given the immense significance of the decisions that are being made which affect their lives, young people should be supported to begin voting at 16.<\/p><p>These amendments address a few more specific issues in terms of access to and participation in information around referendums and elections.  Amendment No. 29 is a plain language requirement which says that when the commission publishes information on materials about a referendum, there should be a plain language version of such information campaigns.  Many people in the community can sometimes be dissuaded from engaging by complex or inaccessible language.  If a decision affects people's lives, it should be communicated to them in plain English and in a way that is clear and understandable to them, in terms of access and inclusion.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 31 is similar.  It proposes to delete the phrase, &quot;as far as practicable&quot;, from the section of the Bill which provides &quot;as far as practicable that the means employed enable those with a sight or hearing disability to read or hear the statements concerned&quot;.  In fact, it is important that people have the right to hear and have access to these statements.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A limit of practicability is not appropriate in something so significant.  It should be borne in mind that Irish Sign Language, for example, is a recognised language in this State and indeed Article 9 the UNCRPD refers to persons with a disability being able to participate fully in all aspects of public life, including electoral ones.  Again, the baseline is full participation and not an aspiration towards participation and, therefore, amendment No. 31 is important.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 30 is minor in that sense.  It simply clarifies material should be published, including by the use of television, radio and other electronic media to ensure again that we have as wide a reach as possible and that we are not just technically publishing information but are, in fact, seeking to ensure the information reaches as wide a swathe of the population as possible.  Again, all these amendments are in the spirit of strengthening access to key information.  It is also important to note that online measures are certainly not sufficient given Ireland has one of the highest rates of digital illiteracy in the EU, according to the Digital Economy and Society Index.  That we have 40% of people in this State who do not necessarily have digital skills is something that gets forgotten.  Having information online will not be sufficient for them and that is why they must be supported to ensure they can participate fully in decision-making and electoral processes via full access to information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#AA01200","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I again thank Senators Ruane, Higgins, Black and Flynn for these amendments and the sentiment behind them on improving accessibility and participation.  It is important and something we all want to achieve.  These amendments seek to amend existing provisions in order that, first, as part of an coimisi&uacute;n's referendum functions, the statement it prepares and publishes to explain the subject matter of referendums be published in plain language; that is amendment No. 29.  Second, amendment No. 30 proposes that print media be explicitly mentioned in the forms of media to which an coimisi&uacute;n has regard to and the distribution of these statements.  Third, amendment No. 31 proposes that the phrase \"as far as practicable\" be removed from the section's requirement that the means employed for the distribution of an coimisi&uacute;n's statements explaining the subject matter of referendums enable those with a sight or hearing disability to read or hear the statements concerned.<\/p> <p>On amendment No. 29, the matter of an coimisi&uacute;n's public information material explaining referendums is an issue of best practice and an administrative matter for it rather than a matter to be addressed in primary legislation.  Notwithstanding this, the referendum commissions from which this function is transferring have regard to a strong blueprint for ensuring the accessibility and ease of comprehension of such material.  For example, in respect of previous referendums, versions of the referendum guide were produced in Braille, Irish Sign Language, video, audio, large print format and easy-to-read format for people with intellectual disabilities.  I am confident these practices will be carried over and developed by an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in when it takes up its role.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 relate to the publication and distribution of an coimisi&uacute;n's statements, which explain the subject matter of referendums, and are a direct transposition of section 3(1)(b) of the Referendum Act 1998.  It is not proposed to accept the amendments as the general approach has been taken of avoiding the amendment of transposed legislation, save where necessary to take account of a transferring function or new organisational context, and the section as it stands provided that an coimisi&uacute;n may publish and distribute statements relating to a referendum in such a manner and by such means, including the use of television, radio or other electronic media.  As such, it is not limiting an coimisi&uacute;n to particular formats.  It provides flexibility for an coimisi&uacute;n to publish statements by any forms of media it considers appropriate, and this includes print media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#BB00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>It is not very clear to me why the Minister of State, if he agrees with the principle that information should be shared in these various formats we have outlined and expects that to happen, will not accept the amendments.

It is not clear to me why the amendments are not being accepted.<\/p> <p>I am thinking in particular of amendment No. 31 because the legislation stating \"as far as practicable\" is a problem.  That is not sufficient with respect to the UNCRPD.  The fact the commission may exceed that and may indeed ensure everybody has access to the information in all the different ways is by the by.  The fact is the Government is bound by the UNCRPD and its legislation, including this legislation, should reflect the convention.  It is not simply enough for the Minister of State to pass the buck and say he is sure a future electoral commission will consider it.  The fact is he has something in this legislation that simply says that kind of access should be as far as practicable rather than that kind of access to information being a right.

It would be important in ensuring access to the register as opposed to something that may be permitted by the registrar at a point in time.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 33 seeks to extend the call to publish the register on the commission's website.  It asks that details relating to individual parties also be published.  These could include the constitution or written rules of a party.  It is very simple and straightforward.  Almost every political party has a constitution or set of rules.  Publishing these would be important to bring greater transparency and increase confidence in, and understanding of, how parties operate.  Most of us here are members of political parties.  If we want people to join parties, this information should be freely accessible.  It is freely accessible from some parties and less so from others.

If the Minister of State will not accept my amendment, I urge him to accept the amendments tabled by the Labour Party.  They are both very reasonable and based on the same principle.  The register of political parties should not have arcane knowledge for reference, for officials or for those who know how to exercise freedom of information requests.  It should be a matter of public information.  This is the public's decision-making process.  It is about electoral processes.  It should be public.

The amendment is so obviously clear and it is a good idea that the information would be made available.  This is important for a number of reasons.  It is important so that if a candidate from a party is presenting as a single issue candidate the public can look to the party&rsquo;s constitution and see what its wider perspective might be.  This is very important.  We have been speaking about disinformation.  We need to speak about information being clear and available.<\/p> <p>On the other side, it is also very important because if people see the constitution and rules of a party and how it works, they might see themselves being involved in politics.  They would be able to see some of the democracy in parties.  They could imagine, for example, what they might be able to do or how they might be able to influence the party for change.  This is also very important.<\/p> <p>The electoral commission has a function in information and education, and later I will discuss amendments in this regard.  There is a function for the electoral commission in civics, social and political education in our schools.

These amendments were previously tabled by Deputy Nash on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Currently, the maintenance of the register of political parties is the responsibility of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  In terms of the register being available for inspection, section 25C(2) of the Electoral Act 1992, as amended by section 11 the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, requires that the register be made available for inspection at the registrar's office.

However, in this instance I have removed the 1992 Act stipulation that the register be made available for inspection at the offices of the registrar, making the text in section 51 of this Bill more general so that it does not contain an implication that the register is a physical document which must be inspected at the registrar's office.  I am satisfied that this empowers an coimisi&uacute;n to publish the register on its website, as intended in amendments Nos. 32 and 34.<\/p> <p>In respect of amendment No. 33, while I support transparency in how political parties are governed, I am conscious of the burdens on an coimisi&uacute;n in getting established and building up experience and organisational capacity.

If a political party is organised on the basis that a small group of people effectively determine everything, even who can or cannot be a candidate, who can be selected or deselected, who can join the party or be booted out of the party, or whatever, the public is entitled to know that.  The scheme of the legislation at present is that the public is not entitled to know that.  The only person who is entitled to know what goes on within a party's rules is the registrar, who has to satisfy himself or herself that there is an annual conference and some kind of executive body elected by the members in whatever way the party chooses, which means there can be different classes of members electing.  I have no problem with parties giving more weight to some people in some contexts, such as leadership votes, but the people are entitled to know that.  If people are to be obliged to satisfy the registrar that they have rules for some purposes, I cannot see any reason that the public should not be able to see what the rules of a party are.<\/p> <p>If the rules of a party were to change in a dramatically undemocratic direction so as to give one person, for example, the leader of a party or the chairman of its national executive of a party, the right to veto A, B and C or to decide who will or will not be candidates, or whatever, the public is entitled to know all of that.  I plead with the Minister of State to take this matter seriously before Report Stage.  If he has a quibble with the phraseology of the amendment, so be it.  The principle is simple.

This is about autonomy.  Trinity College Dublin, TCD, in particular, has a very distinguished historical background, as, of course, has Maynooth University, which was founded in the days before Catholic Emancipation.  The Bill is a power grab of the permanent Government in Ireland - the powerful, senior bureaucracy.  What started as a review of the first 50 years of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, has today become an attack on the university sector, which is 430 years old.  It is a sector that has served Ireland well and should not be under attack in this Bill.  I remind the House that the TCD features in the list of the most distinguished universities in the world.  It is compiled every year or so.  The Bill has not been widely debated in either the universities or wider society because of a democratic deficit.  Debate in our universities has been prevented for two and a half years because of Covid-19 restrictions.  In the fullness of debate for which the Irish universities are famed, this legislation, if needed at all, would have been improved by debate on every campus in the country.  Again, this is about openness and accountability.  Recently, the Taoiseach called for a controversial appointment at TCD to be paused.  This Bill should also be paused, as in the words of the Taoiseach.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Far too few people have been involved in its preparation.  The Bill proposes layers of extra bureaucracy in the HEA and in the colleges on the assumption that Irish universities underperform and that the Bill offers a cure in this regard.  Irish universities and colleges do not underperform.  The Bill&rsquo;s prescriptions are so badly grounded that they are likely to harm a sector that has served the island of Ireland and the world of learning so well.  I speak as a representative of a college that has provided three Nobel prize winners in recent decades, namely, Samuel Beckett, Ernest Walton and William Campbell.  We are very proud of them.<\/p><p>Let me add to the cheeriness of this debate.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, reported on 29 November 2021 that Irish participation in third-level education, at 63%, is higher than the EU average.  This, again, is something of which we can be proud.  We have always been known as the island of saints and scholars.  In the dark days of the early 19th century, when there were hedge schools, people showed their devotion to learning.  In fact, many people, including ragged children in the ditches, were able to understand and read Latin and Greek, which was a remarkable achievement.<\/p><p>In its 2019 education report, the OECD reported that young Irish people have the fourth highest standard of education in the world.  Ireland is now a full-employment economy with, as IDA Ireland companies report, a strong pool of skilled and diverse talent.  Year after year, the IDA reports that the skilled and talented Irish labour force is the main reason Ireland attracts so much foreign direct investment and so successfully serves the European Single Market.  In recent days, the T&aacute;naiste has announced a review of industrial policy.

IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland firms employ some 475,000 people.  The agencies do not appoint people to the boards of the enterprises they finance.  The reward to Irish society is the employment they create, rather than seats on these companies' boards.  Should the reward to Irish society from successful universities, such as TCD and others, be the graduates they produce rather than a handful of seats on governing bodies?<\/p><p>On the international stage, Irish degrees and qualifications are eagerly sought after.  Irish graduates are welcome entrants to the great graduate schools of the world as they pursue postgraduate qualifications of the highest rank.  Irish third-level education is decentralised, diverse and serves its students and society well.  It is flexible, student-centred, international and, heretofore, reasonably bureaucrat-free.  This Bill is bureaucratically intense and based on quangos.  It sits uneasily in this parliamentary democracy.  It proposes to reduce the number of people democratically elected to the governing bodies of universities and asks our democratic Parliament to support reducing the role of the ballot box.  Elected academics, elected non-academic staff and elected students are to be reduced in numbers, to be replaced by others whose route to the governing bodies is not specified by this legislation.  Why should the Oireachtas agree to this?<\/p><p>The Bill seeks to amend charters and letters patent which predate the foundation of the State.  The Ceann Comhairle's request that these documents be lodged in the Oireachtas Library to be consulted by Members was rejected by the Minister.  Why?  The Minister is looking puzzled, so perhaps there is an explanation.  Perhaps he does not know, or perhaps there is somebody lower down the chain who refused to put those documents in the library.  It would be interesting if the Minister were to be able to get an answer to this for me.<\/p><p>Respect for the Chair is a bulwark of our democracy.  There is a total disparity between the position of the Minister, who has advised that charters and letters patent can be readily emended, and those who believe that charters and letters patent are binding on both parties in perpetuity.

This piece of legislation has not been rushed.  It has not been described as emergency legislation.  Consultation first began on the reform of this legislation in July 2018.  The outcome of that was published in July 2019.  There was then a further round of consultation.  The general scheme to replace the 1971 Bill was published by the Government in May 2021.  Pre-legislative scrutiny took place at the Oireachtas committee.  It began on 5 July and ran until September 2021.  Many of the 17 recommendations arising from pre-legislative scrutiny have now been accepted.  The full and final Bill was approved by the Government on 14 December and was published on 7 January.<\/p> <p>A total of 179 amendments were made on Committee and Report Stages, with 97 made on Committee Stage and 82 on Report Stage.  The Bill passed the D&aacute;il on 22 June.  The Bill then came directly from the D&aacute;il to the Seanad.  It could not have come to the Seanad any earlier because we have a bicameral system.  Legislation has to pass through one House before it comes to the other.

I think that is probably an area where we have a disagreement that comes up later in the Bill.

The second category of people who are eligible are persons having &quot;sufficient experience and expertise relating to ... matters connected to education, teaching and learning, research, the promotion and use of the Irish language, organisational and financial governance, management, public administration or risk management&quot;.  That is all very well but the Minister's power under section 16(2)(a) is to select 11 ordinary members from those categories, which include for instance public administration, management and financial governance.

For a lot of these very important institutions of State we are putting in place now, other legislation guarantees a balance within the composition of those bodies.  It might stipulate not less than one person who shall have this experience, or one person who has that experience or, in the case of the judicial appointments legislation brought before this House the last time, people who had actually been vetted by the Public Appointments Service as to their suitability.  That was on an openness basis.  People could apply to be considered for appointment to these bodies but what we are doing here is giving the Minister almost limitless discretion as to who ends up on the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  It goes on to say at least there will be at least 40% of each gender but there is nothing there to guarantee particular insights or experience as a prerequisite for appointment to the board.<\/p> <p>The absence of those criteria means the Minister of the day will have power to make discretionary appointments to the board in a way that is not consonant with what has been happening with other semi-State bodies where legislation has tended to require that of the ten, 11, 12 or however many places it may be, two people will come from this category and two from that category or whatever.  That has been the trend in public legislation and now we have a situation where we are reversing that trend and granting to the Minister effectively limitless discretion as to who he or she appoints to the board.  That is what Senator Norris's amendment is aiming to tie down so at the very least some obeisance should be made to the proposition that the Higher Education Authority, which has such a significant influence over higher education in Ireland, should have among its membership people who are academic persons who have experience of the academic life.

It is only a pity, given they are in the consultation process, that they did not engage as extensively as the Minister has done over the past four years.  I would like to know, and we will soon find out on the record, the extent to which Senator Craughwell made representations during that time.<\/p> <p>What is key about the authority - and this is where I have some sympathy with the proposers of the amendment - and what has to be remembered is that this is not a representative board.  The idea is that the student who is on the board is not there solely as a student representative nor if somebody from an academic background is put on the board, is he or she an academic representative.  They are there because of the skills and experience they have to contribute to the body corporate.  In the same way, with the boards of most organisations, members should leave their representative hats at the door and seek to fulfil the objectives laid out within the legislation.<\/p> <p>That said, and as the Minister will be aware, I have proposed an amendment relating to this matter later in the Bill.  In that amendment I state specifically that, tied in with this, there should be experience of international higher education, particularly given the space within which the authority and the universities should operate.  I, therefore, have some sympathy with the proposers of this amendment.  It is quite clear, and the requirement is there, that the appointee shall have sufficient experience and expertise relating to matters connected to education, teaching, learning, research and so on.  I do not necessarily expect the Minister to appoint a farmer simply because he or she happens to be a supporter of the Minister.  Whoever is involved will have to show that he or she fulfils the necessary criteria and has, as according to the legislation, sufficient experience and expertise.  There is merit in having a student voice on the board but, equally, other members should be able to guarantee some level of expertise in that regard and of higher education.  The question is how we ensure that this is a representative board while, at the same time, ensuring that the necessary experience and competences be available for an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s to fulfil its objectives and that these can be formed from the composition of the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#MM00400","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I may table an amendment on Report Stage in respect of the definition relating to the academic member to address the gender issue Senator Norris highlighted.  The Minister's response indicates that we do not necessarily need people with academic experience on the board.  An t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s is given extraordinary powers.  With respect to Senator Malcolm Byrne, the Minister mentioned that there was previously discretion, but this Bill centralises extraordinary powers in an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  There is a shift.  There is a lot less discretion at the level of individual institutions of higher education as a result of this Bill.  There are also extraordinary powers given to an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  In that regard, it is a concern if, effectively, the Minister has full discretion as to who makes up the membership of the board of an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  It is poor practice.  The Minister mentioned that the members will have proved themselves; they will not have to have proved themselves to anybody expect the Minister.  His or her judgment and opinion are considered the test.  We have mechanisms available in this State such as the Public Appointments Service, PAS, whereby we can determine whether people have appropriate skills, but those mechanisms are not being used in this case.  To be clear, the provisions under section 16(2) are filled with the word \"or\" such that the experience and expertise may be related to any one of a number of areas.  For example, it could well be that all the members have experience of management or public administration and none has experience of academic matters, and the core function of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s relates to academic institutions.  It is an incredibly important and a specific role.  I point to best practice even in other legislation, or certainly improving practice in other legislation.  For example, in the case of climate legislation, in the appointments to the Climate Change Advisory Council there was learning from the fact that undue discretion was not sufficient.  Because the previous council had quite an unbalanced number of economists and lacked academic and scientific expertise, provision was made in the new climate legislation to require a balance on it between the sets of skills set out.  In the legislation as set out in section 16(2) and, indeed, in the Minister's reply, we have not had any indication or guarantee that there will be academic representation on the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  That is the current stance and it is a matter of significant concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#MM00500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":298,"content":"<p>This is just a tangential and light-hearted comment.

I thank Senator Norris and thank the other Senators for their contributions.<\/p> <p>The amendment relates to the definition in respect of the academic member of the board.  As I suggested in my earlier comments, Members felt the need, understandably, to wander to other sections to have a more holistic conversation; I get that.  The amendment relates to whether we should define \"academic member\" in the legislation.  Considering that the Bill being put forward by the Government establishes a competency-based board that does not distinguish on the basis of academic or non-academic experience and expertise, I am not in a position to define \"academic member\" in the Bill.  Senators can disagree with that position but they will understand that that is the logic in my not being in a position to accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>The powers invested in the Minister are not new.  The Minister of the day already appoints the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  I go back to our pre-legislative scrutiny and the significant time some Members of this House, some Members of the other House, stakeholders and others spent at committee meetings and the like.  We have tried in this legislation to do something that was not done in the 1971 Act but is done in this Bill, that is, to begin to detail what certain competencies might look like.  To give one example, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, to whom I openly give credit for this, was of the view that we needed to be clearer in respect of the Irish language.  We made an amendment on Committee Stage to spell that out.  We can debate whether we have got it right or got it wrong, but I want Senators to understand the process we have gone through.  As for section 16(2)(a)(ii), we are endeavouring to do something the 1971 Act did not do, which is, rather than granting unfettered power, to begin to outline the competency set a Minister shall consider.<\/p> <p>I will make a point that I think is fair.  Anybody in politics longer than a week understands that appointments to boards by Ministers are heavily scrutinised, and rightly so.  I could give the House many examples of board appointments and other appointments that have not gone very well.  We all know about them.  Anybody who suggests that board appointments are not scrutinised within an inch of their lives on the floors of this House and of the other House, in the national media, quite rightly, and in Oireachtas committees, is being slightly, if not accidentally, disingenuous.  The PAS is used by the Government for the appointment of people to State agencies and has been used for the HEA board.  We have been extremely fortunate with the calibre of people we have attracted to the HEA board.  This is not intentional, but I am very proud of that and I strongly reject any negative assertion about what I call the USI seat, that is, the student representative seat, on the HEA board.

That, however, is a very significant power to be given to an institution which until now has had autonomy to say that it will not go with the Minister's policies in respect of A, B and C and is entitled, as a group, to think that the Minister is putting an overemphasis on whatever it is.  I am not talking here about things like gender equality, or such issues, but I am talking about the broad frame of policy.  <\/p><p>If a Minister of the day can lay down policy guidelines and the HEA, through its chief executive, can threaten to cut off funding for failing to comply with a ministerial policy statement, that is in fact deeply corrosive of the notion that, for example, Trinity College, with its 400 year old charter, or the National University of Ireland NUI, with its 100 plus years of independence, is obliged to so comply.  It gives the Minister of the day the right to say that he or she is enunciating the policy, and is requesting the HEA's chief executive officer to call UCD, for example, to book because it is not complying with his or her policy.  Then, under the Act, the Minister can have the CEO of the HEA threaten to cut off the institution's funding if it does not comply.  That is what this Act is about in principle.  <\/p><p>I have no doubt that the Minister may have very benign thoughts on this matter, but not every Minister in the future is perhaps going to take a benign view of an institution that just simply does not like his or her policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#NN01000","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":311,"content":"<p>And the Minister may have no experience whatever of higher education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#NN01100","speaker":"1675"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Or health or justice or-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#NN01200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>We will not get into that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#NN01300","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Well, we have had several doctors in Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#NN01400","speaker":"1675"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Senator McDowell was not a policeman when he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#NN01500","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I make the point that we are talking about fully preserving autonomy but we are also giving the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science the right to enunciate policy and are giving the HEA the right to cut off funding for people who do not comply with the Minister's policies.

I am particularly glad, incidentally, that the Minister is also addressing now the core funding issue.  When the issues in respect of UL arose - there were other institutions involved also, and this is not just to single UL out - we, as a State were not able to get the necessary level of accountability concerned.  The only options that were available, quite frequently, to the HEA under the old legislation was to send in a visitor.  This was, essentially, to disband the governing body, to move in, and to press the nuclear button.<\/p> <p>This legislation is about ensuring that there is accountability for the taxpayers' money that goes into the universities.

We need to understand that it has nothing to do with the question of academic autonomy, which must be protected.  It is important that we ensure there are people in the authority with academic experience and, equally, that people outside of academia are appointed.  Ministers do not always get appointments right.  Senator Hoey might remember that one of the appointments to the board of the HEA by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Bruton, was Mr. Paddy Cosgrave, who famously made a number of comments about academic achievement.

I sit on two extremely busy committees, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  I was also sitting on the Joint Committee on Public Petitions at the time, as well as conducting normal day-to-day business.  I did not have any input in pre-legislative scrutiny in this area, as I am sure Senator Byrne does not have an input in foreign affairs, transport or some of the other areas.  That does not preclude me from taking on board advice given to me by academics, members of trade unions and those who appeared before the very committee the Senator spoke about to try to have included in the legislation issues such as that addressed by Senator McDowell some time ago, namely, the overarching power of the chief executive officer, without any reference to his or her board, with respect to sanctions.<\/p> <p>I made the point, as a former president of a trade union, that there should be provision to have academic representation from IFUT or the TUI.

They should be drawn from IFUT or TUI, which are the main trade unions represented in the higher and further education sector.  From that point of view, that is the argument I am making.  We will not reach an amendment about having local authority members represented on the various boards included in this Bill.

The chief executive of the HEA will be responsible to the board of the HEA and is the person responsible for the funding.  He or she is making the funding allocations, on behalf of the HEA, to each of these institutions and is responsible for those funding announcements and decisions.

I remember when I was in student politics in Galway.  I was elected president of the students' union there in 1991.  It was for the Minister of the day to officially approve my appointment to the governing body of UCG, as it was.  I remember these things took time.  As sabbatical officers came and went, year in, year out, it was not always the case that the minute people were elected, their membership of the board of governors of the governing body would be ratified.  The problem with that was dealt with by the governing body admitting me as a non-voting member until such time as the Minister of the day would ratify me.  I cannot remember whether it was Noel Davern or Mary O'Rourke who was the Minister at the time.  It was just as well that I was allowed to attend meetings because the Minister never got around to ratifying me during the course of the year.  I remember, on one occasion, having completely forgotten about the matter and when I went to vote on an amendment or a point on which a vote was called by the governing body, I put up my hand.  The then runa&iacute; um ghn&oacute;tha&iacute; acad&uacute;la, the secretary for academic affairs, brought me down with a bang and said that the vote was 24, instead of 25, agus nach raibh an tUasal &Oacute; Maol&aacute;in ceadaithe go f&oacute;ill.<\/p> <p>I understand and respect the importance of student representation on important bodies and, therefore, I understand why the legislation makes specific reference to the appointment of student representation to an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  However, it highlights the distinct oddness of the absence of a specific reference to academic representation on an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  It is fine for the Minister to say this is because this is a competency-based body rather than a representative body.  I believe that is the gist of his rationale for this exclusion.  Does one infer from that, therefore, that it would not be enough protection for student representation to leave it to the Minister to judge that in appointing a competency-based body, it would be necessary to have student representation?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It seems to me that there is an element of sauce for the goose and sauce for the gander to this.  Students are stakeholders with competency to participate in a board of governors of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, the HEA or a university or designated institution, as are academics.  We can all see how any test of competency, to have all the necessary skills and perspectives under the heading of \"competence\" for such a board, would require student and academic representation.  The fact is that the Minister has chosen to specifically reference student representation but not academic representation.  He cannot explain away that anomaly by referring to the fact that it is the responsibility of the Minister to make competency based appointments and imply that academics will, of course, be a part of that.  It is not sufficient to imply it when the Minister specified another category, as he did with students, in another part of the Bill.<\/p><p>On that very subject, I am reminded of Ronald Reagan's phrase to Mikhail Gorbachev; \"Let me tell you why we don't trust you\".  The Minister talks about competency based bodies but I refer to the very point that Senator McDowell raised, which is the non-amenability of the CEO to the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s regarding certain very serious decisions the CEO may have to make.  The CEO is amenable and requires the approval of the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s in certain decisions on compliance and measures, \"remedial and other measures\" is the phrase used in the Bill, that may have to be taken but not in others.<\/p><p>The problem that many universities have with this is that if one is serious about competence being the hallmark and criterion for the appointment of people to the boards of universities, as well as the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, one must recognise that if people are being put into a position of competence, their competence to govern has to be respected.  If they choose to depart from a prescribed guideline, code or policy, if one is to get the balance right in the context of universities as State-funded and State-recognised institutions, but nonetheless independent of the State, one must respect what it means to appoint a competency based board.  It means the presumption is that if they have a reason to depart from a particular code, guideline or policy and explain it, that that is a desirable approach.  It is not as though there is no further measure open to the HEA if the explanation is unsatisfactory or the problem persists.<\/p><p>The other problem is that universities believe the actual competence of the board of governors is not being respected.  They believe respect for their competence would mean that in the decision of a university to sanction or perform remedial or other such measures arising out of actions or failures to act, as seen by the CEO, they should be accountable to decisions that are themselves subject to the approval of a board.  In other words, they believe that if a competent board, to whom a president of a university is ultimately responsible, backs the president and the administration of the university in making particular decisions, respect for their competence in getting the structures of all of this right would mean that any decisions, which seek to remedy the situation or intervene, involving serious decisions about the freezing or withholding of funding, because the Minister is insisting in putting competence based boards in place at university level, any decisions to intervene on the recommendation of the CEO of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, should by definition be precisely that.  They should be decisions on the recommendations of the CEO but approved by the board.  The board should be somehow held accountable, ultimately, not by an individual but by another board.<\/p><p>To the argument that the CEO is somehow the Accounting Officer to the Comptroller and Auditor General, or that the CEO is the man or woman in the spot, the fact that the CEO would have to get board approval for a decision in no way takes from the CEO's accountability or legal position of accountability.  People come before Oireachtas committees all the time and have to account for their role, decisions and stewardship.  It does not mean that the decisions they take are somehow decisions that they are empowered to take completely independently.  They are decisions they take because they have boards to which they are accountable.<\/p><p>The Minister has presented the argument - a slippery argument which I ultimately do not believe is valid - that the reason he is not requiring that CEOs be accountable to the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s for certain key and serious actions they want to take in universities, is that somehow it is because they are the person in the accountable spot that justifies him or her not being required to have the approval of the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  That argument makes no sense.  People who are accountable in law for whatever function they hold, in most cases that I can think of, are still accountable to the boards that are behind them.  That does not speak to the specific amendment but it does relate to the issue of a competency based board.  There is a problem in that aspects of the Bill do not seem to respect the competence and appropriate zone of action of individual universities and governors that hold them to account.<\/p><p>On the subject of amendment No. 317-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#OO00800","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>We are only on amendment No. 2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#PP00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":333,"content":"<p>There was a mix-up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#PP00300","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I apologise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#PP00400","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I thought they were coupled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#PP00500","speaker":"1675"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":336,"content":"<p>We are still on section 2, amendment No. 2, in the names of Senators Norris, Clonan, Boyhan, and McDowell.

In fact, there is a requirement by governing authorities to put in place measures to implement and report on compliance with the policies that may be set out in codes, guidelines or other documents, such as memos, circulars etc., of the Government or of a Minister of Government to the extent that those policies affect or relate to the functions of universities.  Just to be very clear, there are measures in this Bill requiring governing authorities of universities to implement and be compliant with polices set out in codes, guidelines and other documents of the Government or a Minister.  In that regard, it is quite a wide reach.  It is not clear.<\/p><p>There will be opportunities when we come to debate sections 76, 119 and others where we have amendments where we seek to limit it so that it would be compliant with statutory requirements.  I know there are amendments we may table, given the subject matter of this, which is the academic issue, and I am expecting there would be support from Government Senators for this, specifically to preclude that there would be any such requirement for compliance with any policies that relate to academic matters.  Perhaps we can address those when we come to them in sections 76, 119 and others, but we need to be very clear these are not solely matters of governance and finance.  There is quite wide language in terms of policy in this Bill in relation to the expectations on governing authorities of universities.<\/p><p>I am happy to leave it there because I do not want to talk longer.

Autonomy is protected, but autonomy cannot be used as a fig leaf or a catch-all word to cover other issues that are of legitimate importance, such as in relation to governance, accountability and in relation to an education system that advances the delivery of public policy.<\/p> <p>I attended a very good debate in this House, led by Senator Ruane, on the issue of non-disclosure agreements, NDAs.  During that debate, I specifically referenced this legislation and the ability of the HEA to set guidelines, codes and practices on a number of areas, including, in the context of that debate, the issue of NDAs.<\/p> <p>We have had reports from the Committee on Public Accounts, such as the report from 2017, which calls for legislation just like this.  There some Senators, including my good friend Senator Craughwell, would rightly be jumping up and down about many issues if he felt there were concerns about the expenditure of public money and he did not feel the response was robust enough.  He would probably be trying to hold people like me to account for this.  You can only hold people like me to account and the HEA and others if there are enough levers, clarity and structures in place in terms of accountability.<\/p> <p>My job is not just to write the cheque on behalf of the taxpayer.  That would be a very simple job.  My job is not just to say, &ldquo;Here is the cheque; here is the money; go off and spend it how you wish&rdquo;.  This is &euro;2 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  When we are consulting all these stakeholders, whom I know very well, respect them and consult them regularly, there is another very important stakeholder here and that is the citizen, the person, the taxpayer.  Their voice is not being heard enough in this debate.  This debate is hearing the voices of representative groups, which is perfectly fine and legitimate.  I meet them too and I have no issue with that, but there is also the citizen.  I believe it is right and proper we put a HEA in place that has a competency-based board and that can set codes, guidelines and policies.  I do think there is a link between public funding and public policy.  That is not a revolutionary concept.<\/p> <p>Senator Norris can keep on making that point about experience in higher education and the Minister.

It gives me a useful opportunity, therefore, to clarify the points that were made previously.  I am not against public policy existing but to be very clear, and I was clear in my intervention that my concerns are that there are requirements in the Bill for governing bodies of universities and individual institutions to implement and report on their compliance with policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government.  Again, those are not policies that have become full public policy by means of either statute, regulation or law or, indeed, that have been agreed by the Oireachtas or the HEA.  We all have policies we might put in our manifestos.  Ministers may have policies and Government may have policy but the muddying of the line between public policy and Government policy is an issue on which we need to be clear.<\/p><p>I was specifically clear that I will have amendments that say they may have mechanisms in terms of compliance with matters of statute, that is, regulations that are in place on a statutory basis, laws that are put into place, laws on non-disclosure agreements, NDA, which I hope will be law soon or, indeed, such measures as I propose putting into law here.  I am clear on the policies I think should become law and be given a statutory basis and should, therefore, then be matters that are appropriately enforceable.  I am not okay with a blank cheque whereby any future Government's or future Minister's policy should automatically become something that on which an HEI must implement a report.  That is what provisions in sections 76 and 119 say at the moment.  I will propose amendments to them saying that there are many areas in which we should have more laws and clearer laws, including areas such as equality.  They should be done in a proper way by law, however, and that is what should be indicated.<\/p><p>I will discuss the amendments in the grouping, all of which relate to the question of equality.  Amendment No. 3 seeks to amend the definition of &quot;priority groups&quot; in the interpretations section and proposes to insert &ldquo;persons to whom the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2018 apply to&rdquo;.  Currently, the definition of &quot;priority groups&quot; mentions &quot;persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged, persons who have a disability or persons from sections of society that are under-represented in the student body in higher education&quot;.  It is important to be clear and to include those to whom the discrimination grounds in our Equal Status Acts apply, many of whom, in fact, are under-represented or even if they are represented, face particular obstacles in terms of their access to higher education.  Those include, for example, the grounds in the equality Act relating to things such as gender, marital status, family status, religious beliefs, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community.  The current wording is quite narrow and does not specifically name many of the grounds that have historically been sources of exclusion such as, for example, race, family status, sexual orientation, members of the Traveller community who have experienced particular exclusion and, indeed, lone parents who face particular obstacles.  Again, it is an attempt to widen who might be captured in the definition of &quot;priority groups&quot; and ensure that those groups, which have been acknowledged by the Equal Status Acts to have experienced discrimination across society, are not forgotten in the definition.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 156 would amend section 34(3) by providing that in the ongoing review of the demand for higher education in the State, an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s would have regard to &quot;the needs of society to address issues of poverty, social and economic inequality, racial inequalities and inequities and gender inequalities and inequities&rdquo; in assessing the demand for higher education at a regional and national level in each discipline.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 212 and 214 relate to the equality statement provision under section 62 of the Equal Status Acts and suggest that in preparing the equality statement, the designated higher education institutions should consult with representative organisations of those to whom the Equal Status Acts apply.  Examples of such groups are the Irish Traveller Movement, Pavee Point, the Disability Federation of Ireland or, indeed, many of the disabled persons organisations in the State, Social Justice Ireland, Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, MASI, and others.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 214 seeks to inert the word &quot;equity&quot; in section 62(5)(b), which currently provides that an equality statement of a designated institution of higher education to which the section applies shall specify the policy of the institution on equality in all activities of the institution.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This amendment simply refers to equity.  There is another point in the Bill where there is a reference to equality of opportunity, which is not the same as equality of outcomes or equality in its wider sense, so this is an attempt to add \"equity\" and thereby strengthen what we mean by equality.  We are not going for a minimalist version.  I know that is not the intention in the equality statement but elsewhere in the Bill equality of opportunity is referenced, which I believe is needlessly narrow and which I will seek to amend.  These amendments all seek to give strength to the legislative provisions in respect of equality and equality statements in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#RR01800","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins covered a lot of the amendments but I will pick up on the last point.  The difference between equity and equality is a crucial conversation.  Equality of opportunity means, for example, everybody has the right to apply to Trinity College Dublin.  The equality of opportunity exists for everyone, but obviously that is not true.  Equity is a much more targeted, aggressive approach to addressing the inequalities that exist in society by taking account of the inequality in a person's environment, background, class or race, whatever that may be.  Equity has much more of an agenda in really addressing many of the issues that will arise.  Even with regard to the first amendment relating to the Equal Status Acts, when we look at the different groups that are under-represented the last word change in terms of adding \"equity\" under amendment No. 214 in section 62(5)(b) would go a long way in strengthening the language in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SS00200","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I wish to speak to amendment No. 317.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SS00300","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":424,"content":"<p>You cannot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SS00400","speaker":"1675"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":425,"content":"<p>There is a vote in the D&aacute;il and the Minister, Deputy Harris, has to attend it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SS00500","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I propose that we suspend for ten minutes to allow the Minister to attend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SS00600","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":427,"content":"<p>It should be 15 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SS00700","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":428,"content":"<p>Is everybody happy with 15 minutes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SS00800","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":429,"content":"<p>Once 15 minutes are added at the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SS00900","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":430,"content":"<p>As much as you like, Senator Mullen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SS01000","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Can we amend the Order of Business to add the time at the end?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SS01100","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":432,"content":"<p>The Minister is happy with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SS01200","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":433,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an Seanad ar fionra&iacute; ar 5.03 p.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;s ar 5.25 p.m.<br \/><br \/>Sitting suspended at 5.03 p.m. and resumed at 5.25 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":434,"content":"<p>We will continue our Committee Stage examination of the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022.

However, this part of the Bill relates to the National College of Art and Design, NCAD.  My error was in tabling the amendment to that section when it should more properly have been proposed to section 62.<\/p> <p>On the principle of the amendment, in the context of the preparation of an equality statement, a number of different requirements are made of a designated institution of higher education.  There is an onus on such an institution to prepare an equality statement.  This involves the preparation of a statement of the policy of the institution for enabling access to it and to the education it provides by students in priority groups and persons in those groups who seek to become students and a statement on the policy of the institution relating to equality, including gender equality, in all activities of the institution.  In addition, section 62(5)(c) refers to \"the manner in which the plan relates to any strategic development plan under section 61\" and so on.  <\/p> <p>I wish the Minister to consider the inclusion among these requirements of a requirement for the equality statement to address the policy of the college relating to respect for the academic freedom of students of that college.  That is a core issue in respect of equality.  I apologise for my mistake, which was to propose the amendment of a section that deals only with NCAD.  It is of course my intention that the requirement to prepare a policy on the academic freedom of students would apply to all designated institutions.  I believe the Minister will agree that the principle is the same and that it could be addressed.  I hope he will agree with me.  I am happy to submit a revised amendment on Report Stage and I would be even more happy to withdraw in anticipation of the Government introducing an amendment of its own on this matter on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>Why am I proposing this amendment?  We talk about the importance of academic freedom.  Academic freedom as generally understood in an academic context is not just a matter of equality.  Academic freedom goes to the integrity of universities and institutes of higher education.  It is part of the secret sauce of an institute of higher education.  It is what makes possible the exploration of ideas and an expansive approach to research in all areas, not just in the humanities.  We know that the curtailment of academic freedom is a recipe for disaster where it occurs.  This issue has many dimensions and there are other aspects we might rightly consider in the context of other legislation.  For example, a matter of major concern to people is the implications not just for academic freedom, but for human rights.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Academic freedom is part of that and separate from that in the context of the connections between institutions of higher education and countries such as China.  One thinks of the influence of the Confucius Institutes, as well as the joint college arrangements that have been embarked on and the joint delivery of academic courses between Irish colleges and colleges in countries such as China.  When one also considers the surveillance state that China is, one must surely have questions about the risks to academic freedom inherent in those links.  The links might be welcome for all sorts of reasons but there are inherent risks to academic freedom where one is dealing with institutions that are, in one way or another, under the control of a surveillance State.<\/p><p>What happens to a student who comes here and wants to write a thesis about democracy and the problems with the Chinese system?  To what extent are the academic freedom, human rights, welfare and safety of such a student or indeed a member of academic staff who comes from a country like that to work here compromised?  That is just one example.  That is just one of the issues that are coming up around academic freedom these days.  The issue is broader and more general than that.  It touches on the capacity of an institute of higher education to be the best it can be, to give access to all areas in terms of the exploration and development of ideas, theories and so on.<\/p><p>The key point is that academic freedom cannot be just understood in the context of equality, although there is an equality dimension to it.  Nor can it be understood just as an issue that applies to academics or the paid staff of the university.  Increasingly, we live in a world where institutes are highly politicised and students can come under various different kinds of pressure not to think certain thoughts or develop certain ideas and not to go there on certain issues, whether it is the Chinese Government and its attitude to some of the course content or some of the proposed research areas undertaken by a Chinese student who is based in Ireland, for example, or whether it is a student who feels inhibited from getting into an area of sociology, politics or whatever other discipline it may be because it might incur the displeasure of college authorities, academic authorities or the people to whom they have to submit their work for assessment.<\/p><p>We read in these days about the apparent lack of academic freedom that is going on in the western world and the shouting down of academics and other students by people.  When we read about that - thankfully, we have generally come across this in other countries so far - we know that something antithetical to the idea of a university is going on.  University must surely be the place where people come up with ideas and where people are free to explore ideas.  They may be unpopular ideas.  They may go against the grain of establishment thinking within the university or outside of it.  It is time now to ask universities over which the State exercises a certain level of oversight, and clearly this legislation is about that, what they are doing to protect the academic freedom of students.  A key area of this comes under equality.  As I said, it is not confined to equality, but it very much comes under equality.  If one student feels inhibited, or is inhibited, from engaging in the pursuit of ideas, for example, a proposal for thesis, and another student does not, for whatever reason, for instance, because the ideas are in vogue or not in vogue or there are cultural, economic and institutional pressures, that is antithetical to what a university is supposed to be about.  That is the reason I am asking, in conclusion.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#UU00600","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>As Senator Mullen has indicated, he will resubmit the amendment, perhaps he will-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#VV00200","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding the fact that my amendment is in the wrong place, maybe the Minister would be kind enough to address the proposal.

It is important that the academic freedom of all our institutions has been enshrined here in the Bill before us.  It is important, as Senator Mullen mentioned, and I feel it is present in the Bill as well, that academic freedom is for all the higher education institutions, and that encompasses both students and staff.  The Minister may wish to comment on that.  That is a cornerstone of what we want to achieve in Bill.

Speaking about academic freedom, I spent quite a lot of time in further education in Blackrock, as the Minister knows.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, we had the good fortune to attract quite a number of students from China.  They were excellent in information technology, IT, and various other areas but in areas where they were asked to express an opinion, there was always a difficulty.  Why do I bring that up with respect to equality and academic freedom?  Substantial funding has come into academic institutions from China through Confucius Institutes and so forth.  It is important that we underpin academic freedom and ensure that regardless of where this welcome funding comes from, we protect the freedom of institutions to develop and deliver programmes in a fair, open and equal way and with full academic freedom.<\/p> <p>Having said that, I am also aware that, from time to time, academic freedom is used as a shield to prevent questions being asked.  I am aware of one particular institution, which I will not name, in which a particular practice went on.  The offended party contacted the institution, said the practice was outrageous and they deserved and required the right of reply to the particular programme that was being run.  They were told they would not be given a right of reply because the lecturer in question was operating under academic freedom.  The matter was escalated and went to the top of the institution in question.  The answer came back that academic freedom meant there could be no interference.  There is a fine line to be watched there.  I am 100% behind academic freedom, but we must also be careful that it is not used to mask other issues.<\/p> <p>I spoke about China, which was not the area that gave rise to this problem.  I know from my work on Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and the debate in the House on Taiwan that the Chinese do not take kindly to any sort of criticism.  From that point of view, this is something we need to watch.  It is a delicate matter for the Minister and whoever succeeds him as Minister.  I hope that will not be for a long time in light of the vote this afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#VV00600","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":446,"content":"<p>There is quite a bit to mull over in this series of amendments.  I will start with Senator Mullen&rsquo;s acknowledgment that the placing of the Bill is not the substantive issue.  I see what he is trying to do here and he eloquently outlined it.<\/p> <p>To add to Senator&rsquo;s Craughwell&rsquo;s point, we had a discussion in the D&aacute;il on the need for greater transparency around funding sources, etc.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is probably something we can all agree on; I certainly hope so.  How we achieve this is the interesting part of the discussion in many ways.  One element of the Bill that has been somewhat criticised in this House is the ability of the HSE to set codes, guidelines and the like.  This is a useful area in which such guidelines and codes could be drawn up in respect of interactions with others abroad, transparency around that, and respecting freedom and autonomy.  It is possible to respect freedom and autonomy and still have full transparency.  I am not unsympathetic to the argument.  I still have an open mind on whether that is enunciated in the legislation, or in the provisions for codes and guidelines in that legislation.<\/p><p>I will make two other points.  It is not to be argumentative but I am not sure the equality statement is the right place to put this.  That could have an unintended effect.  The equality statement should stand alone.  I am not suggesting this is anyone's motive at all, but the suggestion there can be a dissent from equality because of academic freedom for students is not the right place to insert this, to take the broader point the Senator made.  The other point, which is more of an observation, is the amendment as drafted very much refers to academic freedom of students.  In the legislation generally - and my colleague, Senator Dolan, referenced academic freedom - we are referring to academic freedom of staff.  That is a different point but I will highlight it.<\/p><p>I am happy to engage with the Senator on this.  I am not giving an assurance in the House that I will bring forward an amendment or support an amendment on Report Stage, but important issues have been raised about how our institutions are fully independent, autonomous and free.  How there is transparency regarding sources of funding and relationships that come from outside the Exchequer is an area worth exploring.<\/p><p>On Senator Higgins's amendment and Senator Ruane's discussion of it, this is an area I am genuinely happy to discuss with them.  I am not in a position to accept the amendments but not for what I hope they will not see as bad motives.  I am teasing these issues through with the drafters of the legislation, and with my officials and team.  Taking the amendments in order, amendment No. 3 references the Equal Status Act.  I fully subscribe to supporting the Act.  The Equal Status Act, by its very nature, can and must be applicable to all citizens at various stages.  Any one of us can find ourselves discriminated against on any one of the grounds outlined in the Equal Status Act.  What we are trying to do in this section, and perhaps the Senators think we are not doing it right, is call out particular under-represented groups and particular priority groups.  That is what we are trying to achieve.  Not every ground under the Equal Status Act is necessarily under-represented in higher education whereas there are some quite specific groups that are under-represented but might not be explicitly covered by the Equal Status Act.  I am happy to engage further with Senators regarding that.<\/p><p>On the issue of \"and social classes\" in amendment No. 4, again, I see what the Senator is trying to do.  I am struggling to work out how we even define social classes.  If we put this into the legislation, what is the added benefit of the wording? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#VV00700","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I do not think we are discussing amendment No. 4 yet.

There is a difference between equality and equity.  There is definitely a difference between equality and equality of opportunity.

We know there are very specific obstacles for those who are parents, but in particular those who are parenting alone and have that family status.  There is a danger that in talking about unrepresented groups, we may address the matter of such groups but, even within that, cohorts may be forgotten.  It may be said we are dealing with unrepresented groups but we have decided not to deal with, or take active measures on, those groups that may need particularly high levels of supports, for example.  There is a danger with the wide framing in that regard.<\/p> <p>I am happy to engage with the Minister on equality and equity.  I concur with him.  My colleagues and I have tabled a number of amendments relating to academic freedom.  We tabled them to this section in the context of the functions of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  That may be a more appropriate place for them.  On the equality statement, the Minister will be conscious there are amendments that, if we are discussing the equality issue with him, we may engage further with him on around, for example, the IHREC legislation, and the public duty on equality and human rights that applies to all public bodies.

He raised two points.  The first recognised the validity of the question posed, namely, whether an equality statement should be in the legislation or if it should be an option of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s to produce a code, policy or guideline on the matter.  I will make the point that this is a very important issue.  The reason the production of an equality statement is required directly in legislation is in a way, I presume, because it is too important to be left - I will not say at the whim because I do not want to suggest the board or its CEO do not take their duties very seriously - to the question of whether they might opt to produce a code, guideline or policy.  There is a further question underlying many of our concerns about the requirements and scope of the CEO to take certain actions.  What if there is a CEO who is not strong on this area?  This is partly why we are also concerned to ensure the CEO has the approval of the board for certain important decisions.<\/p> <p>The question of academic freedom of students is too important not to be in the covering legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The issues are emerging and are emerging now.  They are not just possible issues; they are real, as I said in the context of the freedom and safety of students and staff coming from abroad.  I am referring to students, in particular.  In the times in which we live, there is a perception that people are not as free to engage in free and open inquiry as we might hope in a democracy.  It is important that the Government take a position on that and say we now need to unpack the question of academic freedom.  The Minister rightly says people understand the matter to be about academics being free in their academic areas, but I am saying that academic freedom, if it is to make sense, is freedom of academic pursuit and therefore must apply to students.  It is too important not to be in the legislation.  That is the first point.<\/p><p>The second point concerns whether it ought to be under the heading of the equality policy &mdash;  Senator Higgins does not agree with me that it would work there &mdash; or somewhere else.  Once it was in the legislation, I would not greatly mind, but I insist that academic freedom of students is a question of equality.  It is also a question of quality.  Let us say somebody wants to depart from perceived wisdom on, say, climate change in an extended essay or thesis for a Master's degree or PhD.  Do we want that to be possible in a university?  I do but not because I might agree with where the student or postgraduate is coming from.  The student would be subject to the standards on the assessment of his or her work.  To be able to go there is vital.  It is what we want our universities to do.  They protect us, in the way the Parliament is supposed to protect us in other ways, by allowing this inquiry.  That, at its core, is an equality question.  Are people to be free in the pursuit of ideas, the development of theories, research and so on?  It is an equality question.  I insist on that to Senator Higgins.  It is not about subtracting from equality thinking.  Equality thinking expands to include the fundamental equality of students, one to another, to pursue ideas, research and so on.  Of course, I am also stressing that it is an issue of quality because, if it is not possible in higher education, the students will be the poorer for it, and the poorer will be the Irish educational and academic product.  I ask the Minister to consider putting the provision in the legislation.  I defend the idea that it goes to the issue of equality and therefore would not be out of place in an equality statement, but the important thing is that it be included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#WW01600","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":464,"content":"<p>Does the Minister see any role for the HEA and&ndash;or guidelines issued by the HEA in ensuring universities, lecturers, student societies and student unions are free to pursue diverse opinions without being bullied out of it by one ideology or another on university campuses, in particular?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#XX00200","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I have only a very brief point.

In Chapter I of Part III of the Act, which concerns the objects and functions of a university, subsection 12(d) states the objects of a university shall include \"to foster a capacity for independent critical thinking amongst its students\".  The idea of reading this legislation in consultation with the sectoral legislation is an important consideration for all of us.  \"Yes\" is the short answer to Senator McDowell's question.<\/p> <p>On my final point, I will go from memory.

We will later discuss my amendments with regard to ensuring that there is not an erosion of the role and representation of students' unions within specific institutions of higher education, where the lowering of numbers is lowering the level of representation of students' unions, including the very important roles played by different students' unions officers in specific institutions and an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  Simply having a USI representative on an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s is not necessarily sufficient because there are universities, including UCD and UL, that are not represented by USI.  The Bill is, in some cases, lowering the levels of students' unions representation on the boards of institutions.<\/p><p>However, all of those amendments will flow partly from us being very clear that we know what we are talking about when we talk about a students' union.  I have to strongly disagree with the proposed definition put forward in the Bill.  The Bill proposes that a students' union, &quot;means the student union or other student representative body recognised&quot; by a higher education provider or a Minister.  Students' unions are very important because they represent the students' voice.  One of the crucial points is that they are chosen and elected by the students.  This effectively reverses the power in that regard, whereby the relevant body, which will have access to the limited representation under the Bill, is that which either the institution or the Minister chooses to recognise, and does not ensure that we have a proper representation.  That is the reason for amendments Nos. 6 and 7.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 6 deletes the current definition of a students' union, which is not appropriate, in that the union would need to be recognised by a governing authority or a Minister.  I know the current Minister is engaging with students' unions.  Future Ministers, Governments or individual institutions may have different points and points of conflict.  They may indeed prefer to have a different representative body with a different power balance.  If we look to places such as Hungary, where there has been a systematic dismantling and repression of the power and voices of students, it is very important that we future-proof this legislation.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 7 proposes a preferred alternative to deletion.  It specifically defines that a students' union would be an independent body that is elected by the students.  I know a couple of amendments have been put forward in that regard, but the fundamental point is that the students choose their union.  A students' union must be independent and elected and chosen by the students, not awarded status by a higher education institution or a Minister.  This is fundamental, because if we say that recognition downwards has more weight in the legal recognition of a union, rather than an electoral mandate, that undermines the democratic frameworks which are crucial to students' unions.  I know many in these Houses have their own background within the students' union movements.  We have a fundamental understanding of what unions are in terms of collective power, decision-making and representation of interests.<\/p><p>I note that there is a diversity of unions that need to be properly represented in terms of professional unions and academic institutions.  I have included F&oacute;rsa.  SIPTU and others have all been mentioned with regard to professional staff.  Their lack of representation is an issue to which we will come later and which I will seek to amend.  There is also a diversity of students' unions.<\/p><p>There is a danger this could lead to a level of cherry-picking.  We are very aware of wider discussions on trade unions.  We have seen employers in the State which set up employee representative groups, that they would prefer to have and discuss with, rather than speak to the trade unions that represent workers.  We do not want to have an equivalent, parallel language and practice here.  Whether the Minister accepts the amendment in terms of the language I have put forward, it is absolutely fundamental that this Bill recognises that students' unions are elected by students.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 211 specifies that in preparing an equality statement, the education institutions would consult with representative groups and organisations.  I have not specified such groups, but it is the principle.  Those would be students, in particular, in this context.  I am not talking about NGOs as I did previously, but students' groups that represent.  We talk about under-represented groups within the university.  Those groups may need to have that specific voice put forward in terms of being consulted because, they may not be large enough in number that they will end up elected fully to the students' unions.  I am thinking of groups such as Minceirs Whiden in NUIG and the UCD LGBTQ society.  A number of under-represented groups with which this Bill specifies that it wants to engage have their own representative organisations and groups that they have put together within universities.  It is important to engage with them with regard to the equality strategies.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 213 inserts a new paragraph in section 62(5) to provide that an equality statement would specify the policy of the institution with regard to the protection of mental health and well-being.  This could be within the equality statement or it may be a separate measure.  I reserve the right to bring it forward elsewhere.  It is crucial that there would be policies specified with regard to protection of mental health and well-being of students and staff, and supports in place within the institution, around the promotion of positive health and well-being.  We know from the ESRI disrupted transitions report last month that poor mental health during the pandemic and Covid has been extremely disruptive in terms of young adults' employment, education, day-to-day activities and, indeed, mental health.  <\/p><p>I have lengthy provisions and discussions to make in the area of mental health, because the Minister will be aware that it is a matter of absolutely crucial importance to staff and students.  However, given the time constraints, I will move on.  I note the high numbers of young people, many of whom are students, who are at the threshold for depression and the ESRI research in that regard.  That is of significant concern.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 217 is important.  The Minister mentioned the issue of social class and social and economic deprivation being wider than equality.  If we are looking at equality and wider than those simple categories currently named under the Equal Status Acts and so forth, a crucial issue is that we would make provisions in our equality statements with regard to the policy of the institutions in terms of ending academic precarity.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Precarious employment in Irish colleges leaves many academic staff and PhD students who work unable to secure bank loans, afford healthcare, find accommodation, start families or get above the poverty line.  The Irish Precarity Network, which is a group of academics, researchers and educators, has warned of the devastating impacts.<\/p><p>A few years ago I launched a report from TASC which looked at precarious employment.  The Living with Uncertainty report looked at the extremely damaging effect of precarious employment on individuals and society, including issues like academic freedom.  It highlighted universities as an area where there is an acceleration in the levels of such employment and that is having a negative impact in precisely the kinds of institutions that should be coming forward with proposals for a more equitable society.  This is a loss for society as well as for the individuals.<\/p><p>We know there are a huge number of people on temporary contracts of between three and 12 months.  For PhD students, the Irish Research Council is deeply inadequate.  I have facts and figures on precarious employment and the devastating impact it is having on individuals and on the institutions, the quality thereof and the ability of those working in them to do challenging work, build momentum or explore or do blue-sky thinking of any kind because they are constantly moving from contract to contract.  I will not discuss the figures because we have so many amendments to get through.  I know the Minister is aware of them and believe we should in our equality statements include provisions on precarity.<\/p><p>The Athena SWAN system, an established measure on gender equality in universities, has named precarious employment as a gender equality issue and identified the number of staff on secure contracts with secure progression pathways and continuity of employment as one of the main factors in determining whether we move forward on equality.  The equality and precarity link has been strongly made by Athena SWAN regarding academic institutions.  One of the best ways to deal with this is to make sure we have trade union representation on an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s and the boards of institutions.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 274 provides that in preparing a strategic plan the chief executive of a university should consult \"representative organisations of students belonging to priority groups&rdquo;.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 275 suggests that when preparing a strategic plan, the chief executive of a university should consult the \"trade union representatives of both academic and professional staff&rdquo;.

I am involved in another area with a representative group which the Minister and the organisation in question have decided they do not want to recognise, yet they were elected by a group within the organisation.  That is why amendment No. 8 is the important one and I agree with Senator Norris on that.  I do not see how a Minister or institution can ignore a group that was elected by the membership of the student body.

That kicks in to academic freedom, where a lecturer takes a view in the programme he or she is delivering and the academic institution or dean of the faculty does not like it.  The lecturer is then gone when the contract comes up for renewal.

I find it the most difficult thing.  I was employed in teaching in 1995 and went straight into a permanent job with full hours.  Less than two years later, colleagues were being employed for a couple of hours per week.  I remember writing to the Minister responsible for social protection that teachers and lecturers teaching for one hour per day were not earning any sort of income but were not entitled to any sort of welfare because they were working for five days per week.  What is more, many of them were required to sit in the staff room in case additional hours came up.  This happened in institutes of technology, now technological universities, as much as in second level schools.  I do not know what happened that employment in education has become so precarious.<\/p> <p>In my final year in the Teachers Union of Ireland, we negotiated a change to the contract of indefinite duration from four years to two, which was a remarkable achievement at the time.  The Department and the unions came together on that.  If we want the best people driving our academic institutions to the highest levels internationally, we have to give them employment which guarantees their income, the home loan that Senator Higgins spoke about, the ability to buy a car and to live a life as a young person, rather than wait until they are a decrepit old so-and-so like me before they have enough money to live on.

It could also be about students taking more radical action, like taking over a building or protesting in a disruptive way.  In that case, a governing authority might refuse to recognise that student body because it is progressive, is taking direct action or is getting in the way of governing board decisions.  We cannot leave it in the gift of governing authorities to recognise students' unions.  It would be like me having a mandate from the TCD electorate and then coming in here and having to ask the Oireachtas to recognise my mandate.  It does not make sense in the flow of things.  Once people are voted in on a mandate and that independent body exists, we should not be looking somewhere else for that to be recognised.  We should know that ourselves because we have individual mandates as politicians, in the same way students' unions have their own individual mandates.  I would hate for that power imbalance to affect the types of issues students' unions take on out of fear or because of the threat of not being recognised by the governing authority if that governing authority is conservative in relation to union action.

Maybe we were being a bit suspicious but we always got the sense that the officials did not want to define a students' union on the off chance there was a falling out.  There was always the question of what would happen if we ceased to exist.  We do not operate any other system by saying \"but you might disappear\".  That is not a logical reason.  This was said in conversations.  Any time legislation was being brought in around this area, we would try to get a definition of students' union in there because it is a good idea to have one.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Annie Hoey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I certainly would agree with the second definition as opposed to the first.  Students' unions have representation on a number of bodies.  They are democratically elected.  I am still mystified ten years on as to why there is so much resistance to defining them in a way that recognises their democratic structures and the fact they are elected by students for students and have a really important role and function.  I am not really entirely sure why.  I really would love to hear the reason because as I said, over the ten years I have been doing this, we have never been given a solid reason.  There were kinds of loose questions, for example about what would happen if things do not work out.  It is not a relationship; we are not dating.  It is a students' union.  They have a long history and have been around.  Students' unions predate some of this legislation we are updating.  It is unlikely that they will disappear off the face of the earth and even if they do, we can turn amendments around pretty quick smart in here if we have to.<\/p><p>I do not understand why there is resistance to defining it.  When we are making such big, broad, sweeping statements about what the future of higher education will look like through this Bill, it would be really good to embed the students' unions into that and give them the recognition they deserve.  They are a representative body elected by students both locally and nationally.  I do not know why we are not doing it; it is beyond me.  I would love to hear why we are not recognising this particular structure of education in the way we could and should do.<\/p><p>This is a good piece of legislation.  There are obviously things we want to see changed.  We may not get to our amendments but on the students' union issue, in particular, I do not know why we are not doing it.

That voice should be heard through the democratically elected students' union within the institution and the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, at a national level.  As the Minister outlined earlier, it is obviously key within this legislation that there is very specific provision for a USI representative on the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s and enhanced and clear student representation with regard to governing bodies.  It has been made clear and the Minister has been very strong in terms of recognising the student voice.  It should also be acknowledged that Government policy has been about recognising the student voice, particularly around these issues.  I would even cite the recent decision of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, to appoint the president of the Irish Second&ndash;Level Students' Union to the board of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  The Minister is correct in listening to the partners in education at all times and the USI is the representative body for students.<\/p> <p>In the same way, in terms of engaging with this legislation, the representative voice for universities is the Irish Universities Association and for the technological sector it is the Technological Higher Education Association.  I know the Minister has engaged extensively with them.  Those are, therefore, the voices that need to be listened to on this legislation in terms of representative organisations.  With regard to Trinity College Dublin, the provost speaks on behalf of the institution.  Indeed, with regard to all the other institutions, it is their presidents and governing bodies.  Those are the representative structures that speak on behalf of the institutions.  In the context of this legislation, I know the Minister has listened to all those from the real representative bodies and has taken on board extensively their amendments.<\/p> <p>I was almost pleasantly surprised that I did not have to propose too many amendments because of the number of amendments the Minister took on board during the D&aacute;il debate.  A very valid point was made by colleagues, however, because an issue arose historically with one institution around the representation of students on the governing bodies by people who were not democratically elected student representatives.  That problem arose but I will not go into that detail.<\/p> <p>I am certainly open to this; it is something the Minister might look at considering on Report Stage.  To have a clear definition around the provision that representatives must be elected by the students is important.  That said, it must be acknowledged very clearly that this legislation very much strengthens the student voice right throughout.

Amendment No. 8 specifies that it must be an elected body.<\/p> <p>On the question of representation, the fact remains that there will be less student representation within many institutions under this legislation.  There is a lack of union representation.. When we talk about other representatives, the fact that they would have previously had a representative is a matter of very significant concern, for example in universities in Galway, Cork and elsewhere.  Previously, a mayor would have been a public representative who comes from a place where universities play a really fundamental role, as they do in some of our towns and cities.  Indeed, a local public representative, such as a mayor, may have sat on boards of governance in those situations.  I know that concern has also been flagged.  We have, therefore, a number of layers of representation to discuss.  I want to clarify the core amendment, however.  I referenced amendment No. 7 but it is amendment No. 8 that specifies that it must be an elected body.  Again, the Minister heard the importance of that point across the House.<\/p> <p>I will make two final points on amendment No. 211.  I spoke about the equality statement and we discussed equality and diversity in our institutions and within each institution.  I really regret the loss from the previous HEA provisions of the mission statement around recognising the importance of diverse institutions across Ireland with distinct missions.  It is not just about diversity and equality within each institution, but also the fact that our academic institutions are diverse and, in many cases, will have distinct missions.  It will not be always the case that one size fits all in that regard.  That is just to clarify amendment No. 211.<\/p> <p>As the Minister, Deputy Foley, has been mentioned, it strikes me that if we were to give more time to this legislation and give proper time between Committee Stage and Report Stage, perhaps we would be able to take on board things that may be discussed in the planned citizens' assembly on education, which is the plan for having a national public discussion on education.  It seems a little pre-emptive to make such radical changes to our higher education system before we have a citizens' assembly on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#CCC00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>If we are going to have citizens&rsquo; assemblies, let us ensure that this democratically elected Assembly is allowed to do its work in full.<\/p><p>I wish to speak to my own amendments.  Again, I must start with a <i>mea culpa<\/i>because they are in the wrong place.  The moral of the story is perhaps not to burn the midnight oil.  The amendments I am proposing here relate to the issue of consultation with students in the context of the strategic development plan of the college and the equality statement.  I submitted these for the part of the Bill that relates to the National College of Art and Design, NCAD.  Properly speaking, what I submitted by way of a proposed amendment to section 128 should really be in section 61, and what I submitted with regard to section 129 should really be in section 62.  As previously noted, however, the position is the same.<\/p><p>Sections 61 and 62 provide for consultation with students or the students' union of the institution.  That is what it refers to in the context of the preparation of a strategic development plan and the preparation of an equality statement.  The point, which my colleagues made already, is that it is really important to recognise the role of students' unions with all their history and the fact that they are elected by students.  They have a particular role.  They are funded by universities.  They are actually funded by students at the fee payment stage, notwithstanding free education.  Some thousands are paid by way of a capitation fee, if that is the correct term, and that goes <i>inter alia<\/i>to the funding of students' unions, clubs, societies and many other activities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is very important that this money always be disbursed by the university or students' union fairly and with an eye to equality.  The students' union is in a particularly important place but the way the legislation is currently worded appears to provide that it would be not be necessary to consult with students' unions.  Rather it provides for consultation with students or with the students' union of the institution in question.  As I read it, and I hope the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, it would not actually be necessary to consult with students' unions under these sections.  The designated institution would simply have to satisfy the requirement of consulting with students, although the Bill does not specify which students.  My amendments propose to replace \"or\" with \"and\".  The point is that those to be consulted in relation to these matters must include students' unions.  However, I also favour consultation with those beyond the students' unions because there are times when the students' unions might not be fully representative.  The obligation should therefore be to consult broadly.  The consultation obligation should never depart from including students' unions but it may also be appropriate to consult with other clubs and societies or other gatherings of students who represent particular academic or other interests.  You lose nothing by creating the broadest possible requirement for consultation.  I hope the Minister will correct me if I am wrong but, as the legislation stands, it would be possible to exclude students' unions from the consultation.  I do not believe that is what is meant.  Notwithstanding my own mistake, this problem can be remedied in sections 61 and 62.  Replacing the word \"or\" with the word \"and\" in sections 61(4)(d) and 62(4)(d) would cure the defect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#CCC00500","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":518,"content":"<p>Students' unions are often the heart of our universities.

It cannot just be random students but must be the students of the institution as a whole.  It would be worth checking that out because it is a valid argument.

I will provide the House with a note on the issue of students' unions.  I believe we all accept each other's bona fides on this matter.  The intention is not to be exclusionary but to be inclusive and to provide for students to be consulted regardless of the scenario.  I will provide a note on that in advance of Report Stage in the interests of being brief on the matter.<\/p> <p>I will work my way through the amendments because there is quite a lot in this grouping.  In fairness, Senator Hoey asked a valid question as to why the hell we do not just define \"students' union\".  It is a question I have asked myself.  We have worked with the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, on this matter and have had lots of discussions about it.  On the face of it, it seemed terribly straightforward to me that we should put a definition of \"students' union\" into the Bill.  Of course, it was not as straightforward as I thought.  I will share with the House the rationale behind not defining \"students' union\" and what we propose to do as an alternative.  We discussed this in the D&aacute;il as well and I have engaged with the USI on it.  <\/p> <p>We also sought legal advice from the Attorney General's office as to how to set about this.  While legal advice is always privileged, I will share the thrust of the advice with the House.  We were advised that, in this legislation, the role of the students' union is limited to a consultative role.  That consultative role is set out in sections 34(2), 61(4), 62(4) and 126(2).  The references to students' unions all relate to circumstances in which the HEA or others must consult with them.  The legal view is that, if we defined \"students' union\" in the context of that consultative role in the legislation, we could inadvertently reduce the scope of what is intended by a students' union.  We were also advised that there is a great degree of variation between students' unions and bodies across the higher education sector and that a prescriptive provision could lead to an inadvertent exclusion of some students' unions or bodies from the right to be consulted.  We were also told that, as has previously been pointed out, there is a definition of \"student union&rdquo; in the Universities Act 1997 and in the Technological Universities Act 2018.  As I made the point earlier, the sectoral legislation carries forward with this legislation.  Sections 94 and 105 of the Bill also insert mirror definitions of the section 2(1) definition of &ldquo;student union&rdquo; into the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006 and the National College of Art and Design Act 1971.  Any change to the definition of \"student union\" could result in a different scope from that of the broader definition in the Universities Act 1997 and in the Technological Universities Act 2018.  I am sorry if that is a bit technical but at least it will now be on the record for all of us to consume and look over between now and Report Stage.<\/p> <p>I encourage Senators to scrutinise and engage on this matter before Report Stage but I have written to the USI on it.  I believe it has published the letter I sent, which I am very happy for it to do.  I have talked about how we can use section 143 of this Bill, which relates to the powers of the HEA in respect of policies, codes and guidelines, with regard to student partnerships.  That is badly needed.  I am, quite frankly, not happy with how students' unions have been treated in certain universities.  I have heard from the presidents of students' unions on that in recent weeks.  I am sure this is an issue that will be returned to.  Students' unions are democratically elected by students.  They are autonomous and independent.  Their funding needs to be protected.  I believe we have a shared view on that.  It is just a question of how best to go about doing it in this legislation.  That is my response to amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 8.<\/p> <p>On amendment No. 47, in the first instance, I do not believe this is the right place to put it.  That is a technical point but I do not intend to revisit this issue.  I already made a decision, after consultation with the USI and compelling arguments from students' unions, to increase the number of student representatives on governing boards in comparison with what was previously envisaged in this legislation.  That was the right thing to do and will mean that, in most cases, the proportion of the total membership of governing bodies who are student representatives will increase under this legislation.  You have to be big enough to admit when you were wrong and I believe the idea of having two such representatives was wrong.  Increasing that number was the right thing to do.<\/p> <p>I just cannot accept amendments Nos. 184 and 185 in the name of Senators Norris and Boyhan.  It is again slightly technical.  It is proposed to remove the word &ldquo;Notwithstanding&rdquo; from section 43(1) and to put in &ldquo;In support of&rdquo; or &ldquo;Building on&rdquo;.  This section relates to the HEA engaging with students' unions.  The word \"Notwithstanding&rdquo; is a reference to something we all talk a lot about in this House, that is, recognising the autonomy of the institution.  The primary point of engagement should be between the students' union and the institution.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are saying that, notwithstanding that being the main engagement point, there will be other occasions where the HEA should engage with student unions.

I will be concise, given we have little time to get through the amendments.  The amendment will amend the meaning of \"principal burial land\" in the interpretation section.  Currently, the section defines a principal burial land as land \"associated with an institution where burials have taken place ... of persons who died while resident at the institution, and ... which were manifestly inappropriate\".  As drafted, there are two criteria, namely, the person must have died while a resident and must have been buried before the State may intervene.  The requirement to meet both criteria is, potentially, a barrier and the amendment will change the wording such that only one requirement will apply.  The fact that, for example, a young woman, a baby or a child died in a home or was inappropriately buried there should be enough in and of itself to trigger an intervention.  It does not seem right that either of these circumstances on its own would not be serious enough to warrant an investigation.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 2 seeks to revise the scope of the Bill to align it with the international definition of &ldquo;mass grave sites&rdquo;, namely, that which has been derived from the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  It will incorporate this best-practice definition into the interpretation of what constitutes a principal burial site to ensure intervention will occur in a broader range of burials, whether they are inappropriate in terms of the nature of the burial or of the nature of the death of those persons who were buried.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 3 is closely related to amendment No. 1.  As outlined, the Bill currently specifies that authorised interventions will be limited to cases where a person died while ordinarily resident in an institution and where he or she was buried in a manifestly inappropriate manner.  Two criteria must be met before the State may act, namely, the person must have died while a resident and must have been buried inappropriately.  The requirement to meet both criteria could be a barrier and, in our view, one should be sufficient.  Amendment No. 3 will change the wording of the section such that only one of the criteria will be required.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 4 seeks to revise the scope of the Bill to align it with the international best-practice definition of \"mass grave sites\" to include any burial site where the circumstances surrounding the death, body-disposal method or both warrant an investigation as to their lawfulness.  This will incorporate the best-practice definition into the section, which provides for the establishment, by order of the Government, of an office of the director of authorised intervention.  Doing so will ensure the intervention and investigation occur in respect of the broadest possible range of inappropriate burials.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 12 will add a function to directors of authorised intervention to include the arranging of the forensic excavation and recovery of remains where there is a concern the person's death occurred in a violent, unnatural, sudden or unknown manner.  The current provision is too narrow in that it specifies that only the circumstances of the burial be considered when assessing whether forensic excavation and recovery should be arranged by the director.  As previously noted, the pre-legislative scrutiny report of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth recommended that interventions give due consideration to suspicious or unlawful deaths as well as to the existence of inappropriate burials.  The amendment acts on this recommendation as it relates to the arranging of forensic excavation and recovery by the director of authorised intervention.<\/p> <p>Finally, amendment No. 16 seeks to expand the provisions relating to the obligations on a director of authorised intervention to notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner of certain evidence.  As drafted, section 36 specifies An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner must be notified by a director where evidence emerges that human remains were buried in the principal burial land following death in violent or unnatural circumstances.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This means that even though a child, or mother or young woman may have died in an unknown or suspicious way, this will not be referred to the Garda or the coroner for further investigation, despite the fact the death may well have occurred in a violent or unnatural way.  This amendment expands on the current provision by including death in suspicious or undetermined circumstances.  This ensures that where the cause of death is undetermined or unclear but suspicious, the Garda and coroner would be notified and further investigation could ensue.  This amendment acts on the 6th recommendation in the pre-legislative scrutiny report by the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which stated that intervention should give due consideration to suspicious or unlawful deaths.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#LLL00500","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for facilitating the issue with voting today and I gather it may need to be facilitated again later this evening.  I thank the Senators for putting forth this set of amendments.  I know we discussed similar amendments in the Seanad on Committee Stage here and in the D&aacute;il, and I am not going to be in a position to accept these amendments.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, seek to alter the definition of principal land, as Senator Ruane said, and the conditions for making a Government order to allow for interventions in cases where inappropriate burials have not been discovered but, rather, where the burials relate to any person who died while resident in an institution or where the circumstances of the death or body disposal method warrant an investigation as to their lawfulness.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 12 seeks to alter the functions of the director so he or she would have to arrange for forensic excavation and recovery of human remains where death may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner or suddenly from an unknown cause.  These amendments will allow for interventions in cases where inappropriate burials have not been discovered.  This approach would fundamentally alter the scope of the Bill and ultimately change the underlying objectives of the legislation.  This is clearly at odds with the Government decision to create a lawful basis for forensic excavation, recovery, analysis and identification of remains at institutional sites where manifestly inappropriate burials have occurred, as is the case at the site of the former mother and baby institution at Tuam.<\/p> <p>These amendments will also represent a strong interference with the jurisdiction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner.  Any intervention and investigation where there are questions regarding the lawfulness of a circumstance surrounding a death should clearly come under the remit of those two bodies.  This is why the Bill rightly provides up front that an order may not be made if an investigation or inquest is already under way, and the Garda Commissioner is of the view it would be premature to make an order for intervention pending the outcome of that investigation.  Similarly, the Bill rightly provides that where an intervention under this legislation is under way, the director must notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner of any evidence of a violent or unnatural death that comes to light during the intervention and then follow their direction.<\/p> <p>I also point out that the manner in which bodies are buried does form part of the considerations of what might constitute manifestly inappropriate burials or buried in a way that would not reasonably be considered to provide a dignified interment.  I do not see a justification for referencing the body disposal method when the manner of interment is already included within the scope of the Bill.<\/p> <p>The legislation seeks to complement existing law, including the Coroners Act and not replace it.  I know this was significant in terms of the pre-legislative discussions.  As Senators will know, as a very significant change from the original general scheme, we removed all restrictions on the jurisdiction of the coroner.  Furthermore, under this legislation, the director will have to try to identify the circumstances and cause of death of recovered remains, and if evidence of violent or natural death emerges, the director must notify the coroner and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na immediately.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 16 is concerned with changing the description of the type of death that must be notified to the coroner and a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While I appreciate the intent, I can assure the Senator that the current wording of &ldquo;violent or unnatural&rdquo; would encompass any suspicious deaths where there is potential evidence of same.  In practical terms, it is important the wording remains aligned with the basis of exhumation that already exists in the Coroners Act.  More broadly, the director will publish a full post-recovery analysis report in respect of all recovered remains, which will include the causes and circumstances of death where it is possible for that to be determined by the director.  The director will ensure it is brought to the attention of the relevant coroner.  In addition, as a result of an amendment that was brought forward during the D&aacute;il debate, the legislation will ensure the post-recovery analysis report will document where notifications of evidence of violence or unnatural death have been made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner.  There will be a clear record of that engagement between the director and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and-or the coroner, which has taken place.  In light of those reasons I am not in a position to accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#MMM00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":587,"content":"<p>Given the time constraints, we will go straight to pressing the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#MMM00300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":588,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 11, line 1, after &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;or circumstances surrounding the death and\/or body-disposal method warrant an investigation as to their lawfulness&rdquo;.   <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#MMM00500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#MMM00600","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 14, line 32, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#MMM00800","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#MMM00900","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":594,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 14, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(ii) of persons, where circumstances surrounding the death and\/or body-disposal method warrant an investigation as to their lawfulness,&rdquo;.   <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#MMM01100","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#MMM01200","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":597,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 15, to delete lines 4 to 6 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(c) the making of the order is in line with the wishes of the majority of relatives of persons buried on the land.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#MMM01500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#MMM01600","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":600,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 5 seeks to delete the lines in the Bill which say that an order for an excavation of a burial site will only be made if it is necessary for the purposes of safeguarding important objectives of general public interest.

The excavation and recovery of human remains is a complex and sensitive intervention.  In making a decision to undertake this, the Government must strike a balance between the need to intervene with the need to respect the long-standing tradition of the sanctity of burials and consider the overall public interest.  Consideration of the safeguarding of public interest is not unique to this legislation.  It is a particularly important concept in legislation where elements of constitutional rights are at play and are being balanced.  When legislation does impact on constitutional rights, it is vital the legislation sets out a robust legal basis grounded in public interest for any potential adverse impacts on constitutional rights.  The legislation, therefore, sets out a number of factors a Government would have to take into account when determining if an intervention is proportionate, including the need to accord dignity to persons who are buried in the land, the need to respect the views of the relatives of persons buried in the land, public health, and alternative options, if any, that may be available.<\/p> <p>I believe the amendment proposed would fundamentally weaken the protection of constitutional rights within this legislation and, therefore, the legislation itself.

In doing so, the amendment would ensure that the authorised interventions occur in the greatest possible number of cases.  As drafted, principal burial land would not be eligible for intervention if even a small part of the land comprised a regulated burial ground.  This amendment expands the provision to ensure that regulated burial lands can be intervened in, where there is a cause to intervene.  Subsection (4)(c)(ii) already specifies that interventions should not occur where the land cannot be excavated without disturbing appropriately buried remains.  In my mind this seems like a sufficient protection for remains that are buried appropriately.<\/p> <p>While I understand the sensitivity with which we must approach disturbing appropriately buried remains, we must balance this with the rights of concerned persons to justice and to a dignified burial.  Maintaining the provision that appropriately buried remains should not be disturbed strikes me as an adequate provision in and of itself.  This is why I propose a straight deletion of lines 17 and 18.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 7 seeks to ensure that every possible effort is made to excavate inappropriate burials.  It is related to some degree to amendment No. 6.<\/p> <p>Section 7(4) refers to land that \"could not be excavated without disturbing appropriately buried human remains\".  This amendment adds a small qualifier that the provision would not apply in circumstances where written consent for the excavation was given by living relatives of the person whose remains are buried appropriately.  This could be a productive amendment because the current version of the Bill seems to create a barrier to uncovering inappropriately buried remains in the future.  One can imagine a scenario where a family may be living in a small town where an institutional burial site is discovered.  Perhaps the family had relatives in an institution and a mass burial site is discovered close to one of the family graves or a family plot.  One can imagine that the family would want their appropriately buried love ones to rest in peace, but they may also want to desperately know the truth about what happened in the local institution and what happened to relatives who may have been in it.  In that case the family might want to give permission for a family grave to be excavated.  They might be willing to make that sacrifice to find out the truth about their family, another family's history or their local history.  It is with this scenario in mind that I propose a small qualifying amendment, which I hope can be seen as a constructive suggestion.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 8 seeks to expand the context in which an authorised intervention takes place.  Currently in legislation an intervention would not take place where recovery of human remains would be unreasonably difficult.  Will the Minister clarify what constitutes unreasonably difficult?  It seems somewhat unclear to me and the provision seems vague.  It is also unclear as to how the perceived difficulty would be assessed and who would assess it.  This amendment seeks to delete this vague term from the Bill and replace the relevant subsection with an alternative, which specifies the intervention should progress unless there is a risk of serious physical harm to the persons responsible for the excavation.  In my view this substitution strengthens the section through the removal of what is a very vague term.  In doing so, the amendment ensures that a greater number of interventions will occur where they are required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#NNN00400","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I am not in a position to support these amendments that seek to amend the criteria under which the Government cannot make an order.  The criteria set out are all important factors that need to be considered in decisions on whether an order should be made.  There is a strong rationale for excluding official burial grounds, ensuring that appropriately buried human remains are not disturbed unnecessarily and health and safety considerations are taken into account.<\/p> <p>Section 44 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1948 specifies where burials can appropriately take place.  Where this legislation applies, there is an existing provision for an exhumation licence to be issued by the relevant Minister for a body or bodies that were buried at that location.  An intervention under this Bill would, therefore, not be warranted if the provisions of the 1948 Act are applicable to the burial grounds in question.<\/p> <p>It is also reasonable not to disturb remains that were buried appropriately.  A similar condition exists under the 1948 Act.  It is important to respect the long-standing tradition of the sanctity of burials and, in some cases, it may be necessary to consider the impact of the intervention on other human remains that were interred appropriately.  While the views of relatives in relation to this would be important, and would be provided for under amendment No. 7, the Government may need to consider the other factors in this regard.  I believe the current wording represents the best approach.<\/p> <p>In certain sites, excavations may be unsafe or disproportionately difficult.  These health and safety considerations must be taken into account.  While the risk of serious physical harm to persons responsible for an excavation would be an important factor, as suggested by amendment No. 8, it would not be sufficient to cover situations where an intervention may not appear to pose a risk of physical harm but may be so complex that any attempt to recover the remains would not afford dignity to the deceased.  It should be stressed that such circumstances would be exceptional.  We are aware that the Tuam site will be challenging, but intervention here is justified and the Government has made a clear commitment to doing so once this legislation is passed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#NNN00500","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 7:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 15, line 21, after &ldquo;recovered,&rdquo; to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;unless written consent is obtained from living relatives to excavate the appropriately buried remains,&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#NNN00700","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#NNN00800","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":611,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 15, to delete lines 22 and 23 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(d) recovery of human remains from the land would pose risk of serious physical harm to persons responsible for the excavation,&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#NNN01000","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#NNN01100","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":614,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":615,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are related and may be discussed together.

There should be no easy outs for the Government when it comes to excavating institutional burial sites.  Every site should be examined fully.  It is in the public interest to examine every single one of these sites, so long as there are living families who desire information about relatives buried in them.  As I have said many times already, this is about the truth and closure.  These can only be achieved if we do the hard work of examining the burials.<\/p> <p>This amendment is slightly different from the version I tabled on Committee Stage, in that it specifies that the Government shall consult with relevant persons and parties when deciding whether it is necessary and proportionate to thoroughly examine burials on the land.

The Government has a positive legal obligation under the European Convention of Human Rights Act 2003 to investigate all sites where there are suspicious circumstances surrounding death.  These investigations can happen without excavations and do not preclude memorialisation.  Memorialisation should complement rather than replace the process of intervening in and investigating mass graves.  Any decisions concerning memorialisation should include meaningful participation by survivors and family members.  Regardless of the outcome of consultation with families and survivors in relation to a particular site, the legal obligation on the State to carry out investigations into the deaths of the individuals buried there, if the circumstances are suspicious, should be provided for in the Bill.  This amendment would achieve this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#NNN01600","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":619,"content":"<p>While I appreciate the sincere intent that lies behind amendments Nos. 9 and 10, I am not in a position to support them.

The Bill provides for an advisory board that will be established to guide and support the director of an intervention.  It will include scientific experts and former residents, family members of the deceased or both, and consultation with the advisory board will be required at regular intervals, including at key decision points in an intervention.  The addition of an advisory board responds to a number of recommendations from the pre-legislative scrutiny report to enhance transparency and accountability and, in particular, to ensure meaningful engagement with families and survivors.  It is an important change, brought about between pre-legislative scrutiny and the Bill having been introduced to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>In November last year, I published a 22-point action plan for survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions.  This overarching Government response to the legacy of these institutions adopts a survivor-centred approach with a focus on human rights, and the State's obligations under domestic and international law underpin every action in the plan, including action 22 relating to this legislation.  The primary role of this advisory board is to provide advice and guidance to the director at key points in the intervention, and in that context, it is important the director consider the views of family members and survivors but also have access to scientific expertise.  In inserting provisions for an advisory board into the Bill, a key aim was to uphold the rights of family members by promoting their voice and views at key decision points in the process.  Furthermore, in appointing a director, expertise in human rights will be one of the considerations, as will be coronial expertise.<\/p> <p>I recognise that those most profoundly affected by any intervention will be the family members of the deceased and former residents of the institution in question, and the advisory board includes family members of the deceased and former residents for this reason.  Nevertheless, we need to appreciate the sensitivity and impact of an intervention on the local community, as well as the role of the local authority in the protection and preservation of burial sites.  Accordingly, the advisory board will include a member of the local authority to represent the interests of the local community and to reflect general responsibilities for the protection of burial sites and local planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#OOO01300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":632,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 14:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 22, to delete lines 12 to 13, and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(b) a member having expertise in transitional justice,&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#OOO01500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#OOO01600","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":635,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 33, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(6) Nothing in this section shall prejudice the rights of those who wish to make a protected disclosure under the Protected Disclosures Acts 2014 to 2022.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#OOO01800","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#OOO01900","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":638,"content":"<p>The amendment seeks to ensure that nothing in the Bill will prevent someone from making a protected disclosure with regard to wrongdoing in the process of excavating a burial site or in the sharing of information of significant public interest relating to a burial site.

The Government indicated on Second Stage it would not oppose this Bill but would instead conduct its own research in to the prevalence of the use of non-disclosure agreements, NDAs, in cases such as this.<\/p> <p>In March of this year, officials in my Department published a report, The prevalence and use of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) in discrimination and sexual harassment disputes.  This research highlighted that NDAs are commonly used in a range of contexts within Ireland and other jurisdictions, but it also noticed there were significant data gaps.  The inherent secrecy of these contracts presents challenges in rectifying this.  NDAs are often signed in contexts where there is a significant power imbalance between the signatories.<\/p> <p>The report notes there appears to be a consensus among all stakeholders that some change is needed, with differing perspectives on the optimum legislative response to the challenge presented by the use of NDAs.  While some commentators and practitioners favour the effective prohibition of NDAs in cases of sexual harassment or discrimination, others favour their regulation but still see an important role for them in the ethical resolution of disputes.<\/p> <p>The main recommendation from the report is that prevention is key.  Human resource practices should encourage reporting and foster a workplace culture that does not tolerate sexual harassment or discrimination.  In cases in which a settlement following a dispute includes an NDA, however, employers should ensure best practice is followed.  I have considered the outcomes of this research and I now intend to address the findings as part of the ongoing review of the equality Acts by my officials.  The process of undertaking that review was valuable.  I thank my officials for their work in helping to undertake and devise the review, which is already being looked at as quite significant work.<\/p> <p>In the context of that ongoing work on the equality Acts, last year I launched the public consultation process to inform the review of the equality Acts to examine the functioning of the Acts and their effectiveness in combating discrimination and promoting equality.  My Department was pleased to receive an extensive response to the consultation, and the submissions are currently being analysed.  It is intended that legislative proposals arising from the review will be brought forward at the end of this year, including addressing the use of non-disclosure agreements in discrimination and harassment cases.<\/p> <p>Notwithstanding the intention of Government to bring forward our own proposals, I will indicate amendments to this legislation which the Government intends to bring forward on Report Stage.

It is important to pick up on some of the points the Minister has just made.  I thank him and his officials.  Sometimes when you bring legislation and a Department says it will look at it or a Minister says he or she will look at it. you hope and want to believe that will happen.  I have to say that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and his officials acted very swiftly on carrying out that research, which has been very beneficial, not only to me in the progression of this Bill and our opening up the area of understanding NDAs in Ireland but also as part of a global message.  I informed the Minister a few weeks ago that there are now some Canadian provinces that have introduced the Irish legislation before us.  We are having an impact with this very important conversation we are having.<\/p> <p>The initial research that has been done on non-disclosure agreements and their use of Ireland is just the beginning of being able to unearth the level to which NDAs are used here in Ireland.  What also comes out through our own research that ran in parallel with the Minister's, because we continued meeting with people who are affected by NDAs, is that hybrids of NDAs have become prevalent.  There are some classic NDAs used in instances of business and trades which should be protected, but what has now happened is that we see severance agreements that look plain and simple on the surface, but very significant NDA clauses are contained within other such types of agreements, such as compromise and confidentiality agreements.  The clauses are not very obvious to the eye as a classic NDA.<\/p> <p>I know the Minister intends to bring his own policies forward on this, which I hope we can also inform.  I thank the Minister and I am open to working with officials on all the sections between now and Report Stage, rather than waiting to come back to Report Stage, whenever that happens.  If the Minister gets out there first in terms of bringing his own policies and, potentially, his own legislation and my legislation were not needed, that would also be welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#RRR01000","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":674,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":675,"content":"<p>SECTION 2<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":676,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 2 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":677,"content":"<p>While I support the principles behind the Bill, as it is currently drafted, it may not capture the broad nature and use of non-disclosure agreements that has come to light in the research carried out by my Department.

I note how important this legislation is.  It intersects with some of the other areas on which we work, such as protected disclosures and burials.  There are so many areas on which this Bill impacts.  Over the past year, the matter has come to light more and more and the media are picking up on it.  Older women have travelled the country to meet me on this.  One woman in her 60s or 70s travelled here on a train to hand-deliver NDAs to me out of fear of the consequences of sending them in the post.  I had to meet women in town so they could hand them over.  That is the type of fear people are living with.  With regard to obtaining data, there are gaps because of fear.  We all understand that, in some cases, the victims of abuse or sexual harassment may sign a given document in a desire to see an end to their circumstances, but we know their position changes.  We know from the campaigns I am involved in on this issue here and in the UK, Australia and Canada that over time people regret signing NDAs because they heal within themselves and conclude they want accountability regarding how they were treated.  It is a question of being able to set a legislative framework and policy to give voice to that, not only for the protection of the individual who has signed the NDA but also third parties who may be affected by the abuser, on whom there is no actual data because an NDA has been signed.<\/p> <p>We have discovered the use of NDAs in the private sector.  This has been more difficult for me to get to grips with because I cannot make a freedom of information request.  There is information that I cannot obtain.  We have tried to use other ways to get companies on board.  We have been told a number of companies, including insurance companies, have used NDAs in a very aggressive manner in respect of a number of women, but often the same individual, within their organisations over a period of ten or 20 years.  There is nothing I can do to reach into the private sector.  Legislation is so important because it will apply across the board, not just to a particular sector.  That is why legislation, rather than policy, is so important in this area.  It will not impact very legitimate NDAs.  It will relate only to a crime being covered up.  One of the main points concerns the confidentiality of the victim in some cases.  That is where we really need to have conversations.  If confidentiality should apply to the victim, it does not mean it should apply to the perpetrator, nor does it mean the perpetrator should not be accountable so as to protect the anonymity of the victim.  I look forward to seeing what the Minister's office and Department will come forward with.  I hope that between now and then we can continue to tease out what good legislative practice in this area would be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SSS00500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.  I am very glad to see this Bill passing Committee Stage with support.  I probably have some concerns.  I realise the Minister proposes to introduce his own legislation.  This is such strong legislation.  With regard to some of the language mentioned on negotiations, it is important that, given the power imbalance in many of these situations, we do not end up with anything whereby it may be perceived that persons can negotiate or waive their right to speak in relation to an incident.  That is important because the NDAs are damaging not only to the individuals who are pressured into signing or forced to sign them but also to institutions and other persons within institutions, and that is why there is a wider concern.  Again, individual negotiations should not leave us in a situation where those who have perpetrated sexual harassment are granted anonymity.  That is not the intent but we need to be vigilant about what comes next.<\/p> <p>Regarding timeliness, we are being overtaken, as Senator Ruane has described.  Other jurisdictions are copying this legislation and passing it.  Senator Ruane and I have been asked to speak at international conferences of legislators who are seeking to copy this legislation.  We have a really important issue that has been led in this House by Senator Ruane.  I applaud the Minister again for taking the time to do the review and research and push it forward.  Let us retain that momentum.  It is crucial that it be a matter of legislation, not policy, and that there is no discretion regarding whether it should be used.  Let us keep up the momentum and see early progress.  Let us have Ireland lead in this really important area.  As Senator Ruane said, it is part of a wider shift towards transparency away from secrecy.  It is important and could be an international marker for us all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SSS00600","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":690,"content":"<p>We are all doing our best to get it through these Houses as fast as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SSS00700","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":691,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":692,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657098000,"counter":693,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":694,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Report Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SSS01100","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":695,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070600002#SSS01200","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098000,"counter":696,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?
