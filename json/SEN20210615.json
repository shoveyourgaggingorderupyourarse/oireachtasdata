I wish to raise the registration of rights of way and the coming deadline of November.  I understand there are two methods by which rights of way can be registered.  One is that the person who requires the right of way can contact the landowner or owners and ask them to sign an easement which can be lodged with the land registry.  Alternatively, the person seeking the right of way can lodge an application with the land registry, which in turn contacts the landowner or owners, and if there are no issues, the person seeking it may go ahead and register the right of way.<\/p> <p>There is a deadline of November pending for the registration of rights of way.  I suggest the deadline be extended for several reasons, the main one being the public is simply not aware of it.  People are not aware of what will happen or what they will have to do to register a right of way after that date.  There is also the pandemic, which meant most businesses were closed.  Those who were aware of the deadline did not have the opportunity to address the issue of rights of way because of the lockdown.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise two related issues.  Local authorities granting planning permission in areas where there are public walkways is an issue around the country.  They grant planning permissions without being aware a right of way exists, perhaps a public walkway or beach front.  There are examples which have caused friction in communities.  I suggest the Department could issue a directive to all local authorities advising them that prior to granting planning permissions, they should be cognisant of any rights of way, and where there are local rights of way, the local authorities should take on the responsibility of registering them.  It should not be left to members of the public to go through the expensive and arduous procedure.<\/p> <p>There have been delays in requests for registration based on possession.  I am aware it can take up to five or seven years for the process to complete.  Will the Minister of State shed any light on the nature of the problem causing the delay?  Is it staffing or something else?  There is clearly a problem and there has been for some considerable time.<\/p> <p>I would like responses to these, but in particular around the deadline that is coming in November and the lack of awareness among the public.  They need to be made aware of it and advised what the procedure will be after November.  I hope the Minister will extend the deadline and initiate an awareness campaign so that people know the changes and when they will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#A00500","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising an important matter which is exercising many Members, solicitors and others.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Browne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I want to convey the apologies of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Humphreys, who regrets she cannot be here for this matter due to the Cabinet sitting.  On behalf of the Minister and the Government, I thank Senator Gallagher for raising the matter.<\/p><p>The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 provides for fundamental reform and modernisation of land law and conveyancing law, and aims to simplify the law and the conveyancing process.  Registration of easements acquired by prescription is set out in the 2009 Act and the Registration of Title Act 1964, as amended by Parts 12 and 13 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.  The functions previously vested in the Minister for Justice under the 1964 Act were transferred with effect from 1 January 2018 to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, who has responsibility for the Property Registration Authority of Ireland, PRAI.<\/p><p>The Minister for Justice understands from the PRAI that the following is the position.  First, the extension of the transitional period of three years originally prescribed by section 38(b) of the 2009 Act by the 2011 Act, which extends the period to 12 years, relates simply to the period when a claim to a prescriptive right can be made by reliance on the \"old\" law replaced by the 2009 Act.  From 2021, reliance must be made on what can be termed the \"new\" law introduced by the 2009 Act and, in particular, reliance must be made on the new single and shorter period of 12 years.  There is no question of a cut-off point occurring in 2021 when a claim to a prescriptive right can no longer be made.  All that changes in 2021 is the basis on which the prescriptive right can be claimed, and that is the shorter period.<\/p><p>Second, the new procedure for registration of a prescriptive right introduced by section 41 of the 2011 Act is not subject to a time limit.  It is a permanent procedure and, in particular, does not cease to be available in 2021.  The only change which occurs in 2021 is the basis on which an application must be made to the PRAI.  As I pointed out, from 2021, the application will have to be grounded on the \"new\" law introduced by the 2009 Act and reliance on the \"old\" law repealed by that Act will cease to be possible.<\/p><p>This procedure is only for easements, including rights of way, acquired by prescription.  If all parties agree to the registration of an easement, an application should be made by lodging the appropriate deed of grant.<\/p><p>The Department has received correspondence, including a detailed submission, requesting an amendment to section 38 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.  The Department of Justice is currently in the process of arranging discussions with official stakeholders on this topic.  The Department is assessing the situation.  However, it is important people are aware of the changes being made.<\/p><p>With regard to access to public walkways, beaches and so on, that is more a matter for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  However, I understand the Senator's concerns.  It is an issue that concerns many counties, in particular coastal counties, and I have seen similar situations arise in Wexford.<\/p><p>I will bring to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the concerns around delays in registrations with the PRAI.  While, again, it is a matter more appropriate for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, it is an important issue and I will raise it with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#A00600","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response.

While the roll-out of the vaccine is making wonderful progress and, for most people, the end of the pandemic is in sight, unfortunately, it is not so for the aviation sector.  Its global foundations have been rocked to the core.  The sector, quite frankly, feels abandoned by this Government.  Towards the end of last week, we had a situation where Stobart Air indicated it was going into liquidation.  That is having a very significant impact on connectivity and on the nearly 500 people who work for the company.  With regard to Lufthansa Technik, based on media reports over the weekend there is an indication that it is having a strategic review of operations at Shannon Airport.  Given approximately 500 people are working in that operation, there are real concerns in the sector.  This comes on the back of Aer Lingus recently announcing the closure of the cabin crew base at Shannon Airport, with no idea or indication of when it is going to reinstate routes to London Heathrow, Boston and New York, all of which very important routes for balanced regional development, inward investment and connectivity.<\/p> <p>For a country so dependent on aviation for connectivity and jobs, it seems absurd that we have the most restrictive regulations and travel restrictions in Europe.  The failure to endorse rapid antigen testing is ridiculous, in my view, and is preventing people and the sector from having any kind of meaningful recovery.  The delay in rolling out the EU digital Covid certificate to 19 July is hard to fathom when we consider the vast majority of countries across Europe are rolling it out from 1 July.  There is a failure by the Government to engage meaningfully with airports and airlines and to set out a strategy setting out a clear funding model to support and underpin strategic routes while passenger numbers take time to recover, as they will, and to get back to a point where they are profitable and sustainable again.  I appeal to the Minister of State to get the Government to implement this action plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#B00400","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

This is not just about Senator Dooley and I looking to protect Cork and Shannon airports and the staff, who have taken gargantuan hits already and who have made huge sacrifices and changes.

I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Naughton, who cannot be here but who sends her apologies.<\/p> <p>I would like to provide an update on the challenges facing the aviation sector and the steps being taken by the Government to restore connectivity and ensure the industry will be well positioned to recover once the public health crisis has abated.  The Government is very aware of the critical importance of regional and international air connectivity to Ireland's economic development and growth.  It is a key enabler of international trade and business, including foreign direct investment and tourism.  For this reason, the Government places a priority on international connectivity.  Over the years, Ireland's aviation policy has supported a robust and dynamic sector and facilitated rapid growth in new routes and passenger numbers.  The sector is experiencing its most challenging crisis, however, with many analysts predicting it will take several years for it to return to 2019 levels of activity.<\/p> <p>All service providers in the sector, apart from those substantially or exclusively dedicated to air cargo, have had no option but to radically address their core base and seek to safeguard liquidity.  Alongside rationalisation measures, the major service providers are shoring up their finances through increased borrowings or raising new capital.  Regrettably, Stobart Air's plans to secure a new buyer failed over the weekend.  This resulted in the airline ceasing trading and a liquidator is expected to be appointed imminently.<\/p> <p>The announcement is deeply regrettable for the 480 Stobart Air workers who have been directly impacted by the decision, and my thoughts are with those families who have been seriously affected by this shock decision.  Job cuts have, unfortunately, been a feature of other European airlines as a direct consequence of Covid.  The temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, followed by the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, have been generally successful in maintaining the link between airlines and their employees during the Covid crisis.  In this instance, however, the loss of its franchised contract for the operation of regional UK routes and other factors made Stobart Air's position untenable.<\/p> <p>The restoration of regional connectivity is critical for the Government and work is under way to secure a new operator on these vital regional routes as soon as possible.  The Government is acutely aware of the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector and has put in place a range of supports for businesses including the aviation sector.  These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, a waiving of commercial rates, a deferral of tax liabilities, the Covid restrictions support scheme, the credit guarantee scheme and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland working capital scheme.  Liquidity funding is also available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund for medium and large enterprises.<\/p> <p>The Government also allocated funding for an &euro;80 million aviation-specific support package in 2021.  In addition to &euro;21 million in funding for regional airports under the regional airports programme for 2021, a further allocation of up to &euro;6 million to the regional airports under a state aid-compliant scheme is available in 2021.  This is in recognition of the impact of Coivd-19 on our smaller airports, and Donegal, Kerry and Knock Airports are eligible for funding under the scheme.  Applications for funding under this measure are being assessed and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, hopes to be in a position to allocate funding within the coming weeks.  Approximately &euro;32 million is also being provided to support Cork and Shannon Airports this year.<\/p> <p>Additionally, the Department of Transport is assessing applications for funding to State airports under the &euro;20 million Covid-19 supplementary support scheme, and the Minister of State expects to soon be able to provide funding to Cork and Shannon Airports under the scheme.  This support will allow the airports flexibility to provide route incentives and airport charge rebates to stimulate the recovery of lost connectivity this year.  Government policy on regional airports seeks to optimise conditions for regional development and connectivity, both for social and economic benefits.  The Government recognises that, as employers, they contribute to the local economy and employment is supported through the various ancillary services provided to the airport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#C00200","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, key stakeholders - the airlines and airports - do not believe the Government has engaged in a manner that would help to give confidence to the sector to begin the process of recovery.

My frustration at this stage stems from the number of young people who have approached me about their test having been cancelled up to five times, which is causing deep frustration.  Many of those young people are relying on passing the test and have been for some time.  They may rely on it for summer work in the agricultural sector to drive farm machinery or in order that they can move on to the driver test and get their summer work.  Quite a number of students and young people have summer jobs, and if nobody in their family is available to take them to work, they are missing out.

A gradual reopening was possible due to the detailed work undertaken by the RSA and its contractor, in conjunction with expert medical advice, to examine each aspect of the testing process, and ensure to the maximum possible that the resumed tests would be safe for the public.<\/p> <p>The RSA has been working to deliver online theory tests as well with a pilot online test under way for trucks and buses.  The pilot service has now been extended to include a limited number of car and motorbike tests.  The new offering will see 4,000 online theory tests available for all categories of vehicles for the month of June.  From July, the authority plans to offer up to 10,000 tests per month.  Tests are available on a first come, first served basis with the new online service becoming more widely available later in the year.<\/p> <p>It is important to emphasise the limits of an online test.  While convenient for test candidates, tests must be monitored closely thus making them far more staff intensive than tests in centres.  When the RSA and Prometric, which is the test operator, get approval to extend capacity in centres to 50,000 tests they have indicated that they will prioritise staff for the test centres and may have to reduce the figures online from 10,000.  This will have a positive impact as the test centres are far more efficient and can deliver a greater number of tests.<\/p> <p>The Department of Transport is conscious of the significant number of people waiting to take their driver theory test.  While we can appreciate a suggestion of a temporary amnesty to alleviate the backlog, the Minister for Transport will not make changes to the existing legislation for the learning to drive process.  A test is required by EU law.  While the EU requires only that theory be tested before a person receives a full licence, national law requires that before applying for a learning permit, candidates must complete and pass a driver theory test.  This applies to anyone applying for a first learning permit in any vehicle category.  The test is designed to check knowledge of critical issues such as rules of the road, risk perception, hazard awareness and good driving behaviour.  Upon passing the theory test, an individual can then apply for a learner permit.  We require the theory test before issuing a learning permit for the safety of all road users, including the learners themselves.  Until a person successfully completes a driver theory test and demonstrates that he or she has attained a sufficient level of road safety and motoring knowledge, he or she cannot commence driving on our roads.  Almost 25% of all those who undertake a theory test do not pass.  By allowing individuals to bypass this vital step in the learning to drive process will only put their safety and the safety of others at risk, which I know is not the Senator's intention, and risk further pressure on other services.<\/p> <p>It will take time for the driver theory testing service to return to normal and for the backlog to be cleared.  The new online service is still in the pilot stage but the intention is to offer the service more broadly to customers in the coming months.  The increased physical capacity, when permitted, coupled with the new pilot online service will help manage the backlog of customers and shorten waiting times.  Every measure has been put in place to ensure that the maximum number of customers can be served while public health guidelines are strictly adhered to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#D00200","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

He was reputed to have objected, on one occasion, to a policy measure on the basis that while it was all very well in practice that it would not work in theory.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State will be aware, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, was established in 2003 to try to divert personal injuries claims from the courts, reduce legal costs, reduce the pressure on the courts system and relieve upward pressure on insurance premiums.  As we also know, to knowingly or recklessly give false statements in any court, either in direct evidence or by affidavit, amounts to perjury, which is a very serious offence that carries substantial sentences.  The gravity of this offence is underlined in the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Bill 2018.  It was originally sponsored by my former Seanad colleague, P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, and I hope that the Bill will pass its final Stages in the House this afternoon.  While the legislation deals with the situation in the courts, it is a remarkable fact that while the PIAB process was intended to be a substitute of sorts for the courts, there appears to be no legal penalty of any kind for making false or misleading statements in an application to the board for a claim of damages.  In 2019, a total of 31,500 applications were made to the board and 11,500 awards were made.  Approximately 20,000 applications were rejected by PIAB each year for the past several years as being unmeritorious for whatever reason and deserving of no award of damages.  Therefore, PIAB rejects well over 60% of all applications each year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Nobody is suggesting all these rejected applications were false or misleading because there can be many factors involved in the rejection of a claim but, given the sheer number of rejected claims, it is difficult to believe all of them were based on the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Since personal injuries actions are regularly rejected by the courts based on false and misleading evidence, there is a likelihood that a substantial proportion of claims rejected by PIAB were based on allegations that were shown to be false or not wholly true.  While perjury in a court of law runs the risk of prosecution and a serious penalty, there appears to be no penalty whatsoever in law for making a false or misleading claim to PIAB.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 and the very substantial amending Act in 2019 place no positive duty on claimants to tell the truth and do not even contain the words \"false\", \"misleading\" or \"truthful\", or any words like them.  That is extraordinary given the onus of honesty that is correctly placed on applicants to other State agencies.  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act contains stringent provisions against the making of false or misleading claims to the HSE.  There is a penalty of up to three months in prison or a fine of &euro;5,000 for knowingly or recklessly giving false or misleading information.  When dealing with the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social Protection, applicants have to make regular and repeated commitments regarding the truth and accuracy of their applications.  When getting a jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance, an applicant has to sign a declaration stating he or she is out of work and is a genuine claimant.  This must be done every single week for which he or she collects the payment.  Why on earth, therefore, is an applicant of PIAB not required to do likewise given that applicants are often making claims for tens of thousands of euro, or often hundreds of thousands?<\/p><p>Why is there no provision in law applying penalties for false or misleading statements to PIAB?  Is the Minister of State aware of how many claims PIAB exposes as being false or misleading each year?  How would he assess the knock-on effects of such claims on the work of PIAB and on insurance costs?  As matters stand, any person can submit an application seeking damages that is a tissue of lies from start to finish but face no consequences for doing so.  Does the Government have a reason for this?  Will it justify further inaction?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#D00600","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Mullen for raising this important matter, which I am taking on behalf of Minister of State, Deputy Robert Troy, who unfortunately cannot be here this morning.  PIAB is an agency under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that independently assesses claims for compensation arising from personal injuries.  It can assess claims only where both parties, namely, the claimant and respondent, consent to an assessment.  Under the PIAB process, a respondent has 90 days to carry out an appropriate examination of the facts relating to a claim before deciding whether to proceed with the PIAB process.  By proceeding with the PIAB process, the respondent would have considered the claimant's case and satisfied himself or herself as to its merits or otherwise.  Where liability is an issue, or the circumstances of a claim are disputed, the respondent, generally an insurer, will refuse an assessment of the claim by PIAB so he or she can investigate the matter.  In those circumstances, PIAB will release the case and provide authorisation to a claimant to proceed to litigation if he or she so wishes.<\/p> <p>PIAB does not investigate the circumstances of claims or address the issue of liability.  This is because PIAB is not a court.  It is an administrative body that assesses and makes awards for personal injuries based on the personal injury guidelines following consent of the parties and without recourse to court.  The determination of liability is, by its nature, a matter of judgment for which a court is the appropriate body and for which a court can take into account the relevant matters presented to it by all parties.<\/p> <p>Cases that proceed to court are subject to the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  Section 14 of the Act provides that any party to a personal injuries action who has falsely sworn an affidavit is guilty of an offence.  Sections 25 and 26 address the matter of false evidence and fraudulent actions and section 29 sets out the penalties for persons found guilty of such acts, including fines of up to &euro;100,000 or up to ten years in prison, or both.<\/p> <p>The investigation of fraud is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Any individuals or companies that believe they are the victims of fraud should report it to the Garda.  PIAB co-operates fully with any requests for information from the Garda.<\/p> <p>The PIAB model, which is based on the consent of parties, works.  It saves tens of millions of euro annually that would otherwise be paid in costs by the parties, and ultimately by policyholders.  Through PIAB, claims can be settled without the need for many of the costs associated with litigation, which can contribute to the high cost of settling and the cost of insurance.<\/p> <p>A range of actions to mitigate insurance fraud are set out in the Government's Action Plan for Insurance Reform.  These actions are led, in the main, by the Minister for Justice.  Of particular importance is the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Bill 2018, currently before the Houses and which I hope will pass through the Seanad today.  When enacted, this will provide a deterrent to the making of misleading or fraudulent statements.  It will be a welcome development, particularly regarding the cost of insurance.<\/p> <p>As part of the action plan, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, is currently finalising legislative proposals to enhance and reform PIAB and will engage with the Seanad on strengthening the PIAB process in the near future.<\/p> <p>PIAB is not a court.  It is an administrative body for assessing and either party can reject the process if he or she feels unsatisfied with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#E00200","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Nobody ever said PIAB was a court.  I accept that the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, is just a messenger for another Minister of State but, on a previous occasion, when Deputy Michael McGrath asked a parliamentary question on the same matter, the then Minister, Deputy Humphreys, at least stated baldly there were no penalties involved where false and misleading claims are made to PIAB.  On neither occasion has the Government given a reason for this omission.  The result is that somebody can place their lies on the roulette wheel of PIAB without even having to buy a chip.  One can imagine a situation in which there is a conspiracy involving the person making a claim and somebody within an organisation.  Why should there not be a penalty for putting false information before PIAB &ndash; false information which, for one reason or another, might not be properly denied or put in issue, as a result of which there would be a concession and acceptance of an award from PIAB?  The reply that was given previously was very matter of fact and almost blas&eacute; but, in the context of the discussion on personal injury claims and insurance costs, which has raged in recent years, there is surely a jaw-dropping lacuna.  There has been no action by the Government.  There has been much political posturing about the cost of insurance in recent years.  I have said here before that those involved often seem more interested in the rhetoric and grabbing headlines than in tackling the problem.  Judges and the legal profession have been unfairly blamed.  There was even a nonsensical kite flown about a potential constitutional amendment to cap awards.  The Judicial Council guidelines on awards have come into effect, which is welcome, but I have concerns about some of the changes made that may see the victims of genuine injuries being short-changed owing to large cuts to the levels of awards.  There is little indication, of course, that there will be a fall in insurance premiums.

The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in concert with its enterprise development agencies and other Departments, is actively working to support the implementation of this strategy through the progression of actions over the course of 2021, overseen by an interdepartmental group.  Future investment in remote working hubs and infrastructure in particular in underserved areas will underpin the development of the national hubs network over the coming period.<\/p> <p>To build on the capacity of enterprise centres, incubator hubs and shared office space to offer remote working facilities, a central objective of Enterprise Ireland's regional strategy, Powering the Regions, is the Worksmart Challenge.

This new article imposes severe and undue hardship on inshore fishermen who are already hard pressed to make a living.  I will explain what I mean by inshore fishermen.  I live in Schull, but the same applies to Crookhaven, Baltimore, Union Hall, and all around the coastline including in Donegal and Wexford where they fish in small boats of between 18 ft. and 35 ft.

It was intended to target, in some instances, the illegal landing of pelagic fish in large amounts and lots.  It has now accidentally spilt over on to these unfortunate fishermen.  The cost to fishermen, whether they be in Schull, Crookhaven or Union Hall, of getting a weighing scales to weigh a box of crabs, two or three dozen lobsters, or perhaps a box of shrimp is totally unrealistic.  It should be revoked.<\/p><p>Fishermen traditionally trusted the factories and storage facilities.  The fish were weighed, and they were paid a fair sum of money for the product they fished, supplied and brought on shore.  This new regulation will place a burden on them which many will not be in the position to meet or to take on board financially.  It is ludicrous and I ask the Minister of State to convey this message, not alone to the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, which is the enforcer in this country, but also to the European Commission.<\/p><p>As another example, recently in Castletownbere, three large Spanish trawlers landed probably about 100,000 tonnes of pelagic fish.  Not one of those fish was weighed.  The fish were landed in large refrigerated lorries and transported all the way to Spain.  Who is monitoring that?  Who is controlling that situation?  In my view, there is no one doing so.  Unless we wake up and look after the inshore fishermen - I am talking about the small guys or the small women, in regard to their catch, around the coast - they will be put out of business.  When that is all gone, we will have people in Schull or Baltimore and in the restaurants throughout the country, who would love to see crab meat, lobster or shrimp on their plate, asking what happened to those fishermen.  They have been over-regulated and hounded out of business.  As I said earlier, these people are the endangered species, yet the big players, particularly the Spanish and the French who have abnormal quotas, seem to do what they want.  I ask the Minister of State to wake up.  I know he is here representing the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, who has his own situation in County Donegal.  I ask them to give some respect and fair play to these part-time fishermen who are trying to eke out a living.  Some of them are on the fish assist scheme, etc.  They should not be put out of business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#F00700","speaker":"1691","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, who is in Lisbon today for important discussions relating to the Common Agricultural Policy and, unfortunately, cannot be here.  I thank Senator O&rsquo;Donovan for providing me with the opportunity to update the House on the matters pertaining to this very important issue.<\/p><p>For the record, I should state at the outset that the strict legal position in relation to the revocation of Ireland's control plan is that the monitoring and control of fishing vessels within Ireland's exclusive fisheries zone are matters for the Irish control authorities.  Under the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, all operational issues of this nature are exclusively for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the Naval Service.  Therefore, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, is expressly precluded from getting involved in operational matters such as this.<\/p><p>By way of background, as the Senator will be aware, following an EU Commission audit in 2018, Ireland received a formal decision of the Commission's intention to conduct an administrative inquiry under Article 102(2) of the 2009 EU Fisheries Control Regulation to evaluate Ireland's capacity to apply the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  The findings of the inquiry were communicated to Ireland in December 2020.  The findings of the administrative inquiry deemed the Irish control and sanctioning systems as unsatisfactory, and the Commission put forward a concrete and specific package of measures to address the issues raised.  Many of the issues arising in the administrative inquiry are operational matters for the SFPA and, under statute, the Minister is precluded from getting involved in them.<\/p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has commenced a process of engagement with the EU Commission in association with the SFPA, which is responsible for operational matters.  In the context of this engagement, the Senator will appreciate that the Minister is not in a position to comment on the EU Commission's findings and the package of measures the Commissioner has set out.  To do so, at this juncture, would risk prejudice to Ireland's position.  In the context of the administrative inquiry, Ireland was notified in April 2021 of a Commission implementing decision revoking the approval of the Irish control plan submitted for the weighing of fishery products.  The European Commission deemed that Ireland's obligations arising from the 2009 EU Fisheries Control Regulation were not being met by the Irish control plan as the risk of non-compliance with the rules of the CFP could not be minimised.  The Commission implementing decision in relation to the revocation of the control plan states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... operators did not have in place a &quot;weighing system fit for purpose&quot;, as provided under ... the control plan and the audit identified manipulation of weighing systems.  Moreover, although aware of [these] shortcomings, Ireland did not take appropriate measures to address such noncompliance, in particular by withdrawing the permission to weigh after transport as foreseen in ... the control plan.  Consequently, the control plan does not minimise the risk of ... [systemic] manipulation of weighing pelagic catches in Ireland and the under-declaration of catches by operators. <\/blockquote> <p>Since the Commission's decision was announced, I understand the SFPA has engaged directly with the industry to ensure that fishers and processors are familiar with the changes that are required to comply with EU weighing requirements, and continues to engage with the industry on this matter.  The SFPA recently advised that it is holding a public consultation to gather feedback and opinion on a revised control plan for a derogation to weigh fish after transport in Ireland.  The online consultation is open until 18 June 2021 and is available on the SFPA website.<\/p><p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, I would like to reassure the Senator and the House that the Government takes the Commission's findings relating to fisheries control failures, including the revocation of Ireland's control plan, very seriously.  We are fully committed to having an effective, dissuasive and proportionate system of fisheries control in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#G00200","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I know the Minister of State is standing in for the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, but that answer disappoints me.  The facts are that tomorrow week, there will be hundreds of trawlers coming up the Liffey by way of protest.  The reasons for this are that countries like Belgium have a larger quota for certain species than the Irish have.  We have been totally unrepresented.  The Minister, through the Commissioner and the Commission, must stand up for the rights of these fishermen.  To say that the SFPA will do its job is grossly unfair.  Why is the SFPA not in places like Castletownbere and Dingle, and other ports like Killybegs or Ros an Mh&iacute;l, weighing the fish brought in by the French and the Spanish monthly or weekly?  That is ignored but the poor Irish guys, especially the inshore fishermen, are really overpoliced.  They can - excuse the language - go to hell.

I pay tribute to him, particularly, for the effort he put into bringing this Bill through that Seanad.  I also acknowledge the contribution of the Regional Group, which brought it through the D&aacute;il.  It will, hopefully, be passed today.  It is very useful legislation that, surprisingly, was not previously on the Statute Book.  People will now, hopefully, take the offence of perjury more seriously and people who decide to perjure themselves or commit perjury in a court will be pursued more diligently than they have been in the past.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge there are significant numbers of people, particularly from Donegal but also Mayo, coming to the convention centre today to highlight their plight regarding mica in their homes.  For any of us, the purchase and building of a home is the biggest investment most of us will ever make, certainly in a personal capacity.  These defective blocks were sold to so many people who built their houses, which are their sanctuaries, where they live and raise families and where they think they can go to protect themselves from the whole world, only to discover their houses were crumbling and falling down around their ears.  It is shocking this was allowed to happen and the people who sold these blocks will not, and cannot, be pursued.  I hope that somebody tries.  The State should make sure that we protect people and give them redress.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Cabinet are dealing with that today, but we really must pursue people.  <\/p> <p>We need a debate on building controls generally in this House.  All of us know of people who have had great experiences with builders and contractors, but equally we all have horror stories.  Many of us on local authorities know of people whose houses were not completed properly, where workmanship was shoddy and the tradesmen involved did not do what they were supposed to.  We need, as a State, to make sure people working on sites are competent and able to what they do, and, if they are not, that they can be pursued.  It is not okay for people to engage in shoddy workmanship.  It happens all the time; obviously not in every situation but too often.  We need, as a State, to look at how we regulate.  People get planning permission, which they do not necessarily complete.  There are no checks on that.  We need a proper debate and decent action on how we pursue people who do not complete houses the way they should and do not carry out the work they were engaged to do. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#K00300","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I am doing something unusual this morning; I am opposing the Order of Business.  I do so because I object to the Government's disgusting habit of constantly proposing, and implementing, the guillotining of legislation in this House.  It happened again on Committee Stage of the Affordable Housing Bill on Friday, 4 June.  Many amendments were not discussed, including one of mine.  We have been promised so often that the guillotine would only be used sparingly, but that is not what is happening.  It would be interesting to get the Oireachtas Library and Research Service to examine when this practice of ruthlessly guillotining discussion of legislation started.  On that particular day, 4 June, the worst of it was a Committee Stage debate on housing was guillotined to give way to a Private Members' motion on housing from Fianna F&aacute;il Senators on the question of a constitutional right to housing, something specifically excluded from the programme for Government.  That sums up the attitude of the three largest political parties to housing.  Instead of devoting more time to debating housing legislation, they provide time to allow debate on a toothless motion purely for political grandstanding.  It is high time Government Senators stood up to their party leaders and told them to back off.  The reputation of the Seanad is destroyed every time this guillotining rule is implemented.<\/p><p>I also raise today the strange attitudes of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  On 19 May, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, met the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran, which was a friendly meeting by all accounts, complete with elbow bumps.  On 1 June, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, visited China and made a very emollient statement afterwards of the kind we have become used to.  It was certainly nothing China would object to.  The same week the Minister launched a ferocious attack on Israel in the D&aacute;il regarding the conflict there and, just 24 hours after returning from China, he correctly denounced the President of Belarus as having no democratic legitimacy.  How can he excoriate Israel one day and have friendly elbow bumps with the foreign minister of a country supplying the rockets Hamas use to attack Israel the next?  How can he have friendly meetings with a totalitarian communist government and then accuse Belarus of having no democratic legitimacy?  What does it say about the moral underpinning of Irish foreign policy?  Have we stopped pretending we base our foreign policy on morality and human rights, instead sacrificing both on the altar of trade links?  It is hardly a coincidence that we are trying to expand our exports to China and Iran but have negligible exports to Israel and almost none to Belarus.<\/p><p>I will conclude by referring to a very troubling paragraph I came across in an important book, <i>Hidden Hand: Exposing How the Chinese Communist Party is Reshaping the World.<\/i>It describes how the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, CPAFFC, is actually a front for the Chinese Communist Party.  In May 2019, the Chinese news agency, Xinhua, reported on the signing of a memorandum of understanding between CPAFFC and a think tank in Ireland, Asia Matters, &quot;to promote people-to-people exchanges and co-operation&quot;.  According to this report, at the ceremony, Ireland's foreign minister and deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said that the deepening relationship would help Ireland reach out to the European Union so as to advance China's interest in the EU.  Does that not say it all?  We need a debate on China and our Government's attitude to it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#K00400","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I join colleagues yesterday and, I am sure, today, in raising the need for defibrillators throughout the country, following the shock we all felt during the Denmark-Finland game when a young fit player, Christian Ericksen, dropped to the ground after suffering a cardiac arrest.  The medical team on site jumped into action and with the aid of an automated external defibrillator, AED, the player was stabilised and a life was saved.  The availability of trained people and an AED was key.  The Irish Red Cross estimate there are between 8,000 and 10,000 public access defibrillators in Ireland but there is evidence some are not being checked regularly and, therefore, may not be working.  A study by the Health Information and Quality Authority found instances of battery failure and issues regarding the accessibility of defibrillators and where they were located.<\/p> <p>We need a central register of all available defibrillators in the country and regular inspections to ensure they are working.  I previously highlighted our magnificent community first responders who are embedded in our communities and, thankfully, many of them are back at work.  We must provide them with the training and funding they need to be able to certify and log these AEDs on a central system.  We should also talk with all the many clubs in the country, which have AEDs locked away in clubhouses and are unsure about making them available to the public due to fears about vandalism and insurance.  We need to reassure them that should vandalism occur, insurance will be in place to replace the unit.  <\/p> <p>A defibrillator used by a trained person increases the survival rate from a sudden cardiac arrest by 50% if CPR and defibrillation occurs within the first four minutes of the incident.

This is a route and service making a difference to rural south Kildare and its villages.  The Kildare South Dublin Local Link wants to improve its service on the 880 route from Carlow via Castledermot to Naas.  The application is with the National Transport Authority, NTA, but has unfortunately not received the funding required and we are told that the NTA is seeking additional funding from the Government. The  Kildare South Dublin Local Link website tells us that if improved, the 880 route would benefit from additional trips in each direction, the addition of services on a Saturday and Sunday, and the addition of evening services on Friday and Saturday.  Most important, the reconfiguration will also see the inclusion of the villages of Narraghmore, Calverstown and Two Mile House, bringing much-needed public transport to these great villages.  <\/p><p>Additional to the above, the commissioning of a fully accessible low-floor bus will ensure the relevance of the service for people with mobility issues.

We have also had a review by the Minister&rsquo;s own Department on Shannon which was announced last August.  Yet we are here, in the teeth of the worst crisis in the aviation sector and certainly the worst crisis in Shannon&rsquo;s history, where we have lost an Aer Lingus cabin crew base with 81 jobs just a couple weeks ago, and where 500 jobs are now at risk at Lufthansa Technik.

Recently, it has been supporting a number of families who find themselves disadvantaged because of their marital status.  <\/p> <p>Treoir told me of a father who lost his life partner and the mother of their three children earlier this year due to Covid-19.  Although they had been living together for 20 years they never got married.  A married man in a similar situation would be entitled to the widower's grant, an &euro;8,000 support provided through the Department of Social Protection.  This can be a very important support when one loses a loved one.  This unmarried father was unable to access the widower's pension because he was not married to his life partner.  This unmarried couple both paid their PRSI.  If they had been married for just one day, the partner would have been entitled to the widower's pension and grant.  These children are being denied the opportunity to benefit from a State support that children of married parents benefit from.  For all other social protection supports, these unmarried parents would be assessed as a married couple but for the widower's grant and pension these people are assessed as individuals.  This is not right.  The recent Citizens' Assembly report on gender equality calls for a constitutional change to protect families, with protection not limited to the marital families.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Eileen Flynn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I support Treoir's call for the Government to extend the widower's grant to cohabiting couples and to put in place a pension scheme for cohabiting couples.

I totally support the campaigners who are beginning their protest at Convention Centre Dublin and marching to the D&aacute;il today.  I have had experience with the pyrite remediation scheme.  It worked very well.  It was introduced with a level 3 assessment from an engineer, which was a visual inspection.  From there, the programme rolled out.  The mica redress scheme is being assessed completely differently, as we are aware.  In fairness, the Government has addressed the issue, but has only come 90% of the way.  At this stage, we need to go the final furlong.<\/p> <p>The &euro;8,000 that people have to come up with to start their assessment and get the ball rolling is just too big of a lump sum to begin with.  The county council should possibly bear that burden.  Also, there are a few other issues that are causing the scheme to stall currently.  The cap of &euro;275,000 is too low.  So far, around 50 homes have been assessed.  The average size of the homes assessed is 2,500 sq. ft, while the original estimated figure in respect of these houses was just over 2,000 sq. ft.  The payment of &euro;120,000 or &euro;130,000 per cost of rebuild for these houses should probably be linked under the scheme.  The 10% shortfall is also a problem with the scheme.  Holiday homes are exempt.  Getting insurance is a problem for people who, in some cases, rebuild the outside leaf of their house but are not rebuilding the internal leaf.  They will need some sort of State guarantee going forward.<\/p> <p>Finally, I would like to mention the chair of the mica redress committee, Councillor Martin McDermott, who has been doing Trojan work on this issue.  Indeed, I met Councillor McDermott and the group leader for Fianna F&aacute;il, Councillor Ciaran Brogan, in the last few weeks .  They outlined to me the issues and the problems that they face on the ground and the work that needs to be done.  I know that the Taoiseach visited Donegal.  I have also spoken to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage about the issue.  I know that work is being done.

I wish to raise the issue of the Central Bank of Ireland and the very restrictive rules that it has in respect of lending in comparison to other European countries.<\/p> <p>While I accept the independence of the Central Bank, the Government should make it clear that the bank should relax and reduce the lending rules.  As legislators, we can act, while at the same time respecting the independence of the Central Bank.  There are many people in their late 20s and early 30s who are trying to buy their first home.  In Dundalk, for example, they are paying &euro;1,200, &euro;1,300 or &euro;1,400 in rent per month.  In Dublin, they are paying much more.  How can people be expected to pay that kind of rent and also save the same amount towards a deposit?  If the rules were relaxed to allow people to show that they consistently pay &euro;1,100, &euro;1,200, &euro;1,300 and &euro;1,400 in rent, surely that could go towards a deposit.  In one of the first Private Members' Bills in the last D&aacute;il, the former Deputy, Noel Rock, proposed legislation in this regard.  His legislation would have allowed 70% of rent paid in the previous three years to act as a form of shadow deposit, providing that documentation showed that the tenant had paid rent on time for the last three months.  If we were able to do that, it would benefit people trying to get onto the property ladder for the first time.  In 2019, the T&aacute;naiste stated: \"I do think one aspect of mortgage rules that is very tough is that you are expected to show you are saving at the same time you are renting, but of course if you didn't have to pay a rent of &euro;2,000 a month you would be able to save.\"<\/p> <p>To conclude, I think it is a cop-out to say we are doing everything we can to try to improve the housing situation in this country, but we are not tackling the elephant in the room, namely, the fact that we have the strictest lending laws and rules in the EU.  If we are going to stand in this House and talk about solutions to the housing crisis, we must engage with the Central Bank.  If an individual in their late 20s or early 30s is consistently paying &euro;1,100, &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,300 a month in rent, surely he or she can pay a mortgage at the same price.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#M00300","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I would like to raise a few issues today.  First, two months after the cyber attack, why is the Department of Health using it as an excuse for not coming to this House to answer questions under Commencement matters?  I am sick to death of people who are in jobs refusing to do their job.  The amount of funding that the HSE receives in our annual budget does not mean that it can shirk its responsibilities.  Two months is long enough.  I ask the Leader to address the issue with Government Ministers immediately.<\/p> <p>Second, I wish to raise the welcome news on the changes to the employment permits system.  As of yesterday, the occupation of healthcare assistant has been removed from the ineligible occupation list within the framework.  It is a welcome change, as fewer and fewer people in our country are entering this sector of the labour market.  If the pandemic has taught us anything, it should be that we must encourage elderly healthcare.  Many people do not know that families may claim relief on the actual costs of employing a carer.<\/p> <p>I wish to make a point in relation to our mainstream media.  The scaremongering and fear that is tripping off the tongues of reporters is unnecessary.  Not only have they now effectively become the Government's spokespersons, but they have never looked for what they advertise as \"the truth matters\".  The alternative voice of reason is rarely heard in this country.  The pictures from the G7 meeting of all the leaders sitting around a conference table unmasked say a lot.  Those who are leading us here have us sitting in a building costing &euro;25,000 a day.  This madness must stop.  Like many of my colleagues in the Chamber, I will be vaccinated before we return to business in September.  We must show confidence in our belief in vaccines.  I will not be wearing a mask once I am double vaccinated.  Either we believe vaccination works, or we are fooling the people.  Variants will be with us for decades.  People will present with different symptoms monthly.<\/p> <p>I also want to support the mica protest today.

I am aware that many Senators and Deputies have no interest in the fishing industry whatsoever.  I have been involved in public life since 1985.  My concern is that a country like Belgium has a much bigger quota for certain species of fish than Ireland.  The Spanish and the French have dominated the industry.  We have 15% of the catch in our own waters.  That is crazy.  Negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy are ongoing.  Why have Governments, past or present, not renegotiated the Common Fisheries Policy to give the Irish fishers - who are men and women - a fair deal with regard to the quotas in their own waters.

Fishing boats will soon be tied up and the fishermen, like some of the fish, are an endangered species.  I ask the Leader for a debate on the issue.

It is unique funding that gives sports clubs an opportunity to embark on large-scale developments.  The pot of &euro;40 million is very welcome.  More than 3,100 applicants have sought money from the fund.  The Department stated the calls for funding amount to in excess of &euro;200 million.  More than 60 different sports have sought funding.  We have approximately one fifth of the budget relative to the demand, which gives rise to the question of how we will deal with the requests for funding.  We either give a small number of the applicants the funding they require to deliver their projects or we give a large number of applicants a small amount of money, which means many of these projects will not get off the ground.<\/p> <p>We must work between now and next November to find a solution to the problem.

Many of the clubs fundraise and do so much to build up the matching funding required to develop their amenities.

If anything was brought home to us on Saturday evening it was the importance of defibrillators.  We must ensure, first, that every community has a defibrillator and, second and most important, that it is working.  We should remind ourselves we have a number of similar instances in this country almost every year.  We have seen that defibrillators have been so important.  I know the Leader will take this message back and I know where her own heart is in this regard, but we all have a responsibility - politicians, communities and the Government - to make sure we have up-to-date defibrillators throughout the country and, most important, that they are all working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#N00300","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Four weeks ago I raised the plight of long-term patients in hospital who are waiting to get home and the fact they are allowed no visitors.  I thank the Leader for writing a letter to the Minister for Health.  I followed up on the issue with him in the meantime, asking that long-term patients in hospital should be afforded the same visiting rights as those who are in nursing home care.  There is no reason they would not be allowed at least one visit a week.  I received a very distressed email last night from a relative who had seen his uncle for all of a couple of minutes in the past week.  When he went in to see him, his hair was long and his nails were long.  The family asked if they could get a niece in to cut his hair and his nails but they were told they could not.  A staff member pulled them aside on the way out to say that if they handed in a nail clippers they would look after him.  Things like that should not happen.  If relatives were allowed in to visit their elderly or vulnerable family members with early dementia, they could cater for things like that themselves.  They could oversee the care.  I contacted the hospital in question but the situation is not unique to the hospital.  It is the case across the country.<\/p> <p>Now that all the people in hospitals are vaccinated there is no reason for such a disproportionate restriction on visiting rights.

The European Parliament backed a motion to support the waiver.  Fine Gael did not support it.  Even Joe Biden is now calling for patents to be waived.  In all of our names, the European Commission is putting shareholders before citizens.  It is putting private profit before public health and delaying production rather than waiving the patents.  We have seen unprecedented restrictions on citizens but no rules on the pharma companies whose technology has been funded for decades by taxpayers.  AstraZeneca's vaccine was developed with at least 97% of public and charitable funding.  Vaccines have been funded by public money yet are very much private goods and so the pandemic becomes a profit-generating machine.

In north County Dublin we have two fantastic estuaries, namely, the Broadmeadow Estuary and the Rogerstown Estuary, so we are very familiar with the word \"inbhear\".

Every county council should have a full-time Irish language officer and a naming committee.  That committee can ensure the correct Irish versions of names are given and suggest Irish names for all new housing estates, roads and pieces of infrastructure.  This has worked well in Galway City Council and now over 30% of housing estates in Galway have an Irish name.  This sends a strong signal of support and respect for the Irish language.

It is not acceptable, whether in a hospital or nursing home, for anybody to have long hair or long nails just because a family member is not allowed in to give the loving care they would normally give.  If somebody is in hospital, it is up to the staff at that hospital to ensure the person receives the care, even if that is something as simple as washing the person or cutting his or her nails.  It is outrageous that somebody said to the patient's family member that if he or she dropped in a nail clippers, they would look after it.

Nevertheless, the Senator's point, which was made by Noel Rock in the previous D&aacute;il, is pertinent.  If people cannot afford to save the deposits they need because they are paying such excessive levels of rent, that participatory record needs to be taken into account.  I suggest the Senator might reintroduce the legislation tabled by Noel Rock in the previous D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>Senator Davitt talked about Councillor Martin McDermott and the strong work he has done to represent the families in question.  As I said earlier, I hope there will be a good and positive outcome today.<\/p><p>Senator Flynn raised the same issue.  The other issue she raised, with regard to the widow's pension, would probably be more pertinent to Commencement matters but I will contact her after this debate to see how I can help her.<\/p><p>Senator Gavan raised the issue of an interview with the Minister for Transport regarding the establishment of a task force.  It pains me to say I agree with almost everything the Senator said.  There have been too many task forces and reports and much too little action.  We need absolute action now, not in a few weeks or months when we are all aghast at more job losses in the aviation industry that will trickle down to the hospitality industry.  We cannot be left whingeing after the fact, given we have an opportunity to do something about it now.  I support the Senator in his comments.<\/p><p>Senator Martin opened his contribution with some lovely comments on Arlene Foster.  Her speech yesterday was dignified and ladylike and so in tune with her public life in Northern Ireland, and I wish her well.  We all take for granted that when the bricks and bats are thrown in political life, we are supposed to be able to take them.  Ms Foster showed yesterday with great humanity that she is a true lady.  I dare say Northern Ireland will rue the actions of her party colleagues in recent weeks in regard to what is anticipated, although I wish them well in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Senator Wall spoke about defibrillators and I support him in that regard, but more important, we need to have a debate on rural transport.  Local Link buses provide essential transport for people in rural counties.  I will try to arrange that debate as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen requested a debate on China and other humanitarian aspects of international behaviour.  I have submitted a request for a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the China issue, but a wider debate is probably needed on some of the issues the Senator raised.  I cannot promise I will secure that in the next couple of weeks but I will do so as soon as I can.  Every day I propose an Order of Business.  It is entirely up to the House whether it accepts it and I appreciate that Senators are entitled to oppose it.<\/p><p>Senator Horkan opened the debate with a welcoming of what, please God, will be the passing of the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Bill 2018 today before it returns to the D&aacute;il for a final adjudication of the amendments passed in this House.  It shows the power of Private Members' time and legislation.  It is very welcome and I look forward to it being on the Statute Book.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#O00500","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1623744000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the Order of Business be agreed to.\"<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 27; N\u00edl, 6.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Robbie Gallagher and Se\u00e1n Kyne; N\u00edl, Senators R\u00f3n\u00e1n Mullen and Sharon Keogan.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#P00200","aye":["1633","1636","1637","1638","1384","1639","1640","1642","1643","1646","1648","1651","1652","1653","1655","1658","1412","1665","1666","1667","1670","1671","1674","1691","1692","1682","1685"],"nay":["1657","1660","1664","1673","1688","1686"],"abs":[]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Sitting Arrangements: Motion","time":1623744000,"counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#R00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \t(1) That, notwithstanding anything in the Standing Orders relative to Public Business, the Seanad on its rising on Tuesday, 15th June, 2021, shall adjourn until 9.30 a.m. on Friday, 18th June, 2021, in the D&aacute;il Chamber, and unless otherwise ordered, the following arrangements shall apply:  \t(<i>a<\/i>) Standing Orders 29 and 30 shall stand suspended;<br \/><br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) there shall be no Order of Business;<br \/><br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) the business to be taken shall be confined to the items set out in the Schedule to this paragraph and, accordingly, no other business shall be taken unless the Seanad shall otherwise order on motion made by the Leader of the House or such other Senator as she may authorise in that behalf. <div><b>Schedule<\/b><\/div><i>Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.<\/i><br \/><br \/>Subject to the publication of the Bill, the Order for Second Stage and Second Stage of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 shall be taken at 9.30 a.m. and shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10.45 a.m. The opening contribution of the Minister at the debate on Second Stage shall not exceed 8 minutes, the contribution of all Senators shall not exceed 5 minutes, and the Minister shall be given no less than 8 minutes to reply to the debate.<br \/><br \/><i>Suspension of Sitting.<\/i><br \/><br \/>On the conclusion of the proceedings on the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2021, the sitting shall be suspended until 11.15 a.m., or for 15 minutes after such conclusion, whichever is the later.<br \/><br \/><i>Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2021 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.<\/i><br \/><br \/>Subject to the publication of the Bill, the Order for Second Stage and Second Stage of the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2021 shall be taken on the resumption of the sitting and shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 75 minutes.

As the House is aware, the purpose of the Bill is to consolidate and simplify the law relating to offences and related offences.<\/p> <p>The Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Bill 2018 aims to establish a statutory criminal offence, much like theft or burglary, for perjury that could clearly be understood by the public, enforcement authorities and prosecutors alike.  The Bill proposes penalties of up to 12 months for conviction on a summary offence and up to ten years for conviction on indictment, and these clear statutory penalties for perjury and related offences will act as a deterrent to the offence of perjury and facilitate effective prosecution of the offence to reflect substantial damaging effects caused by perjury.<\/p> <p>The amendments brought by the Government to the Bill in the D&aacute;il, all of which were taken on Committee Stage, were necessary to take account of various matters identified by the Office of the Attorney General and in consideration of the observations of other Departments and the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions which might have affected the ability of the State to prosecute effectively under the legislation.  Most of the amendments were technical in nature and reflected the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel as to how best the provisions should be drafted.  Others were designed to ensure the new legislation can deal effectively with statements of truth, which are an electronic form of providing formal statements in civil proceedings in place of affidavits and statutory declarations which were introduced by the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020.  Many of the amendments were focused on more clearly clarifying the provisions in the Bill to ensure the offences in the Bill can be prosecuted effectively.<\/p> <p>Turning to the detail of the amendments themselves, these are all Government amendments taken on Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The first group of amendments are Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, 27, 28 and 36.  These are amendments to sections 1 and 17, and to the Title of the Bill.  Amendment No. 1 allows for the inclusion of a reference to the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020, to which we refer in this Bill, in relation to statements of truth.  Amendment No. 2 provides for the enactment of the Bill as having the same meaning as in the Interpretation Act of 2005, while amendments Nos. 3 and 5 provide clarity on interpreting references to perjury and subornation of perjury under this Bill.  Amendment No. 4 deletes a reference to \"relevant Act\" which is not required in light of the wider, more comprehensive reference to enactment, which covers secondary as well as primary legislation for the purposes of qualifying offences under section 6 in respect of false statutory declarations and other false statements without oath.  Amendment No. 6 provide that section 21(3) of the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 does not apply in the case of this Bill.  This is because a subsection of the 2020 Act assumes references in any enactments to affidavits and statutory declarations as references to statements of truth made in place of such affidavits and statutory declarations, whereas in this Bill those affidavits and statutory declarations are treated separately and distinctly and do not need to be included here.  Amendment No. 27 amends the Short Title of the Bill in accordance with the usual formulation used for Government Bills which would provide for criminal offences by renaming it the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021.  Amendment No. 28 is a technical amendment while amendment No. 36 is on foot of proposed new wording from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#T00400","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Is it proposed to continue this item until 1 p.m. given we started 15 minutes late, or must we conclude at 12.45 p.m.?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#T00500","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>At 12.45 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#T00600","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>That is a pity because we have cut 15 minutes off this discussion on what is a Seanad Bill which was initiated by our former colleague.  I was not a Member of the Oireachtas at the time but it is an excellent Bill which is overdue.  I give credit to the Government for accepting it and moving it through the Houses and back to us now.  It is important to recognise that all legislators have a role in making legislation.  We do not need to rely solely on Departments to bring legislation or ideas for legislative proposals forward.  It is welcome it was accepted by the Government and turned into a Government Bill.<\/p> <p>I think the changes to section 17 and the renaming of the Bill was unnecessary.  It comes back to the control that is exercised over the legislative process by the various Departments.  Sometimes the Department of Justice has its style, and I make no criticism of that, but the original name of the Bill was perfectly adequate.  I do not think it needed to be renamed, and renaming does not advance anything in the legislative content of the Bill.  It may well conform to legislative nomenclature conventions but that is all.  The name originally given to it by the proposer was adequate.<\/p> <p>If time is limited, I will not speak for long but I welcome that important amendments were made in the D&aacute;il on definitions that will make this much stronger legislation.  The inclusion of the offence of suborning perjury is particularly important because we know so many instances of perjury can come from pressure being put on an individual by another person.<\/p> <p>Reading the Second Stage debates in both Houses, I know the provenance of the Bill came from an idea that it would help to address issues of fraud, especially around insurance claims.  That is very welcome.  It is very important we send out the message that people who lie in insurance claims and bring false claims and back that up by making false statements before the court must suffer the rigours of this kind of legislation and the penalties that come with it, but it goes beyond that.  People make sworn statements and give sworn evidence in every type of legal case from criminal matters to family matters to civil disputes and personal injuries cases.  This legislation will benefit every one of them.  It gives a greater strength and importance to the oath that is given by a witness in a given case, or indeed to the statements of truth that are given in relation to legislation that we passed last year.  It is very welcome in that regard.<\/p> <p>I hope this will bring a serious indication from the Houses of the Oireachtas that the State will not tolerate lies being told in the context where a person has made it clear it is a statement of truth or given so under oath and I hope that message goes out in relation to any such statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#T00700","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State back to the Chamber.  I compliment our erstwhile colleague, P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, on his excellent work on this area.  I know the long hours he put into the Bill.  As he is from a business background, he was acutely aware of the difficulties caused by not having proper legislation dealing with this area.  On a side note, I was sorry to learn that he would no longer be with us.  He was an excellent Senator who contributed significantly on a vast number of areas.  The Seanad is poorer for his absence.<\/p> <p>As regards the point made by Senator Ward on the renaming of the Bill, I agree with him that it was unnecessary.  There was nothing wrong with the Title as drafted.  <\/p> <p>To move on to the substantive point, which has been covered by other Senators, this legislation is long overdue.  It is sad to think that people will take the oath and lie for financial gain but, unfortunately, when it comes to the insurance industry, that is exactly what is happening.  We have to send a clear message from both Houses of the Oireachtas that such behaviour will not be tolerated.  Let us make no mistake about it: this is costing every man and woman money.  Whether through motor vehicle, business or other insurance, everyone is paying for it and we cannot allow this practice to continue.  I look forward to the House concluding the Bill today and it being enacted into law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#U00200","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I, too, compliment former Senator, P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, on the excellent initiative he brought to the House in this legislation, which puts on a statutory footing what was already an offence under common law.  This body of work is a credit to him.  It is good that the Government accepted it and that amendments were made in the D&aacute;il on Committee Stage.  Indeed, at the time this was being discussed in the Seanad, former Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh credited the advocacy of the Irish SME Association on this issue because it was clear that many businesses were being affected by false and misleading claims made under oath in the context of court proceedings.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the remarks of Senator Ward.  I agree with him 100% that it is regrettable that the time for the discussion of the Bill has been foreshortened.  By the way, the reason for that is the Government insistence on guillotining the consideration of legislation.  That has to be challenged.  It led to an unnecessary vote and, as a result, we have less time for the discussion of legislation.  I urge the Government, and Government Senators in particular, to stop guillotining the detailed consideration of legislation, particularly on Committee Stage.  It is a scandal and it is increasing disrespect among the public for the Houses of the Oireachtas and for the Seanad in particular.  It is an irresponsible thing to be doing and it is disrespectful of colleagues and of our responsibilities as legislators.<\/p> <p>The second issue on which I agree with Senator Ward is that the Bill points up the ability of the Legislature to bring forward important initiatives, that is, to legislate, and that not everything has to come by way of an initiative from the Government.  In that context, in the House earlier we witnessed an example of the resistance of the Government to taking on board important ideas with regard to the amendments that need to be made to legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, responded on a related issue I raised as a Commencement matter this morning, that is, the fact there is no legal penalty of any kind for making false or misleading statements in an application to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, for a claim of damages.  In the context of the legislation before the House, which applies to court proceedings and statements made under oath or subject to a statement of truth, as Senator Ward reminded us, it is clear why it should be a criminal offence to make a false and misleading statement in a court context, but it is not just an offence to make false and misleading statements in a court context.  I gave several examples in that regard earlier.  I mentioned statements made to the Revenue Commissioners or in the context of applications for social welfare benefits.  It is interesting that the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, actually  denied this is a lacuna in the law.  I was astounded by what he said this morning.  He said it is on purpose and he seemed to say it is because the PIAB is somehow not a quasi-judicial body, when I had given him the example of another non-quasi-judicial body-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#U00300","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>If I may interrupt the Senator, we have to stick specifically to the technical issues relating to the first group of amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#U00400","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Very good.

I consider it more appropriate that the existing relevant statutes and legal architecture across a range of health, social care and other specific roles requiring statutory registration in the State continue to provide for and deal with the matter of sanctioning the obtaining of false registration in such roles rather than doing so on a general level in this Bill, which would unnecessarily undermine the tailored approach that is already available to deal with those types of offences within those professions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021061500002#W02200","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1623744000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>The last group we completed was group 6 and the Minister of State reverted to group 4.

Similarly, the Schedule is amended so that references to perjury and subornation of perjury, which are now set out in the new Schedule 2, are to be construed in accordance with their definitions in this proposed Act.<\/p> <p>Schedule 3 to the Bill currently provides for amendments to certain older Acts which contain perjury provisions so that they may be consolidated under this proposed Act and have this new statute applied to them.  Many of the Schedule 3 amendments delete outdated penalty provisions for false statements in historical legislation so that they may be replaced by the penalties section of this Bill.  This combination of the approach taken with section 4 and Schedules 1 and 2 to the Bill provides a more consistent approach so that perjury offences under other, older enactments are subject to the relevant provisions in this Bill.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 30 is a technical amendment which deletes the provision deleting section 2 of the Perjury Act 1791 from Schedule 2.  Amendments Nos. 31, 32 and 33 are technical amendments to the text of Schedule 2, pertaining respectively to the Assurance Companies Act 1909, the Checkweighing in Various Industries Act 1919, and the Statutory Declarations Act 1938, to update the reference to this proposed Act in the amending text to provide that the text reads more clearly.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Browne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Amendment No. 34 deletes the text providing for changes to the Dentists Act 1985 in respect of updating penalties for falsely obtaining registration under that Act.
