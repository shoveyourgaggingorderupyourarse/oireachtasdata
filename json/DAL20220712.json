Higgins described the housing crisis as a disaster.  I believe that he gave voice to the hard realities faced by those desperately struggling to put an affordable roof over their heads because when people cannot afford a home, it does not just stop there; it has wide-reaching and deep consequences for our society.<\/p>  <p>  Today we read that schools in Dublin report that teachers are leaving and seeking employment in other parts of the country due to extortionate rents and soaring house prices.  Schools are finding it very difficult to recruit replacements.  One school in Stillorgan, it is reported, recently wrote to parents advising them that six of its teachers were relocating outside Dublin.  The teachers' unions are alarmed.  They say that difficulties with teacher supply are made worse by the fact that teachers cannot set up home in this city.  They say that teachers who commute to Dublin are now considering working elsewhere because of the soaring cost of fuel.  The teachers' unions are worried because schools are struggling to get teachers in important subjects like maths and science.  Many schools are forced to consider asking teachers who have Gaeilge but who do not have a degree in Irish to teach the subject.  The situation has become so bad that some schools may have to consider dropping optional subjects.  We now face, therefore, the prospect of another serious problem rooted in the housing crisis.  If left unchecked, it will have major knock-on effects.  Being unable to afford a home impacts the quality of life of teachers, which then affects the ability of schools to deliver and, in turn, impacts the education of our children.  It ripples through everything.<\/p>  <p>  We should not be surprised that this problem is emerging.  The average rent in Dublin is now more than &euro;2,000.  Average house prices range up to &euro;600,000, which is truly off the wall.  How could anyone build a life when facing those costs?  By the time a teacher pays the rent or the mortgage repayment, a huge chunk of his or her wage is gone.  Add in the spiralling cost of living, the relentless hikes in electricity and gas prices, childcare fees and the sharp increases in the price of food and life in the city has become literally unaffordable.  We can see that teachers are left in an impossible situation, and why they are now voting with their feet.

The Government has produced the most comprehensive housing policy, entitled Housing for All.  I have not seen any alternative policy formulation either from the Deputies opposite or their party that has the same depth, breadth or detail to deal with a very serious issue concerning housing.  Housing supply will be key regarding it.  We simply need to build more houses and apartments across the board.  The target is to get to 33,000 to 35,000 units per annum.  This year the expectation is that we will be on target for approximately 24,600 new houses.<\/p><p>On commencements, 22,000 new units were completed in the year to March 2022.  That is the highest number of home completions in any 12-month period since the series began in 2011.  A total of 5,669 new homes were added to the national housing stock in quarter 1 this year, so progress is being made.  A total of 43,000 planning permissions were granted in 2021, which is a sixfold increase on the number of units granted permission in 2014 and represents the highest number of planning permissions since 2007.  More than 30,000 new homes were commenced in the year to May 2022.  That is the highest number since records started.<\/p><p>In the EU, Ireland has gone from having the third lowest level of completions <i>per capita<\/i>, in 2013, to having the fifth highest, in 2020.  Progress is being made, but it is not enough to deal with the huge demand that exists.  We are looking at every possible avenue to increase housing supply and build up the capacity of the industry to build more, particularly through apprenticeships, for example.  The number of construction apprenticeship registrations in 2021 increased by more than 40% compared with the number in 2019.  We are working at every level, therefore, to ensure that the industry has greater capacity and that we build more houses.  <\/p><p>On the rent side, we have brought in a series of Bills to protect renters, particularly in rent pressure zones, which will become more important now given the inflation rate of 9% odd.  Rent increases have to be limited to 2% in these zones.<\/p><p>On the affordable housing front, the Cro&iacute; Conaithe cities initiative has been launched.  A further initiative will be launched this week in respect of Cro&iacute; Conaithe towns, which will entail substantial support for prospective homeowners to renovate a house and live in it.  Significant support will be given by the State in that regard.  The Land Development Agency, established by legislation by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, is working on a range of initiatives to produce more housing.  He also launched the first home shared equity scheme.  That will be a significant scheme that will help teachers, garda&iacute; and those in a range of other occupations to access homes in an affordable manner.  The number of applications has been significant since the scheme was launched.  I know Deputy McDonald opposed it but it has been proving very attractive so far to people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200004#B00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1657631100,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I set out for the Taoiseach a story that I think is very worrying.

The purpose of the study was to discover the experiences of women who have sought to access abortion under our abortion legislation.  The words expressed by women include \"awful\", \"draining\", \"arduous\", \"harrowing\" and \"distressing\".  This really shows just how inadequate our current legislative structure is to meet the real needs of women in crisis pregnancy and unplanned pregnancy.  These are the women we voted to support in 2018 in the repeal referendum when the people voted with a 66.4% majority to ensure women would have access to abortion services in Ireland.  Yet what we see from the study published today is that the paternalistic shadow cast by the eighth amendment is still over our system of abortion care provision.<\/p>  <p>  The National Women's Council points out that it is clear from the experiences of the women expressed through the study that significant systemic improvements are required.  Women share the anguish and distress of being deemed ineligible for care on the grounds of fatal foetal anomalies, the disempowering impact of the three-day wait and the shock many women have had at the lack of GPs providing care in rural communities.  We know that 13 counties in Ireland have fewer than ten GPs willing to provide abortion services.  Many counties have no provision at all for women.  Therefore they must travel outside the county to avail of services, twice in many cases because of the three-day wait period prescribed in the legislation which is not based on any medical necessity.  We know that the three-day wait period in particular causes real hardship for those women who struggle to get off work, those on low incomes and those at the end of the first trimester.<\/p>  <p>  We know that last year more than 200 women had to travel to Britain to obtain abortions because the law here does not meet their needs.  The old Irish solution to an Irish problem phenomenon has not gone away.  Every woman who takes that lonely journey represents a failure by the Government and the State to deliver on the mandate the people gave us in 2018.  Will the Taoiseach confirm when the review of the abortion legislation will be published?  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and the Government will ensure the review will address the inadequacies in the legislation, as illustrated by the evidence gathered by the team at Trinity College and the experiences so graphically expressed in the report by women describing how they had fared in seeking to access abortion care here?<\/p> <p>We heard about awful scenarios relating to women who were awaiting diagnosis as to whether an anomaly was \"fatal enough\" to enable a termination after 12 weeks.  Some of the definitions in the legislation are deeply problematic not only for women and their families, but also for doctors and medics who face criminalisation under this legislation if they do not get it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200005#C01900","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657632000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising what is a very important issue.  The background is very clear, as she will be aware.  In May 2018, the Irish people voted, overwhelmingly, to repeal the eighth amendment.  The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 was introduced in December of that year, in line with the amendment and the debate.  It is important to make that point.  An all-party Oireachtas committee worked through the complexities of the legislation.  There is a requirement under that Act to ensure a wide-ranging review to examine the effectiveness of the operation of the legislation.  That is under way.  Ms Marie O'Shea, BL, has been appointed as the independent chair of the review.  The Unplanned Pregnancy Support and Abortion Care Study, which was conducted by Trinity College Dublin, is part of the review provided for in the legislation.  That part of the review is being carried out by Dr. Catherine Conlon and is seeking to generate an in-depth understanding of the experiences of women who have accessed abortion care services since the commencement of the Act.  It will be part and parcel of, and fed into, the review.  It is expected to have the entire review completed by the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of terminations of pregnancy, up to nine weeks, take place in the community setting.  There are approximately 413 termination-of-pregnancy providers in the community.  This includes 403 GP contractors and ten women's health contractors.  The HSE is saying it is satisfied that there is a good geographic spread.  We need to wait for the review to be fully satisfied with that analysis, but that is what the HSE is saying.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of maternity services, I am not satisfied.  Eleven of the 19 maternity hospitals provide termination of pregnancy services.  A number of other maternity hospitals are expected to introduce these services before the end of 2022.  The Minister has provided additional funding for women's health and the national maternity strategy, to be fair.  That is resulting in a significant increase in consultant posts in our maternity services, which is helping to overcome the barrier of conscientious objection in some locations.  All 19 maternity hospitals offer a range of services with regard to termination of pregnancies, including supporting women with any post-termination complications, provision of ultrasound scanning, where required, and the management of fatal foetal anomaly cases.  It is important that reviews of this kind happen.  It is a significant and disturbing analysis.  It will be fed into the overall review and then that will be brought to the House for decisions to be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200006#D00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1657632000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for confirming the date.

I acknowledge that the legislation that we passed was, indeed, done on a cross-party basis and many of us banded together to facilitate the passing of that very important change in the law.  However, as the Taoiseach acknowledged, there are still certain inadequacies, which could be addressed even pending the publication of the review.  Geographic coverage and availability of services throughout the State, both through GPs and, indeed, hospitals, should be improved upon, even without awaiting the outcome of the review.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the announcement the Taoiseach has made today on safe access zones, but it is somewhat overdue, given that we had sought those back in 2018.  They were promised in late 2018 by the then Minister and we have been awaiting them since because women are still being intimidated in seeking to access services.  While inadequacies remain and women cannot access services, locally, in their own area, we know that the legislation is still inadequate to meet the real needs of women.

This week, the Government has an opportunity to prove it is interested in positive proposals.  The reason I have no confidence in this Government is that as we head into the summer recess it has done nothing to take on board positive proposals to deal with the utterly dire housing and homelessness crisis and the rental crisis blighting hundreds of thousands of working families and ordinary householders.<\/p><p>Tomorrow, People Before Profit have a Bill to reduce rents to affordable levels and link rents to people's income and their ability to pay, in other words, to have real rent controls, which the Government has failed to introduce successfully.  Will the Government support our rent reduction Bill to bring rents down to 25% of median income?  Why do we need such a measure?  We have 320,000 renters and average rents nationally are currently &euro;1,400 per month, which is totally unaffordable for huge numbers of working families.  In Dublin they are &euro;2,000 per month on average.  That is &euro;24,000 per year for an ordinary family.  That is absolutely unaffordable.  In my area, the average rent in the past six months was &euro;2,600.  The consequence of the Government's failure to control these rents is that we now have record numbers of families in homelessness, including children, as we head into the summer recess, and it is getting worse every week.<\/p><p>As if all that is not bad enough, in a report by Killian Woods in the <i>Business Post <\/i>at the weekend we discovered who is benefiting from this misery and these extortionate, unaffordable rents.  Of the 91 applications put in for strategic housing development build-to-rent apartment blocks, 21 were lodged by investment entities based in tax havens, including the Isle of Man, Guernsey and the Virgin Islands, where the identities of the investors and shareholders are not even disclosed to the local authorities.  These are tax dodgers - corporate tax dodgers - benefiting off the misery of people who are paying these extortionate rents.  If the Taoiseach is serious about wanting positive proposals, I have a simple question for him.  Will the Government support our Bill tomorrow to set rents at affordable levels?

I admit to spending a little bit too much time in the Visitors Gallery looking down at proceedings.  Little did I know how events would transpire and I would actually end up here today.<\/p>  <p>  It is on that basis that I want to welcome the additional funding that has been announced this morning for our military.  It is very important because it is desperately needed.  I welcome the increased funding for infrastructure and capability development but, particularly, I want to welcome the increased funding for military pay for the people who are on the lowest pay grade in our Defence Forces.  Those are the people who have less than three years&rsquo; service. <\/p>  <p>  We all appreciate that our defence community has no access to the Workplace Relations Commission.  It is denied access to the Labour Court and to any type of industrial action whatsoever.  It is uniquely vulnerable from that perspective.  Therefore, it is the Government&rsquo;s job to intervene regularly to ensure a level playing field from a military perspective.  To be fair to the Opposition as well, it is also the Opposition&rsquo;s role.  I want to put on record my gratitude to all Members of the House from all sides, both Government and Opposition benches, who have campaigned so passionately over this issue for the past number of years.  <\/p>  <p>  It is good to see at least a moderate increase and improvement announced this morning.  Is the plan perfect?  Of course not.  However, is it progress?  Yes, for sure.  It builds on progress that has already occurred this year, particularly allowing reservists to travel overseas and for PDFORRA and Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, to associate with Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  <\/p>  <p>  How will we know if the plan is working?  There is only one metric that matters and that is headcount.  The strength of our military is the lowest it has been for 50 years right now at fewer than 8,300 people.  It has not been this low in half a century and we need to get that number up.  There has been a net loss of 203 people already in the first five months of this year.  That is ten people a week.  That is not turnover; that is attrition.  No organisation can put up with that level of attrition.  <\/p>  <p>  The focus now needs to shift on three other allowances.  First, the specialised instructors allowance was taken away as result of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts that have yet to be returned.  Also, the military service allowance needs to be done, but also the patrol duty allowance.  Because it is in his constituency, the Taoiseach would be aware that there is a major problem with the Naval Service at the moment.  We get many calls from Cork, which I am very happy to take of course.  Strictly speaking, they may not be my constituents, but they certainly are my people.  <\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach accept that there are unique industrial relations circumstances in our armed forces as part of our military community?  As a result, it requires regular, direct intervention by the Cabinet to ensure there is a level playing field for our troops and their very important families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200009#G00700","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1657633200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  It is fair to say that since he was elected, he has been a very strong advocate for the Defence Forces.  He has been advocating on its behalf to many Members in this House, including Members of Government.  His advocacy has been consistent and genuine, obviously, given his own experience.  I did not realise the vicarious influence, if I may say, of just being here looking after us many years ago had and the clear impact in ending up as a Member of the House through spending that time in the Gallery.  The Deputy must have been attracted to what was going on to make him want to become a participant.<\/p>  <p>  Today at the Cabinet meeting, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, brought forward a memorandum.  We met with the commission on a number of occasions.  I have met with the commission and the commission chair.  It is a high level action plan.  It will entail multi-annual funding increases, commencing in 2023, to reach a defence budget of &euro;1.5 billion by 2028.  It will involve - the Deputy was correct when he said this is key metric - increasing the number of personnel, which will be an enormous challenge, by nearly 2,000 over the current establishment figure of 9,500.<\/p> <p> The other key aspect of this is that there is an urgent need for human resources change and a cultural transformation of our Defence Forces.  When I spoke to the chairperson, he was adamant about that.  There are many practices that need dramatic transformation.  It will take time.  That is as important a part of the commission's recommendations as the ambition to go to a higher level of provision and defence capability.  The report says we should go to level 2, as outlined in the report.  I do not think we have any choice but to do that in terms of the level of ambition.  It is a realistic level of ambition that we can get to.  When we get to that level of ambition, we can review.  We need radar systems and we need to have a greater understanding of the risks and so on, given our maritime size, and also in terms of how that relates to our naval strength and what is going on in the air around Ireland and so on.  These are all issues on which we need to be stronger in terms of capability, intelligence and understanding.<\/p> <p> In terms of the pay structures, there is a recommendation to provide immediate access to the seagoing service commitment scheme to direct-entry personnel in the Naval Service.  We will follow through on the removal of the requirement for a private, three-star, or able seaman to mark time for the first three years at that rank.  The payment of the full rate of military service allowance applicable to the rank of all private, three star, or able seamen personnel, replacement of the existing seagoing allowances with less complex seagoing duty measures and introduction of long-service increments to the pay scales of all ranks are all recommendations that have been made on the personnel front.  It is something we are going to pursue.  The Government will be keeping a hands-on approach through the Department and I, as Taoiseach, will be following through in terms of implementation with the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200009#G00800","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657633800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his response.

Deputy McDonald raised the issue of the Ivy Exchange residents and the general issue of poor building and defective blocks.  Those builders have responsibilities.  Councils have responsibilities.  Authorities also have responsibilities and insurance should have a role in all of this.  In a unique response the Government has decided in respect of mica, because of the humanitarian crisis with people having their houses effectively destroyed in many cases and compromised and undermined in others, to provide well over &euro;2 million to deal with the issue.  There are clearly knock-on effects.  There was an earlier scheme for pyrite.  There is a report coming to the Minister in respect of the defective building of apartments.  It is a huge challenge for the Exchequer overall.  It is an issue on which I will come back to the Deputy.  I will speak to the Minister with responsibility for housing to get the most up-to-date position.<\/p><p>To respond to Deputy Bacik, there are several issues with regard to the cost of living.  We should not lose sight of the economic recovery that has occurred.  I am concerned about what may happen in 2023 with Russian gas and the energy crisis.  There has been an incredible bounceback in the economy since Covid-19.  There are 2.5 million people now working in the economy.  We now have the highest participation rate ever in our economy.  It is substantially higher than it was last year or pre-pandemic.  All of this is positive.  In respect of cost-of-living measures, approximately &euro;2.5 billion has been allocated to date.  We took measures last week that will increase the back-to-school allowance, deal with transport costs and provide school meals for those in DEIS schools.  There will be some once-off measures, as the Deputy identified.  I do not have the specific sum total yet of how much will be involved but it will be comprehensive.  We are looking at the issue of a windfall tax.  We will keep it under review.  There are pluses and minuses.  The ESB is a State company and we take a dividend from it.<\/p><p>We will look at welfare increases and pensions.  We will look at families and children, targeting children in particular because families have higher costs.  This is why we have already taken measures to reduce healthcare costs for families with children.  The back-to-school allowance will help low-income families with children.  Transport measures will help families.  We will keep this theme going in the once-off cost-of-living package and budgetary measures.  Childcare is an issue that has been identified by many in the House.  It is something we would like to do more on compared with what we did last year.<\/p><p>Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of Uber.  I read the articles and I commend <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and all of the media concerned on the articles and revelations.  They are important for public discourse.  What is also important to keep in mind when we read it is that lobbying is a fact of life.  It happens in all shapes.  It does not have to be done by corporations.  It can be done by NGOs or individuals.  It can relate to anything in life from sport to economics.  Very often companies feel the need to employ people to gain access to the political system.<\/p> <p>Many of us have had clinics for years and people walked in the door to see us.  The system is robust on this one, which is kind of important.  People can lobby.  It does not mean they get their way or that policy changes.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, did not move.  The Government of the day did not take a decision to grant access to Uber.  That is an important point.  There should always be full transparency.  If people are lobbying, they should register the fact that they are lobbying.  That is an important point with regard to the issue.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is bringing in new legislation to update our lobbying laws and register in terms of garden leave and so on.  There should be a reasonable distance between people being in very senior positions and going into a lobbying role, immediately after their role in such senior positions.  There are competing rights and so on in terms of the individual and the right to earn a livelihood.  It is not simple but transparency is a very important way of dealing with it.  The system proved itself robust if not in resisting, then at least in not acceding to the requests made by those who were doing the lobbying.  That should be acknowledged as well.

In that context, I requested that an investigation be carried out.  This investigation is being done in the context of a broader consideration of the arrangements in place for the management of documents for Government meetings as this bears directly on the protection of their confidentiality.  The investigation is being undertaken by a senior official in my Department and the process is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  The House will be aware that in January 2021, I apologised on behalf of the Government to those who spent time in a mother and baby home or county home.  The Government published a comprehensive action plan for survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions in November 2021 and we are very clearly focused on advancing the action plan.  The 22 actions set out in the plan have been arranged into central themes, which have emerged as fundamental in how the Government responds.  Those themes are a survivor-centred approach; a formal State apology; access to personal information; enduring archive and database development; education and research; memorialisation; restorative recognition and dignified burial.  Detailed and sustained engagement with survivors and their families has been central to the development of each of these actions and very significant progress has been made in giving effect to them.<\/p>  <p>  The Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022 was signed into law on 30 June.  This provides for a full and clear right of access to birth certificates, birth and early-life information for all persons who were adopted, boarded out, the subject of an illegal birth registration or who otherwise have questions with regard to their origins.  On 1 July, the provisions of the Act to establish the contact preference register and give effect to statutory public information campaign were commenced, which paves the way for the release of birth and early-life information from October 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Institutional Burials Bill 2022, which provided a legal basis for recovery and identification of those who died in residential institutions and were buried in a manifestly inappropriate manner, has passed both Houses and is with the President for his signature.  Subject to that, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, plans to commence it immediately and seek the Government's approval to make an order for an intervention at the site of the former mother and baby home in Tuam.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the supports available to survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions, the HSE national counselling service is available for individuals who feel they need this support.  Those who identify themselves as former residents of the institutions will be prioritised for the service.  The HSE also operates a dedicated freephone information line for former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions.  The Department of Health, in partnership with the HSE, is currently working on establishing a patient advocacy liaison service for all survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions.  A business case for this initiative has been developed by the HSE and has been approved by the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  The general scheme of a mother and baby institutions payment scheme Bill was published on 29 March.  It is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny and, in parallel, is the subject of priority drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  This legislation will  provide financial payments and an enhanced medical card to defined groups, in acknowledgement of suffering they experienced.  An implementation group has been established to oversee preparations for the scheme and project planning work is under way.<\/p>  <p>  On 29 March, the Government approved proposals for a national centre for research and remembrance.  The centre will stand as a site of conscience and will be a national memorial to honour, equally, all those who were resident in mother and baby homes, industrial schools, reformatories, Magdalen laundries and related institutions.  The centre will be located on the site of the former Magdalen laundry on Se&aacute;n McDermott Street in Dublin city centre and will comprise a museum and exhibition space, a research centre and repository of records and a place for reflection and remembrance.

We have subsequently raised the outcome of this investigation on a number of occasions but to no avail.  The Taoiseach has, in fact, accepted our concerns with regard to the Government's protection of such sensitive documentation and information.  In January, we were told that new mechanisms had been requested to ensure the protection of material that comes before the Government.  What are these protections in practical terms?

Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the legislation for the payments scheme will be passed in the autumn?<\/p>  <p>  I raise the separate matter of the case of thalidomide survivors in light of a number of reports over the weekend.  Just last week, the Scottish Government guaranteed lifelong support for thalidomide survivors there.  In 2013, it committed over &pound;14 million to help survivors with health and living costs but it is now extending assistance to survivors on a needs basis.  Finola Cassidy, who is the spokesperson for thalidomide survivors here, has asked for the Government to put in place similar measures.  I have raised this before in the House and ask whether a similar approach to that adopted in Scotland would be adopted here in respect of this small group of survivors who really need this support from the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200019#T00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1657638900,"counter":241,"content":"<p>The report is still working on the mechanism in terms of Cabinet confidentiality and more general Cabinet documents and also the degree to which, in the modern era, many documents or many proposals are aired well in advance.  There is, therefore, a fairly complex piece of work required to come up to pace with where we are today in terms of what happens with the briefing of a whole variety of proposals and policies.  Given the more open approach to policy development in the current era, it is timely to update that entire area.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald raised the individual case of Margaret Donovan.  Ms Donovan should not have to navigate this on her own.  I referenced earlier the survivor advocacy liaison services in the HSE.  Assistance should be given to people in Ms Donovan's situation to navigate to get the truth.  I have met the residents of Bessborough who have views on that site.  They have a view as to where the site is located and that housing development should not take place on that site.  I agree with the survivors in that respect.  They are not objecting to other developments in the vicinity of the site, it has to be said.  I hope Cork City Council will work with the survivors who have taken a very reasonable approach to the matter.  The future development of that site is important.  I would have preferred it if the council had purchased the entire site because some of the services there are State services and amenities, and also maybe some social housing, could have been provided there as well.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's point, I do not know but I will come back to him on the separate investigation.  The scheme of the mother and baby institutions payment scheme Bill was published on 29 March.  It is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny but is, in parallel, being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, so that when the pre-legislative scrutiny is over we may be in a position to get the legislation published faster.  I would like to see it published in the autumn and enacted in the autumn session.  That will need co-operation across the House because we need to start the process of payment in respect of this.  It is an important issue.  An implementation group has been established to oversee preparations for the scheme.  Project planning work is under way on the scheme itself.  It will provide financial payments and an enhanced medical card but, again, much will depend on its progress through pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p>  <p>  To be fair to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, if we go through all the areas, we can see he has made very significant progress in respect of the entire action plan.  The Birth Information and Tracing Act is the most complex legislation of its kind and has been groundbreaking in terms of what it will provide.  It is far superior to earlier iterations in previous D&aacute;ileanna.  Also, the Institutional Burials Bill is very important legislation and the Minister stands ready to intervene immediately in relation to that.  The HSE national counselling service is also available.  The payments scheme is key and a very important part of the action plan is the memorialisation centre.  We were hoping we would have that at Cabinet today but I am anticipating we will have it at Cabinet in the next number of weeks so we can give effect to it.  That would be a very significant issue in itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200019#T00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1657638900,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I asked three questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200019#T00400","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1657638900,"counter":243,"content":"<p>In relation to the thalidomide issue, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has met the thalidomide organisation, as have I in the context of the parliamentary party.

Economic Forum in Davos on 25 May.  During my visit, I participated in a panel discussion, attended a lunch hosted by <i>The Washington Post<\/i>, had a number of political and economic meetings, and attended a dinner hosted by IDA Ireland.  The panel discussion I participated in was on the theme of European unity in a disordered world, and was chaired by B&oslash;rge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum.  Fellow panellists included the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, Eduard Heger, and President of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde.  Russia's war on Ukraine was a major theme in our discussions, with a focus on the response by the European Union.  Speakers observed that despite Putin's attempts to divide, the EU had shown great unity and strength.  I raised the question of food security, which Russia is deliberately undermining, and stressed the impact this was likely to have on already vulnerable countries.  The panel also considered the question of enlargement of the Union, including Ukraine's wish to join, and the implications that would have for the effective functioning of the Union.  I expressed my view that much reform was possible within the framework of the existing treaties, but that I was open to considering treaty change if it proved necessary for what we are aiming to achieve together.  I also took the opportunity to set out Ireland's distinct experience through our 50 years as a member state.<\/p><p>I attended a lunchtime event hosted by <i>The Washington Post<\/i>where I had the opportunity to meet and engage with a wide range of other leaders, including the Prime Minister of Moldova and my colleagues at the European Council, the Prime Ministers of Greece and Croatia and the Chancellor of Austria, as well as a number of other European, Middle East, African and Latin American leaders.<\/p><p>I had a bilateral meeting with the Foreign Minister of Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba, who briefed me on the conduct of the war, in particular the devastation being visited on the eastern part of the country.  I conveyed Ireland's support for Ukraine's application for EU membership and undertook to advocate for the granting of candidate status with my EU colleagues.  I also met briefly with the Mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko.<\/p><p>At his request, I had a bilateral meeting with the President of Israel, Isaac Herzog.  At our meeting, we recalled the president's family connections to Ireland and we agreed our shared interest in deepening bilateral relations.  I underlined that the occupation remains a priority for me, the Government and the people of Ireland.  Recent events have demonstrated the urgent need to maintain a political horizon for peace.  I expressed my deep concern at continued expansion of settlements in the occupied territories, including recent announcements, as well as evictions and demolitions.  I also expressed my concern that these actions and policies would only escalate further an already tense situation.<\/p> <p>I raised the shocking death of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh and the appalling scenes in Jerusalem during her funeral procession.<\/p> <p> I had meetings with senior executives of a number of multinational firms with operations in Ireland and addressed a dinner hosted by IDA Ireland that was attended by representatives of 30 multinational companies with significant operations or interests in Ireland.  These meetings are typically an opportunity for company executives to update me on progress with their operations in Ireland and their future development plans.  For my part, it was an opportunity to emphasise again Ireland's foreign direct investment proposition and our core competitive strengths, namely, talent, stability and a proven track record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200019#T02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657639500,"counter":261,"content":"<p>As was recognised at the World Economic Forum, the world is facing an unprecedented energy crisis.

Collectively, we face a massive challenge to counter climate change, forge a new path in energy production and secure a cleaner future for our island.  The cornerstones of our strategy can and must be energy independence, security and affordability.  The State has to be the driver of the strategy, but that is not where we are today.  Earlier this year, the wind energy sector told the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, that it has absolutely no confidence in key State agencies' ability to deliver major infrastructural projects.  Planning decisions are taking anything up to 12 or 24 months and not the 18 weeks provided for in law.  Restoring confidence in the board will not only require significant investment in skilled personnel and restructuring.

The French Government can do that.  It has also introduced a new regime of rent controls.  It recently nationalised one of the major energy-producing companies to keep prices down.  Those are all things the Taoiseach refuses to do as the cost-of-living crisis absolutely crushes people and will do even more extremely as we head into the winter months.

Another example of that is the agreement between the European Commission and the US to import liquefied natural gas, that is, fracked gas, for the coming decades, thereby doubling down on fossil fuels.  The consequence is more private investment into unsustainable fossil fuel infrastructure, potentially locking us in for decades.<\/p>  <p>  The science is crystal clear.

In these three countries, more than 23 million people are experiencing extreme hunger.  They have now had their fourth successive dry rainy season.

I do not think Deputy McDonald raised any issue around the Davos meeting but instead raised an issue about An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the energy issues.  Energy is a big issue at European Union level at the moment, as it is globally, across the board.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has initiated an inquiry into An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  He has commissioned a senior counsel to look at those issues.  The planning regulator is also doing a review of its processes.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la itself has done an internal review.  It is the Government's intention to hold An Bord Plean&aacute;la to account in respect of these issues, to get clarity and transparency without prejudice, and to act subsequently by introducing any legislative improvements that might be required and considering its approach to ensure An Bord Plean&aacute;la is fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of offshore wind energy, the maritime legislation that the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, piloted through the House last year was a major breakthrough.  We now must establish the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, administratively, get it up and running as fast as we can, and get the necessary consents in place, because the key issue for the future of this country will be that we accelerate offshore wind energy and floating technology in particular.  The European Union has made it clear that it wishes to create a new regulatory framework that would facilitate faster permitting of offshore wind developments.<\/p> <p>It will create an overriding public interest clause, namely, climate change, as the basis to override other planning objections to offshore wind platforms and floating technology so that we can shorten the timeline between the conception of a wind energy project and completion.  At the moment it is about eight years, but we do not have eight years to wait.  We have to move faster.<\/p> <p> I can anticipate what will happen, of course.  That regulation will come and everyone will then come around it, scrum and say, &ldquo;Actually, you should not be doing that.  Can we go back to life as normal?&rdquo;  We have to have that debate, anyway.<\/p> <p> Deputy Bacik described Davos as the most exclusive lobbying club around and asked what companies were lobbying me.  I am fairly embarrassed to say we were doing the lobbying in terms of some of the companies.  I attended a dinner, hosted by IDA Ireland, with 30 companies that are in Ireland and have interests in Ireland.  We took the opportunity to suggest they could invest more in Ireland.  We use those occasions to identify what they feel the needs are within Ireland and how best Ireland can progress.  These are companies in life sciences, technology and other areas.  It is a very useful occasion for Ireland to advance its cause to advocate for workers and jobs in our economy and society.  Equally, then, there is a very strong political element to it as well.<\/p> <p> Around the war in Ukraine, I met the Mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, and the foreign minister.  Again, one was struck by the enormous dedication of these officials and political representatives of Ukraine.  They looked exhausted at that particular meeting that day, given the round of meetings they had to engage in on behalf their people.  People can have a go at Davos, but when you see a country such as Ukraine that is under enormous pressure, Davos was extremely useful for them to be able to advocate for their people in terms of a whole range of issues.  Their diplomacy was very impressive.  It led actually as well to the European Union granting Ukraine candidate status for European Union membership.<\/p> <p> I say to Deputy Boyd Barrett that we can learn from France.  I know Deputy Murphy was anxious that Deputy Boyd Barrett might learn on the nuclear front as well because he suggested it.  Nuclear energy is one the ways France is keeping its energy prices down.

More importantly, it is also a good time to start having an honest debate between two very different views about how we can serve the people and address their concerns.  Fundamentally, this is a debate between those who believe in tackling problems and those who believe in exploiting them.  It is between those who have an honest and ambitious programme based on what can be achieved and those who have taken cynical and populist politics to a new level in our country.  It is a debate between those who understand and respect diversity in politics and those who have introduced legal threats and online abuse as weapons to silence other Members of the Oireachtas and the media.<\/p><p>Today we are being told the Government has supposedly failed because it has not implemented its full programme in just two years.  In contrast, last week Deputy McDonald insisted that Sinn F&eacute;in should only be judged after ten years and two full terms of office.  As always, double standards are the watchword of this cynical Opposition.  Ireland is a modern, diverse and dynamic country.  It has problems and challenges to overcome of course, but those who deny its successes are simply showing they have no interest in honest debate.  They are proving that the progress of our country and the future of our people is not actually their core concern.  Shouting &quot;Not enough&quot;, &quot;More&quot; and &quot;What about&quot; represents an approach to politics that is, at its heart, deeply dishonest.<\/p><p>In my first speech after being nominated by this House for appointment as Taoiseach, I explained both how I intended to approach the task of holding this office and the priorities of the then new Government.  The two most urgent crises we faced were an historic pandemic and the fastest moving recession ever recorded.  It was a time of deep uncertainty and much fear.  I promised then that I, as Taoiseach, and we, as a Government, would do everything possible to mitigate the terrible toll of the pandemic and to work to achieve as fast a recovery as possible.<\/p><p>By any fair judgement of our performance on these measures this Government has served the people well on these critical challenges.  The truth is Ireland has been assessed as one of the top three in the world for the resilience of its Covid response.  We have the second highest vaccination rate in Europe.  Most importantly, the fact is this Government&rsquo;s actions in responding to the greatest public health crisis of our times protected public health and saved lives.  Of course, we did not get everything right, but we got more right than the great majority of governments.  If Ireland had performed simply at the average level of the European Union, there would have been over 4,500 more deaths.  If we had performed at the same level as the United Kingdom, there would have been 5,500 more deaths.  How often did we have to read and listen to attacks on our vaccine roll-out as being supposedly a shambles?  It was the largest public health mobilisation in Irish history and, frankly, the glitches it had were minor.<\/p><p>In attacking the Government, the Opposition likes to ignore or dismiss actions that dramatically reduced the impact of Covid here versus other countries, reinforcing the equally strong fact of its cynicism.  So too, it will ignore the fact that sustained Government action has helped our country emerge from recession faster and more successfully than most countries.  Within weeks of taking office, we published new policies to limit job losses, help companies and help families.  Initiatives were designed, agreed and implemented at a record speed and with very clear success.<\/p><p>The hard yards of working to ensure high levels of employment and a strong economy is something which appears to bore the Opposition.  These issues have basically disappeared from its daily agenda, and every time a journalist has the temerity to report good news, they get accused of being a hack.  However, Ireland today has the lowest youth unemployment in Europe.  The economy is strong and it is not just supporting employment; it is providing the resources to deliver essential social investments.<\/p> <p>This Government understands the fact that a strong economy is needed to support social services and investment.  We are proud of the fact that we have led Ireland so quickly out of recession and that this enables us to help people when world affairs are having such a direct impact.  That gives us capacity.  The economic recovery enables us to be in a position to help people going through the cost-of-living situation arising from the war in Ukraine.<\/p> <p> Two years ago, I told the D&aacute;il that the three parties that had agreed to form a Government understood that we had to work constructively together.  The members of Fianna F&aacute;il participated in the largest party vote ever recorded in Ireland and expressed clearly their desire to take on a daunting agenda.  As a Government, we have disagreements but we work hard to overcome them and to honour the ambitious and achievable programme.  We each have our priorities and remain separate parties.  This is how successful coalition governments across Europe work.  I thank members of each of the parties for their work and their constructive approach.  While the Opposition acts as if the pandemic had no impact on the Government, it was in fact profound in placing great pressure on individuals.<\/p> <p> Due to the limited time available, I cannot cover all of the areas of the Government's work but I want to address broadly what we have been working to achieve in the past two years and what we aim to achieve in the next two.  I have been determined that we address the great unmet challenge of the Good Friday Agreement to build stronger links and understanding on this island.  I immediately launched the first sustained effort to develop these links through the shared island initiative.  This is supporting a wide agenda of investments, dialogues and essential studies.  For the first time, we are preparing vital, rigorous and independent work on key services and policies on both sides of the Border.  I thank the National Economic and Social Council and the Economic and Social Research Institute for the extensive systematic research they have undertaken in terms of the services economy on the island, education outcomes on the island and the climate opportunities on the island.  That is very important work in underpinning, in an evidence-based way, our approach to the all-island economy and developing strong linkages, as manifested in the extraordinary research programmes that we have already funded and that are now under way between third level institutions in the Republic and in Northern Ireland.  It is a striking fact that the party that is today telling us how our country is a basket case where everything has been wrong for 100 years is, at the same time, claiming that country is so successful that it should be irresistible to the North.  As a Government, we continue to work to force all who have responsibility for the agreement to make it work and we have been resolute in demanding that both the text and the spirit of the agreement be honoured, and also that the outcome of the recent elections be fulfilled and realised.<\/p> <p> The strength of our relations with other European countries and with the Commission has been a vital support for Ireland in opposing the legal and political vandalism directed against the Northern Ireland protocol and the progress it protects.  In contrast to the Opposition's consistent anti-European Union stands, we see the European Union as a forum for enabling countries to prosper, protecting democracy from the extremes and solidarity such as the recovery funding which we negotiated.  We took a clear leadership position in terms of advocating for that breakthrough fund to enable European recovery from Covid-19.  There is a significant difference in terms of the Government's approach to the European Union and the approach of most of the Opposition to the European Union.  I identified Deputy Paul Murphy earlier in this regard but Sinn F&eacute;in has a similar attitude of never-ending criticism and anti-European Union positions.<\/p> <p> My party went into this Government eager to embrace the hardest challenges.  We understood that they were never going to be areas which could be solved quickly but we were determined to deliver sustained action that would show real results over the full course of the mandate of the D&aacute;il and the Government.  Part of that, and part of the approach Fianna F&aacute;il brings into Government, is a strong pro-European approach.  We led Ireland into the European Union.  We are proud of our record of support for democracy, particularly now in the context of the cause of Ukraine, something that we promoted actively with our government colleagues in Europe and at the United Nations Security Council.<\/p> <p> The challenge of ensuring housing for a rapidly rising population is one of the most important facing Irish politics.  Of all areas, this is one of those that is least open to overnight change.  However, it can be done a lot faster than the target of 15 years set out in a proposed housing strategy for Northern Ireland published by Deputy McDonald&rsquo;s hand-picked housing Minister in Belfast.  There is now in place an ambitious, funded and comprehensive plan for expanding housing provision for the benefit of all sectors.  Housing for All is still in its early stages but the facts show that planning applications are up, housing construction is up and housing completion is up, and this is in spite of the thousands of homes that one party has sought to block - more interested in talking about a crisis then allowing it to be addressed.  Most important, however, this Government has in two years put in place the largest social housing programme in our history.<\/p> <p> Home ownership matters as well.  The new affordable housing scheme launched last week is an example of a plan directed at those most in need.  In its first 24 hours, nearly 400 pre-applications were received and thousands more looked for information.  The sustainable way of controlling prices and rents is to increase supply.  The latest 12-monthly figures recorded 35,000 commencements, the highest figure since records began.  Only the most cynical could claim that is a failure.  There is no doubt that when our mandate finishes, we will have delivered a sustained and significant increase in housing of all types, especially social housing.<\/p> <p> We will also deliver a sustained improvement in key health services and, in particular, those where the pressures are being felt the most.  The pandemic was a dramatic challenge for health services and everyone who works within them.  It led to many thousands of treatments being cancelled and lengthened nearly all waiting lists and waiting times.  However, in spite of the pandemic and the recession, the past two years have seen vital improvements.  Lessons will be learned from our experiences during the pandemic and we will embed some of those lessons in terms of the reform programme in respect of health.  I pay tribute to all in our health services for the work they did throughout the pandemic and continue to do.  The pandemic has not gone away and the aftershocks are still to be seen in our health service and other sectors of our economy in terms of isolation protocols, waiting times and so forth.  That said, there are already an extra 850 permanent new hospital beds.  New diagnostic facilities are being put in place.  A major increase in staff and investment in the ambulance service is under way.  Mental health services are expanding and a range of initiatives are under way to support wider mental health challenges.  I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on her extraordinarily diligent and dedicated work in that area.  New services are being rolled out.  A comprehensive women&rsquo;s health programme led by the Minister for Health and including the first national programmes on endometritis and menopause has been developed and funded and is now under way.  Access and fairness are being extended with an extension of medical cards, the abolition of hospital charges for under-16s and other measures.  Yes, there are many more issues to tackle.  There are many who do not have access to the services they need when they need them, but one helps these people by delivering credible, sustained and secure services, not by the cynical politics of refusing to acknowledge any progress.  This year, 469,000 people currently on waiting lists will benefit from this progress and many more will benefit during the rest of our term.<\/p> <p> Education has been and remains a core priority for us.  A new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is in place.  That has been overseen by the Minister, Deputy Harris.  That is a significant policy development that is already having an impact in terms of education policy.  For our schools, I am proud that in the past two years we have begun an ambitious programme to increase resources, reform provision and develop facilities.  As a result of this Government, Irish children are benefitting from smaller class sizes, with disadvantaged schools benefiting the most.  Guidance provision is available in every school.  There are 300 new school building projects on site and many more being advanced.  The most significant reform of the senior cycle in 50 years has begun.<\/p> <p> Having been the Minister who gave the first recognition to special needs as a national concern, supporting students with special needs has always been a deep priority for me and it is a priority for this Government.  The number of special needs teachers and assistants is up 10% in only two years and action is being taken on a range of support issues.  When we have finished our mandate, we will deliver a significant and sustained improvement in special needs education, and this will take a lot less time than the ten years Deputy McDonald has promised.  We will do more in respect of disability in the coming period, particularly in the context of therapies and supports for special schools.<\/p> <p>We have also ensured with our colleagues in government that the budgets we have implemented support an expansion of public services, have helped our country through a recession, underpin a new national development programme and have given the most help to those most in need.  Every single analysis has confirmed that our budgets have been progressive and have given the greatest benefit to those on lowest and fixed incomes such as pensioners and families facing back to school costs.  Over the past year we have faced a new international challenge, dramatic pressures on prices, and the impact of these pressures on people.  It is fair to say that the Irish people have led in regard to our response to Ukraine and the Government has led in terms of the first major war on our Continent since the Second World War and the worst humanitarian crisis on the European Continent since 1942.  We have led from the front on the humanitarian side of that but it has had an impact on the cost of living and on inflation.<\/p> <p> We cannot start chasing our tails on inflation, making things ever worse with massive compensation for everyone.  We can and we are prioritising those under the most pressure.  We will prepare and implement a budget that does as much as possible to protect the economy, protect public services and above all reduce and relieve the cost-of-living pressures on working families and those on low incomes.  We will also continue to focus on the existential challenge of climate change and the loss of our island&rsquo;s biodiversity.  We reject the posturing of those who claim they want to save the planet but oppose everything difficult required to achieve this objective.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, developed, published and has brought into law is both transformative and challenging and it has the support of the entire Government.  Let there be no doubt that it will leave a lasting legacy.   There is no going back from that legislation.  It will govern future Governments as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200021#V01800","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657641300,"counter":291,"content":"<p>Apologies, I do not wish to interrupt, but the Taoiseach has two colleagues speaking as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200023#X00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1657641300,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I did not realise, apologies.<\/p><p>Addressing climate change and protecting our biodiversity is not about any one sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200023#X00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1657641300,"counter":293,"content":"<p>That is constituency rivalry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200023#X00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1657641300,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I thought the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said I had 20 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200023#X00500","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1657641300,"counter":295,"content":"<p>It is a 20-minute slot.

The full impact of Brexit on our island remains unresolved and Covid-19 is on the rise again.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's answer is to call for a general election.  Sinn F&eacute;in's approach to opposition is very simple: promise everything to everyone, say whatever has to be said to get into government and worry about the consequences afterwards.  Delivering the promises being made by Sinn F&eacute;in would amount to billions and billions of euro.  Sinn F&eacute;in is building a level of expectation of what it can deliver in government that is utterly unrealistic and unrealisable.  In its heart of hearts it must know this and it is a deeply cynical approach to politics.  Some of those who will support Sinn F&eacute;in today have had not one, but two, opportunities to enter government in recent years but chose the safe and comfortable Opposition benches where it is easy to have all the answers and none of the responsibility.  No one on this side of the House has denied that our country faces many challenges, not least the imperative to build more homes quickly, to reform our health service and to address the cost-of-living pressures that many face.  The Government has managed our economy and our public finances well.  Our economy is now close to full employment.  At times the House and certainly the Opposition seem to take those fundamental achievements for granted but it is a successful economy with well-managed public finances that give us the resources to intervene and support people who are genuinely under pressure from the rising cost of living.  Our focus now is on the budget.  It will be a cost-of-living budget with &euro;6.7 billion and a separate package of one-off measures to help people who face real challenges.<\/p>  <p>  We have a strong and stable Government that does not claim to get everything right.

Sinn F&eacute;in tabled its motion of no confidence in the Government opposite because we believe that change is needed now more than ever.  The Government in those benches is out of touch, clearly out of ideas and now out of time - a Government that is unravelling before our very eyes, which has lost the support of the people, if indeed it ever had it.  Last week it lost its D&aacute;il majority.  Now the Taoiseach scrambles to get the votes to win a confidence motion.  The writing is on the wall for him.  This failed Government should go, it should go now and make way for a Government that will finally put workers and families first.  T&aacute; an Rialtas ag titim as a ch&eacute;ile d&iacute;reach os &aacute;r gcomhair.  Theip air tabhairt faoi na ruda&iacute; at&aacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach do dhaoine.

It is not hard to see why this coalition is coming apart at the seams.  It is a Government that has presided over two years of utter and abject failure.  Not only has the Government failed to make improvements in the areas that really matter to people, but it has, in fact, managed to make a bad situation so much worse.  This is especially true in housing, in healthcare and in dealing with the cost-of-living crisis that has literally pushed households to the brink.  The Government has no urgency, no vision and no capacity to grasp the severity of these problems in the lives of ordinary people.  By any fair judgment, the Taoiseach is failing.<\/p>  <p>  Far too often the message from Government to the people looking to it for solutions has been, \"Suck it up, get on with it, shop around, you are on your own\".  Well, that is just not good enough.  People expect so much more from those they elect and those who they pay very handsomely to get the job done.  Strike one against this failed Government is without question housing.  Let us not forget the coalition came to office declaring that it would fix housing.  This was a very bold statement that has not aged well.  On its watch, the housing crisis has escalated to a housing disaster.  So many of our people now struggle to put and keep a secure roof over their heads.<\/p> <p>House prices continue to soar beyond the reach of ordinary workers and families.  The dream of owning a home has become an impossibility for an entire generation.  Rents keep going up and up.  Renters are being ripped off every month, robbed of their money but also robbed of their futures.  Young people, in particular, watch on as international funds build fancy apartment blocks in their neighbourhoods and they get to look at them because they never will be able to afford to live in them.  Generation Rent is exploited in the here and now and they face a difficult and uncertain future.  A new Government on the side of renters would take action now to cut rents through a tax credit and legislate to ban rent increases for three years but the Taoiseach's do-nothing Government sits on its hands and turns a blind eye; worse than that, and he is at it again this afternoon, the Taoiseach bragged about the Government's new shared equity scheme.  It is a vintage Fianna F&aacute;il move if ever there was one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200023#X02300","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657641900,"counter":313,"content":"<p>What is Sinn F&eacute;in doing in the North?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200024#Y00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1657641900,"counter":314,"content":"<p>It is one designed to prop up extortionate house prices and to saddle people with additional debt, and the Taoiseach boasts that people in desperation will reach for that measure.

People in families who never thought that they would ever be in such an horrific situation find themselves in emergency accommodation, if they can get emergency accommodation.

For any state that calls itself a republic, one child in homelessness is a scandal but hundreds of children homeless is a damning indictment of those in power.

Rather than lining up to vote confidence in themselves, Government Members might, for once, do some self-reflection because this housing disaster was created by them and it is sustained by them, and yet they remain wedded to the housing policies that created this mess in the first place and feathered the nests of well-got developers, wealthy investors and big landlords at the expense of ordinary people in housing need.

Under Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, so many are denied the medical care that they badly need.  Our hospitals are chronically overcrowded and we have a never-ending trolley crisis.  Waiting lists have ballooned to record levels.  Children with conditions, such as scoliosis or spina bifida, wait years for life-changing surgery.  Mental health and disability services are on the floor as families and communities cry out for help.  Despite all the promises of change, our front-line health staff continue to endure unacceptable working conditions.  The message from the Government to ordinary people is clear: \"Do not get sick, do not need an operation or a treatment, and, for God's sake, do not need support services.\"  Bad Government policy ensures that they are not guaranteed the care they need when they need it.  When so many are denied vital healthcare and when a government, indeed, asks so many to live in agony and stress, how can anybody come into the D&aacute;il and argue that the Government is doing a good job, let alone vote confidence in it?  The truth is that the Government persists with policies that hollow out our public health system and prop up an at times inefficient, inequitable, unjust two-tier health service.<\/p>  <p>  People are sick and tired, by the way, of Government telling them that healthcare cannot be fixed or solved.  I do not accept that for a second and I never will.  A new Government can deliver a health service that works for everyone - a single-tier national public health service where treatment is accessed based on medical need, not on how much you earn.  That is what people deserve.  That is worth working for; that is worth fighting for.<\/p>  <p>  Strike three against the Government is on the cost-of-living crisis.  Households across the country are at breaking point and the threat of poverty is now very real, not only for those on low and fixed incomes, but for middle-income households too.  People simply do not know where they will find the money to pay soaring energy bills and put food on the table and fuel in the car, and the massive cost involved in getting children back to school in September has become a household crisis for many.  Families struggle to afford the basics but the Government refuses to do what needs to be done.  With a bull-headed stubbornness, it refused to introduce an emergency budget with measures to bring relief.

We in Labour cannot do that.  We have never had confidence in the Government to address the housing disaster, the childcare crisis, the spiralling cost of living or the climate catastrophe.  In 2020, we did not support the election of the Taoiseach and we now believe in the need for a change of Government.  We believe the project of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party has been unsuccessful.  Despite their stated aims, they are simply not delivering the desired and necessary outcomes or results.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has long professed itself the party of home ownership and of house building.  Yet, since the Government took office, the housing crisis has deteriorated, rents have increased by 15%, house prices by 22% and homelessness by 19%, with more than 3,000 children and 1,300 families now homeless.  That is without mentioning those who have homes but fear they will collapse due to mica, pyrite or construction defects.  As the Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Health grapples with the two-tier health system his party ushered in alongside the Progressive Democrats, the promise of Sl&aacute;intecare remains distant and, indeed, waiting lists remain unforgivably long for many basic services for many adults and children.<\/p>  <p>  Fine Gael finds itself similarly unequipped to deal with the challenges of its own portfolios.  In the midst of an enormous cost-of-living crisis, the best the party can promise is a five-year wait for a living wage.  After the trauma of the pandemic, it has produced a sick pay scheme that will cost lower-income workers money, and so-called flexible working legislation that empowers employers to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; - a right to refuse, not a right to remote work.<\/p>  <p>  The Green Party, a party that shares many policies and aspirations of my own, has managed to pass some climate legislation, which we have supported, but it appears it is incapable of pushing its Government colleagues to meet those legally-binding targets.  We, therefore, see a stand-off on agriculture emissions and on peat and, all the while, the countdown to climate catastrophe keeps ticking.<\/p>  <p>  On childcare, the Government is bound to examine the introduction of a universal public scheme by the First 5 funding model, which is welcome, but that does not appear to be on the horizon, despite ongoing poverty wages for those working in the sector and exorbitant costs for parents.  Inequality in Ireland starts the day a baby is born and that should not be how it is in a republic.<\/p>  <p>  This country deserves a Government with the imagination to do better; a Government that can be relied on to act in the common good for all its people, that will build affordable homes on public land, lead the charge on climate justice and a just transition, and bring about a new Donogh O&rsquo;Malley moment to ensure universal public childcare and early years education for our youngest citizens and people; a Government that will ensure that nobody languishes on waiting lists for CAMHS, medical intervention, special classes or autism assessments; and a Government that treats care work with the respect it deserves and that will work for the unity of the island in the spirit of John and Pat Hume.  Unfortunately, I remain unconvinced that the Government can deliver on any of that.<\/p>  <p>  We acknowledge the many challenges that the Government has and that we all have - the brutal war in Ukraine, the ongoing effects of the Covid pandemic and, of course, the spiralling cost of living.  As inflation has skyrocketed, we know that individuals and families are struggling to put food in their mouths and roofs over their heads, but we also know that there are solutions to these complex problems and there is a way to address these challenges.  We believe in a Labour vision, a constructive and alternative vision for change based on a centre-left, social democratic philosophy and set of principles, based on the introduction of key measures, such as genuinely free education, genuinely free childcare and early years education, windfall profit taxes on energy companies, immediate increases in the minimum wage and social welfare rates, a rent freeze and new measures to drastically reduce rents, and ensuring the building of more homes as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  We offer that alternative vision and we also offer a vision on climate justice and on just transition.  Something that is notably absent from the no-confidence motion tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in is a mention of climate, and it is a strange omission.  As climate spokesperson, I have certainly given the Green Party its due for the measures it has sought to introduce in government but we know its coalition partners are simply not willing to do what is necessary to ensure we address the real, existential climate crisis in climate and in biodiversity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200025#Z03800","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1657642500,"counter":375,"content":"<p>That is not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200025#Z03900","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1657642500,"counter":376,"content":"<p>We need a Government that will integrate economic planning with a stronger climate response to take us to net zero as quickly as possible, to make Ireland the renewables superpower that it can be and to support the creation of decent jobs through a just transition.<\/p>  <p>  There is a pressing case for change.  The reality is that younger generations in Ireland are now growing up worse off than their parents who came before them.  Young people are locked out, with no prospect of secure, affordable homes.  Workers on low pay and in precarious conditions are struggling to get by, rather than getting on.  We know Ireland needs a pay rise and we know the State can and must deliver a new social contract, with real change offered on housing, care, climate and more.  We need to build an equal, sustainable island, contributing proudly to our European and international future, but we can only do this if those holding the levers of power understand that change cannot wait and if they are an ambitious enough to do more and do better in delivering tangible results.<\/p>  <p>  The tone of too much of this debate has been one of mock outrage and mock anger, which is not helpful.

Meanwhile, in the North, where her party sets the rate, having been in power in 2007, it is giving out less than half measures, with payments of &pound;42.90 for primary school pupils and a maximum of &pound;67.20 for a post-primary pupil.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200026#AA02900","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1657643100,"counter":406,"content":"<p>It gets better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200026#AA03000","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1657643100,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Deputy McDonald's party should give the Irish people more credit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200026#AA03100","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1657643100,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Pupils there get free meals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200026#AA03200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657643100,"counter":409,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657643100,"counter":410,"content":"<p>The party should give the Irish people more credit.

That is the very definition of cynical.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, let us just look at the progress this Government has made under the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.  Homelessness has increased in the last two years by 19%, and child homelessness by a staggering 40% in the last 12 months.  There are now 5,000 single adults in emergency accommodation funded by the Department of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  This is the highest level of single-person homelessness ever recorded in modern times.  More than 3,000 children, because of the policies of this Government, will be sleeping tonight in emergency accommodation.  We are only days away from breaching the October 2019 peak of the highest level of officially-recognised homelessness in the history of the State.<\/p>  <p>  Rents are sky high.  The average for a rental property in this city is &euro;24,000 annually.  In the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency, it is &euro;19,000 a year for a standard rental property.  Contrary to what the Taoiseach said, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, has not increased protections for renters.  Last April, he stripped the single most important intervention that led to reductions in family homelessness, namely the ban on evictions.  That has led to almost a month-on-month increase.  The crisis in the private rental sector is continuing.  Not only is that sector shrinking month-on-month because of the Government&rsquo;s failed policies, but the new rental supply that is coming in, because of the building and planning regulations introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, is locking in high-cost rental in perpetuity.  This is why the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, rightly highlighted in a report last week that this Government&rsquo;s policies, like those of the Governments before, are subjecting an entire generation to the risk of pensioner poverty.<\/p>  <p>  Contrary as well to the claim made by the Minister and Taoiseach their party is about homeownership, every time Fianna F&aacute;il has been in government, with the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, home ownership has plummeted.  People's dependence on insecure high-cost rentals has continued.  With respect to social housing, we are told that it is going to be the biggest social housing programme in the history of the State.  Yet the Minister&rsquo;s own report at the end of the first quarter of this year stated that the total number of new social homes delivered under the Government's programme is 639, which is just 7% of the total.  We are at about the same level as we were last year during Covid-19, when there was a lockdown.  Therefore, I do not believe that these targets are going to be met.  Even if they are met, that will be 1,000 less than what was promised by the last Government and therefore nowhere near enough.

This is a Government that is happy to acknowledge the vast number of people enduring serious financial pressure from an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis, yet it has consistently refused to introduce an emergency budget to provide workers and their families with interim relief in advance of the budget in the autumn.  The Government is also blind to the havoc it is causing in housing, which has long morphed from a crisis into a disaster.  One of the most basic requirements of any functioning society is the provision of secure and affordable housing.  It is supposed to be the biggest priority for the Government, but it is also its biggest failure.  The housing crisis did not happen by accident.  It was caused by a collection of policy choices by successive Governments, all of which have included Fine Gael.<\/p>  <p>  It is now, as I said, a housing disaster.  We are told that record amounts are being spent and we have been told, and repeatedly told, about the &euro;4 billion.  Let us, however, have a look at this figure.

The direct builds of local authorities are in many cases turnkeys rather than direct builds and are not an addition to housing completion numbers.<\/p> <p> Last week's ESRI report is very sobering.  The report states that one in three people aged between 35 and 44 years will not own a home by retirement age.  The new research suggests that a future cohort of retirees will likely have substantially lower rates of homeownership than current retirees, with only 65% of those currently aged 35 to 44 years estimated to become homeowners by retirement age.  It gets worse.  We are told that it is even more stark for the age cohort between 25 and 34 years, of which one in two households are likely to become homeowners by retirement age.  The report finds that such drastic changes in homeownership patterns could raise the proportion of people aged 65 years and over in income poverty due to housing costs from the current rate of 14% to 31%.  That is some legacy and it is being created as we speak as a result of deliberate housing policies that make housing completely unaffordable.  It is not just an issue of delivery.  There is an affordability crisis at the heart of the housing crisis.<\/p> <p> We are spending approximately &euro;22 billion on our health service, yet it is in perpetual crisis.  One quarter of the population, some 1.3 million people, are now on waiting lists for health services.  That is a truly shocking figure.  It has become much more difficult to retain our excellent healthcare workers because the system also fails them.  There has been a rush to the door and it hardly fills one with confidence that people like Professor Tom Keane and Ms Laura McGahey left the health service last year partly because they did not believe there was a real commitment to reform through Sl&aacute;intecare.  We have watched senior officials head to the door in recent weeks and months and it does not fill one with confidence that the Department of Health is in control or can reform the healthcare system to the extent required to tackle that problem.<\/p> <p> This is supposed to be a cohesive Government and it cannot even agree climate targets.

That kind of approach might work when leading an Opposition and when one is more interested in the content of a social media video than the content of policy, but it will not work if one is looking to lead a country.  It points to the greater void at the heart of Sinn F&eacute;in policies.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants more rental accommodation to be built, yet it demonises landlords and anyone who seeks to provide it.  It wants to make progress on climate change, yet it is against any measure, particularly difficult measures, that are needed to achieve it.  It wants to abolish the local property tax in Ireland, yet it wants to hike the tax in the North.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to make progress on the cost-of-living challenge.

It is a party that is negative on Europe, indifferent to investment and always sees income in our country as something to be spent and never earned.

There was a legitimate debate in the House a couple of weeks ago as to when we should have the budget and on the size of the budget package.  The Government responded, moved the date of the budget forward and will now deliver a budget package bigger than previously planned.  However, instead of now allowing the Government to knuckle down and get on with that job, the motion Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled would result in the dissolution of the D&aacute;il, the hanging up of posters and a paralysis in Irish politics for the weeks and months ahead.  It would result in a delay in delivering help to hard-working families at a time when, as Sinn F&eacute;in rightly highlights, they so need it.  In many ways it is a mini-version of the very difficult situation in Northern Ireland that it rightly castigates.  It wants to plunge this jurisdiction into paralysis, just like Northern Ireland now sees paralysis as well.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it is more sinister than that.  As my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, rightly outlined, we hear very eloquent speeches that prey on people's legitimate fears and concerns and offer beautiful sound bites, very well articulated, but no solutions.  The people do not need that.  What the people need now is a Government that will, in the face of massive global challenges, get on with progressing an agenda that will deliver for them, their families and their futures, and that is what we are doing.<\/p>  <p>  We are doing it in the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, where we see massive increases in student grants coming, changes to adjacency and income thresholds, and five technological universities now bringing higher education into the regions, not just the cities.  We are launching our apprenticeship action plan, delivering record numbers of apprentices to build the homes we need and to retrofit our buildings.  We are determined to reduce the cost of education.  Sinn F&eacute;in criticises the cost of education here, but a fact it does not talk about much is that students in Northern Ireland are charged over &euro;2,000 more just to go to college every year than they are charged here.  Shame on Sinn F&eacute;in.  We are reforming the CAO process.  We are giving out free laptops to more than 17,000 students.  We have introduced funding streams to help autistic students to get into college and to have pathways and programmes for students with intellectual disabilities.  We have abolished fees for post-leaving certificate courses.  We will deliver 200 more medicine places over the next five years and new pathways and structures for our PhD students.<\/p>  <p>  That is what we are doing to try to make a real and tangible difference in an important area of people's lives and the education system of our country.  All of that is happening at a time when Sinn F&eacute;in offers division, a menu of empty rhetoric and stagnation and a proactive policy of paralysis.

It is a promise worth &euro;854 million.  Again, it is not costed.  No explanation is given as to where the money will come from.  Sinn F&eacute;in would abolish carbon tax, which raises approximately &euro;500 million per year.

The trolley crisis gets worse year on year.  Emergency department waiting times are more than 12 hours on average, and what has this Government served up?  A damning report from HIQA on the danger of University Hospital Limerick's emergency department, with patients left waiting up to 116 hours.  The Government has run down the emergency department at Navan, and the ambulance service is stretched thin, with no plan in sight.  We have wholesale cancellation of elective surgeries, which is now routine, with more than 16,000 hospital appointments cancelled in May alone.  Children with scoliosis and spina bifida face cancellation after cancellation and get treatment only when they and their families have to take to the media to beg for care.<\/p>  <p>  Disability services are completely unfit for purpose.  We have more than 700 vacancies on children's disability network teams.  That means 480,000 lost therapy hours while 50,000 children are on waiting lists for care.  The State and the HSE were taken to court for denying rights to children with disabilities.  I say to the Minister, Deputy Harris, that that is shameful.<\/p>  <p>  In mental health, more than 240 children were exposed to risk of significant harm under south Kerry CAMHS.  GPs are retiring without replacements, with waiting lists for GPs growing.  The dental treatment service scheme for children and medical card holders is collapsing and has been for the best part of two years.  The Government's plan for waiting lists has been wholesale outsourcing to the private sector.  The Government relies on the National Treatment Purchase Fund to purchase private care.  The Government invests in private diagnostic capacity instead of the public system.  Home care is entirely reliant on private agencies.  Outsource, outsource, outsource is the Government's plan, rather than building capacity in the public system.  The Government is building a new national maternity hospital on land the State does not own.<\/p>  <p>  Front-line healthcare workers are exhausted and burnt out, yet there is no joined-up workforce plan and no plan to stem the tide of emigration of those in healthcare.  No training targets of substance have been set by the Minister or the Government, and a range of healthcare contracts are out of date.  Non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, work more than 60 hours a week.  The new consultant contract is years behind and there has been no resolution to pay inequality.  The GP contract does not work.  Medical scientists were forced to go on strike, junior doctors are now planning to strike, nurses are considering going on strike and student nurses have told me and my party leader in droves that they will leave because they were told by this Fianna F&aacute;il Government they do not do real work.<\/p> <p>Many front-line workers are still waiting for the pandemic bonus, which has still not been paid, and there is no long-term sick pay for long Covid for those on the front line.  Is it any wonder healthcare professionals leave and emigrate or do not work in the public system in the numbers they should?<\/p> <p> We have an absolute failure of accountability in healthcare.  There is no accountability for Grace, no accountability in the Brandon case and no inquiry into injury from sodium valproate or mesh implants.  We have a CervicalCheck tribunal that is not supported by the survivors or families who lost loved ones and organs of deceased children incinerated without the parents' knowledge or consent.

They have no prospect of getting out of the accommodation.  The Government has not solved this.  Meanwhile, we have 160,000 empty properties.  In my area, flats and apartments in the hands of vulture funds have been sitting for three and four years.  I have raised this repeatedly.  What does the Government do about it?  It does nothing but these investors are making a fortune just sitting on empty properties.  They are making record profits.  Energy companies are making record profits.  Corporate profits have gone up by 300% in the past ten years.  Those concerned are doing well, however.  According to ICTU, housing and accommodation costs in this country are 78% higher than the EU average.  Therefore, the Government should not hide behind the Ukraine war.

I am referring to the past 12 years.

He is over the threshold so he gets no support in facing the cost-of-living crisis.

What makes this stunt even more cynical is the reality that it will not succeed.  There was never a realistic expectation in Sinn F&eacute;in that it would.  This is about disruption.

It opposed the help to buy and shared equity schemes.  It is against financial interventions to get apartments built.

I have also introduced new laws to criminalise the distribution of intimate images without consent and to introduce preliminary trial hearings to make the court process less stressful for victims.

As Minister for Justice I take my responsibility towards the security and safety of our State and our people very seriously.  Weeks ago, once again, Sinn F&eacute;in failed to support the renewal of the Offences Against the State Act and the Special Criminal Court.  It was another reminder that Sinn F&eacute;in cannot be trusted to protect national security and the institutions of the State.  It told us it is willing to ignore very clear security advice from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Commissioner whose unambiguous view, and I put this on the record of the House, is that the Offences Against the State Act and the Special Criminal court are vital in the continued fight against terrorism and organised crime.  Sinn F&eacute;in ignores these views and prefers to help its own.  What other advice from the Garda Commissioner would it ignore if it were in office?

Anyone who went to the photographic exhibition the Ceann Comhairle put on today of the damage being done to lives in Ukraine would not doubt this is the reality.  Mercifully, we are far from that reality but we are feeling the brunt of it.  The evidence shows the Government has been caring and innovative in its response to the crisis.  It is undertaking deep-seated reform in many areas that had been left untouched for many years.  It is doing so with the caution required by what these underlying crises imply for our country.  We need to proceed with caution and not with rashly jumping on every bandwagon that comes by our door.<\/p>  <p>  There are many people bearing the scars of the multiple crises we have been through.  There are many whose expectations have been far from fulfilled.  What I find disconcerting about the Sinn F&eacute;in response to this is that its response is simple and cynical.  It seeks to portray the Ministers in the Government as uncaring, out of touch and trying to line their own pockets or the pockets of so-called developers or wealthy interests.  This portrayal is an entire fantasy.  I have worked in Cabinet with Ministers from the Labour Party, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and Independent Members.  I can say with absolute confidence that none have spared themselves.  None have pursued special interests.  They have sought to provide government for a country that is trying to grapple with what are worldwide problems.<\/p>  <p>  No matter how often the Sinn F&eacute;in communications juggernaut repeats these charges in scripts that come off its wonderful word processors, elevating it now to theatre, the truth is that those who hitch their wagon to this juggernaut today should not for one minute think it will not shortly reverse over them and the parties supporting this.  Most people enter politics to resolve conflict.  Unfortunately, we see too much of politics that is all about generating conflict.  Twice in my lifetime I have seen the sort of situation where faith placed in the triumph of political hope over expectation has destroyed opportunity.  It has been the weakest who have been damaged by this failure.  Unfortunately, I see the seeds of this same approach being sown today and many days previously.  We are asked to consider a change of government to Sinn F&eacute;in.  I do not have the time to do it now but look at the policies and plans it is offering.  There is no solution to the multiple challenges we face from the strategies offered by Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200031#FF00500","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1657646700,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Faoin Rialtas seo, t&aacute; an gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im tith&iacute;ochta tar &eacute;is &eacute;ir&iacute; ina tubaiste s&oacute;isialta.  T&aacute; na liosta&iacute; feithimh ospid&eacute;il ag &eacute;ir&iacute; n&iacute;os faide n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; riamh agus t&aacute; an caighde&aacute;n maireacht&aacute;la ag titim.  Is &eacute; ceann de na f&aacute;thanna go mbeidh mise ag v&oacute;t&aacute;il m&iacute;mhuin&iacute;ne sa Rialtas seo n&aacute; go bhfuil &aacute; teip ioml&aacute;n air.  T&aacute; s&eacute; in am don athr&uacute;.  An Taoiseach was right when he walked outside this House a number of years ago and declared to the world that the best interests of the Irish people were not served by a Government made up of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  How right he was, unfortunately, because we have seen over the past two years how those words have rung loud and true for workers and families throughout the State.<\/p>  <p>  Since the election, we have seen rents increase and spiral out of control.  The average rent in this State is now &euro;18,000 per year while, in Dublin, it is more than &euro;24,000.  Since the election, house prices have continued to spiral, with the average price now almost &euro;312,000.  A whole generation has been locked out of home ownership.  Under the Government, the housing crisis has got worse and worse.  Today, there are 1.3 million people on hospital waiting lists.  Many of them are waiting 12 hours and longer in emergency departments up and down this State.  Healthcare has become less accessible, not more, to patients and families who are struggling.<\/p>  <p>  Some children with additional needs still do not even know what schools they will be in, come August and September.  We saw last week when families, whose homes are crumbling before their eyes, watched as the Government rammed a defective scheme through the D&aacute;il that leaves them with tens of thousands of euro to come out of their own pockets.  Many of them will be locked out of this scheme and locked into a future of despair.<\/p>  <p>  We need a strong and inclusive economy that supports workers and families, but the failures of the Government in housing and childcare are damaging our economy and the workers who have built it.  Under the Government, living standards have fallen faster than at any time since the financial crash that was brought on by a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  Ireland is now the most expensive country in the EU for housing costs, including rent, mortgage rates and electricity.  The Ireland of today, under Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Greens is an Ireland in which one in three are living in energy poverty.  It is an Ireland where one in three are struggling to make ends meet and too many, struggling on low pay, struggle to build a future.  They live in an Ireland where they feel they have no future.<\/p>  <p>  The living standard of Irish households is below the European average; that is a fact.  Under this Government, workers and families face mounting energy builds, transport costs and food prices, with many of them at breaking point.  Struggling under a cost-of-living crisis, workers and families deserve a Government that hears them, listens to them and is willing to respond for them.  Workers and families deserve a Government that is in touch with their concerns and that will take decisive action but, instead, they are faced with a Government that refuses to take action or bring forward an emergency budget.  The message to them is to sit tight and buckle up because they are on their own, but a very different message is there for the vulture funds and the investment funds because this is a Government that is only all too quick to roll out the red carpet for those who want to exploit the housing crisis to the detriment of renters and home buyers.  <\/p>  <p>  This is a Government that has allowed the most vulnerable to wither on the vine and has only responded when it has been shamed into action.  This is a Government that is out of touch, a Government that is out of ideas and a Government that is out of time.  Today, the D&aacute;il faces a simple question: are we heading in the right direction or the wrong direction under this Government?  The answer is plainly clear for anybody to see in housing, health, the cost of living, mica and many other issues.  Things are getting worse for far too many people.  The Irish people have big ambitions for their country, their communities and their families, but they are stuck in a rut, because they are with a Government that has created more problems that it solves.  This is a Government that is big on promises, but weak on delivery.<\/p>  <p>  I have no confidence in a Government that has turned a housing crisis into a social disaster; I have no confidence in a Government that has brought our healthcare system to a standstill for so many patients; and I have no confidence in a Government that has failed to protect lower- and middle-income households from the sharp edge of the cost-of-living crisis.  Members of this House should not either.  That is why I am voting no confidence in this Government.  It is time for change; it is time to replace this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200032#GG00100","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1657646700,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I stated many times in the Chamber that the people of Ireland need help and they need help now.  The main issues that are continuously being raised in my constituency office are the cost of living, housing and health.  I have raised these issues with the Government and expressed my disappointment.  On the cost of living, we need to cut taxes for those on middle and low incomes and increase social welfare in the upcoming budget.  We need to continue the supports and reductions on the cost of energy by reducing VAT on gas and electricity and the public service obligation levy; cutting the cost of public transport and children's school transport, and the cost of putting food on the table; do and much more on top of the extra &euro;75 lump sum for recipients of fuel allowance.<\/p>  <p>  As I said in the Chamber last week, I welcome the &euro;2.4 billion in cost-of-living measures, but help is needed and it is needed now.  On housing, we need to build more houses and make them more affordable.  We need more rental accommodation and to get unoccupied and vacant properties back into the housing stock.  The Government has a housing plan, Housing for All, which sets out to deliver 300,000 new homes by the end of 2030, including 90,000 social houses, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost-rental homes.  Families, at present, are working just to pay for their mortgage or rent.  We need to help them, and we need to help them now. <\/p>  <p>  We must make the Government keep its promises and we must follow up on the allocation of &euro;165 billion towards housing, climate change and  balanced regional development.  Families need a home and stability, and children need a home.  I look at all these vacant houses lying idle beside schools and medical centres.  It is very important to give a few euro to the local authorities to put families in these houses, as soon as we can.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of health, we must not forget that Ireland had one of the most successful Covid vaccination programmes in the world.  In fairness, the Government provided &euro;48 billion to the economy and society, which was very welcome, and we all worked together.  However, with the largest budget in the history of the State in 2022, it is still disappointing that we see so many patients on waiting lists.  Some &euro;350 million has been provided to deliver additional activities under the Government's waiting-list action plans and I will chase after it to see how this money is spent.  With an additional 847 permanent beds in the past three years, we do not seem to see their impact, but I welcome the reduction of the drugs payment scheme threshold from &euro;124 to &euro;80 and a successful vaccination roll-out.<\/p>  <p>  I have spoken to many constituents and businesses in my area who are concerned that Sinn F&eacute;in will get into power.  They say Sinn F&eacute;in is full of promises and is always throwing the toys out of the pram when it does not get its own way.  Its record in the North on housing, health, homelessness and the cost of living speaks for itself and, again, no Assembly has been elected.<\/p>  <p>  The Government parties have to show me that they are fully aware of the impact of the rise in prices on households and businesses and I will work closely with them over the coming months to make sure they gets the help they need.  I have represented the people of Louth and east Meath for nearly 12 years.  I have always been open and transparent.  Since I became an Independent three years ago, I always take into consideration my constituency and I am not just here to push buttons.  I will do my best for them.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we all work together like we did during the pandemic and put this wonderful country first.  The last thing we need is for the Government to collapse and a general election be called, which will mean no budget until 27 December and a lengthy election similar to the last one.  People need help and they need it now.  I will vote confidence in this Government.  I will hold it to account and make sure that it keeps its promises.  I will always stand up and be counted.  It is my duty, as an elected representative, to represent my constituency as best I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200032#GG00200","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1657646700,"counter":557,"content":"<p>We have a record-breaking Government but for all the wrong reasons.  We have record housing prices.  Some 15 years after Fianna F&aacute;il generated the last property bubble, we have the same Celtic tiger house prices.  The price of a three-bedroom home is increasing by &euro;100 every day in this State.  We have record rents.  Rents are more than &euro;254 per month higher than they were during the Celtic tiger era.  People in their twenties and thirties are paying a record share of their income on accommodation.  In real terms, their spending power is falling.<\/p>  <p>  We also have record homelessness.  More than 10,000 people are in emergency accommodation, 3,000 of whom are children.  We have record hospital waiting lists.  Some 1.3 million people are on health waiting lists in the State, 100,000 of whom are children.  We have record overcrowding in emergency departments, with patients in some hospitals waiting for 24 hours on average.  GP services are collapsing throughout the country.<\/p> <p>So far this year, 400 GPs have emigrated to Australia, which is incredible.  A constituent of mine rang a doctor for an appointment and was given a date in September.  At the same time we have the Government cutting emergency department and ICU capacities.  There are more than 600 patients on trolleys in the middle of summer.  University Hospital Limerick is like a war zone and senior management in the heath service are in open revolt against the Minister for Health.  He has paused the closure of the Navan emergency department but they are proceeding with it right now.<\/p> <p> We have record fuel prices in this State.  Incredibly, the Government is taking more in fuel taxes today than it did before the cost-of-living crisis.  We have an incredible situation where 29% of the population is in fuel poverty and it is estimated 40% will be by the time autumn comes.  Semi-State companies such as Electric Ireland are gouging citizens by increasing prices for electricity and gas while making profits of &euro;679 million.<\/p> <p> It is not the only semi-State company gouging citizens.  The Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, is charging the highest airport car parking prices in Europe at the moment.  In the airport we have people waiting for their luggage longer than the duration of their flights.  Donna O'Connor arrived into Dublin Airport and could not locate her suitcase upon arrival.  Her heart is broken as her luggage contained her parents' ashes.<\/p> <p> We have a spiralling cost-of-living crisis.  Ireland is one of the most expensive places to live in Europe and people are lying awake at night-time wondering what bill they are going to be able to pay.<\/p> <p> We also had one of the longest, most severe and costly lockdowns in Europe.  It cost the citizens of the State more than &euro;30 billion.  The national debt, which no Member has discussed so far, is one of the highest in the world.  It stands at &euro;237 billion at a time interest rates internationally are about to take off.<\/p> <p> We have also got phenomenal Government nepotism.  We should not forget the selection of Katherine Zappone for an appointment that was supposed to be critical, though a year later it is still open.  Dr. Tony Holohan was selected for a secondment worth more than &euro;20 million in direct contravention of the Government's own rules and Government Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la have enjoyed all-expenses-paid races gifted by the gambling lobby.  We had the leaking of a confidential document by the T&aacute;naiste, the leaking of the mother and baby homes report, the plucking of Robert Watt's salary out of the air, the refusal to publish details on the selection of Martin Fraser for the job of ambassador to the UK, the mushrooming of the capital costs of projects such as the children's hospital, the glacial roll-out of broadband and Government parties pretending to be charities while selling national draw tickets.  We have the refusal to investigate 10,000 people who were moved from hospitals to nursing homes during Covid, many of whom were not tested, and we have nearly 300 women forced through the courts to get justice on CervicalCheck after a promise from the T&aacute;naiste this would not happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200032#GG00300","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657647300,"counter":559,"content":"<p>Like the Minister for Finance, I listened with real intent to the Leader of the Opposition's speech.

The cold reality of the real world shows it cannot deliver the false promises it presents.<\/p>  <p>  It is important because we live in extraordinary times where all of us as ordinary people are going to have to manage the most challenging situation.  The cost of living is an issue because energy and food are being used as weapons of war and rhetoric about simplistic solutions is not going to heat a single home.  All of us in every party, and Independents and others, have a desire that our children should be able to raise a family and have a home in this country in a way that is affordable.  That desire does not belong to anyone but, again, the reality is in our country it is going to be building the builders.  There will be a real change in our country with apprenticeships coming back.  That is the way you actually achieve and deliver what is in the title.  It says it on the tin.  It is \"Housing for All\".  We work for all in government - for the people who vote for the Opposition and those who vote for us, not for some and playing it as a division.<\/p>  <p>  If it comes to change, trust me, there is so much change coming to meet our climate and biodiversity restoration plans that it is going to be beyond compare, and I am proud of what our party is doing in that regard.  It would take me too long to list the changes but I want to mention some of my colleagues.  There is what the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, is doing to deliver a basic income for artists.  That is radical change in a Green way.

Deputy Joe O'Brien is responsible for social inclusion and community activation while Deputy Malcolm Noonan is trying to restore nature.  In our backbenches, when we vote now as a Government, we vote from the top bench to the floor and through our chairpersons of the climate, housing and budget oversight committees.

It is on the basis of that track record that I will vote confidence in this Government.<\/p>  <p>  Within my own Department, we are investing &euro;221 million in reforming the childcare sector so it works for everybody, including parents, children, providers and staff.  We have targeted support for the most vulnerable children and families through significant additional funding for Tusla in the two most recent budgets.  We have responded to the legacy of our institutional past, passing historic legislation to provide adopted people with their birth and early life information and allowing the exhumation at the site in Tuam.  We are creating fairer, more equal workplaces with legislation to make firms publish details of their gender pay gap and providing parents with new rights to more flexible working.  We have made family life easier by extending parent's leave from two weeks to seven weeks paid leave per parent.  Recognising the positive impact that youth services had for young people during the pandemic, we have provided additional funding for youth services in each of the two most recent budgets.  We have halved transport costs for young people, providing much-needed support at a time of cost of living pressure.<\/p>  <p>  We have accommodated more than 30,000 Ukrainian refugees who fled here and we have worked to improve conditions for international applicants in the face of a major migration crisis.  Too many issues, including our country's institutional legacy, childcare, direct provision and inequality, have gone unresolved for too long.  This Government is addressing omissions of the past.  It is supporting families, children and young people.  It has prioritised our international humanitarian obligations.  It is making Ireland a more equal place.  It is delivering, and that is why it deserves the support of this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200034#JJ00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1657647900,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to our healthcare workers all over the country.

My answer has to be &ldquo;No&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach earlier asked us to be fair.  Therefore, I will stick to the facts.  The European Commission has downgraded the northern and western region from a developed region because our GDP, the measure of our wealth, is collapsing around our ears.  IDA Ireland backed jobs from 2010 to 2020 for Sligo show an increase of 16% and for Leitrim, a 10% decrease.  Nationally, we see an 85% increase.  We are not even at the races.  <\/p>  <p>  Nationally, reports tell us that only one in two young people can hope to own their own home.  That is a tragedy.

I refer to Simon&rsquo;s latest snapshot study, Locked Out of the Market, which states there are no properties available in Galway city or county under HAP - not even with the new discretionary schemes that are coming in.  We have no houses available whatsoever.  We have now 10,325 people homeless.  We are almost approaching the peak.  Can one imagine a peak of 10,514 homeless in 2019?  Yet, the Government is telling us its policies are working.<\/p>  <p>  I live in a city where last week somebody was on a trolley for seven days before being given a room.  That may happen and if I was part of the system, I would be apologising profusely and saying it was most unusual.  Unfortunately, however, it is not unusual.  I failed to understand the answer.  The person who spent seven days on a trolley is almost blind and on a catheter.  That case was in the city I come from and it is repeated in Limerick hospital and all of the other hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  I am voting against the Government because I believe it is not for the common good.

Allow me to put on record just a few examples of the good things this Government is doing.  We have invested &euro;40 billion to help businesses and workers get through Covid, doing so through the pandemic unemployment payment and the employment wage subsidy scheme.  We have the highest number of people at work in the history of the State, at 2.5 million people, with jobs growth in every region and full employment now within grasp.  I refer to the biggest job increases in the south east and the south west, as well as the lowest unemployment now down the western seaboard, including the north-west region.  There have been record levels of foreign direct investment, FDI.  Trade with other countries has never been higher.  That underpins living standards breaking all records.<\/p>  <p>  We are introducing paid sick leave for all workers because nobody should feel under pressure to go to work when unwell.  The sick leave that we will pay will be more in a day than Sinn F&eacute;in gives in a week in Northern Ireland.  We have increased the minimum wage and are moving towards a living wage.  We have a new law planned on the right to request remote working.  We are building infrastructure, with 400 hubs nationwide.  There will be a new public holiday in February.  New laws to protect workers' tips and service charges will be passed this week.  We are introducing a basic income scheme for artists and have doubled spending on the arts, ahead of schedule.  We have an auto-enrolment scheme so that everybody who is at work has an occupational pension on top of the State pension.  There are new laws to protect consumers from being taken advantage of, as well as an insurance plan that is bringing down motor premiums and has outlawed the loyalty penalty.  There is a new retrofitting scheme for warmer homes that are cheaper to heat.  There is a new corporate enforcement agency to crack down on corporate crime.  We are helping businesses to restructure and survive, such as through the small company administrative rescue process, for example, which offers a cheaper and much quicker alternative to examinership.  We are providing funding for businesses to go digital and funding to help them reduce reliance on fossil fuels.  Low cost loans to help businesses with Covid, Brexit and future expansion are being made available.<\/p>  <p>  For children and families, there is seven weeks of paid parent's leave, an increased back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance, five new technological universities, an increase in the student grant, expansion of the school meals programme, no charge for school transport and an increase in grants for postgraduates.  There has been significant investment in special education, with record numbers of special needs assistants in classrooms and more special education teachers.  There are more special classes than ever before.  There are more pathways for people to get the career they want, with 10,000 new apprentices a year by 2025 alone.  I could go on but, in so doing, in many ways I would be repeating what was said earlier.<\/p>  <p>  I will come to my third point.

Under the AMIF, the EU provides financial support for a comprehensive approach to the management of migration in the European Union.  As the House will be aware, Ireland is required to opt in formally to certain EU home affairs instruments under arrangements in place for non-Schengen member states.  This includes the new 2021 to 2027 AMIF programme.<\/p><p>The opt-in process requires both Government and Oireachtas approval.  Following Oireachtas debate and approval on 3 February 2022, Ireland agreed to opt in to the 2021 to 2027 programme.  The European Commission accepted Ireland's opt-in on 27 March 2022.  However, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Union has adopted amendments to the AMIF regulation to support member states to manage the arrival of displaced persons from Ukraine.  Ireland may be able to access &euro;500,000 by virtue of these amendments and this can be allocated to projects to support the integration of Ukrainian displaced persons.<\/p><p>Opting in to this amendment is important to signal Ireland's ongoing support for and participation in the AMIF programme.  I obtained Government approval at the Government meeting last week and this motion is being moved in both Houses of the Oireachtas today.  Each member state participating in the fund must produce a national programme setting out its objectives and plans for how the funding will be deployed.  The national programmes are normally drafted following consultations with relevant interests in the state, including non-governmental organisations, as well as with the European Commission, which is responsible for overseeing the administration of the fund generally.<\/p><p>Subject to approval for the opt-in, my Department will, over the coming months, lead the development of a national programme for Ireland for the 2021 to 2027 AMIF.  The new national programme will cover the main areas of the fund: asylum, legal migration, integration, resettlement, countering irregular migration, returns and solidarity measures.  In developing the new national programme, my Department will consult stakeholders in the areas of asylum, migration and integration, including relevant NGOs and Departments, including the Department of Justice, which will continue to manage funded activities in the area of migration and return.  Subject to Oireachtas approval of the opt-in, the relevant EU bodies will be informed and work on the national programme can begin.<\/p><p>I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200037#OO00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1657649700,"counter":644,"content":"<p>The invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 has led to a mass influx of displaced persons to several EU member states.  This has placed renewed pressure on the financial resources of the member states to deal with migration and border management needs.<\/p> <p>The increased pressure is already being felt across member states that share a land border with Ukraine and the needs have been spreading further afield.  The overall objective of this proposal, as the Minister said, is to support member states to address the consequences of war in Ukraine by facilitating access to unspent financial resources.  Council implementing decision No. 382 of 2022 was adopted, \"establishing the existence of a massed influx of displaced persons from Ukraine within the meaning of Article 5 of Directive 2001\/55\/EC, and having the effect of introducing temporary protection\".  This implementing decision has clarified that the efforts of member states to comply with their obligations and offer temporary protection will be supported by the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund.<\/p> <p> I want to address a few issues in regard to the White Paper on ending direct provision, which was introduced in February 2021.  At the time of its publication, the White Paper was long overdue and there was much anticipation and expectation that there would finally be meaningful reform of a broken system.  It is disappointing, 18 months later, that little or no reform has been undertaken.  We welcomed the White Paper at the time because direct provision is a shameful and cruel system that has caused serious harm to many asylum seekers and wider communities.  We need a modern, humane system that is fit for purpose.  The White Paper contained many positive proposals, which we welcomed, including alignment of welfare rates with existing benefits, the provision of driver's licences for asylum seekers and a reduction in the reliance on private operators, one of which had obtained, through direct provision, the sum of &euro;400 million over a period of years.  The White Paper emphasised the importance of care and supports and, crucially, proposed a non-adversarial approach to applicants.<\/p> <p> However, we pointed out at the time that the White Paper was lacking in ambition in a number of key areas.  We asked that applicants be required to wait three months rather than six months before entering the labour market.  We expressed disappointment at the granting of leave to remain for only five years for people who had been in the system more than two years.  Many asylum seekers who were working in healthcare and food were anxious about facing deportation.  In particular, we were concerned that the length of time people would remain in reception centres would be longer than four months if there was not a front-loading of capital investment in own-door accommodation and accelerated delivery of same.  We were concerned about the White Paper's failure to address the growing problem of those with leave to remain who were trapped in direct provision.  We called for greater supports to remove those families and ensure they were not subjected to entirely unnecessary and unfair delays.<\/p> <p> There have been many critics of the direct provision system over the years, including very highly qualified individuals and organisations focused on supporting asylum seekers.  The Government has not listened closely enough to those people and has entrenched a system that has been known to fail in the past.  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, a former special rapporteur on child protection, has called for direct provision for be abolished, noting it is not a suitable long-term solution.  It has been described by the Irish Refugee Council as \"already a chapter in Ireland's long and dark history of institutional living\".  Using for-profit accommodation providers has only added to the cruelty of the system.  The Irish Refugee Council has stated that any replacement for direct provision should offer \"own door accommodation, the opportunity to cook for oneself, to live in a community\".  The Department of Justice, which had responsibility for the direct provision system at the time, introduced regulations in this regard in August 2019.  In July 2022, however, we still see the same problems, with people not having their own accommodation, being unable to cook for themselves and not being part of a community.<\/p> <p> Three direct provision accommodation centres have been built in recent years.  We all remember what happened when a large number of asylum seekers were moved into a former hotel in Cahersiveen, County Kerry.  Approved housing bodies, AHBs, are clearly the best model, providing dignity and a sense of self and home and enabling asylum and refuge seekers to live a meaningful life.  Any future policy that relies heavily on the private sector will repeat the mistakes of the past.  I urge the Government not to repeat those mistakes.  It is essential that it be transparent regarding the provision of all housing and the transition from the old direct provision model to any new system.<\/p> <p> Direct provision was supposed to be a short-term measure designed to house people for weeks, not years, but half of the children in the direct provision system in 2019 had been there for more than five years.  At that time, the Children's Rights Alliance, Dr. Liam Thornton of University College Dublin, UCD, and the Irish Countrywomen's Association all argued that direct provision does not have the best interests of children at its core and is a violation of the rights of the child, and that there is a need for access to complementary services.  Some of those concerns were met in the White Paper but, unfortunately, 18 months since its publication and three years after the concerns were raised, we are still seeing the use of accommodation centres in very isolated areas.<\/p> <p> Many of the asylum seekers who have come to my office say they are grateful to be in Ireland but that they quickly felt abandoned and lost in the system.  They are concerned they have spent weeks and months waiting for answers via official channels.  They do not have access to broadband, which makes it very expensive and stressful for them to communicate with Government bodies.  All the while, they are receiving a very small amount of money from the State.  Transportation to hospital or urgent appointments is also a very expensive proposition.  They are reliant on Government resources such as the Tralee International Resource Centre, which provides invaluable help because there is nobody else to help them.<\/p> <p> Direct provision is, in general, provided in sub-par accommodation in which residents are expected to share bedrooms and bathrooms, with little concern for the reasons they sought asylum in the first place.  Many of them feel isolated.  A single pregnant woman was sent to rural Kerry, for example, with no consideration as to how she would travel to her prenatal appointments.  The travel cost was more than her weekly allowance, meaning much of her care was forgone.  The provision of counselling to help her cope with the reasons she was alone and pregnant in Ireland was not even an afterthought.  Many residents of direct provision refer to problems with shared kitchen resources, where facilities are often closed early in the evening and food is lost or stolen.  Families may be living three to six to a single room, with some people sleeping on the floor.  There is no capacity for children to play games, draw, write or even learn how to eat sitting at a kitchen table with any consistency or pleasure.  Complaints from residents are met with threats of deportation or removal to a different location.  One person faced the prospect of being moved to a container in Athlone, away from any small stability or community the individual had managed to establish.<\/p> <p> We have not offered any respect for, or understanding of, people's culture but they must meet our the expectations of our culture.  I urge the Minister at this late stage not to use the private sector as much as has been the case.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has resulted in a massive humanitarian crisis, with millions of displaced people.  We can be proud of the speedy response from people in the State.  Whole communities have mobilised to provide assistance and recent Ukrainian arrivals have already started to contribute and work.<\/p>  <p>  The challenge for the Government is to pivot from an emergency response to a long-term integration plan.  Too often, immediate solutions become permanent problems.  Direct provision was supposed to be a temporary process but, more than 21 years later, that inhumane system remains.  Many Ukrainian families are in student accommodation or hotels with short contracts.  What happens when those spaces are no longer available?  Regrettably, the Department is not moving quickly enough on offers of accommodation and potential sites for use.<\/p>  <p>  Confusion and misinformation facilitate those who want to stoke xenophobia and far-right ideologies.  Unfortunately, some Members of this House are playing the old card of attempting to pitch vulnerable groups against each other.  Linking refugees and the housing crisis is a spurious and insincere argument.  The housing disaster is a decade old and is the result of failed policies, primarily from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael but also from the Labour Party and the Green Party, involving a collapse in the building of social housing, leaving homes to fall into disrepair and facilitating vulture funds over families.  These are the causes of the housing crisis, not refugees.  We have an obligation to be responsible and factual when discussing these issues.<\/p>  <p>  Human trafficking is in the headlines today after the Olympian, Mo Farah, spoke publicly about being trafficked to the UK and forced into servitude.  Unfortunately, this abhorrent crime and human rights abuse also happens in Ireland.  The US State Department's Trafficking in Persons annual report for 2021 assessed Ireland as being a tier 2 country, which means we do not fully comply with the minimum standards but are making significant efforts to be in compliance.<\/p> <p>Even more concerning is that we dropped from being a tier 1 country in 2018 and we are now on what is called a tier 2 watch list because \"The government continued to have systemic deficiencies in victim identification, referral, and assistance, and lacked specialised accommodation and adequate services for victims\".  <\/p> <p> These findings are supported by the recent report of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, on the implementation of the EU anti-trafficking directive.  It highlights the need for greater co-ordination from the Department of Justice, new mechanisms for the identification of victims, secure gender-specific shelter and avoiding secondary victimisation in the criminal justice system.  There have been 475 known cases of trafficking since 2013, including 34 children.  Almost two thirds of these are women, with sexual exploitation being a leading cause.  Labour exploitation is the most common feature.  Crucially, this issue needs a social response.  While our criminal law aspects are strong, the systems to assist and support victims remain insufficient and lack a statutory footing.  As part of this process, the voices of survivors must be at the centre of the policy, with the establishment of dedicated survivor counselling, as recommended by IHREC.<\/p> <p> I urge the Government to use the fund to work on the issues identified by the commission, the US State Department and others to support victims and survivors.  This issue of prioritising where to spend money relates to my larger reservations regarding AMIF.  One of the fund&rsquo;s objectives is to contribute to countering irregular migration and ensuring the effectiveness of return and readmission in third countries.  Embedded in the EU's response are hostile processes and structures that facilitate crime, push vulnerable people into the hands of criminals and lead to deaths, such as the regular drownings in the Mediterranean Sea.  These are still happening, even if they do not make the headlines.  There needs to be a serious critique of migration management systems in Ireland and the EU and their role in increasing human suffering.<\/p> <p> While I welcome any discussion of these important matters, I am unclear regarding the implications of the amendment for Ireland.  This is a democratic deficit.  My comments are based on the EU&rsquo;s document, rather than on an understanding of any policy implications.  This session, regrettably, is a technical function rather than anything meaningful.  The Minister needs to issue policy papers and budget breakdowns before discussions such as this one, if they are to be anything more than tokenism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200038#PP00200","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657650600,"counter":648,"content":"<p>I will use this opportunity to speak about the reality of the EU&rsquo;s migration policy, which is not, unfortunately, in keeping with the image it would like to present to us: that of it being one concerned with humanitarianism and welcoming refugees fleeing war and persecution.  Instead, it is a consistent record of racism, of Fortress Europe and of trying to keep people out.  Often, these are people fleeing the consequences of policies adopted by countries in the West.  I refer to trying to keep those people out at any cost, including massive humanitarian costs and great loss of life.<\/p><p>What happened at the Spanish enclave of Melilla, at the border with Morocco, a few weeks ago sums up the situation.  Moroccan border guards, paid for by the EU as part of the policy of externalisation of EU borders, were managing a situation where 37 refugees died trying to flee from war and persecution.  They died either by being crushed against the fences in some cases, or, in others, by being beaten to death by those border guards, who are funded to the tune of &euro;100 million by the EU.  This is the true face of the Union&rsquo;s migration policy.  We can see the same thing when we look at the EU&rsquo;s deal with Libya or Turkey.  Massive amounts have been given to fund border guards to externalise EU borders, resulting in horrendous treatment of those trying to flee war and persecution.  Over the past five years, violations by the Libyan coast guard have been repeatedly filmed and recounted by victims and eyewitnesses, including shootings at heavily-laden inflatable boats, beatings of people during disembarkation, the throwing of petrol cans onto boats and those people then facing being detained in Libya&rsquo;s brutal detention system.<\/p><p>Even within the borders of the EU, look at what is happening in Greece.  I ask the Minister and the Government to commit to being in favour of an independent and transparent investigation into the clear breaches of EU law being undertaken by the Greek state.  Let us look, for example, at the clear policy that exists of pushbacks.  These are, as the Minister will be aware, where a coast guard or a border body of some sort push refugees back out into international waters after they have come into Greek or European territory to make them someone else&rsquo;s problem.  It is illegal, but it is a definite policy of the Greek Government.  The UN&rsquo;s special rapporteur on migrants stated that in Greece &quot;pushbacks at land and sea borders have become de facto general policy&quot;.<\/p><p>In mid-March 2022, 30 Syrian asylum seekers, including two pregnant women and seven children, were confined on an islet in the River Evros for six days following an alleged pushback operation by the Greek authorities.  Even if refugees manage to get into Greece, they are then taken into an EU-funded, so-called migration centre, worth &euro;43 million, in Samos.  This migration centre in reality is a detention centre for migrants.  According to Oxfam, approximately one in five people have been in<i><\/i>de facto detention for two months.  Effectively, it is deliberately far away from towns and villages and completely isolated.  There is excessive use of security, constant CCTV monitoring of all residents and an 8 p.m. curfew.  It is horrendous treatment and it is EU funded.<\/p><p>Let us take the example of the way those who try to act in the interests of human rights and the rights of refugees are treated, including Se&aacute;n Binder.  There are many others, but we know of Mr. Binder because he is from Ireland.  He is still facing trial.  It has now been delayed and this is part of a tactic of intimidating people from engaging in helping migrants.  For helping migrants, Mr. Binder is facing a prison sentence of up to 25 years if found guilty.  This is the reality of what EU migration policy is.  At the very least, I would like the Minister to consider or investigate the idea of supporting the Oxfam call.  It has made a complaint to the European Commission concerning infringements of EU law by Greece.  That complaint is detailed.  It has a table and goes through all the breaches one by one.  It is very long because all the breaches are long.  I urge the Minister to commit to the Government supporting an independent investigation into these breaches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200039#QQ00200","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1657650600,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important issue.  History has shown, since we have started taking in asylum seekers, that the conditions under which they have been living are not right.  Human rights issues have not been addressed.  We have placed people and families in congregated settings.  For whatever reason, we have put them in buildings where they live in dormitories.  They are isolated from communities.  It takes a lot of time to get them to a stage where they are accepted and integrated into communities.  Measures such as having curfews imposed on people to be inside at certain times of the evenings can be seen and are seen as a scandal in our time.  The Minister is well aware of the issues with the mother and baby homes and with what we are trying to deal with, and what he as the Minister has been trying to deal with.  We do not want to see anything like that happening again in our society.  At times with asylum seekers, we are bordering on doing things that are not right.<\/p>  <p>  This brings me to another concern I have.  At present, we are bringing Ukrainian migrants into the country, which is right, but we are putting them into questionable accommodation.  We are putting them into hotels and places where they have a bed and perhaps an ensuite and that is it.<\/p> <p>I know many people have offered housing and volunteered to let families stay in their homes.  The process of making sure that Ukrainians are integrated into our society will take a lot of effort.  At a time when we have crises in housing and with the cost of living, it is important in whatever we do that we deal with these people as individuals who have suffered a great deal, have been discommoded and have left their homes, families and country to come to Ireland.<\/p> <p> If we are to learn anything, we have to go back in time and history.  When our ancestors left Ireland never to return to these shores and were forced to travel to America because there was no work here, some were treated well and others not so well.  We were very upset about that.  At the same time, we should be very upset if our nation, Government and State do not provide properly for human beings coming into this country.  We pride ourselves on our generosity and on making sure that take people in and embrace strangers.  We need to go back to basic principles.  When people are coming to this county we should try to provide them with accommodation that is suitable for them to live in and raise their families and allow them to integrate into the communities that are embracing them.  A huge effort will have to made.  This debate sets out the concerns Deputies have about how we treat people coming into the country who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in a position where their lives have been turned upside down causing them to suffer enormous trauma.<\/p> <p> The other issue I have come across is that of people with disabilities and children with special needs coming to Ireland from Ukraine.  It is important that we integrate them into the services that are available as fast as possible.  We should also take into account that the services are very much stretched in trying to deal with domestic demand.  There is a lot to contemplate in this debate.  We should all work together and not politicise this issue in any way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200039#QQ00300","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657651200,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I am glad to be able to speak on this sensitive and important topic.  The issue of reception centres has been dogging us for a long number of years.  There is a centre in Carrick-on-Suir which has changed and adapted and become very good and the people in it have integrated well.  However, in times to come, I do not think history will be kind to us as a nation for the way we have treated asylum seekers in general.  That goes without saying.<\/p>  <p> We look at the legacies of the past and talk about the Magdalen laundries and other such issues but on this issue we have taken a ham-fisted and badly organised approach.  The White Paper produced in this area gave people hope that there would be changes.  It was very aspirational and very little seems to have happened.  This is not a personal criticism of the Minister.  We have seen the appalling circumstances from which people are trying to flee, including war and devastation.  We have seen graphic images of people on sinking boats and the huge loss of life.  These people walked for days and weeks and having saved whatever money they could, paid unscrupulous people who then put them on boats that were not fit for purpose.  That is traumatic enough without having to deal with arriving here and not being treated with a modicum of dignity and respect.<\/p>  <p>  I have been criticised in the past for saying we should have limits.  I say this in the context that we should cut our cloth according to measure and should look after people properly and with a modicum of respect.  As I said, we have not done that.  Private entrepreneurs got involved, some of whom were very good while others were desperate and awful.  Millions of euro have been poured into the coffers of private individuals to do this.  I know where they are and it is not far from where we stand.  In a town not far from here, by the seaside, people have been treated appallingly.  They have been put in big rooms divided into three parts and handed curry and chips in a plastic bag, with the use of vending machines at night.  It is shocking.  I wonder who is overseeing this to make sure these people are treated properly.  This is no way to treat visitors who come here.  We have travelled the world with an expectation of a modicum of support.  A lot of work needs to be done to ensure these people are treated with dignity and respect, as they must be if we are to have any self-respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200040#RR00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1657651200,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I am also glad to speak on this issue.  AMIF was set up for the period from 2021 to 2027 and funding amounts to &euro;9.9 billion.  The fund aims to further boost national capacities and improve procedures for migration management, as well as enhance solidarity and responsibility sharing between member states, particularly those providing emergency assistance.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2017, nearly 100,000 men, women and children have been intercepted at sea by coastguard vessels supported by EU surveillance and forcibly returned to Libya, a failed state.

There have been other direct provision centres over the years that have been nothing short of shocking.<\/p>  <p>  If people are in trouble and are coming from a war-torn country, we should by all means give them a welcome in Ireland but there have to limits set, especially if they are being treated disrespectfully when they come to this country.  We do not have the facilities for a huge number of people.  Unfortunately, it has been proven in the past that the management in direct provision centres has placed large numbers of families in a single bedroom or similar, which was not fair to those people.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps this fund will be used to rectify many of those issues.

I am concerned that it will only further reinforce European policies focused on externalisation, deterrence, containment and return.<\/p>  <p>  Following the mass influx of displaced persons from Ukraine, I understand the need for increased financial aid and that facilitating access to financial resources under AMIF is badly needed.  However, I am also aware that accelerated border procedures, when implemented, often go hand in hand with reduced fundamental rights, standards and safeguards.  The fund will provide &euro;500,000, which is not a huge amount and perhaps we will lose a lot more by adopting the regulations.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals put forward by the European Commission acknowledges that increased migratory pressure, including from reception and asylum processing procedures, is already being acutely felt by member states.  I am worried that by the acceleration of border and fast-track procedures, the idea of a human being will be lost.  We do not want a case where applicants are dehumanised and treated only as a number.<\/p> <p>We see the behaviour of Frontex on the European borders, especially around Greece, pushing people back into the sea in order that they do not land and are not counted among the asylum seekers entering Europe.  That is not any way I would want any agency to behave in my name, and I hope the Government is not in favour of that either, but it is happening regularly and this is an agency that Ireland is supportive of and that we fund.  That is wrong, and anything we do in accessing or accepting this funding should be specifically on condition that we are not supportive of those kinds of measures because that is a problem.  I hope the Minister will take that on board because what is happening there is appalling.  We need only see the work of Mick Wallace MEP and Clare Daly MEP in that regard.  They are highlighting the issues arising in Greece every day.  Every day we talk about asylum and we welcome Ukrainians, as we have to do, asylum seekers from Syria and Afghanistan are being pushed back into the sea and made sink or swim in our name.  That is completely wrong.<\/p> <p> There are a lot of great groups and projects which are currently funded through the asylum, migration and integration fund.  I just hope that funds are not being taken away from such groups in this proposed process.  We have the capacity to ensure that asylum seekers and migrants from all countries are accommodated in a respectful manner that has regard to their human rights.  A human rights approach should be taken towards all proposals and decisions that affect our European borders.  The proposal states that it seeks to unblock access to unspent amounts previously earmarked for specific purposes under the AMIF.  However, it does not go on to state exactly what the funds were earmarked for.  I would be interested to hear whether the Minister has an answer to that.<\/p> <p> I believe we are in need of far more transparency in general regarding these European funds.  We should be given a list of projects we are supporting to ensure all asylum seekers and migrants are treated equally under the fund and to ensure money in the fund is not used up by concentration-type camps, migrant camps and security and building companies and, as I said, for Frontex to behave in the way it does regarding migrants on our borders.<\/p> <p> I support the motion in principle.

I wish to take a few moments to restate the benefits of opting into these amendments to the AMIF programme.  The fund will help to support a broad range of programmes in the area of asylum, migration and integration in Ireland and the State's response to the Ukraine crisis.  It is my intention to build on the success of the 2014-20 AMIF programme and, if I receive approval today, to opt into these amendments.  Some of the projects to which I referred earlier demonstrate the scope, scale and benefits of AMIF funding to improve the lives of vulnerable asylum seekers, migrants and third country nationals in Ireland.  Subject to the approval of the opt-in, my Department will liaise with NGOs to support these vulnerable individuals and to provide assistance to Ukrainians living here.  Additionally, while detailed plans for the full 2021-27 AMIF programme will not be finalised until the national programme is published, it is my intention to explore ways in which the new AMIF funding can be used to implement some of the objectives in the White Paper.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies raised the issue of direct provision and our treatment of international protection applicants.  It is a subject we have discussed on a number of occasions in this House.  Concerns were raised about the implementation of the White Paper.  I will reiterate some of the progress that has been made.  Driver licences and bank accounts can now be accessed by those in international protection.  The time period within which someone can seek to work has been reduced from nine to six months.  Significantly, vulnerability assessments, which were required of Ireland under EU law for a number of years and which were not implemented, are now being offered to all new international protection applicants.  Hundreds of vulnerability assessments have taken place and have revealed the types of vulnerability Deputy Canney mentioned.  In addition, In the coming weeks we will bring forward new integration supports to support not only local authorities in the work they do on integration but also the work NGOs around the country do.  We will bring forward financial support to enhance that work in the context of supporting the integration not only of Ukrainian displaced persons but also of those in the international protection process living in different parts of the country.  Addressing that need for more accommodation and better, more appropriate accommodation, we will bring forward the funding mechanism whereby AHBs can apply for funding to deliver phase 2 accommodation.  We have been working in a lot of detail with the Housing Agency and with the representative body for AHBs to make sure we can bring forward a funding stream that is accessible to these bodies.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Cairns was correct regarding the need to pivot from an emergency response to a long-term response.  Since February of this year, we have been undertaking two emergency responses: one to the humanitarian needs of Ukrainian displaced persons arriving in our country and one to the needs of international protection applicants, of whom there has been a significant increase arriving in our country.  Since the beginning of this year, 6,498 people have sought international protection in our country.  Pre-Covid the last major year in this regard was 2019, and in that year 4,800 people sought international protection, so we are already at 160% of 2019's number of applicants and we are just slightly over halfway through the year.  There is a major migration crisis across Europe because of the wars that have been discussed here in Afghanistan and in Syria and because of the conflicts in other parts of Africa.  That is putting pressure on the system.  Our response at the moment is an emergency response.  I acknowledge that it is not always the response we want to give to people, but it is a requirement under international law to make sure that we can accommodate people and provide meals to them.  We are doing that at a time we are looking to implement the White Paper and to move on the 7,000 people who were in international protection this time last year and, of course, to support those who have obtained status to move and to live independently.  There are a wide range of challenges at play here.  The passing of this motion, the provision of this financial support, small as Deputy Pringle said it is, adds to our ability to do this.  Undoubtedly, there are major challenges in our response to these two crises, but we deal with them in conjunction with NGOs.  Earlier today, I met with the Ukraine community forum.  I have been in consistent contact with the NGOs working with Ukrainians and with those in international protection.  I will continue to engage in that process in order that we can make the best provision for both displaced persons and international protection applicants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200041#SS00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657651800,"counter":656,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space: Motion","time":1657651800,"counter":657,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200041#SS00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1657651800,"counter":658,"content":"<p>Despite the title of the motion, it is not 1 April.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200041#SS00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1657651800,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, pursuant to Article 29.5.2&deg; of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, approves the terms of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, signed by the Government of Ireland on 27th January, 1967, and laid before D&aacute;il Eireann on 30th June, 2022. <\/blockquote>  <p>Apart from the reason we are here, it is great to have the chance to focus on the great work many are doing from an education point of view, a research point of view and an enterprise point of view.

In the course of the legal and policy review undertaken by my Department, it was discovered that they were never formally approved by the D&aacute;il.  In fact, these legal matters came to light as a result of the legal and policy analysis undertaken by officials in our Department to ensure there would be a supportive legislative and policy framework in place for the future launch, maybe this year or early next year, of Ireland's first satellite, EIRSAT-1, by UCD as part of the European Space Agency's Fly Your Satellite!  programme.  I am delighted the team from UCD is with us tonight in the Visitors Gallery.  They stick out not because the Visitors Gallery is half empty but because they are in blue.  It will be a proud moment for Ireland when we can see the fruits of their work in the months ahead.  They have been very busy in UCD in recent months and I am glad they are here.  They are part of the satellite programme for EIRSAT-1.  We are joined by Ms Lorraine Hanlon, Mr. David McKeown, Mr. Gabriel Finneran, Mr. Joseph Thompson, Mr. Joseph Mangan and Mr. Ronan Wall.  I think I have covered everybody and hope I am missing nobody.  They are doing great work from an education point of view as well.<br\/><br\/>Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution requires that all international agreements that put a charge on funds be approved by the D&aacute;il.  The contingent liability that arises under these agreements is just such a charge.  As approval was not sought at the time of ratification, it must be done now.<br\/><br\/>Ireland signed the Outer Space Treaty in 1967.  The treaty is the basis on which international space law is built.  It prohibits signatory states from placing nuclear weapons in space and limits the use of the moon and other celestial bodies to peaceful uses.  It also introduces principles of state responsibility for objects launched into outer space, including those launched by non-governmental bodies.  The State signed and ratified the UN Liability Convention in 1972.  The purpose of this convention was to elaborate on the liability requirements set out in the Outer Space Treaty.<br\/><br\/>As it stands, Ireland is bound by the Outer Space Treaty and the UN Liability Convention under international law, while not complying with the requirements of the Constitution required for the domestic legal system to recognise those obligations.  That is why we are in the House tonight.  Passing this D&aacute;il motion will remedy this legal lacuna and allow Ireland to further its scientific, educational and commercial interests in space, including through the forthcoming launch of the EIRSAT-1 satellite.<br\/><br\/>Ireland's obligations concerning liability arise only when Ireland becomes what is known as a &quot;launching state&quot;.  In effect, this happens when the State launches a space object or when a space object is launched from our territory.  Ireland is not yet a launching state but that might change, hopefully sometime later this year or early next year, if a Government decision is made in this regard.  The probability of liability occurring under these treaties is so remote that the European Space Agency has informed my Department that there does not exist any precedent globally to refer to.<br\/><br\/>When originally drafted, these two agreements were designed to promote and facilitate the peaceful use of outer space.  Ireland signed and ratified them because we share these ideals, and we have always worked with our international partners, in the EU and the European Space Agency, to utilise space for educational and commercial purposes and to fund much research.  The commercial, educational and research-related opportunity is a large part of why I am proposing this motion.<br\/><br\/>Space used to be the preserve of a handful of nations and only the largest and wealthiest countries could venture into it.  However, over the past decade there has been an unprecedented escalation in the volume of space activities by small nations such as ours and more recently by the private sector.  To put this into perspective, the number of satellites launched annually has accelerated from a stable historical average of around 100 per year to a phenomenal 1,819 in 2021, having quadrupled in the past four years alone.  This trajectory is set to continue and it is right that Ireland should develop a framework such that we can benefit from a share of this growth and also be part of the educational and commercial opportunities.<br\/><br\/>Ireland's involvement in space is not well known.  When we think about space, we tend to imagine rockets or moon landings, but the truth is that space touches our daily lives much more than we realise.  It is important that we recognise that during these important debates.  A good example of space touching our daily lives is that when you need to navigate to somewhere new, satellite data enable the maps on your phone.  When you want to know what the weather is going to be like, satellite data enable more accurate weather predictions.  When you need to stay connected, satellite data enable your broadband and television services, even in the most remote areas of the world.  In addition, through the increased space activity in the past decade, more data are available on the health of our planet than ever before.  Space programmes that Ireland contributes to through our membership of the European Space Agency play a key role in developing our environmental understanding and informing climate change mitigation actions.  Satellites can measure air quality in cities and the rate of melting of icecaps, for example, and they can monitor deforestation and inform policy decisions targeting sustainable agriculture all over the world.  Critically, in emergencies such as floods or fires, satellite data can be used in real time to assess damage, supporting a safe and informed emergency response.<br\/><br\/><font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>The Government and most of those present understand the value of space and its importance in our lives in Ireland.  In May of this year, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science published Ireland's new research and innovation strategy, Impact 2030, which recognises &quot;the strong potential for Irish researchers and companies to use space applications to address climate change and other environmental goals&quot;.  The strategy commits to developing our network of research-and-development centres and facilities to ensure Ireland is at the forefront of technological advances in domains, including space, in order to embrace and respond to the twin challenges of climate and digital transition.<br\/><br\/>This commitment builds on Ireland's national space strategy for enterprise, which sets out a framework for investment and growth between now and 2025, focusing on technology transfer, commercialisation, entrepreneurship and the development of key skills to meet future needs in space and complementary sectors.  The national strategy is being implemented by Enterprise Ireland and my Department and is yielding very positive results.  The number of Irish companies in contract with the European Space Agency grew from 60 in 2017 to 94 in 2021, representing an increase of over 50% in just four years.  Many in the research community and education, such as the team in UCD, are involved in work and contracts through the European Space Agency.  That is really beneficial to ourselves as we bring forward a lot of new talent in the sector.<br\/><br\/>I can give many examples of the very diverse areas in which Irish companies from all regions are engaged.  There is a company in Cork developing a technology that will allow the verification of carbon credits, enabling revenue streams in developing countries for maintaining carbon-capturing forests.  I believe that the company might have some Kerry connections so I had better be careful to cover all relevant counties.  A company in Tipperary has developed a system that uses space data to monitor the impact of illegal dumping in watercourses.  Another company is involved in producing the paint for one of the satellites flying close to the moon.  Many Irish companies are involved in these initiatives.  Another example is that of another company in Cork that has developed a remote patient-monitoring device for use in Covid-19 patients.  This technology has been trialled in both Ireland and Italy and was found to improve patient outcomes.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, much of the investment in the technologies used in outer space is beneficial to all our lives in many aspects and through many departments.  None of the activities I have mentioned is one that we normally think of as being related to space.  The companies are working at the very cutting edge of technology development.  They have been supported to develop their technologies through Ireland's membership of the European Space Agency and through the work with Enterprise Ireland.<br\/><br\/>I am telling the House about this Irish activity in space so the opportunity for Ireland and the rationale for addressing this legacy issue will be clear.  It is incumbent on us now, as a responsible nation with growing involvement in space, to rectify the legal lacuna identified with respect to the Outer Space Treaty and the UN Liability Convention and to participate fully in the development of future standards in space that protect the peaceful use of outer space for all of us.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the House for their time.  I am happy to take any questions on the agreements and the motion moved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200041#SS00600","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657652400,"counter":661,"content":"<p>I never thought I would be hearing us speak about space, but here you go.  This is probably the longest ratification process in the history of the D&aacute;il.  The first treaty was ratified the year I was born and we are working towards approving it in the D&aacute;il now.  That is a bit of progress anyway, so we will get there.<\/p>  <p>  The cosmonaut Alexei Leonov said, \"The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic.\"  I thought of these words today as I considered these proposals.  As humankind, we have already committed terrible acts against our planet.  The penalties we are paying now are in the form of erratic weather patterns, natural disasters and the displacement of people across the globe.  Avoiding these mistakes in the great vastness that is space must be something that we can do to defend our holy relic, Earth.<\/p> <p>I welcome the debate and indicate Sinn F&eacute;in's support for the D&aacute;il's approval of the terms of the outer space treaty of 1969.  The treaty is many decades old and came into being at a time of great upheaval and change for our world.  It was signed by the then powers, at a time the Cold War was at its height and space exploration was a rallying call for the respective Cold War camps.  It was an opportunity to highlight the superiority of one ideology over another.  Without such a treaty the world would have been in great peril, with the potential of weapons of mass destruction put in place in outer space.  The State ratified the treaty long ago, with almost 100 other countries, but due to the advice of the Attorney General we must formally do so now by D&aacute;il vote.<\/p> <p> We support the treaty.  It outlines how space should be used and for what purposes.  The treaty should be updated to be gender-proofed as some of the language in the 1960s and 1970s would not be accepted today.  The treaty outlines a number of important aspects of our use of space, such as that the exploration and use of outer space should be carried out for the benefit and in the interest of all countries and should be the province of all mankind.  Another aspect is that outer space should be free for exploration and use by all states.  The treaty also outlines that outer space is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation or by any other means.  If all of these aims are protected, we will be in a much better place.  These are principles my party is happy to support.  We have some concerns with regard to the potential weaponisation of space.  The treaty makes no reference to the use of conventional weapons in that setting.  Nor does it mention any governance of the use of Earth-launched weapons to target space infrastructure.<\/p> <p> As the TV show says, space is the final frontier.  The frontier seems far less remote than it did on that famous day in April 1961 when Yuri Gagarin became the first human to enter space.  It is right and proper that laws are in place to cover its exploration and its use.  This treaty of principles has stymied efforts by those nations who may wish to colonise space.  It is an international treaty that ensures space is not the site of weapons of mass destruction.  It is a treaty with noble aims and one we should all support.<\/p> <p> Irish companies and people are playing an important role at European level when it comes to the exploration of space.  The number of Irish companies working for the European Space Agency has grown by 60% in the past five years.  Make no mistake, Ireland has a stake in ratifying the treaty.  Sinn F&eacute;in will also protect funding for Science Foundation Ireland becoming an associate member of CERN to deliver significant benefits in areas such as research and development, technology, education, training, jobs and procurement.<\/p> <p> As space travel has expanded from an activity of nation states into the realm of private enterprise, it is important that the principles of the treaty are held on to resolutely.  States must be responsible for activities regardless of whether they are carried out by the State or private companies.  They have a responsibility to ensure the use of space is not monopolised by the wealthy few.  Equally important is the principle of liability for damage caused by human-made space equipment and the environmental damage this has the potential to cause in space and on Earth.<\/p> <p> We must be vigilant regarding the involvement of private companies such as SpaceX and how it operates in space.  It has already deployed almost 2,000 satellites.  We must ensure their use is monitored.  The scale of the operation of SpaceX should be a cause for concern.  Astronauts view the Starlink satellites as a primary collision hazard in the Earth's orbit.  Environmentalists have raised concerns about the sheer volume of metal that will be burning in the atmosphere with the potential to trigger unprecedented changes to our climate.<\/p> <p> For generations many children have dreamed about going to space.  As space travel has expanded into the private realm in recent years, it is important that companies involved in such pursuits focus on ensuring they remain a diverse workforce.  As a State we can be proud of our involvement in the European Space agency.  We can be proud of the almost 100 companies from Ireland participating in space activities.  We have a responsibility to ratify the treaty and I urge everyone to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200042#TT00400","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657653000,"counter":663,"content":"<p>This has been a very unusual evening in the week prior to recess.

They have been working on the satellite for approximately five years.  I wish them the best of luck with the launch and its operation.  This will be Ireland's first satellite and it is unlikely to be the last.  There are no international regulations for the operation of satellites in orbit.  There is no traffic management system or pollution regulations.  It is up to each nation to implement its own policies and hold itself accountable.  We will never put as many satellites into orbit as the US, China or Russia but this does not mean we do not have a responsibility to legislate for the handful that we may launch.<\/p>  <p>  These treaties were landmark conventions in the space race era.  They were written at a time when activity in space was minuscule as opposed to what it is now.  Space is becoming congested.  Ever since the first days of the space age there has been more rubbish in orbit than active satellites.  As environmental consciousness has grown over recent decades we do not seem to have come around to viewing the space around Earth's orbit as part of our environment.  No one owns it and no one takes responsibility.  There are approximately 5,000 active satellites orbiting Earth.  This has increased from 2,000 in late 2018.  All have gone into the most congested level of our surroundings at the low Earth orbit.<\/p>  <p>  Sharing the space with these satellites are the remains of approximately 10,000 satellites and rockets.  Over time they are all disintegrating, colliding and being purposely exploded into debris.  Given the speed at which debris and space craft travel, any impact can be catastrophic.  Travelling at more than 15,000 mph, micrometre-size particles can chip windows or dent solar cells.  Millimetre-size paint flakes can destroy satellite cameras or puncture the spacesuits of astronauts.  A 1 cm bolt has the explosive force of a hand grenade on impact.  Anything smaller than 10 cm is untraceable.  It is impossible to predict when they might impact an active space project.  It is estimated there are more than 100 million pieces of untraceable debris.  It is essential that we are incredibly careful about what we choose to send into orbit.  All of these items will stay in orbit for hundreds or even thousands of years.  Had the Romans launched a satellite into a 750-mile orbit, it would only fall back to earth around now.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt there is a problem.  The private company SpaceX plans to launch thousands more satellites and it is not alone.  OneWeb, a communications company, has announced plans to launch its own constellation of 300,000 satellites.  Last August, researchers in the United Kingdom reported that SpaceX satellites have been involved in approximately half of all collision avoidance moves in low orbit.  In the near future, they predict this could rise to nine in every ten.<\/p>  <p>  Given the range of new private actors and geopolitical tensions, any binding international treaty is probably well out of sight.  Treaties will only get us so far.  Domestic legislation will be needed.  If something falls from space and can be identified as ours having been launched from Ireland, we have a legal responsibility.  We should not lose sight of this.  For the limited amount of space activity in which we take part, we need to have leadership.  Our activity is very limited.  I suggest to further and higher education institutes seeking to replicate the work of UCD, which I again applaud, that the area of space decluttering is where we should focus some of our efforts.  It does not look like it is happening at a global level.  It is only when it becomes a real issue and we see something catastrophic that we will realise we have allowed this to get to a point where it causes real problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200043#UU00400","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1657653000,"counter":666,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be in the Chamber to speak on a scientific topic such as this.  It is an area of great interest to me.  To paraphrase Deputy Quinlivan, space is the final frontier.  There are great opportunities from a commercial point of view.  There are also great responsibilities from environmental and peacekeeping perspectives.  I join Deputy Catherine Murphy in congratulating the UCD team.  It is a fantastic achievement.  I believe they are in the Gallery and I say well done ladies and gents.  It is outstanding and inspirational work.<\/p> <p>It took five years' work.  The team designed, built and tested and now they are almost ready to launch Ireland's first satellite, EIRSAT-1.  It is a fantastic achievement and we very much look forward to greater details on it.  It could be a precursor to something even more ambitious.  We do not have any Irish astronauts.  There has not been one yet.  We know Dr. Norah Patten has put herself forward.  She is very motivated, gives many talks and has major qualifications in aeronautical engineering.  Has Enterprise Ireland considered establishing a programme to mentor, support and subsidise Irish citizens who may be interested in becoming more competitive for the candidate selection process of the European Space Agency?  We have travelled the world.  Why do we not travel beyond the world as well?  It would be an inspirational goal for many people in primary and secondary school.  It would definitely be worth identifying, through a competitive process, ten people who would stand a fighting chance and supporting them as they continue their preparations.<\/p> <p> Most people will agree that Shannon Airport is very underutilised.  I am not sure whether consideration has been given to offering its services to the European Space Agency as an opportunity for training or even rocket launches.  It is on the west coast, close to the Atlantic and it is safe.  Rockets, such as booster rockets, can land on barges now.  There is an opportunity there if we wish to exploit it.  Many people in County Clare recognise the underutilisation of Shannon Airport and this may be an opportunity for the future.  <\/p> <p> I very much support the two motions on the outer space treaty and the liability convention.  Is there any information on where and when the launch will take place?  Will it take place in Ireland or abroad?  The reason we are discussing this matter is that it will probably impose a cost on the taxpayer.  Is there an estimate of that cost?  I wish the team every success.

Following the Cabinet's approval, the T&aacute;naiste cited space as an area of growing importance for Ireland, with the number of companies based here and engaged with the European Space Agency having grown by almost 60% in the past five years.  The outer space treaty sets out the key principles of international space law, from prohibiting the placement of weapons of mass destruction in outer space to ensuring that nations cannot make a claim of national sovereignty to any part of space.  It also requires states to be responsible for actions by their non-government entities, which is an obligation that has arisen in disputes between China and the United States over the activities of the Elon Musk-backed SpaceX.<\/p>  <p>  The number of companies based in Ireland which are taking part in space activities has risen significantly, from 55 in 2015 to 87 in 2020.  A spokesperson indicated that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been undertaking a legal and policy analysis to ensure that Ireland has a supportive framework with regard to potential future launches of space objects for commercial or educational purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland previously signed and ratified two agreements, the outer space agreement in 1967 and the liability convention in 1972, of which the latter arose from the need for effective international rules to deal with the liability for damage caused by space objects and to ensure the prompt payment of compensation.  At the time of their signing, the agreements were laid before the D&aacute;il in compliance with the Constitution.  The Attorney General has now advised that formal D&aacute;il approval is required for both agreements again.  Under national law, Ireland is party to both these agreements.<\/p>  <p>  The key provisions of the outer space treaty include prohibiting of nuclear weapons in space, limiting the use of the moon and all other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes and establishing that space shall be freely explored and used by all nations.  The treaty precludes any country from claiming any type of sovereignty over outer space or any other celestial body.  Although it forbids the establishing of military bases, testing of weapons and conducting of military manoeuvres on celestial bodies, the treaty does not expressly ban all military activities in space, the establishment of military space forces or the placement of conventional weapons in space.<\/p>  <p>  From 1968 to 1984, the outer space treaty birthed four additional agreements on the rules for activities on the moon, liability for damages caused by space craft, the safe return of fallen astronauts, and the registration of all space vehicles, respectively.  The treaty provided many practical uses and was the most important link in the chain of international legal agreements for space, from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s.  The treaty was at the heart of a network of inter-state treaties and strategic power negotiations to achieve the best available conditions for nuclear weapons world security.  It also declares that space is an area for free use and exploration by all and \"shall be the province of all mankind\".<\/p>  <p>  Drawing heavily on the Antarctic Treaty of 1961, the outer space treaty likewise focuses on regulating certain activities and preventing unrestricted competition that could lead to conflict.  Consequently, it is largely silent or ambiguous on newly developed space activities, such as lunar and asteroid mining.  Nevertheless, the treaty is the first and most fundamental legal instrument of space law and its broader principles of promoting the civil and peaceful use of space continue to underpin multilateral initiatives in space, such as the International Space Station and the Artemis programme.  It is very important that Ireland do everything we can to promote and encourage the educational use of space for future generations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200044#VV00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1657653600,"counter":669,"content":"<p>This debate has thrown up all the different types of \"Star Trek\" references and every other reference to space and space use.  I was thinking about speaking on this motion on my way down to Dublin today.  There was an item on the radio about the James Webb telescope which has sent fancy pictures back of the formation of the galaxy many thousands of years ago.  It was probably appropriate that the motion of confidence was tabled today instead of this motion because they both hark back to the past and how great it was, rather than look to the future.<\/p>  <p>  The discussion on this motion was assigned a couple of hours today when important legislation was to be taken.  It is to approve a treaty that was ratified more than 50 years ago.  It shocking that we ratified a treaty 50 years ago and we have still not put it into law.  It shows how the Government works.  I remember all of the other treaties that have been ratified and never enacted, such as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  These treaties were passed and enacted, not 50 years ago but ten, 11 or 12 years ago, and nothing was done with regard to implementing them.<\/p>  <p>  I wondered why this was being done now.  In many countries, space use is for a military purpose.  Maybe we just have to make sure we get all of our ducks in a row and ratify these treaties to ensure there is no comeback in this area in future.  The Minister of State outlined that space development has many useful purposes in peacetime but many developments in space have been done from a military point of view.  Will we see this tied in with the European Space Agency in a few years' time for something it will do with satellites for the defence of Europe?<\/p> <p>It would be interesting to see what that is.<\/p> <p> The Minister went on to say that, \"As it stands, Ireland is bound by the Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention under international law, while not complying with the requirements of the Constitution required for the domestic legal system to recognise those obligations.\"  That is a strange statement.  How can we comply with something when it has not been ratified under the Constitution, which is the primary legal article in our State?  I do not see how that complies.  It would be interesting to see what the legal situation is of any work that has gone on before now on that.  I am not saying this as a way of scuppering anything that is going on at the minute but why this is all happening now is very interesting.  It is interesting it is happening when there is talk about Ireland moving into the European defence mechanisms and everything else like that.  It will be interesting to see how this develops over the next year or two.  We will see then how it goes.  I hope much of the work that is ongoing and that is of value will continue.  I hope we will not see the Irish space agency working with the ESA on developing satellite weapons technology and stuff like that.

It is difficult to resist, when discussing a treaty on outer space, the gag about this Government living on a different planet, but I will resist it and try to take the issue seriously.<\/p>  <p>  It is quite incredible it has taken 50 years to get to the point of actually transcribing this treaty into law.  That is a pretty extraordinary fact.  The objectives and intentions of the treaty seem laudable on the face of it.  However, when I looked at what are called the depository nations where the treaty, I understand, will be deposited, I saw they are the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which is now obviously the Russian Federation, the United States of America and the UK.  That says it all.  We have a treaty that is supposed to prohibit anybody trying to claim sovereignty over outer space or to use space for the purposes of war and the depository nations for that are three of the biggest warmongers and imperialist powers in the world.  The idea they can be trusted with ensuring there are not attempts to colonise space for selfish strategic interests or to use space for military purposes is frankly preposterous.  There is zero chance of that having any meaningful effect.<\/p>  <p>  I heard the Minister of State talking earlier about the wonderful impact of satellite technology and how it helps us navigate, identify problems with the climate, deforestation and impacts on water.  It is incredible, not that the world takes much notice, most of the time, of the information we gather from this amazing technology.  However, it is also that same technology that allows the US, Russia, Britain, China or some of the other big military powers in the world to guide precision missiles to hit people from hundreds and thousands of kilometres away and blow those human beings to pieces.  That is happening all the time.  That is what the US and the UK did in Iraq with utterly devastating consequences and it is what the Russian Federation is now doing to people in Ukraine.  Indeed, those very same states are now ramping up their military expenditure, in a great irony of the discourse of such powers, by saying that to guard somehow against the horrors we are seeing in Ukraine, we must spend more on weapons and the military, as if that is not ultimately going to result in more disaster for humanity and the climate.  It is difficult, therefore, to believe this treaty is going to make any difference in preventing the use of space for this.  In reality it is being used for it already.  I was quite shocked to read Elon Musk, who is very close to the American political establishment, is the owner of 40% of the satellites circulating around the Earth at the moment.  That is one individual and he has a very close relationship with the American state.<\/p>  <p>  The other interesting issue is the space debris floating around.  In orbit of the Earth, or floating around there, are thousands of old satellites and bits of debris that have been thrown up into space.<\/p>  <p>  The objectives of all this are laudable but it is difficult to credit the idea it actually is going to achieve those objectives when you look at the states and the big corporations that are utterly dominating the use of space, as they are the main users of military technology both terrestrially and in space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200045#WW00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1657654200,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I thank the House for its support for this motion.  As the Minister of State said at the outset, the motion will resolve an issue that has been outstanding since the great era of space exploration back in the 1960s.  The motion will also help Ireland to stimulate further space activity.<\/p>  <p>  The treaty itself dates back to a radically different time when space exploration was in its infancy and the race was under way to put the first man on the moon.  However, its core aims are as relevant today as they ever were.  The treaty states international responsibility for missions lies with the jurisdictions that launches them.  It prohibits nuclear weapons in space and limits the use of the moon and all other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes only.  It says no country can claim sovereignty over a celestial body or establish military bases on them but does not preclude all military activity.  Exploration is open to all signatories and, rather quaintly, it requires that astronauts be treated kindly as envoys of mankind.<\/p>  <p>  I want Ireland to be at the forefront of cutting-edge technology, and by its very nature that must include working in outer space.  This motion will ensure Ireland is able to make further progress in this very exciting area.  Commercial space is a real growth sector.  The number of Irish companies involved in space is growing, as is the amount of activity.  Ireland has been a member of the ESA since 1975 and its governing conventions ensure it is used exclusively for peaceful purposes.  We now have 94 Irish companies engaged in contracts with the ESA, and all these companies are operating at the very cutting edge of technological development.  We are almost certain we will hit our target of having 100 Irish companies engaged with the ESA three years ahead of schedule.  ESA membership is essential for Irish companies to access expertise in space technology.  It also generates strong returns.  Enterprise Ireland estimates a return on investment of something close to 5:1 in 2025 and rising to 10:1 by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  In the long run, we may need bespoke legislation for further work in space.  Although it is not currently necessary, we are monitoring this area.<\/p>  <p>  As well as this commercial space activity involving Irish companies, there is also great work under way in education.  Our membership of the ESA has helped UCD secure the opportunity to launch Ireland's first satellite, which will be named EIRSAT-1.  I am not sure how exactly satellites are named and maybe we did not have discretion on this matter but I am a little sorry a somewhat more imaginative name was not chosen.  I suggest we might call the next one Ulysses 22, for example, in recognition of the classics and the wonderful journeys that occurred in that time.<\/p> <p>It would also be a nod to our own literary history.  As a child who grew up as a big fan of \"Ulysses 31\", it would give me particular pleasure.<\/p> <p> To date, believe it or not, Ireland is the only ESA member which has not launched a satellite.  However, we are now about to take that first foray into outer space.  It is a big and exciting moment.  That is why we need to ratify this treaty formally now.  The ESA is covering the cost of the launch, with free access to its test facilities.  The launch will be from French Guiana and the launch window is scheduled for some point between November of this year and January of 2023.  Officials are still progressing a number of legal and policy issues in advance of seeking Government approval for EIRSAT-1 to launch later this year.  It will require a Government memo for us to do so and we hope to do that in the autumn.<\/p> <p> It is a fantastic opportunity for UCD, its academic staff and students.  I recognise the presence in the Gallery of some of the EIRSAT team.  Lorraine Hanlon, David McKeown, Gabriel Finneran, Joe Thompson, Joe Mangan and Ronan Wall are all very welcome to the House.<\/p> <p> We are now finally going to join the growing number of nations engaged in satellite activity and, therefore, take our place among the nations of the world.  Hundreds of Irish people, including the Minister of State, Deputy English, and I, are looking forward to the launch with great excitement.  The passing of this motion will allow Ireland to further its scientific, educational and commercial interests in space.  I thank Deputies for their support and commend the motion to the House.<\/p> <p> I should mention that the second motion will be taken without debate on Thursday.

In direct response, there were a growing number of protest movements, some of which were very localised and included local soup kitchens and homeless tables, and others of which were State-wide, such as the National Housing and Homeless Coalition.  There were occupations of buildings here in Dublin and elsewhere as part of the Take Back the City movement.  All of that culminated in a large trade union and civil society-led movement called Raise the Roof.<\/p><p>The Minister will also remember that in 2018, 10,000 to 15,000 people, led by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the entire trade union movement, many of the country's leading housing and homeless organisations, housing rights activists and political parties from the Opposition, gathered to call for the D&aacute;il to support a motion setting out what was then the agreed position of Raise the Roof as to how best to tackle the housing crisis.  That evening, the Minister and his party colleagues, who were in opposition but supporting the then Government through a confidence and supply arrangement, supported the Raise the Roof motion.  That was the beginning of what many of us hoped was going to be a mass mobilisation of civil society and of people power to try to force a radical change in Government housing policy.  Unfortunately, the pandemic and the public health restrictions, necessary as they were, intervened and the possibility of continuing large-scale popular mobilisation was put on hold.<\/p><p>Given the very serious deterioration in the housing and homelessness situation over the past 12 months, Raise the Roof relaunched its campaign earlier this year.  The first phase was a series of public meetings around the country.  Many of us have attended those meetings, spoke at them and participated in them.  The meetings in Galway, Limerick, Maynooth, Dublin, Waterford and Navan have shown there is a public appetite to get involved again in the public campaign for a new direction in housing.  Those meetings were also, in many cases, very disturbing because people were giving voice to their very real and acute level of housing need and housing stress, in part caused by Government policy failures.  As part of the relaunch of the campaign, a range of Opposition parties have co-signed this Raise the Roof motion, which also carries the <i>imprimatur<\/i>of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the entire trade union movement, many of the homeless and housing NGOs, many housing rights activists, campaign groups and others.  We are calling for something substantial in what we want the Government not to say but to do.  I want to focus on the positives of this motion and contrast them with the gap between the rhetoric and reality of what this Government is doing.<\/p><p>At the centre of this motion is a demand for a refocusing of Government policy towards genuinely affordable homes, not measures that heap additional debt on working families to buy overpriced homes, not developer-led subsidies to lock in, if not push ever higher, the unaffordable cost of homes in our cities, and not tax reliefs for institutional investors who have a model for the development of residential stock that will be permanently unaffordable.  This is about saying the State needs to increase direct capital investment dramatically in the delivery of large volumes of public homes on public land to meet social and affordable need.<\/p><p>On many occasions, the Minister has said, and I am sure he will say it today, that is what the Government is doing and that is in its plan.  He will claim the Government is spending &euro;4 billion this year to deliver the largest public housing building programme in the history of the State.  First of all, the Government is not spending &euro;4 billion on public housing this year.  Anybody with eyes to read can look at the voted capital expenditure in the most recent budget.  The Government is spending less than half of that.  It is claiming that averaged expenditure, including approved housing body, AHB, borrowing and potential expenditure by the Land Development Agency, LDA, four, five or six years into the future, can be booked as &euro;4 billion of expenditure this year but that is not what is happening.<\/p><p>Likewise, the Minister is telling us that the social housing programme this year will be the largest in the history of the State.  That is not factually accurate on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis or indeed on a real expenditure basis.  Given that the Government has only actually delivered just over 600 social homes between the new-build programme and Part Vs in the first quarter of this year, which is not far off the delivery figures for last year, it is hard to see how that will develop.<\/p><p>Other colleagues will use their time to talk through the other elements of this motion but we are urging the Government to realise that unless it starts to deliver the 20,000 public homes a year it promised during the election campaign and quickly abandoned thereafter, this crisis is going to get worse.  That is the key to tackling this crisis and it is the central element, though only one of many, in the motion before us today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200046#XX00400","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1657654800,"counter":679,"content":"<p>I listened to the debate on the motion of confidence in the Government, and Ministers and Deputies from Government parties, one after another, rolled out and talked about the great work the Government is doing to deliver housing and all the start-ups.  The fact is that in my 14 years in politics, it has never been as bad as it is now.  This is not just Sinn F&eacute;in talking; all of the Opposition are saying the same.  It is not just us.  It is also the Simon Community, the Peter McVerry Trust and the Cork Penny Dinners.  Any of the charities that deal with families who are in homeless or emergency accommodation or need supports will say the same.  Thirty-eight families and people have come to me because they will be evicted by Christmas.  The Government's answer is to tell us about start-ups.  People do not care about start-ups; they care about homes.  The Minister and the Government are not delivering homes.  People are becoming homeless under the Government's watch.  The homeless figures are rising.<\/p>  <p>  We spoke during the debate on Covid-19 about how a ban on evictions would work, and it did work.  However, the minute the Government got the opportunity to do so, it lifted those restrictions and now we have a situation where more and more people are becoming homeless.  At one time, homelessness was for people who might have problems with addiction or with their mental health.  Now we have families with one or two people working who cannot put a roof over their heads.  How is that possible in a society where people are working in good jobs?  It is not just me saying this.<\/p> <p>These are the facts.  The Government has failed.  It is in power more than two years now and we have seen the homeless, housing, social housing and the affordable housing crises get worse.  We have seen private purchase and cost rental get worse as well.  It is all under the Minister&rsquo;s watch.  The Government has failed, and that is why we are supporting this motion.

However, it is not if you are a student looking for affordable accommodation.  We are hurtling headlong into an accommodation crisis for students like we have never seen before.  It is the biggest barrier to third level education today.  This is especially true of students in rural areas.  Many end up having to commute extraordinary distances because they are unable to secure any accommodation.  The on-campus projects are being shelved because colleges are rightly unwilling to advance projects that will deliver accommodation that is far too expensive for the majority of students.  We already have student accommodation in public universities that cost &euro;1,300 and more.  We desperately need a student accommodation strategy, in partnership with colleges and students' unions, delivering genuinely affordable accommodation for students on or near campus and greater protection for students in digs-like accommodation.<\/p><p>I want to turn to Mayo.  There are only 22 properties to rent in Mayo.  I want the Minister to hear the story in the headlines in <i>The Western People<\/i>of Niamh O&rsquo;Malley, who, with her autistic son, is at risk of homelessness because she cannot find a property for less than &euro;1,500 per month, which is all she can afford.  She cannot find one.  She says:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI work hard and mother harder.  It is society who has failed us and the cards I've been dealt.  I'm not looking for pity.  I wake up every day and night and search for homes.  I feel the fear in my belly and yet I still mother.  I still show up every single day.  I'm not ashamed to share my story.

During the Minister&rsquo;s time in this Government, rents have increased by 15% and house prices by 22%.  It is disgraceful.  Homelessness has increased 19% in the lifetime of this shambolic Government, particularly considering there was a moratorium on evictions during lockdown.<\/p>  <p>  For ordinary workers and families, having a decent home at a decent price is a goal that has been ripped from their lives because of decisions by others and policies of successive governments that failed them.  The number of households living in rented accommodation has doubled in two decades.  The number of these households that are purely private renters - those not paying rent to a local authority or receiving State supports - has tripled.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and others in government have deliberately created this change.  In those 20 years, from 2001 to date, Government has spent over &euro;12 billion in support of a private rental market, be it through the housing assistance payment, HAP, leasing, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, or any of those schemes.  Against the best interests of ordinary people, successive governments have reversed the successes of previous generations and put those successes out of the reach of this and future generations.  An ESRI report states that between the 1950s and 1960s, fewer than 20% of people lived in private rental accommodation in their mid-30s.  Of those born in the 1980s, it is now more than 40% living in private rented accommodation.  That is mirroring the decline in home ownership.  Government parties to date have supervised, supported and encouraged that 180 degree turn.  I do not remember any election posters promising a return to lifelong renting or ending the possibility of home ownership, but that is what the Government has done.  It is crystal clear that what people want and what the Government is providing has become completely polarised, and ordinary people are suffering horrific consequences.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier today I heard the Taoiseach speak about the potential for landlords leaving the market.  I want to ask a very specific question.  Why is it that local authorities are now refusing homeless supports to families who abide by their notice to quit?  Where a family leaves on the final date of their notice to quit, local authorities are refusing to provide them with homeless supports and are encouraging them to break that notice to quit and overhold, because if they do not, they will not get any help from anywhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200047#YY00300","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1657655400,"counter":683,"content":"<p>In the two years this Government has been in office, we have seen spikes in rents, house prices and the number of people presenting homeless.  We have seen Government policy repeatedly failing to do what was promised, with Ministers more concerned about representing the views of the big developers and the hedge funds.  Corporate landlords are being treated as the State&rsquo;s golden goose, with the Government showing little concern for people who are struggling to keep a roof over their heads.  The shared equity loan scheme, which has been widely criticised by everyone from the ESRI to the Central Bank, is a concrete example of a policy that will put people into more hardship.<\/p>  <p>  According to the Daft report for quarter 2, average house prices in Dublin Bay North are above &euro;390,000.  This morning, I had a look at Daft and there were 23 rental properties available in Dublin 5, Dublin 13 and Dublin 17.  If a person is lucky enough to be able to get one of these, he or she is looking at paying a minimum of &euro;1,800 a month for a one-bedroom apartment.

In Limerick recently, the first and biggest public meeting since the easing of restrictions was held.  I have no doubt the rally taking place on Saturday will be big as well.<\/p>  <p>  The housing market in Limerick is broken.  I want to talk to the Minister about three specific issues we have there.  The first is about renters.  Anybody who has a constituency office like I do will know there is something noticeable with every single person who comes in at the moment, and that is the envelope in their hand.  You know exactly what it is before they even give you the envelope.  The envelope is the notice to quit.  I have never seen so many of them.  The homeless services tell me to see them.  If a person is approved for social housing, there is no RAS property available in Limerick.  There simply is not one there.<\/p>  <p>  I looked at Daft this morning and there were nine properties available.  There is a one-bedroom apartment on Thomas Street in Limerick city centre for &euro;1,800 a month.  If that does not tell the Minister how broken the market in Limerick is, nothing will.  If a person has a notice to quit and simply has nowhere to go, there is no emergency accommodation in Limerick, and Limerick City and County Council told me that.  Providers of homeless services have told me that for a number of weeks, that there is no emergency accommodation available.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding people who work and might have a job, a small income or whatever and earn slightly over the limit, the income thresholds to get a social support have not changed since 2011.  The Minister has been talking for a long time about doing something on that, but we have been waiting and waiting and have not seen anything come in on that.  A family of two adults and children in Limerick has an income limit of &euro;36,000.  If the adults have any sort of a job, they are not getting any supports.<\/p> <p>I support the aims of Raise the Roof.  It is an important campaign that will build as it goes on.  Among its aims are a ban on rent increases and an emergency ban on evictions, bringing vacant homes back into use and holding a referendum on the right to housing.  We can do better, but only if the Government has the political will to do so.

Generations will bear the brunt of the crisis it got this country into, but it has learned nothing.  Fine Gael subsequently facilitated the selling out of families and invited in cuckoo and vulture funds.  Those traditions continue today, no matter what spin the Minister and others tried to put on this situation earlier.  The fact that since the Government came to power, the number of homeless adults in County Tipperary more than doubled shows the extent of the Government's failure.  One does not hear Deputies and Senators from Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael trying to sell those figures in their constituencies.  Do they know how many people are sleeping in cars in County Tipperary this evening, or how many kids are in a different house each night?  They do not know because those figures are not collected.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in warned the Government that lifting the ban on evictions would lead to this tsunami of homelessness, but it would not listen then either.  To take the example of the Tipperary-Cashel-Cahir municipal district, there are 841 people on the waiting list, with five council houses available.  There are 16 properties available to rent in the entire county - the biggest inland county - which has a population of more than 160,000.  Meanwhile, the Minister and his constituency colleagues remain intent on following the failing housing plan.  Does the fact that 184 children in the mid-west and south east are homeless indicate a successful policy, as the Government tried to spin today?  The Taoiseach spoke earlier about how well his Government has done.  Does that include the fracturing of families or the rise in mental health issues?  Does it account for no affordable houses being built in County Tipperary in 2021?  I recently asked the Minister if he was prepared to allow councils to take emergency measures to address the housing crisis.  I got an unrelated stock response.  It is shameful.<\/p>  <p>  We have a broad campaign calling for an increase in direct capital investment in public housing, real action to use vacant homes, an emergency ban on evictions, a ban on rent increases and measures to cut private rents.

<\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank the Deputies for tabling the motion to allow us to have a further discussion on housing and the current situation in that regard, which is, without question, difficult.  What has not been recognised is the two years that we have come through, with two significant construction shutdowns that did affect output.  Most reasonable people would recognise that has had an impact on delivery.  Thankfully, our projections are that we will deliver on our target of 24,600 homes this year, even with the current difficult inflationary environment and the supply chain issues that have occurred, mainly due to the war in Ukraine.<\/p><p>What is interesting about the motion tabled by the Opposition is that, straight away, it calls for the delivery of 20,000 social homes per annum.  We are going to deliver 8,000 to 9,000 new build social homes this year and, on top of that, other homes that I will discuss momentarily.  That is more than 10,000 social homes.  What has not been addressed by any of the Deputies who have spoken thus far on the motion is the capacity of the sector to deliver that number of homes.  All present are aware that one needs people to build the homes in order to deliver them.  I can advise Deputies that, thankfully, the capacity within the construction sector now is above pre-pandemic levels.  We need a workforce to deliver those homes.  The Deputies opposite have on many occasions raised their desire to see 20,000 social homes delivered in one year.  What is never said is how long that will take, where they will built or by whom.<\/p><p>The Government's plan, Housing for All, which is &euro;4 billion of investment in social and affordable housing, sets out clearly the trajectory of how we increase social housing supply in every county.  That is happening now.  It may not politically suit some people to recognise the basis from which we started.  There were ten or 12 years of undersupply, particularly on social housing.<\/p><p>I am acutely aware of the challenges that we face, particularly in the area of homelessness.

It has to be about increasing supply across all tenures - social housing, affordable housing, private housing and rental housing.  Deputies have referenced the lack of rental housing on the market.  Some Deputies have bemoaned the amount spent on HAP.  I think it was Deputy Mitchell who referred to the &euro;1 billion being spent on HAP and RAS payments.  That is supporting more than 60,000 families with direct rental payments.  We have seen a reduction in the increases in HAP in the past two years and that is what I want.  I want to see people transition out of HAP into permanent social housing.  What is the suggestion of the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, however?  Is it that we stop HAP payments?

We need to go further.  To March 2022, we had the highest number of residential units completed since 2011.  That is 22,219 new homes.  It is not possible to go from 20,000 homes to 40,000 homes in 12 months.  If the Deputies opposite are telling people they can do so, then they are lying to them.  It cannot be done.

The first applications are being approved and on top of that we are going to deliver the first affordable purchase homes, through local authorities, in a generation with purchase prices starting from &euro;166,000.  We will deliver that and build up supply.

The reality is that the housing crisis is as a result of political choices.  That is why we are where we are.  There is no denying that.  It is because of political choices made by the previous Government, which the Minister supported, and by this Government.  I am sure the Minister knows of, and everyone in this Chamber faces, the situation where every Monday at my clinic the key issue that comes through the door is housing.  To be honest, it has become increasingly difficult to find any kind of solutions for the people coming in the door.  Much of the time the people have notices to quit.  We know there are rising numbers of notices to quit and the best the council can say to people is to apply for the housing assistance payment, HAP.  The reality in Galway city, and I cannot speak for anywhere else, is that there are no rental properties available, let alone anything within the HAP limits.  What are these families to do?  We know the figures and the huge increase in the number of people who are in emergency accommodation.  The reality for these people is that being faced with this prospect is a huge and terrifying shock for them.  They really have two or three options.  They can try to get emergency accommodation, much of which is substandard.  I have seen the photographs from people who come to my office.  They can try sleeping in their parents' sitting rooms or maybe on a friend's couch but that is all they have.  It is getting worse.  I hear about it in my clinics.<\/p>  <p>  On the points the Minister in regard to affordable housing, I would love him to come to Galway city and bring us the affordable housing.  This is not about me wanting to win this argument.  I do not want Sinn F&eacute;in to win this argument.  I want the Government to deliver.  For years we, in Galway city, have been hearing talk about an affordable housing estate.  We are told that the earliest it will be delivered is 2024.  It will not be enough for all the people who ask me if they can get an affordable house.  To be clear, I am sick of hearing Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies telling me that we object.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been objecting in Galway for years.  The Minister should maybe check that out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200049#AAA04000","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1657656600,"counter":742,"content":"<p>The Minister mentioned facts.  Here are some facts.  The percentage of young people under 35 who can buy their own homes halved between 2005 and 2015.  We all know that this is in freefall.  The average cost of a one- to three-bedroom home in County Laois has increased by 9.9% in the past year to &euro;225,000.  That average includes one-bedroom homes.  In County Offaly the average cost was pushed up by 8.6% to &euro;230,000.  High rents are imposing serious hardship on workers and families.  In the past 12 months, the average rent in County Laois for an apartment or a house increased by 10.5% to a whopping &euro;1,169.  There was a massive increase in County Offaly of 14.6% to an average of &euro;1,158 per month.  Government housing policy is failing renters.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned HAP.  Any increase in HAP payments would be welcome but the problem is that you need a rent freeze to go with it because it results in chasing high rents.  Rents go up when HAP payments increase.  The Minister will know that if he checks the history of what happened the last time.<\/p>  <p>  A recent check on availability in counties Laois and Offaly showed that only four long-term lets were available for rent in County Laois.  At the same time, there were 57 Airbnbs available.  The picture in County Offaly is similar with only three long-term lets available, but 53 short-term Airbnbs.  The Government has to change tack.  The recent census shows a huge increase in population in both counties, similar to the rest of the State.  The supply of housing is not keeping in line with that.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned supply.  Supply on its own will not do it.  I want to see increased supply of private, affordable and social housing but I remind the Minister of when his party was in power and it crashed the housing market and the economy.  More than 90,000 homes were built in 2006.  What happened in 2006?  House prices shot up.  The Government needs to changes its approach.  It needs to bring in a rent freeze.  In particular, the rent pressure zones are not working.  In Laois-Offaly, only the Tullamore, Portlaoise and Portarlington-Graiguecullen districts have them and they are not working in those districts.  Half of the constituency has no rent pressure zones.  The delivery of affordable to purchase and cost-rental homes needs to be ramped up significantly to deliver genuine affordability, and accelerated provision of new housing schemes is also needed.  According to the census, 48,000 long-term homes were vacant.  There are a further 45,000 rentals lying empty.  We need a vacant property tax to bring those back into use.  We need to end speculation by taxing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200049#AAA04100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1657657200,"counter":743,"content":"<p>Our Uachtar&aacute;n was right.  This is no longer a housing emergency; this is a housing disaster.  I was there when he spoke in Naas in my constituency in north Kildare last month and his words really crackled like electricity in people.<\/p><p>One person who lived those words is a spokesperson for Focus Ireland, Ms Kelly Anne Byrne, who addressed us in Maynooth last week at a Raise the Roof public meeting.  She was electrifying too but it was traumatic to have to listen to her - she has given me permission to speak here about it.  Ms Byrne spoke of the chaos, the terror of not having a place for herself and her children as a young mother, and how her life and the lives of her children changed dramatically once they found a decent place to live.  I wish the Minister could have heard her speak of the small, but essential, joy it is to be able to come home and to close your door on the world and enjoy your dignified private life in your dignified private space.<\/p><p>The difference between Sinn F&eacute;in and the Government is that we believe that housing is a right.  It is a right to be secured under a referendum and a right to be enjoyed regardless of income because every person needs a home.  Only in this State and the absolute state the Government has made of governing, hard work, a good job, a degree, a deposit, savings and a mortgage are no longer enough to buy a home.  Thanks to too much Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, one now needs a wealth fund or an inheritance to buy a small three-bedroom semi-detached house.  By what measure and in whose world is that progress?  This is unfair.  It is unsustainable and unjust to the hardworking people who only want an affordable home to rent or buy, if they are happy to pay.<\/p><p>There is a certain political mindset in the Government that believes some people get free houses but the only people getting free houses in Kildare are the developers.  The local authority hands back the houses to them after a 25-year lease, all paid for and all redone at the taxpayers' expense, with the tenants homeless again.  No society gets away unscathed from treating so many people so badly while at the same time protecting and venerating the privileged few.

I am not the first Deputy to repeat the following figures: a 15% increase in rents, a 22% increase in house prices and a 19% increase in homelessness.  We have all probably taken a look at Daft.  Across Louth, there are 18 houses for rent.  In Dundalk, the corresponding figure is nine.<\/p>  <p>  Anecdotally, in relation to issues I try to deal with, a number of my party's councillors on a day-to-day basis are engaging with people and trying to find solutions.  Of course, we use everything available, including the housing assistance payment, HAP.  We are waiting for the 35% and the other changes, that the Minister is talking about, to happen as soon as possible because that will get us some time until this fixes but we know we are all operating in a dysfunctional system that will not get any better until we deal with the supply issue, .  It is exactly as Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell said.  It is getting worse.  Every time we deal with this issues, more people come in to us.  People who never would have come in with regard to housing issues are now coming in.  They are finding themselves in absolutely dreadful situations.<\/p>  <p>  I have spoken specifically to the Minister about anomalies in relation to HAP and how people who should be able to get a payment cannot get it.  We need to introduce some element of flexibility or we will only put more people into homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  It goes without saying that we must do the basics.  We must protect renters.  We did some of these pieces of work during the pandemic.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility to do so again.  We know that we will only do real business when the State engages fully and we look at figures, such as the need to deliver at least 20,000 social and affordable homes per year, including cost rental.  The fact is, if one talks to Mr. Tom Parlon and others from the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, they say they are solution-focused if they have targets that they will do all in their power to deliver.  It cannot be beyond the realm of possibility to do what has been done previously.  We have no choice.

That is the day I have had with the people with whom I have been dealing and I am glad this motion is being debated tonight.<\/p><p>I am also glad it is being debated on the same day that we had this showpiece debate late this afternoon which, quite frankly, did not show this Parliament in its best light considering the depth of this housing crisis.  The Chamber was full for almost two hours.  It was a breathtaking display of barracking, one-liners, jokes, heckles, arrogance and detachment.  Anyone with whom I or many of us dealt today, in the past week or the last months, anyone on the housing list and anyone who is waiting for an offer letter to drop onto his or her letter-box floor but who will probably get a notice to quit before he or she gets an offer letter would say, were he or she watching this afternoon, that there is no combination of groups in that Parliament that will be able to resolve this housing crisis.  This motion is timely in that it comes so quickly after that.  It is a good motion.  It is coming from a cross-party, cross-political NGO group that is speaking to the heart and the complexity of this housing crisis, which, too often, we do not get to the root of in this Chamber, and we have seen an element of it already in this debate this evening.  It does a disservice to the people that we all purport to be representing.<\/p><p>The Minister has gone all in on Housing for All as his policy.  Nearly two years into the term of this Government, at most there are three years left.  At present, it is hard to see how Housing for All would be delivered for all.  That is the reality.  It seems to be housing for those who can afford it and profits for those who can build it.  I am not seeing it.  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell said it earlier.  Even six months ago or a year ago, if anyone came to one of my clinics, at least one would have a couple of options for them.  Sometimes that option might be only to help people look through <i>daft.ie<\/i>, to telephone rental agencies or whatever the case may be.  Now it seems those ways of helping are being diminished.  With the Covid protections now unwound and with there being no rent freeze and no ban on evictions, we are seeing the notices to quit drop at a rate that is quite frankly frightening.  We are not building houses quick enough.  We are not acquiring houses.  They are not coming on.  Whatever the method of supply, and we can argue over the method, they are not quick enough to meet the standstill target we have.  That target is getting bigger and bigger every day with the rate of notices to quit.<\/p><p>The level of private rental accommodation available is minimal and the short-term rentals are soaking up a large number of homes in our cities and towns.  I have yet to find any value in or any good about Airbnb as to why it exists.  It is anti-worker.  It is anti-standards.  It is contrary to a fair housing system.  These gig economy superpowers, such as Airbnb and Uber, are global behemoths with a substantial amount of resources.  They do not build a house and in the case of Uber it does not own a car, but they undermine absolutely everything.  It is the worst form of capitalism with a glossy progressive branding that is tricking the rich part of the world into believing that it is engaged in something that is somehow helpful because it might be saving a few bob.  It is killing the rental market.  Any hope we have of having supply for long-term rents is being absolutely undermined by the likes of Airbnb.  There is not one reason I can think of that that company should be in existence.<\/p><p>The price of a home is moving further and further out of reach for multiple generations.  I will never forget one of the first presentations I ever attended here from the trade union movement in the audiovisual room.  A representative from the Mandate trade union said that 20 or 25 years ago someone who worked on the bakery counter in Superquinn who married someone who worked in the local shoe shop, if they worked and saved, and it was never easy, would be able to afford to buy a house.  Now we know that if the baker in the local SuperValu is married to or in a relationship with a person who works in the shoe shop, all they could hope for is social housing and they would have to be 13 or 14 years on the list.<\/p> <p>The reality is that because the income limits have not changed, they may be 13 years on the list.  We are all getting it now.  They are so long on the list and they see it incrementally going up and up, then they are in the offer zone and, bang, they are asked for their income details.  Two low-paid people in a couple might be on &euro;43,000 and they are ticked off the list because they are over the income threshold.  Those income thresholds have not changed in over a decade and they need to change to reflect the reality.  We cannot trust the housing list when people are being knocked off for having low incomes which are above those income thresholds.<\/p> <p> Rents have increased by 15% and we have heard the figures on homelessness, with 5,000 single people, 3,000 children and 1,366 families in homeless accommodation.  During a cost-of-living crisis, the loopholes that exist in the rent pressure zones have allowed these funds to contribute to this problem by charging exorbitant rents of &euro;2,140 per month for a one-bed apartment up to &euro;5,220 a month for a three-bed apartment.  When someone comes into my clinic and says they have found something for &euro;1,800, and I find myself saying it is good value, it shows how crazy it is.  That is where we are.  We are not seeing anything ticked down in a structured manner.  The Minister said that we have had commencements and supply and that people are going to build, but given the tragedy that is happening now, we are not seeing any evidence of it working.  We are just seeing prices go up and up.<\/p> <p> The next six months is going to see this crisis taking off to a whole other level.  More than anything else, the struggle to find affordable accommodation is in part due to the fact the Government is refusing to regulate these cuckoo funds in recognition of their increased dominance in the housing market.  We see it in every constituency, we know where they are, we know the developments and we can see them pushing out existing tenants who may be on legacy rents so they can get new tenants in at the market value as it exists right now.<\/p> <p> We know the power of the State when it acts.  We know the State can introduce a rent freeze.  It has done it before and it should not take a pandemic to do it.  What the Minister is doing instead is spending &euro;560 million on the help-to-buy scheme, which has helped some people but, as shown by the Oireachtas Parliamentary Budget Office, was not needed by a third of those who availed of it.  The &euro;450 million Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme is essentially a slush fund for those who have squatted on prime development sites instead of developing them.  We have handed over millions to these developers to build to their own timetable and to apportion out these schemes and these phases in order to continually push up the price.  Anyone could set their clock by it - phase 1 will be expensive, phase 2 will be more expensive, then phase 3 and phase 4.  That is how they do it and nothing the Minister has brought in is going to stop that.<\/p> <p> Last September, the Labour Party brought forward a comprehensive renters rights Bill to limit the multiple excuses used to evict families and to enshrine long-term tenancies.  We have seen no changes in that regard.  The two words the Minister seems to most hate are &ldquo;rent freeze&rdquo;, which is a real, tangible measure that could help to reduce the burden of rent bills, along with a ban on evictions.  The argument is beyond being made that they have to be brought in.  We need urgent action on Traveller accommodation and the implementation of the Irish Refugee Council proposal on emergency accommodation for all refugees.  In the budget, the Government can also show its willingness to tackle the rental crisis by increasing taxes on REITs, IREFs and the speculators.  Again, none of us have any sense that is going to be done.<\/p> <p> It is quite a depressing day all round to be bringing this debate here but it is much needed.  We need to have a more sophisticated debate on housing.  We need to put the people who are in housing distress first every time we are in the D&aacute;il.  As we come out of Covid, we are seeing those notices to quit fall like an avalanche on people's doorsteps over the course of this blistering hot summer in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis.  This winter, when people are not able to afford heating, food or medicines, they will be in an even longer line outside the homeless offices of our local authorities all over the country.  It is a shame that we are there but, based on my experience, that is exactly where we are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200050#BBB00300","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657657800,"counter":747,"content":"<p>I am happy to support this motion from the Raise the Roof coalition.

It is not clear if the Minister thinks it is not possible to do that.  I do not understand how the Minister feels it is possible to do 24,000 homes this year yet we could not have 20,000 of those as social, affordable and cost rental homes.  If we have the capacity to build 24,000 homes, including many that will be owned by investment funds, how come we do not have the capacity to do that?  Some of them will be high-end and high-rent.  If we have the skills and the labour in Ireland to build 24,000 homes, how come we do not have the skills and the labour to ensure that 20,000 of those will be social, affordable and cost rental homes?  It makes no sense whatsoever.<\/p>  <p>  The issue with a lot of housing policy in Ireland is that there are far too many measures that are stimulating demand, pushing up prices and pushing up rents, and not nearly enough on the affordability side, and on the affordable supply side in particular.  Long-term leases are doing that, HAP is doing that, the shared equity scheme is doing that and acquisitions are doing that because they buy out of a limited pool rather than putting enough resources into affordable supply.  That is the issue.<\/p>  <p>  I really wonder if the Minister is serious when he cites uptake in some of these schemes as proof that they are working.  That should not be a sign of success.  The fact we are in a crisis and a disaster situation, and that people are understandably going to whatever supports or schemes are in place, does not mean those schemes are a success or the best use of scarce resources.  If that is how the Minister and the Government are measuring the success of their housing policy, we have another problem in housing because that is not the way it should be measured.  The way the Government should be analysing this is by asking what is the effect of the different schemes we are doing and whether this is pushing up house prices, pushing up rents or increasing the supply of affordable homes.  Those are the questions they should be asking, not whether people in a desperate situation, who are either renting or looking to buy, are availing of whatever schemes are made available.  Of course, they will do that.<\/p>  <p>  One of the things that we did not hear from the Minister in his comments, and that I was hoping we would hear because we need to hear it from the Minister and the Government, is what action they are going to take urgently and now to stop the absolute disaster of us reaching record levels of homelessness in the coming days.  We need to hear what the Government is going to do about that now, today, urgently.  It should be top of the list for all of us to be asking that question and we have not heard that.  There needs to be immediate emergency action on that right now.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach, the Minister and other Ministers constantly make this claim that there is &euro;4 billion in State capital expenditure on housing.  It simply is not true and there is no such figure in State capital expenditure on housing.  In fact, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage heckled and interrupted my party colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy, when she referenced this earlier today.<\/p> <p>There is no &euro;4 billion State capital expenditure on housing.  That is a highly misleading claim.  This year, less than &euro;2.3 billion is being set aside by the Government for capital expenditure on housing, which is just over half the &euro;4 billion to which it keeps referring as being the claimed expenditure.  Simply including possible Land Development Agency, LDA, expenditure and loans to the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, issue to bring the total expenditure up to &euro;4 billion is misleading.  It is not the level of direct capital expenditure that was called for by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  This is an issue that goes across the board and does not just apply to housing.  There is a danger the Government will begin to believe its own spin in this regard.  The more it does so, the further we will be from solutions.<\/p> <p> There are three tests that apply when assessing how we are doing on housing.  First is the supply and availability of housing that is affordable, second is home ownership rates and third is the level of homelessness.  On the first test, there were zero affordable purchase homes delivered last year, despite all the promises that were made.  Just 65 cost rental homes were tenanted.  We can contrast that with the thousands of apartments in the ownership of investment funds that were built to attract high-end rents.  We can contrast it with the reports this week that Greystar, which already charges rents of between &euro;2,140 and &euro;5,220 per month in Dublin, is seeking double-digit rent increases.  That is the reality of what has happened with much of the new housing supply that has come on stream.  Rents have almost doubled over the past decade and we have had the third highest rent increases in the EU since 2010.  Rents in Dublin are among the highest of any capital city in the EU.<\/p> <p> Home ownerships rates, as we know from information provided by the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO, have collapsed among people of working age.  We have had a report from the ESRI indicating that the number of 25- to 34-year-olds who own their own home has halved in the past 15 years.  That is absolutely shocking.  As people become older, poverty levels will increase substantially as they will not have the security of owning their own home.  The Government talks about its support for home ownership and that is all fine.  In fact, what is happening now is that home ownership levels are continuing to decline.  Last year, the number of new-build homes that were available for individuals to buy plummeted to fewer than 6,000 individual homes.<\/p> <p> There is a lack of urgency in the Government's response to the crisis.  In 2017, Fine Gael in government promised to implement a tax on vacant homes to help to bring them back into use.  It still has not been introduced.  That should be done now; in fact, it is one of the measures we should be taking in the D&aacute;il this week.  We should forget about the rushed changes on planning that mean An Bord Plean&aacute;la cannot be held to account in the same way it currently can be.  Why not bring in a vacant homes tax this week, especially given the rental crisis, the homelessness crisis and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures showing there were 35,000 rental homes, making up 20% of the total rental stock, lying empty on census night?  If that tax were brought in as an emergency measure, it would go some way to helping the situation.<\/p> <p> I do not think the Government grasps how serious the situation is.  It knows there is an issue but it is not grasping the knock-on effects it is having across society.  We now have parents withdrawing from the workforce because they cannot get childcare as their childcare providers are reducing capacity as a consequence of their staff being unable to find anywhere affordable to live.  We are seeing the same effect in schools.  There has been a massive impact on the hospitality industry, with businesses simply not opening or operating on reduced days and hours because they cannot get staff.  There are huge knock-on impacts but we are not seeing an urgency from the Government to act to address them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200051#CCC00600","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657658400,"counter":753,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Boyd Barrett.

I wonder whether the Minister has ever thought for one minute that the current housing policy and others that preceded it are and were wrong.  I would like somebody on that side of the House to say, \"You know what, I think we have got it wrong.\"  I am not getting that sense and I do not think it will ever happen.<\/p>  <p>  To deal with the housing crisis, we must look at what happened 20 years ago.  There is a historical legacy of commodification and marketisation of homes.  In fact, it is a basic need of human beings to have shelter.  This discussion is like Groundhog Day because we are now in a situation where 10,000-plus people are in emergency accommodation.  There is a crisis in regard to the provision of rental accommodation and affordable housing and those issues are only going to get worse.  Several speakers alluded to the tsunami of notices to quit, with a huge number of people in line to be homeless come the autumn.  Those figures are going to go north rather than south.<\/p>  <p>  This situation is completely untenable and unacceptable.  One factor relates to the operation of the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme in the rental market.  HAP rates are nowhere near market rental rates.  Even in the case of the homeless HAP scheme, the amount of money that is being given to private landlords is obscene.  In many cases, they are charging up to &euro;2,400 per month for a home.  These people should be wearing balaclavas because they are robbing the State.  Some of the homes are not worth &euro;2,400 by any means.<\/p>  <p>  This is both a historical legacy issue and a contemporary issue.  It comes down to policy, choice and the decision to look at shelter as something that is all about the monetary value.  This is not new.  It has happened in Britain and elsewhere around the world, where speculators, or robbers, speculate on property.  That is the situation in which many people find themselves.  Homelessness and the housing crisis affect everybody at this stage.  It is not the classical situation where it is just about the people who are homeless and living on the street.  That is not the situation at the moment, if it ever was.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent general election probably was the most important election for a generation.  It sent a message to Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, which have been ruling the country for the past 100 years, that people have had enough and are not going to take any more when it comes to public services, particularly housing, that are inadequate.  It is the reason many people who voted for the Minister of State's party are now turning away from it.  The housing crisis will be the key factor in the next general election, whenever it happens.  If the Government does not address the issues we are talking about today, the parties in government will pay a heavy price.  People do not forget the misery they have endured.  Some have had to emigrate and others have had to go into emergency accommodation.  It stays etched in people's minds that they have seen their children go into emergency accommodation.  It is unacceptable that in such a wealthy country, more than 11,000 people have been allowed to end up homeless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200052#DDD00400","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1657658400,"counter":756,"content":"<p>The Minister suggested that some of us are just playing politics with this issue and we do not really want to see the housing crisis improved because, somehow, there is some political benefit to us from its persistence.  I do not know whether he is just saying that to play politics or if he actually believes it.  I say to him that it is absolute nonsense.  <\/p> <p>I can tell him that I absolutely dread going into my clinic on a Monday and a Friday because of the misery I have to face when families and individuals come in, one after another, who find themselves in absolutely hopeless situations.  I have lost count of how many of these situations I am dealing with, where over the next few weeks, a month, or couple of months, people are going to be made homeless because their landlords are selling up and there is nothing else for them.  There are no council houses, no HAP properties available and now no emergency accommodation.  There is not even emergency accommodation.  As dreadful as that thought is, people are now scrambling for such emergency accommodation.  It is utterly hopeless, and it gets worse.  <\/p> <p> There are so many different aspects to how much worse this situation has got.  Rents have gone up by more than 100% in the last decade and average rents in Dublin are now more than &euro;2,000 a month.  In my area in the past six months, average monthly rents have been &euro;2,600.  That is completely unaffordable for the vast majority of people.  In the same period that this has happened, the number of people eligible for social housing support has dropped because the Government refuses to raise the income thresholds for social housing eligibility and support.<\/p> <p> There are so many different things I could have asked the Minister, but he has run off.  I will ask him again tomorrow, for about the 50th time, when he is going to raise the social housing income thresholds.  He promised me on at least three occasions in this House that we would be told the answer to this question before the summer recess.  We are now going on recess, however, and there has been no answer to the question.  The result is that again this week, just as there was last week, the week before that and the weeks before that, families who have been on the housing waiting list for up to ten to 12 years, and 15 years and 20 years in many cases, will be taken off that list.  All those years waiting will count for nothing.  Not only will those people now never get a council house, they will not even be entitled to the HAP.  If people are not on the housing list, then they cannot get HAP.  Therefore, if people get a pay increase or a promotion and their income goes just a few quid over that threshold, then they are goosed.  They will have no chance of being able to afford something.  These are people who are working but who will have no chance of being able to buy, no chance of being able to pay these rents and will not now even be entitled to social housing support.<\/p> <p> We were told that a report has been sitting on the Minister&rsquo;s desk since December 2021.  Why has he not come into the House and told us what is in that review?  Why?  He promised us that he would do so.  He has sat on that review since December and he has not brought that information into the House.  Of course, however, we know the answer.  This is a conscious strategy that has been pursued for five years to reduce the number of people eligible for social housing support.  This is to reduce the numbers and to reduce the bill.  This is what is going on.<\/p> <p> Thankfully, the ESRI has quantified all this.  In 2011, 47% of households were entitled to social housing support.  This is now reduced to 33% as of 2019, and it is probably considerably lower now.  The ESRI's figures only cover the period to 2019.  Therefore, when rents are higher than ever before, when more and more people need help with the rent or social housing, fewer and fewer people are entitled to avail of those supports.  It is a stealth cut of the nastiest kind and it is directly contributing to massive housing lists.  This is why the Minister has run out.  We do not get an answer to this question.  I have asked the Taoiseach again where this report is.  I know I am not going to get an answer from the Minister of State either.<\/p> <p> If there is no other reason why I have no confidence in this Government, it is this: I was promised that we would have the review by now.  I know what is going on.  The Government wants to reduce eligibility for social housing.  That is a fact.  The Government wants to make everybody pray to the flipping market and to the same crowd who are building all these special housing developments, SHDs and build-to-rent apartments.  Half of them, as we discovered from Killian Woods's report at the weekend, are in flipping tax havens, not paying tax and dodging tax and making a fortune out of the human misery in our rental crisis and the Government does not want to do anything about it.<\/p> <p> I will conclude on this point.  Apart from all the stuff in the context of this motion, which I obviously support, here is something simple that the Government could do now.  Regarding all those SHDs, do not take 20%, take all of it.  There is no justification for putting stuff on the market now at these kinds of rental prices.  Take every bit of it.  We will be paying for it anyway with HAP.  If we got those properties into public hands ourselves, however, then we might actually make a dent in the homelessness crisis and in the housing emergency we are facing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200052#DDD00500","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657659000,"counter":758,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to discuss what is the most pressing issue for many families and young people.  I heard many people talking tonight about what is wrong, what the problems are and what people are suffering.  I come across these aspects in my constituency.  Many people might think this is a city-based problem.  In fact, it is experienced right across rural Ireland as well.  Young people are not getting a chance to build their own houses or to get mortgages to buy houses.  They are stuck in this bind.  At the other end of this situation, people come into my office who have applied for social housing and have found that the thresholds are so low that they cannot get onto the ladder.<\/p>  <p>  Taking Galway County Council as an example, the income threshold is lower in the county than in the city.  People therefore try to get onto the city's local authority housing waiting list, but they must prove that they have a link to the area and all this kind of thing.  Those people are going around doing paperwork without getting any place with it.  It is very stressful.  A woman contacted me today who has until 28 July before she must vacate her house because it is being sold.  She has two children who are aged one and four.  She is a single mother.  She is in a bind and her only recourse is to go to the homeless services and God knows where she will end up from there.<\/p>  <p>  When we come back to why involuntary landlords are selling houses or whatever, there is a problem in this regard.  People may own a house they wish to sell.  It might be their second house or they might have ended up with a house by default, perhaps by inheriting it or whatever.  They may have been renting that house and now want to sell it for family reasons, etc.  These things will happen.  We need to find solutions to these kinds of problems.  The basic problem is supply.  The Northern and Western Regional Assembly undertook a survey where it was found that there were 44,500 vacant properties in its area.  Those almost 45,000 vacant properties are there to be taken in and made use of for people to live in.  Most of these vacant properties are in our towns and villages where the communities could do with additional people living in them.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Minister may be bringing forward some sort of a grant scheme worth &euro;30,000 per house for first-time buyers of second-hand properties or vacant properties.  We in the Regional Group called for this measure in the last budget.  We were led to believe that it would happen.  It is beginning to happen now, almost a year later.  One of the frustrations concerning housing is that decisions are slow to come and when they do come, another year has passed and the situation has worsened.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest problem with new builds from the perspective of the local authorities is that we have a huge issue with trying to get projects to the stage where they can go to construction.  I have no doubt but that the construction industry can build all the houses we need.  We can use innovative techniques.  We talk about modular homes and the use of precast and timber-framed elements.  That is the easy part of it.  It takes up to six years to get a project from inception to the stage where a building contractor is appointed to undertake the work.  The building stage is the easiest.  Until we face up to the fact that housing is an imperative issue of overriding public interest, take the planning process and bring in a fast-tracked approach to building social housing, we will still be talking about the housing supply issue in five years&rsquo; time.<\/p> <p>We need to look at the planning and procurement processes that are in place for public works.  We need to look at the public spending code and set these things aside, because a plethora of appraisals and approvals are required throughout a process, which can hold up projects for months on end.  I am bringing forward solutions.  This is not a criticism.  We need to act on this quickly if we are to increase the number of social houses being built.  Above all, we must make sure that local authorities are properly resourced so that they can manage their housing stocks, turn around the vacant properties as fast as they can, and build houses quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200053#EEE00200","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657659600,"counter":760,"content":"<p>I welcome the work of the Raise the Roof campaign and I was delighted to attend its launch in Meath not so long ago.<\/p>  <p>  From Phil Hogan, to Deputies Kelly and Coveney, Eoghan Murphy and now the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, we have been told that there is no overnight fix to the housing crisis we are in.  However, it is now more than a decade since we first heard that excuse being used in the Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  I have three constituency offices.  We are inundated with housing issues.  Like many Members in this Chamber, I have heard many horror stories in terms of the housing crisis that is engulfing so many families.  Housing is in the worst state it has ever been in.  I have heard the Government blame different factors for the housing crisis.  I have heard it blame Covid for the lack of supply.  Let us be honest, in the first quarter of 2021, Ireland was the only country in Europe that closed building sites.  Ireland, which had the worst housing crisis in Europe, was the only country to shut down the building of homes for three months.  No other political party mentioned that issue in the Chamber today.<\/p>  <p>  During the earlier motion of confidence in the Government, the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues majored in the points that Opposition Members are refusing to bring solutions to the housing crisis to the table, which is grossly untrue.  We in Aont&uacute; tabled a Bill that would end the tax advantages of real estate investment trusts, REITs, and reduce the competitive advantages they have when they compete against first-time buyers.  We tabled a Bill that would end the ability of Airbnbs to function in towns and cities with a population of 10,000 for a period of three years.  Overnight, this would increase the supply of long-term lets by thousands for families in the State.  We have been urging the Government to get real when it comes to vacant property taxes.  The Minister has refused to talk about such taxes for years.  We have demanded that homes which remain vacant for long periods of time be taxed properly to get them back into use, and to ring-fence and invest that money into the vacant properties so that they are in good shape for families to use.  Despite the urgency of all of that, house taxes are still referred to in the future tense by this Government.<\/p>  <p>  We in Aont&uacute; urged the Government to use NAMA land to build thousands of social homes, but the Taoiseach refused to do it.  He made the argument to me in the Chamber that building social homes would go against NAMA&rsquo;s mandate.  He said that NAMA&rsquo;s job was to protect the taxpayer and that this was underpinned by legislation.  First, the Government can change the legislation as well as NAMA&rsquo;s mandate so that it can build social homes.  Second, more than 70,000 families are in receipt of rental accommodation scheme, RAS, payments and the housing assistance payment, HAP, in this State.  The taxpayer is paying private landlords every month for the use of 70,000 homes.  The Government is paying private landlords &euro;1.3 billion every year for RAS and HAP when it could be using that money to build public and social housing.  The Government is not protecting the taxpayer in any way in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Aont&uacute; set out a plan to increase of the number of apprentices.  We proposed a vacant site tax that would actually work.  The last vacant site tax that the Government brought in raised &euro;29,000 in its final year.  Never before has a tax cost more to draft than what it collected in a given year.  It is absolutely incredible.<\/p>  <p>  I carried out research into the level of vacant State buildings and land.  I found that there are hundreds of State-owned buildings throughout the country and thousands of acres of Government land that are actually vacant while we are in a housing crisis.  The HSE is the worst offender.  It has 137 unused buildings or vacant land.  Our analysis showed that the Thornton Hall site, which was bought by the Progressive Democrats to build a big prison a number years ago, is still being used to grow spuds because the Government has not got it together to use it for the community.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been boasting about full employment, but let us remember that under its economic model, many families with both parents working cannot afford to buy a house or rent a home in their area, and that is a fault with its economic model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200054#FFF00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1657659600,"counter":761,"content":"<p>I am in the D&aacute;il since 2016 and, since then, I do not know how many times we have spoken about housing.  I often think that if a couple of dozen houses were built every time we spoke about housing, there would not be a housing crisis in the country but, sadly, there has been a lot of talk with nothing happening afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  This motion is about Raise the Roof.  I would like to talk about putting in foundations before we even get to the roof and that is a sad situation in which we find ourselves.  Many young people who are trying to start off in life do not want a social house.  They only want to borrow a bit of money so they can build a home for themselves and their family.  However, every obstacle has been put in there way and every county development plan that comes along puts another obstacle in front of them.  It is sad to think that many young people end up on the social housing waiting list, a list which the Government has promised to shorten, for as long as I have been a Deputy, but it has gotten longer.  We have a massive crisis in building houses, with young people trying to get planning permission for their homes.<\/p>  <p>  I also mention sites that are in towns and villages throughout the country.  I always believed in having a proper rural regeneration programme but the Government would not even consider providing an incentive to people, who are struggling to get homes in the cities, to move to rural Ireland.  They are good people who deserve a home.  Sadly, that was always refused.  There is not a great incentive at present.  There are great communities in west Cork, including Ballinspittle, Ballinadee, Ballydehob, Schull, Ardgroom, Eyeries and Drimoleague, fine places that have great community centres, schools and sports clubs that could easily cater for all the people.  Unfortunately, there is no great incentive to move people into the communities that are badly in need of new life.<\/p>  <p>  We have a crisis in Clonakilty, west Cork, where no building can take place because there is a lack of water.

The Ceann Comhairle visited Ukraine and will appreciate what I am saying.  I do not mean to disparage the people coming here.  They are coming here out of want and necessity, and it is our duty to help them if we can.  We always help people to the best of our ability.

I am very glad that they have found refuge and are safe and that there are no bombs coming down upon them and their children.  That does mean, however, that there is unreal pressure out there at the moment.  I have seen people come into clinics who are going into homelessness and into homeless shelters and centres, where they do not want to go but where they have to go.  There is a massive lack of availability of housing now, and the fact that we have an uncapped number of people coming here because of the war in Ukraine is, of course, compounding the problem.  What I have always stated - and it is in the interest of the people we have - is that we should have a serious debate on capping the numbers.  If you cannot help people properly and adequately, you should let them know that.  It would be fine if we had endless accommodation.  Then I would suggest that as many as possible come here.  Why tell people to come here, however, if we will not be able to cater for them?  So many people do not have places to go to now that it is a major worry.  We have people sleeping in cars who would never have had to do so before.

The fact that in our local authority last October we had 162 vacant houses, many of which have not been brought up to the standard at which they can be allocated, says something.  The Government needs to do something about that.  It needs to give the local authorities adequate funding to bring such houses back to the standard it is asking the local authorities to bring them to.

I got a call about it because there are now vermin perching there and threatening the people next door.  Householders and landlords want to get out of letting properties.  Why?  That is the big question.  There is a reason, and the Government has to suss it out because many of them are getting out.  The Government cannot make them stay because they have problems.  As for planning permission in the Killarney electoral area, where people want to build homes themselves and put a roof over their heads, half the total area of the electoral area is sterilised on one side by the national park, where people cannot build, coming out onto the national secondary roads from Rathmore to Killarney to Killorglin, and from the county bounds into Killarney.

For 38 years Askeaton has been waiting for the Government, the previous Government and the governments before it to put infrastructure in place to stop raw sewage going into the river.  Dromcollogher, the Deel and Hospital have been polluted by the local authority.  I am talking about areas such as Glin and Foynes.  Does the Minister of State want me to keep talking about all the pollution that has been done to our county because of lack of infrastructure?  We have been waiting for infrastructure.  What does infrastructure mean?  I will tell the Minister of State.  If you have proper infrastructure, including sewerage and water, you have houses.  If you have houses, you have sustainable business, sustainable sports clubs such as GAA and soccer clubs, and sustainable schools.  That is what infrastructure means.  However, this Government, the Minister of State's partners in the Government and the previous Government have not invested in infrastructure in County Limerick.  We have had a junior Minister in Limerick County for 15 years, with nothing returned for Limerick.  We have another junior Minister who celebrated ten years recently, with nothing returned for the area he is elected for.  That is not a good record.

People in County Limerick are sick of it.  We want our families to return to our county.  We want infrastructure that basic humanity needs and that any person should have.

We keep going with the policy that the market will provide and, when it does not, we will use taxpayers to make it provide at enormous cost, with absence of security of tenure and a dire emergency.<\/p>  <p>  I am so tired listening to my own voice on this that I will quote from documents.  When the Minister was here he accused the Opposition of being against homeownership and said that his policy is to encourage homeownership with various schemes, which have been found utterly defective.  My time is limited but I will quote from an ESRI report published in July 2022.  It is an interesting document.  It notes that there has been \"a notable decline in homeownership and a rise in the proportion of households in private rental accommodation\".  It goes on to state that \"Ireland has experienced a marked drop in homeownership rates\" and goes on to give the specific figures, which are substantial.  That fully contradicts the Minister's statement that his policies have led to homeownership.  That is clearly not the case.  In the report there is a very interesting statistic.  The authors talk about poverty later in life among people who do not own their own homes and the increase in such poverty, particularly among women.  The report points out research that was carried out across ten member states, including Ireland, which found that neither generous pensions nor high ownership rates had the strongest poverty-reducing potential.<\/p> <p>What had?  Lower poverty rates in older age were most strongly associated with the provision of social housing for older people.  That is an interesting fact in the middle of the research.<\/p> <p> Let me look again at the Simon Community report because I have a little more time than I had earlier.  Directly consequent to the Government&rsquo;s policies, Galway city has absolutely no properties available.  There are very few for rent and absolutely none in the county or city within the HAP criteria.  Even if you allow for the increase in the discretion, there is nothing available.  The study was carried out in June over three days.  It is called a snapshot.  It is the Simon Community&rsquo;s 37th report.  Worse the situation has got.  The Simon Community, which has no axe to grind, is setting out the facts and figures for Galway city and county and the rest of the country.  Those are the facts, so any sensible, intelligent Government &mdash; maybe these do not go together; I do not know &mdash; would say the policies are not working and will have to be reconsidered.  That is not happening.<\/p> <p> A point was made on NAMA.  NAMA has been a huge part of the problem considering the remit it was given.  It was praised for carrying out that remit, which has artificially, along with HAP and all the payments enshrined in law by the Labour Party and Fine Gael in 2014, but particularly the HAP, ensured the prices of houses and rent would remain astronomically high and simply unaffordable to everyone.  The latest is that the young teachers trying to get jobs in Dublin cannot stay in Dublin because there is no accommodation, yet we persist with making silly personal comments across the floor as if we were standing here just for nothing.  All the time, we are doing what we do on behalf of our constituents on the ground, yet we cannot even get a meeting with the local authority; we have to do it by email.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200055#GGG01000","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657660800,"counter":774,"content":"<p>Recently, both the Minister responsible for housing and the Taoiseach claimed progress was being made in the Government&rsquo;s so-called Housing for All plan.  This claim flies in the face of reality given the actual statistics concerning any area covered by the plan.  We have a new homelessness emergency on top of the existing crisis.  It is a crisis within a crisis, which was partly abated by the ban on evictions during the Covid-19 lockdown.<\/p>  <p>  The number of homeless families grew by 11% in 2021 over 2020.  In Dublin last year, 30 families became homeless every week.  A total of 786 children have been in emergency accommodation for over a year, affecting their schooling and mental health.<\/p>  <p>  I have raised this issue already and I am sure the Ceann Comhairle is sick and tired of me raising it in the past couple of weeks.  Last year, 3,038 households renting were served a notice to quit, mainly because the landlords were selling up.  I cannot understand why the Government is not alarmed by it.  It was the highest number of evictions of tenants in a single year since the foundation of the State.  The trend has continued unabated into this year, but now we know there is another problem on top of it because the family support unit, in response to queries from our office, has said it is at capacity.  There is no room in the hubs; they are full.  No rooms can be got in hotels or B&amp;Bs.  Now we have the quarterly report of the Simon Community, Locked Out of the Market, which states there is not a single property to rent for families with one child identified anywhere in the country based on the standard HAP rate, and just 12 were available on the basis of the discretionary rate.  There are now officially 10,335 people nationally in emergency accommodation.  In May, there were 7,200 adults and 3,000 children.  In October 2019, there was a record number in emergency accommodation: 10,500.  The Simon Community has said the number will be surpassed in the next two months while we are on holidays.  There will be no opportunity for the Government to intervene if this becomes worse over the next eight weeks.<\/p>  <p>  This is not progress by any stretch of the imagination, as far as I am concerned.  As stated in the Private Members&rsquo; motion, there is an urgent need to reinstate the eviction ban and introduce rent freezes.  I appeal to the Government to achieve this because, in the next eight weeks, families will be in a worse situation.  Whatever hope there would otherwise be of getting them somewhere, there will be none.  Therefore, there is an urgent situation developing.<\/p>  <p>  On every front, Housing for All is failing to meet the targets set.  A target of 33,000 new builds was not met in 2021, 2020 or 2019 and is unlikely to be met this year.  Last year, there were 20,433 new units built.  That is 12,000 short of the target.  An important question is: How many of these 20,000 were actually affordable?  Not one affordable one was actually built.  Just 65 cost-rental units were actually built.  Construction of new apartments was up 30%, to just over 5,000, but they were mainly built to rent and were extremely unaffordable.  Two-bed apartments were being advertised in Dublin at &euro;2,250 per month.  That is 72% of take-home pay on an income of &euro;50,000, which a large majority of working people do not earn.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to so-called social and public housing, only 3,144 units were built out of a target of 9,000.  Even then, 2,000 or so of these were not actually built by local authorities or approved housing bodies; they were given over by private developers under Part V agreements.<\/p>  <p>  In the private rental sector, rents are continuing to rise.  They were up by over 8% in 2021.  The rent caps are not working as new or refurbished properties are exempted.  One could say the Government&rsquo;s rent caps were designed not to work.  Despite Government claims of progress on security of tenure, as long as landlords can evict on the basis of selling or refurbishing, or of a family member moving in, there will be no security of tenure for renters.  We now have the Minister asking Departments to look at land in their possession with a view to getting permission to build and then selling it on to developers in the continuation of a housing policy that has failed miserably through its reliance on the private sector.  I fully support the motion from Raise the Roof and thank Sinn F&eacute;in and the others that have signed it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200056#HHH00200","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1657660800,"counter":775,"content":"<p>I thank everyone who has contributed to the debate while I was here.  As already indicated by my colleague Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, the Minister, much is being done by the Government to address housing supply and homelessness.  I assure the Deputies in the House of the work done to date.  The Government is committed, through Housing for All, to over 200 actions designed to tackle housing issues.  Increasing the supply of housing is at the centre of Housing for All.  This includes major direct investment in social and affordable housing, reforms to ensure the availability of land, measures to support the viability of development and ensuring sufficient investment and capacity to support housing construction.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All is backed by a &euro;20 billion State investment in housing to the end of 2026.  It gives certainty and stability to those who want to finance and build homes.  Addressing homelessness continues to be an absolute priority of the Government and my Department in particular.  Resources and funding are not obstacles to the urgent efforts required.  There is a &euro;194 million allocation for homelessness services alone in 2022.  This funding ensures that local authorities can continue to provide emergency accommodation and other essential support services to households experiencing homelessness, while also ensuring that pathways out of homelessness for those households in emergency accommodation are secured as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to the reduction and prevention of homelessness and last year signed the Lisbon Declaration on the European Platform on Combatting Homelessness.  Many of the actions in Housing for All directly address this, including the expansion of Housing First, the development of a youth homelessness strategy and the establishment of the national homelessness action committee.  To secure more tenancies and prevent new entries into homelessness, thus relieving pressure on emergency accommodation, we have increased the HAP discretion rate to 35% and allowed local authorities to apply a couple rate to single-person households where required.  The proposed measures to strengthen the regulation of the short-term lettings sector, which have been approved by the Cabinet this week, will lead to a return of much-needed properties to the long-term rental market, further preventing entry to and increasing exits from homelessness.<\/p> <p> The first home shared equity scheme is open for applications to support 8,000 affordable purchases by 2025, primarily for first-time buyers.  The first home scheme will help applicants exit the rental market and achieve the stability and security of affordable new homes through the use of an equity share model within the designated regional price ceilings to target starter homes.  The Cro&iacute; Conaithe city scheme will bring apartments forward for development, delivering much needed additional supply in cities.  We believe that demand for owner occupation of apartments in these city locations is strong but cannot be met because of the viability gap.  We have been pragmatic in recognising the barrier to apartment construction that the viability gap presents and have worked to bridge it and kick-start the construction of much-needed apartment schemes.  These will provide much-needed homes as well as facilitate compact growth and create vibrant livable communities in our largest cities.  Meanwhile the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe town scheme will support regeneration in our towns and villages, with further details on the scheme to be announced later this week.<\/p> <p> It has been more than a decade since State-led affordable homes have been built.  Building new social, affordable and market supplied housing is key.  Adding to the supply of housing is at the very heart of our Housing for All strategy.  We are pressing ahead with delivering new affordable housing to meet the clearly identified need.  A total of 234 cost-rental homes had been tenanted as of the end of June.  A total of 65 were delivered in 2021 and a further 169 have been tenanted so far this year.  The development of the cost-rental sector from a concept to an on-the-ground reality is a huge step forward.  We intend to scale up this tenure type to ensure we provide tenants with secure affordable options.<\/p> <p> The LDA is working to deliver on its social and affordable housing mandate.  The contractor has been appointed for the development of 597 new cost-rental affordable purchase and social homes at Shanganagh, County Dublin, with work on site to commence in September.  Work will also start at St. Kevin's site in Cork this year.  Planning permission has also been applied for in respect of four other sites which are expected to yield close to 2,300 units.<\/p> <p> Vacancy is being addressed through a number of measures, including the rural regeneration and development fund, the introduction of a vacant property tax, the reforming of the fair deal scheme and expansion of the voids programme.  Tenants are being supported through the extension of notice of termination periods, the introduction of tenancies of unlimited duration, the requirement for landlords to inform the Residential Tenancies Board when serving a notice of termination and the capping of rent increases at a maximum of 2% in rent pressure zones.  Actions on housing for older people, those with a disability and Traveller accommodation, including sectoral specific plans such as the national housing strategy for disabled people 2022 to 2027, are being progressed by means of pathway 2 of Housing for All.<\/p> <p> Indicators show the Government's 2022 housing targets will be met, with more than 22,000 new homes completed in the 12 months to the end of March, increases in commencement notices month on month and residential planning permission applications increasing by more than 22% over a 12-month period.  The fourth progress report for Housing for All will be published this week and reflects the significant progress that has been made towards overall reform of the housing system and delivery of measures to accelerate the supply of homes in the short to medium term.<\/p> <p> As Deputies and campaigners know, homelessness is a very complex issue in which casual factors and family circumstances vary considerably, as do the type of responses that are needed.  Homelessness is interrelated with other areas in the housing system and with broader social and healthcare policies and service delivery.  A whole-of-government approach is required when dealing with this huge challenge.  Housing for All is this approach, and we will continue to work to house everyone.  For those who have left homelessness, we must work to ensure that, where needed, families and individuals are supported to sustain their tenancies.  This is important work that needs to continue.  We must also ensure that families and individuals remain in their homes and do not re-enter homelessness.  All of these supports are essential to tackle homelessness.  If we work together in co-operation and collaboration we can reverse the trend of rising homelessness.  I thank all of the organisations involved in helping those at risk of homelessness.  We will all work together to continue to drive our actions in Housing for All, which will be critical to the success of the strategy.<\/p> <p> The issue of infrastructure has been raised in the debate.  Irish Water is doing significant work.  A critical point on infrastructure is that it takes significant capital funds to unlock it.  We know that Irish Water competes for funding with various Departments, including those responsible for transport, health and education.  As I travel throughout the country I see the demand is great.  There are sites that were environmental flash points where wastewater was getting into our water courses.  These had to be worked on urgently.  There are also remediation schemes throughout the 31 local authority areas.  Unfortunately, at the height of the Celtic tiger era, developments failed and remediation schemes had to be established.  There is significant demand in rural towns and villages throughout the country for the infrastructure to unlock the development of homes and increase the capacity.  We are working hard to do this but it will take time because the call to do so is significant.<\/p> <p> People have to be realistic about the funding streams and the revenue raised to deliver these actions and the competing interests.  I acknowledge that Deputies have mentioned dealing with the public in their clinics.  I acknowledge it is very challenging.  It is very difficult.  I meet constituents at clinics on a weekly basis and I try to assist them with housing options.  As I have said in the House in recent months, there is significant hope given the increase in commencement notices, which are above 30,000.  This is strong evidence of builders on site delivering homes.  I can see it in my community as I look around.  There are four or five significant large-scale sites.  They will assist in providing secure tenancies for all our citizens.  This is what collectively all of us in the House are trying to achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200056#HHH00300","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657661400,"counter":777,"content":"<p>It is important to see the support this motion has from many Opposition Members.  It relates to housing, which has been one of the main political issues of this D&aacute;il.  It is appropriate that we table this comprehensive motion in the last week of the term, when the Government's targets are not sufficient to meet the housing disaster ahead of us.  This is an issue that affects every constituency in Ireland.  In County Wexford alone the latest house prices and rent prices have increased by 14% on what they were this time last year.  The trend is putting hard-working people in the impossible position of never owning permanent homes.<\/p>  <p>  People are one paycheck, one price hike or one notice to quit away from being back in their parents' box rooms or, in the worst scenario, on the streets.  Every day I receive emails and phone calls from constituents looking for affordable places to rent, affordable housing or social housing.  They are just not there.  It breaks my heart to know that what we can do is limited and that the Government's policy will ensure these issues will continue.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most difficult aspects of the housing disaster is children and homelessness.  There are 5,054 single people, 3,028 children and 1,366 families who are homeless as we speak.  Children who have experienced homelessness are more likely to have health problems, go hungry, experience development delays and have higher rates of depression, anxiety and behaviour disorders than other children.  These children can spend three years or more in bed-and-breakfast accommodation.  Other children are in direct provision centres for ten years or more.  These are our most vulnerable children and the Government is fully aware of these facts.  It is time to sink or swim and support the Raise the Roof campaign led by the trade union movement, housing rights activists and all those young hard-working citizens who are brushed aside from owning their own homes by vulture funds and the wolves of the stock market.  The budget must be used to deliver a major shift in housing policy.  It must focus on affordable homes and increase direct capital to deliver at least 20,000 social and affordable homes, including 4,000 cost-rental homes.  The Minister must not fail another young generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200057#JJJ00200","speaker":"1621"},{"type":"speech","time":1657661400,"counter":778,"content":"<p>I do not believe that people fleeing war and savagery are responsible for people sleeping in cars.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200057#JJJ00300","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1657661400,"counter":779,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200057#JJJ00400","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1657661400,"counter":780,"content":"<p>That was mentioned earlier.  It has been happening for years in this city.  There are plenty of houses but unfortunately they are in the wrong hands and they are being used for the wrong purposes.  Child homelessness is endemic once again.  There are more than 3,000 children without a place to call home.  This is the official number.<\/p> <p>We do no know how many are sharing box rooms or sitting rooms at night, with their parents, in homes of other family members, or just staying with mammy's or daddy's friends.<\/p> <p> This Government has been in power for two years.  Fine Gael has been in power for 11 long years.  Under the combined rule of these parties, rents, house prices and homelessness have all skyrocketed.  None of this is by accident.  It was not always the way, but Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are wedded to the idea that private development is the only path forward.  The ideal of the State providing housing does not gel with their world view.  The result is 3,000 homeless children.<\/p> <p> They are even warning now of a housing crisis for pensioners on the horizon.  The Government reacted with shock and surprise, but what did it expect when home ownership or housing stability is just a pipe dream for whole generations of Irish people?  More than 80,000 vacant homes have been identified in the census.  Think of the impact we could make on homelessness figures if even 10% of those could be brought back on stream.  However, the Minister for Finance has fought tooth and nail against bringing in an effective vacant property tax and we have a Government that is best friends with the speculator and developer, while children go without a roof over their heads.<\/p> <p> Most of the solutions coming from Government have caused more damage.  The so-called help-to-buy and shared equity schemes only served to pump more money into an already broken system, raise house prices further and create a system where only investing firms can afford to swoop in and hoover up properties, while workers and families give up the dream of ever owning their own home.<\/p> <p> Budget 2023 must deliver a radical shift in housing policy, as demanded by the Raise the Roof, homes-for-all campaign.  We have to tackle the speculative investment in land and land hoarding.  We must end outrageous tax reliefs on rents and capital gains for institutional cuckoo and vulture funds and there should be a referendum to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200057#JJJ00500","speaker":"1571","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657662000,"counter":782,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  The problem is that there is a void at the very heart of the Government's housing plan, which is the lack of an ambitious public housing delivery programme, based on the level of need that is out there.  Even if the Government meets its social and affordable housing targets, which I do not believe it will, it will come nowhere close to meeting existing needs, let alone growing, emerging and future needs.<\/p>  <p>  The reason I do not believe the Government will meet its targets is that of the 9,000 newly built social homes that were to be delivered this year, just over 600 were delivered in quarter 1.  That is roughly the same as the same quarter last year, when there was lockdown.  Even the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, started to use the figure of 8,000, today, rather than 9,000.  Maybe he is gently breaking the news to us that the targets will be missed.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, made reference to the cost-rental targets.  Some 169 have been delivered to date this year, of a very low target of 700.  Clearly, it will be a challenge to even meet the 700 by year's end.  Some 700 is nowhere near enough.  With regard to the affordable purchase side, the target is 450 to 500 and none have yet been purchased.  Some are close, but they are in the tens, not in the hundreds.<\/p>  <p>  That is why this motion centres around the need for a minimum of 20,000 social, affordable rental and affordable purchase social homes.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, asked where the homes would come from.  Of course, if he had read the motion, he would have gotten some indication.  We have tens of thousands of vacant homes.  If local authorities were given a dedicated financing stream to purchase those properties, up front, for social or affordable use, we could turn many of those around.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing Part V, not just for land bought from this year, but for planning permissions on land that had been bought previously, would deliver more social and affordable homes.  With 90,000 planning permissions out there and a nervousness among the private sector, because of construction sector inflation for starts next year and the year after, a more assertive turnkey programme for mixed-tenure, social, affordable, rental and affordable purchase estates could combine to yield a far greater output.  The money and planning permissions are there.  What is lacking is the political will.  We also need urgent action for renters.  Rents cannot continue to rise at the rate which they are currently rising.  Renters need the crucial relief of a three-year ban on rent increases, as well as putting one month's rent back in their pocket.<\/p>  <p>  However, this motion also talks about a number of other issues, some of which are the direct responsibility of the Minister of State.  We still do not have enough urgency with the implementation of the 32 recommendations of the expert group on Traveller accommodation.  I know many people are doing considerable work, but the outcome is key.  When we look at what is happening throughout the State, we are still seeing many local authorities not spending their Traveller accommodation budgets, or spending it on anything other than the delivery of new, culturally appropriate accommodation.  The acceleration of the implementation of that report is key and, in particular, the recommendations around planning and land.  <\/p>  <p>  I have to say I fundamentally disagree with the Rural Independent Group.  We are a rich country and we have many properties.  We can meet the needs of our own homeless community, Ukrainian refugees and everybody in between.  It is wrong, no matter how politely it is presented, to suggest that providing refuge for people fleeing way is in any way exacerbating our housing crisis.  It is not.  I urge the Government to take on board the Irish Refugee Council's proposal for the access of holiday homes offer those property owners a licence agreement, 12-month legal security and a small administrative payment.  Our getting 5% or 10% of the 60,000 holiday homes would take considerable pressure off hotels, while providing people fleeing Russia's unjustified war in Ukraine with better-quality accommodation.  That is something the Government has yet to do and I urge it to do so.<\/p>  <p>  We need a new accommodation strategy for students.  The existing strategy had a 20,000-bed shortfall at the end of the plan and the reliance on the private rental sector to meet student accommodation need, given the crisis in that sector, will no longer be possible.  More needs to be done.  <\/p>  <p>  There is a problem with respect to so-called help to buy, the shared equity loan scheme and Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe.  We know from the recent Parliamentary Budget Office report that one third of the help-to-buy scheme went to people who already had a deposit and a sufficient mortgage to buy a home.  That is &euro;200 million.  According to figures from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, that could have delivered 1,000 new-build social homes.  We have 1,300 homeless families.  Why would we give &euro;200 million to people who had a deposit and a mortgage, when that money could have been used to build or buy homes for families in emergency accommodation?  That makes no sense, regardless of the inflationary impact of those demand-side schemes and the additional debt, particularly, that would be carried by the equity portion of the shared equity scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There are a considerable number of positive solutions in this motion, but if Government does not listen and change tack, we will be here in six, 12 or 24 months, with an ever-deepening housing crisis and a Government using the same speeches to justify the same failed policies, with the same failed results.  It is time to raise the roof and change policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200058#KKK00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1657662000,"counter":783,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Wednesday, 13 July 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200058#KKK00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna ar Sonra\u00edodh Uain D\u00f3ibh - Priority Questions","time":1657662000,"counter":784,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200058#KKK00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","time":1657662000,"counter":785,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200058#KKK00500"},{"type":"question","time":1657662000,"counter":786,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[37351\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200058#KKK00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the pandemic bonus payment and special leave with pay for frontline healthcare workers with long-Covid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Any period of illness extending beyond the isolation period is treated as ordinary sick leave.  A special scheme specific to the health sector is merited in recognition of the requirement on staff to work on site through the most challenging phases of the pandemic and where they were clinically exposed or in a clinically-exposed Covid-19 environment.  There are ongoing discussions between the representative unions and the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.

There have not been, so at the moment there is no support.  Of course the Minister can talk about the merit of a scheme but we have similar schemes in place for, for example, front-line workers who contract MRSA, or in the past contracted TB, or blood-spread illnesses and a whole range of different risks front-line workers must take when they go into work.  Covid is an occupational hazard and there is obviously an additional risk for those on the front-line, so it is not good enough that cliff edge has come and workers with long Covid have gone over it and are now entitled to no payment because the Minister simply did not extend that option to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200059#LLL00400","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1657662600,"counter":793,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I agree that the time patients are having to wait in emergency departments is not acceptable.  Much of that is due to Covid and it is frustrating for everyone, including the patients, our healthcare professionals and all of us, because there is a level of capacity in the system now that has never been there before.  There are more hospital beds, doctors, nurses and healthcare assistants than ever before.  There is more community-based care than there has ever been.  There are more home care hours and there is more preventative community care.  One would expect the emergency departments not to be under the pressure they are.<\/p>  <p>  A big part of the problem is the unprecedented level of presentations.  May of this year saw the highest monthly national emergency department attendance on record.  That was May, not December or January.  Not only was that number the highest on record, the people coming in are older and more frail as a result of many of them having been at home for two years during the pandemic.  I know the Deputy has acknowledged that.<\/p>  <p>  What are we doing about it?  I am working with the Department and the HSE to put together a short-term plan for all 29 emergency departments.  There is now a draft plan in place and being worked out.  More and more detail is being added to it.  That plan is for all 29 emergency departments.  It is considering how we keep people out of the emergency departments unless they really need to be there.  Injury units, access to GPs on call, community-based care, older person intervention teams, home supports and other measures are the alternatives.  When people need to come to emergency departments, we must consider whether the hospitals have the resources they need in the emergency departments and elsewhere in the hospital.  Something that is critical, and the closer we look at this issue the more we realise this problem must be resolved, is the discharge option.  For example, one of the big issues in Limerick is that patients are not being discharged as quickly as they should be.

It is partly a result of Covid but if people cannot get access to out-of-hours GP care, they will go to their local emergency department.

Can they see more people?  There are age limits on many of the injury units.  Is everybody in the community aware of exactly the kind of injuries for which one would attend an injury unit?  For example, there is a brilliant injury unit in Smithfield in Dublin but not that many people know about it.  We need to have much more comprehensive engagement and communication.

It does not mean that people are not waiting too long in emergency departments but very clear action was taken.  I know that a hospital in Drogheda, for example, has got to grips with what was happening in its emergency department and the trolley situation involved.  The last thing it wants is more pressure and that is why there is controversy around closing the emergency department in Navan.

I know the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is working every day to fix this problem.  We have sanctioned hundreds of posts around the country that are not yet filled.

The panel concluded that it was not feasible, desirable or ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.<\/p> <p>An example was where there was discussion around medical cards for cancer patients.  The answer we got back was not to create a hierarchy of diseases, such as a cancer patient versus someone with motor neurone disease and so forth.  That was not recommended in the 2014 report.  However, since December 2018, the medical card earnings disregard for people in receipt of disability allowance was substantially increased from &euro;120 to &euro;427 per week.  It applies to the assessment process for single people and to family assessments.  This very significant policy change gave effect to the important recommendation of the Make Work Pay for People with Disabilities report.  This substantial increase in allowable earnings acknowledges that a medical card is a particularly significant support and ensures that people with disabilities can continue to be supported to access care where needed.

Following the strike action on 18 May and 24 May, health management and the MLSA attended an exploratory engagement at the Labour Court on 25 May for the court to establish whether or how it might assist the parties in finding a resolution to the matters in dispute.  Following engagement at the Labour Court, the parties agreed to reconvene at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, for a final engagement process.  This process took place over a three-week period.  Parties agreed that any outstanding issues which could not be resolved through the WRC process would be referred to the Labour Court for a final recommendation.  During these talks an agreement was reached on a process to assess a claim it has had for 20 years.  They have been looking for a resolution to this for 20 years.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, because this is an ongoing industrial relations process, it would be inappropriate to discuss the funding of any outcomes that are yet to be determined.

Some of that figure relates to people who are on maternity leave, a total of 120.  The Deputy would have got the breakdown, but it is important to lay out the position.<\/p>  <p>  On recruitment and the filling of those posts, in the context of workforce planning, we in the Department of Health are, in conjunction with the Minister and the HSE, putting a number of measures in place.  First and foremost, we want to bolster the teams.  How we plan on doing that is by looking at targeting international recruitment.  This involves: national and international recruitment to the CDNTs being targeted; an apprenticeship programme for therapy grades; employment of graduates to therapy assistants as they await their CORU registration; and an expansion of the therapy assistant systems within the HSE.  My colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, explored the position regarding the latter earlier on.<\/p>  <p>  We are also looking at the recruitment of behavioural therapists.  Behavioural therapist is not currently a grade within the HSE.  The executive is working through the plan of giving it a particular pay grade.  We are training these therapists but we are not recruiting them.  When one is looking at the spectrum within disability teams, it is important to have everything from occupational therapists to the physiotherapists.  We also need to have behavioural therapists on those teams.  We are looking at that model.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of social care workers, we are looking at link workers as well.  We are expanding the range of what should be within the team also to recruit into it.  We are not only looking at a medical model; we are looking at a social model and a more holistic approach.  Disability teams no longer need to look only at the medical aspect.

We talked about the CDNT census, which identified 542.5 whole-time equivalent posts as being vacant at that point.  In budget 2022, an additional 190 posts were funded.  How many of the 542.5 posts that were identified in the census are still vacant and how many of the 190 additional posts are vacant?  Maybe that figure can be given.  What we really need to know is how we will fill those posts and what additional measures can be taken, in terms of international recruitment, domestic recruitment and other ways, to fill them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200064#QQQ00700","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1657665600,"counter":878,"content":"<p>If I was to talk specifically about what is happening around the CDNTs in the various CHOs, I would say that CHO 4 - if Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire was here I would have explained - is piloting recruitment within Ireland to the colleges.

One of our biggest challenges is the fact that in our CDNTs the population of clinicians is so low and we do not have a critical mass of clinicians.  We are failing to grasp the opportunity to give that training on the ground.  Perhaps next year, one of my plans is to work with the Department of Education on special education where the summer programme will give the opportunities for trainee therapists to have practical engagement so that they can build towards their CORU hours.

Hopefully, that can be reversed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200065#RRR01200","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666200,"counter":897,"content":"<p>As I said, it is a whole-of-Department of Health response and I am ably supported by the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, in trying to find those solutions and putting proposals to the Department of Health and the HSE to take this on board.  That is why we met Paul Reid a number of weeks ago in terms of trying to redesign the progressing disability services, PDS, programme and that transition piece and the gaps that are there, trying to work it all out as to the various complements to ensure children get timely access to a service, to assessment and, most importantly, to intervention.  This is about having the proper clinical oversight and support and supporting the therapy assistant levels, whether in psychology, in occupational therapy or in physiotherapy.  We are totally open to that proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200065#RRR01300","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666200,"counter":898,"content":"<p>The Minister of State in her introductory answer referred to on-the-job learning, continuous training and upskilling.  I very much welcome that.  There are a huge number of very talented people within the general health service who could benefit from upskilling and on-the-job training, and who would then be able to provide additional services to people and enhance the overall delivery of services.  There would be a win for everybody, particularly for the people who need the services, who are the most important people in the discussions we have had here tonight with the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071200065#RRR01400","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666200,"counter":899,"content":"<p>There is a clear desire within the Government to ensure that all of our teams are filled.
