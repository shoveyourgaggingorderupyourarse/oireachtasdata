Further successful projects will be announced early in the New Year with a second call for applications under the Fund to follow later in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the other capital funding schemes administered by my Department, such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme, the Community Enhancement Programme and CL&Aacute;R, the criteria underpinning funding decisions are tailored to the objectives of the relevant scheme, all of which are consistent with the strategic outcomes set out in Project Ireland 2040.  <\/p>  <p>  While the LEADER Programme 2014-2020 is governed by regulations established by the European Union, the themes of the programme - Economic Development, Enterprise Development and Job Creation; Social Inclusion; and Rural Environment - are also in harmony with Project Ireland 2040 and will contribute to the achievement of the National Strategic Outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100060#WRD02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100060#WRD02200"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[51676\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100060#WRD02300","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the status of the allocation made under the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme in 2018; when measure 2 approvals will be announced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>The Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development and provides funding for the development of new outdoor recreational infrastructure or the necessary maintenance, enhancement or promotion of existing outdoor recreation infrastructure in Ireland. <\/p><p>On 28thMay last, I launched the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme for 2018, under three separate measures: <\/p><p>- Measure 1: Small maintenance\/promotion of existing infrastructure (maximum grant &euro;20,000)<\/p><p>- Measure 2: Medium scale repair\/upgrade and development of new small\/medium infrastructure (maximum grant &euro;200,000), and<\/p><p>- Measure 3: Repair\/upgrade and development of larger more strategic projects (grant of between &euro;200,001 and &euro;500,000).<\/p><p>Since September last, I have announced the allocation of &euro;1.8 million in respect of 128 projects under Measure 1, and over &euro;8 million in respect of 18 projects under Measure 3.<\/p><p>My officials are now assessing the applications received under Measure 2 and I hope to be in a position to announce the successful projects in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100060#WRD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Development Initiatives","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100060#WRD02500"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[51720\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100060#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the way in which the provision of essential community infrastructure will be supported in the north fringe of Dublin city; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>My Department supports Local Community Development Committees who are responsible for the delivery of the community elements of their Local Economic and Community Plans (LECPs).

I am deeply concerned by the continued high level of violence, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which perpetuate the crisis and impact negatively on its scale.<\/p>  <p>  The current conflict began in 2013 and has had devastating consequences for civilians. The war, compounded by drought, has led to severe food insecurity and caused massive population displacement and suffering throughout the country, with women and girls suffering the most. It is estimated that almost 400,000 people have died, and 7 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance.<\/p>  <p>  On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with the opposition. While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders implement it without delay. Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. In November 2017, during his visit to Addis Ababa, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) and the African Union to discuss the situation in South Sudan. On that visit, the T&aacute;naiste announced funding to the IGAD High Level Revitalization Forum, the process which delivered the revised peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the agreement in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis. The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation. Her most recent visit took place in November.<\/p>  <p>  We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan and have contributed to projects aimed at peace building. In 2018, this has included supporting partners&rsquo; meditation efforts and empowering civil society, in particular women&rsquo;s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes.  <\/p>  <p>  As well as our direct bilateral support, we are actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan. Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The T&aacute;naiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November.<\/p>  <p>  While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Over &euro;10 million in Irish funding has been provided so far this year, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable. Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire and World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, are working in partnership with local organisations and NGO networks to provide lifesaving supplies to meet the basic needs of those suffering from the conflict.<\/p>  <p>  As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed significantly to humanitarian support in South Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $187 million to alleviate the crisis in South Sudan since 2011, as well as to the EU, which has provided more than &euro;90 million so far this year.<\/p>  <p>  With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute in 2019, Irish funding will continue to support both those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100063#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Data","counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100063#WRG01900"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[51820\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100063#WRG02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of online passport renewals submitted since the launch of the service in March 2017, by county, in tabular form.","asker":"1369","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":207,"content":"<p>The number of online passport renewal applications received since the launch of the service in March 2017, per county, is as follows:<\/p><p>Passport Renewal Applications:<table><tr><th>ANTRIM<\/th><th>2,767<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>ARMAGH<\/td><td>663<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CARLOW<\/td><td>2,359<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CAVAN<\/td><td>2,678<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CLARE<\/td><td>4,661<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK<\/td><td>20,421<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DERRY<\/td><td>2,029<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DONEGAL<\/td><td>6,976<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DOWN<\/td><td>2,250<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DUBLIN<\/td><td>66,554<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>FERMANAGH<\/td><td>250<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GALWAY<\/td><td>10,644<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KERRY<\/td><td>5,139<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILDARE<\/td><td>10,745<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILKENNY<\/td><td>3,693<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LAOIS<\/td><td>2,944<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LEITRIM<\/td><td>1,105<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LIMERICK<\/td><td>7,658<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LONGFORD<\/td><td>1,339<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LOUTH<\/td><td>5,985<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MAYO<\/td><td>5,221<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MEATH<\/td><td>9,006<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN<\/td><td>2,145<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>OFFALY<\/td><td>2,674<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON<\/td><td>2,488<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SLIGO<\/td><td>2,680<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY<\/td><td>6,001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TYRONE<\/td><td>1,081<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WATERFORD<\/td><td>4,693<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH<\/td><td>3,649<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WEXFORD<\/td><td>6,210<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WICKLOW<\/td><td>7,349<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*Figures from 30 March 2017 to 30 November 2018<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100063#WRG02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[51821\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100063#WRG02300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of children who have had their passports renewed since the expansion of online passport services in November 2018, by county on tabular form.","asker":"1369","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>The Passport Service receives applications via a range of channels, including Embassies and Consulates abroad, the Online Passport Application Service, Passport Express service and, by appointment, at the public counter.  <\/p><p>The total number of applications for a renewal of child&rsquo;s passport received worldwide between 28 November and 5 December, the week after the launch of the online renewal service for children, was 683.

Before receiving an asset to which a person is entitled, the person may disclaim or refuse the asset. However, a disclaiming beneficiary cannot choose who will then get the disclaimed asset which becomes part of the residue of the deceased person&rsquo;s estate and is distributed accordingly. A recipient of the disclaimed and re-distributed asset is then treated as having received a taxable inheritance from the deceased person.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In contrast, a re-distribution of assets received by family members under a deed of family arrangement gives rise to two potential charges to capital acquisitions tax; i.e. <\/p>  <p>  1. a potential inheritance tax charge for the original beneficiary on his or her inheritance from the deceased person, and<\/p>  <p>  2. a potential gift tax charge for the beneficiary receiving the asset under the deed of family arrangement from the original beneficiary.<\/p>  <p>  As far as capital gains tax is concerned, deeds of family arrangements do not give rise to a charge to tax if certain conditions are met. Section 573 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that any variation made by deed of family arrangement in respect of the deceased person&rsquo;s assets between family members within 2 years after the date of death (or such longer period as the Revenue Commissioners may allow) is to be regarded as made by that person at the time of his or her death. <\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the tax treatment of gifts and inheritances in this State and in the U.K. is not directly comparable. The U.K. tax authorities apply a different basis of taxation whereby it is the value of the estate of the deceased person that is taxed and not the recipients of the assets as happens in this State. A further difference between the tax treatment in both jurisdictions is that the receipt of gifts is not generally taxable in the U.K. <\/p>  <p>  I have therefore no plans to make any changes to the current tax treatment for CAT or CGT in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100064#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Agreements","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100064#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[51635\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100064#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the EU proposal to introduce digital taxation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":244,"content":"<p>The Deputy is aware that the European Commission proposal for an interim Digital Services Tax, which imposes a 3% levy on the turnover of certain companies&rsquo; digital activities, has been debated among Member States at both a technical and political level for some months.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Digital Services Tax proposal was included as an item for policy agreement at ECOFIN on 4 December, where Finance Ministers were asked to agree the scope of the proposal.\u00a0 The debate was held in public session.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An agreement was not reached, with several Member States, including\u00a0Ireland,\u00a0expressing reservations about the proposal.

Qudos is authorised and regulated by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, and therefore the Central Bank had no role in this decision. It is understood that Qudos operated in Ireland on a freedom of services basis and that its products in this country were sold through Patrona Underwriting Ltd.<\/p>  <p>  On 4 December, Qudos published further information that it is no longer paying insurance claims. The Central Bank then issued a statement strongly recommending, based on the uncertainty around the payment of claims, that affected customers should contact their insurance broker to arrange alternative insurance cover. The Central Bank is actively monitoring developments and is liaising regularly with its Danish counterparts, the supervisory authorities of other affected member states and EIOPA.<\/p>  <p>  It is understood that there are approximately 50,000 policyholders in Ireland that have been impacted by the developments with Qudos. Patrona Underwriting has issued a statement saying that policies remain valid and in force until their natural expiry date, however given the current Qudos position and in line with Central Bank recommendations they have provided brokers with options to replace all insurance covers with other providers at no extra cost to consumers. <\/p>  <p>  Early indications suggest that there are  in the region of 1,400 claims outstanding in relation to Irish policyholders, but this is subject to confirmation. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Danish liquidators are currently continuing their review of the company with a view to determining its underlying financial position. Once this exercise is concluded they will be in a better position to determine whether the company can pay existing claims.  It is expected that more information regarding this matter should be available within the next two weeks.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that my officials have been in contact with the Danish Finance Ministry, who  advise on the basis of information they have received from the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, that as the company is in solvent liquidation, claims will be met.  However, the Ministry also indicated that if ultimately Qudos is placed into bankruptcy, and this happens after 1 January 2019,  that the Danish Insurance Guarantee Scheme will not be liable to meet these claims due to a legislative change in May 2018. In such a situation claimants may  instead be eligible for cover from the Irish Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF), subject to its terms and conditions and the particular circumstances of the case. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding informing customers who are impacted by the failure of an insurance undertaking,  if winding-up proceedings are initiated, in accordance Article 281 with Solvency II Directive (2009\/138\/EC) &ldquo;the competent authorities of the home Member State, the liquidator or any person appointed for that purpose by the competent authorities shall without delay individually inform by written notice each known creditor whose habitual residence, domicile or head office is situated in another Member State.\"  I understand that this has happened and that the Central Bank has also instructed the Managing General Agent, Patrona underwriting to inform brokers and policyholders of the temporary stoppage in paying claims.  <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised my Department that all relevant brokers have been contacted and the process of contacting policyholders is ongoing. It has also published information for policyholders on its website and this will be updated as more information becomes available. Furthermore, I understand that brokers are absorbing the administrative costs in arranging the replacement policies. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100065#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100065#WRJ02500"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[52181\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100065#WRJ02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the public bodies and entities under the aegis of his Department for which he is responsible for making all or some appointments not subject to the guidelines on appointments to State boards, in that the recruitment and selection process is undertaken by his Department and not through the Public Appointments Service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":309,"content":"<p>Of the seventeen bodies under the aegis of my Department, seven are State Boards and, as such, are subject to the guidelines on appointments to State Boards.

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  I would advise\u00a0if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any student that these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he\/she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100067#WRL04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100067#WRL04700"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[51981\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100067#WRL04800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the measures being taken to ensure that the safety issues raised by a person (details supplied) are being addressed.","asker":"1235","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":437,"content":"<p>In accordance with the Education Act 1998, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school.

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government\u00a0recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). \u00a0The 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.\u00a0 This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.\u00a0 Parental preferences for each patron,\u00a0from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.\u00a0 Based on the current analysis, this need can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools.\u00a0 Approximately 40% of extra school places are delivered by extending existing schools.<\/p>  <p>  The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular would have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a new 1,000-place post-primary school was established in September 2017 to serve the Carpenterstown_D15 and Castleknock_D15 school planning areas as a regional solution.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  All new schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.\u00a0 This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established.<\/p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to prioritise enrolment of children from particular areas or particular age groups or on the basis of some other criterion.  For example, some schools give priority to applicants who have attended a particular primary school (known as a feeder school).\u00a0 The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100068#WRM03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"English Language Training Organisations","counter":479,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100068#WRM03500"},{"type":"question","counter":480,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[52220\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100068#WRM03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if measures can be taken to ensure that checks are put in place in order that language schools involved in overseas trade missions encouraging students to travel here must in some way prove they are financially viable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":481,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[52221\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100068#WRM03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he has sought a meeting with representatives of an organisation (details supplied) since the closure of a college; if not, his plans in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":482,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 and 219 together.<\/p>  <p>  On Monday 3 December 2018 my Department was informed of the closure of the school referred to by the Deputy.  This school, which was a private English language school, is a member of MEI (Marketing English in Ireland), an association of English language schools.  I understand that MEI representatives met with the school&rsquo;s management and affected students on 3rd December 2018 and are continuing to liaise with all relevant parties.  MEI are putting the necessary arrangements in place to ensure that students affected by the school's closure will be able to complete the course for which they have enrolled, or a similar course, at another MEI member school.  My colleague Minister Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor and I have also separately met with some of the affected teachers. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that legislation is currently being progressed through the Oireachtas which is intended to substantially strengthen regulation in the English language education sector.  Committee Stage of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill was initiated on 5th December 2018.<\/p>  <p>  This new Bill will establish the International Education Mark (IEM) and a Protection for Enrolled Learners (PEL) Fund.  The IEM is a core component of the Government's policy for the English language sector and will provide a full quality framework for the provision of education to international learners in the future.  Only those providers who meet the robust quality assurance procedures of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) will be allowed to carry the Mark. <\/p>  <p>  Once fully implemented, providers must gain authorisation from QQI to use the IEM in order to be eligible to recruit international students.  The IEM is a tool to further enhance and sustain the quality of our education system.  It also provides learners, or potential learners, with the necessary confidence that providers with the IEM have been quality assured by QQI.  <\/p>  <p>  The Bill also contains provisions to provide QQI with additional statutory powers to examine a provider&rsquo;s financial sustainability and to evaluate a provider&rsquo;s corporate fitness.  These provisions will enable QQI to examine the bona fides of a provider in addition to assessing that the provider has the capacity and capability to implement the quality assurance processes and provide programmes of education and training consistent with the requirements of the Act.  All providers, including English language providers, will have to satisfy QQI in relation to issues such as the legal personality, ownership and corporate governance arrangements in addition to examining that adequate financial resources are in place to ensure the viability of these businesses.  <\/p>  <p>  Upon enactment, the Bill will also empower QQI to establish a fund for the protection of enrolled learners (PEL).  This fund will be resourced by an annual charge from those providers covered by it.  The fund will be used to &lsquo;teach out&rsquo; a programme in the event that a provider fails to provide a programme.  Should this not be possible, the fund will be used to reimburse students for the most recent fees that have been paid. <\/p>  <p>  At Committee Stage reading of the Bill Minister Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor announced her intention to appoint an experienced mediator to meet with bodies representing employers and employees in the English language education sector to explore the potential for a Registered Employment Agreement to be developed for workers in the English language sector.  This will complement the provisions contained in the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Amendment) Bill that are intended to strengthen QQI&rsquo;s role as a regulator of quality in the English language training sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100068#WRM03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100068#WRM04100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":483,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100068#WRM04000"},{"type":"question","counter":484,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[51548\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100068#WRM04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda stations here which do not have broadband.","asker":"1287","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[51633\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100068#WRM04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda stations here which do not have broadband.","asker":"1287","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":486,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 and 226 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as for decisions in relation to the allocation and management of Garda equipment and resources, including in relation to ICT, in light of his identified operational demands.

On 11 February 2004 advertisements looking for suitable sites were published.  In May 2004, a site selection committee was established to review potential sites.

Vetting checks are conducted by the Vetting Bureau for each new application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.

The Act is the vehicle for the relevant reforms recommended by the Competition Authority in 2006 as undertaken by the Government under the EU\/IMF\/ECB Troika Programme.  These include the introduction of a new and more consumer-friendly legal costs transparency regime, the setting out of Legal Costs Principles and the modernising transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicators who will\u00a0maintain a public register of their\u00a0legal costs determinations.<\/p><p>They also include the introduction of an independent complaints and professional conduct regime for both solicitors and barristers including the establishment and appointment of an independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal. Members of the public will no longer make their complaints through the legal professional bodies as they do at present but directly to the new Authority. Both the legal costs and the public complaints regimes, for which extensive preparations are ongoing, are due to come into operation\u00a0during Quarter 2 of 2019. The regulated introduction of new legal\u00a0services models in the guise of Legal Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships is also due in Quarter 1 of 2019.<\/p><p>The key driver for much of this\u00a0programme of structural reform is the Legal Services Regulatory Authority which was established,\u00a0along the lines recommended by the Competition Authority,\u00a0on 1 October 2016 and held its first meeting on 26 October 2016. The Authority has eleven members including a lay majority and a lay Chair, Dr. Don Thornhill, and\u00a0continues to roll out its functions under its first full-time Chief Executive, Dr. Brian Doherty. Members of the Authority are nominated by ten prescribed nominating bodies who represent a balance of interests between the legal professions and those consumers, both private and enterprise, who avail of their services. The Authority is, under the 2015 Act, independent in the performance of its functions and appointments to it have to be approved by a motion of each House of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>In its first year of operations to the end of 2017,\u00a0the Authority\u00a0produced five mandatory reports on new legal services options which included public consultations within deadlines set under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. It has also submitted its Annual Report for 2017 and recently produced a review of legal professional education. The Deputy will wish to be aware that I have laid these, along with the\u00a0other reports to which I have referred, before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the required manner.  The Authority\u00a0will also soon be submitting its first statutory review of the operation of the 2015 Act directly to each House.<\/p><p>The Authority's forthcoming actions\u00a0have been\u00a0set out in its first\u00a0Strategic Plan for 2018-2020 which I laid before the Houses on 1 May 2018. The Plan sets out indicative timelines for the roll-out of the Authority's functions during that period. This will be supported in each instance with the commencement, by\u00a0me as\u00a0Minister, of the relevant provisions concerned. The Authority has its own website on <i>www.lsra.ie<\/i>where its reports, minutes of meetings, Strategic Plan and other useful information are also publicly available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100070#WRO02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Accommodation Provision","counter":567,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100070#WRO02200"},{"type":"question","counter":568,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[52018\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100070#WRO02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to develop the Thornton Hall site which was initially purchased as a site for a super prison; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":569,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware the Thornton Hall\u00a0site was purchased in 2005 with the intention of constructing a large scale prison campus to replace the 19th century complex at Mountjoy Prison which the then Government planned to sell to fund the development. Due to the downturn in the economy, the scale of the project could not be accommodated within the capital allocation available and the project did not proceed.  In the decade since the original plan, international research has tended towards smaller prisons within reach of support communities as the best option for rehabilitation.  In addition, in light of the decision not to proceed with Thornton Hall, significant capital investment has been made at the Mountjoy campus over recent years to upgrade accommodation and eliminate the practice of slopping out.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Thornton Hall site which is fully serviced and adjacent to Dublin airport remains in my Department&rsquo;s ownership and in recent years a working group, which included representatives from the OPW, considered future use options for the site.

This includes a focus on the use of motorways by criminal gangs so as to disrupt and arrest those involved.<\/p>  <p>  The scale of Garda activity against burglary and property-related crime &ndash; under Operation Thor - has led to (as of 2 November 2018) over 168,636 targeted checkpoints and 243,277 crime prevention patrols nationwide. This has produced in the region of 8,837 arrests and 10,143 charges covering a range of offences, which, in addition to burglary, include handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.<\/p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; continue to pursue a range of measures to support elderly and more vulnerable people in the community, working closely with Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch and other community groups.<\/p>  <p>  At the Ploughing Championships in September, I announced details of the 2018 Text Alert Rebate Scheme which will be available to over 1,000 local groups registered under the Garda Text Alert Scheme.

Theft Stop is designed to deter criminals from taking and selling farm equipment by ensuring it is clearly marked with a unique ID and then registered on a nationwide database. The clearly visible serial number should act as a deterrent to criminals. A further impediment for criminals is that the details and serial numbers of stolen equipment can be viewed by would-be buyers on-line at www.theftstop.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Other partnership initiatives with the IFA and Crimestoppers have included a reward fund to encourage reports to assist Garda&iacute; in identifying those involved in livestock theft. Anyone with information about livestock theft may use the Crimestoppers confidential number 1800 25 00 25 to make a report if they so wish, or contact Garda&iacute; directly.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, new legislation has been put in place to target repeat burglary offenders and the Government is determined that there will be no let-up on the pressure which the Garda&iacute; are bringing to bear on the organised gangs engaged in burglary, including the mobile gangs who have targeted rural communities in various parts of the country.<\/p>  <p>  Underpinning the strong policing action now being taken against burglars and criminal gangs is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme.

The relevant law in relation to receivership is largely made up of rules which the courts have developed by applying general contract law and equitable principles.  Receivers are appointed under a relevant security e.g. a mortgage or a charge which contains the contractual terms in relation to their appointment and their powers under the instrument.  Depending on the circumstances of the case, courts may also, on application from a secured creditor, exercise their discretionary powers to appoint a receiver.

Among the Directive&rsquo;s many proposals are provisions aimed at ensuring greater rights for press publishers seeking to protect their content online (Article 11), and intended to address the &ldquo;value gap&rdquo;, whereby rightsholders are receiving less remuneration despite the increased usage of their works (Article 13).<\/p>  <p>  Officials of my Department have actively engaged in negotiations since publication of this proposal. On 25 May 2018, the Copyright Directive was discussed by Ambassadors at Coreper and the Presidency gained approval for a mandate from the Council to commence negotiations with the European Parliament.

The Strategy is to be implemented on a cost neutral basis. Each relevant Department is responsible for the implementation of their actions and the Department of Health co-ordinates a progress report on overall implementation which is produced on a periodic basis over the lifetime of the Strategy and presented to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy. The Strategy contains actions to implement four national goals encompassing a recognition of the value and contribution made by family carers, a need to support carers to manage their own health and well-being, providing adequate information, training, supports and services, and the empowering of carers to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the National Carers' Strategy, the Department of Health is committed to the periodic publication\u00a0of progress reports, highlighting work carried out by relevant Government departments and agencies. The fifth progress report, capturing actions which took place in 2017, was published on the Department of Health's website in August 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is engaging with other Departments at present with a view to the development of a revised Action Plan for the further implementation of the Strategy. Meetings have been held between the Department of Health and a number of other departments and agencies to identify additional actions which can be carried out. A stakeholder consultation on the draft Department of Health\/HSE health-related proposals was undertaken at the Annual Carers Forum organised by the Department of Employment and Social Protection in November. Family Carers Ireland, the main carer representative organisation, has submitted a revised set of proposed actions for various Government Departments which will be considered in consultation with other Government Departments and the Department of the Taoiseach over the next few months with a view to agreeing a revised action plan in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100071#WRP03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Delays","counter":629,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100071#WRP03300"},{"type":"question","counter":630,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[51510\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100071#WRP03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason persons (details supplied) have still not received a medical card even though they meet all the criteria and are fully eligible.","asker":"1305","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":631,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100071#WRP03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Speech and Language Therapy Data","counter":632,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100071#WRP03600"},{"type":"question","counter":633,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[51511\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100071#WRP03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the length of time children are waiting for speech therapy and occupational therapy services after assessment for developmental language disorder a nationally; the comparable length of time for the Dublin 15 area; the number of children on such a waiting list nationally and in the Dublin 15 area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":634,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Furthermore, Pembrolizumab is being assessed by the HSE using the criteria in the 2013 Act for a number of other indications for which it has received marketing authorisation. <\/p>  <p>  However, Pembrolizumab has not been granted a marketing authorisation by either the EMA or by HPRA for the treatment of cervical cancer and accordingly, in accordance with the 2013 Act, it cannot be assessed by HSE for reimbursement for cervical cancer, using the standard criteria.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a Government decision of 11 May 2018 put in place a package of support measures for the women and families affected by the issues related to CervicalCheck.

To this end\u00a0I introduced a number of targeted measures  including:<\/p>  <p>  - a &euro;2.75 million Fodder Production Incentive for Tillage Farmers to encourage tillage growers to actively engage in the fodder market and there has been positive\u00a0engagement with this measure<\/p>  <p>  - a &euro;4.25 million Fodder Import Support Measure for Autumn 2018. The measure seeks to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage. The measure operates\u00a0through the Co-operatives\/registered importers and\u00a0will cover forage imported from 12th August 2018 to 31st\u00a0December 2018.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In July I\u00a0secured agreement from\u00a0EU Commissioner Hogan to pay higher advance Pillar 1 and 2 payments, increased to 70% and 85% respectively.

In addition, in\u00a0consultation with my ministerial colleague Mr. Eoghan Murphy T.D.,\u00a0a two week\u00a0extension of the closed period for the spreading of chemical and organic fertilisers was implemented that allowed farmers capitalise on autumn grass growth for fodder production. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0most recent\u00a0national fodder survey conducted on my behalf by Teagasc last October indicated that the national fodder shortfall\u00a0has been reduced to 1% nationally. \u00a0It is clear that the various support interventions I have introduced have worked and continue to help alleviate what was a very serious fodder conservation issue on many farms during the dry summer period<\/p>  <p>  It is important to\u00a0stress that while the deficit nationally has been reduced significantly there still remains a  fodder deficit on some farms and there is a need for farmers to remain vigilant and avoid complacency. I have urged Teagasc and the other Stakeholders to continue their individual efforts in support of those farmers worst affected and in need of help. <\/p>  <p>  I can\u00a0assure the\u00a0Deputy that\u00a0I will continue to closely monitor\u00a0the fodder\u00a0situation during the coming period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100078#WRW01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":1009,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100078#WRW02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1010,"qnumday":402,"qnumall":"[51789\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100078#WRW02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of the situation regarding Mercosur; and if a deal will be completed in the coming months.","asker":"1268","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1011,"content":"<p>The EU Mercusor negotiations have not progressed sufficiently to conclude any sort of agreement.

In the context of Ireland's transition to a low carbon energy future, it is accepted that Ireland will continue to need oil and particularly gas for quite some time, though their use\u00a0must significantly reduce. Ending all future oil and gas exploration in Irish waters and placing a full moratorium on exploration activity would\u00a0not impact\u00a0the amount of emissions Ireland creates by burning fossil fuels; rather it will commit Ireland to source all of its oil and gas from abroad. <\/p>  <p>  The Government's approach to tackle emissions from fossil fuels is to focus efforts on energy efficiency and renewable energy which make essential contributions to all of the major objectives of climate and energy policies, including improved competitiveness, security of supply, sustainability, and the transition to a low carbon economy.<\/p>  <p>  Minister Bruton\u00a0has secured Government approval to develop an all of Government plan which will set out the actions which must be taken\u00a0to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding occasional speculative comment as to the potential of the Irish offshore in terms of oil and gas, it is only through active exploration that such potential will be proven. Ireland&rsquo;s offshore remains underexplored with only a fraction of the exploration experience of\u00a0Norway and the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Early exploration efforts viewed the petroleum geology of the Irish offshore as being comparable to that of the North Sea. However, lack of success from drilling efforts in the 1970s and 1980s led to a decline in interest. However, industry perspectives have been transformed in recent years. While the North Sea comparison retains potential, two new possibilities have also emerged. Successful exploration off the Atlantic coasts of Africa and South America has stimulated new interest in the prospectivity of the Atlantic margins, with new data, analysis and targets. Research on the Newfoundland-Ireland conjugate margins has demonstrated the potential for Ireland to replicate the oil and gas success of Newfoundland-Labrador exploration.<\/p>  <p>  Marine industrial activities, such as oil and gas exploration and production, require careful assessment, management and regulation in order to protect the marine environment.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the 2015 Atlantic Margin Licencing Round, my Department undertook the Irish Offshore Strategic Environmental Assessment (IOSEA) 5 Environmental Report in respect of oil and gas exploration activities in the Irish offshore.

In addition, the observations of the National Parks and Wildlife Service regarding potential impacts on Annex IV Protected Species and\u00a0sites protected under the Birds and Habitats legislation are sought. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0recent completion of the ObSERVE Programme led by my Department has highlighted the rich diversity of cetaceans and seabirds in the Irish offshore. The findings of the Programme\u00a0are already informing the environmental aspects of decision making in respect of applications for exploration activities. <\/p>  <p>  Scientific research regarding the potential for exploration\u00a0activities to have an adverse impact on plankton and fish with trophic links to cetaceans is limited and not settled.

The publication on 8 October of the Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\u2070  C confirms the absolute urgency of achieving deep cuts in our greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has fully supported the level of ambition in recent negotiations to reform the EU ETS and to put in place Member State targets for non-ETS sectors under the EU Effort Sharing Regulation. Ireland also continues to support high ambition in on-going negotiations at EU level in relation to emissions standards for both Light- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles. I consider it essential that the EU seeks high ambition in all of its sectorial policies and targets for 2030, which will be essential in supporting individual Member States to achieve their respective targets under the Effort Sharing Regulation and may enable the EU as a whole to achieve emissions reductions by 2030 in excess of the 40% reduction on 1990 levels already committed to by the European Council.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports strong EU ambition in order to contribute to the Paris Agreement objectives. It is vital that the EU long-term strategy to be adopted on foot of the European Commission&rsquo;s recent proposals can be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, with all Member States participating in this effort, balancing considerations of fairness, cost-effectiveness and solidarity.

This year the rise in\u00a0cost charged for childcare\u00a0was 2%, half of what was experienced the previous year. <\/p><p>In addition the number of children participating in the ECCE (free pre-school) scheme has doubled; whilst the scheme itself has lengthened to 76 weeks per child. <\/p><p>Earlier this year the Oireachtas signed the Childcare Support Act; putting the entitlement to financial support for childcare on a legislative footing for the first time. <\/p><p>In 2019, we will launch the Affordable Childcare Scheme, a radical new approach to how families access financial support towards quality early learning and care. <\/p><p>It will take time to deliver the world class system of early learning and care that families deserve but I am confident that we are moving swiftly in the right direction to achieve this goal. <\/p><p>Table: Cost\u00a0charged for childcare - County by County<\/p><p><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Full day care<\/th><th>Part-time care<\/th><th>Sessional<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin &ndash; D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown<\/td><td>&euro;233.26<\/td><td>&euro;127.45<\/td><td>&euro;86.26<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City<\/td><td>&euro;206.67<\/td><td>&euro;104.27<\/td><td>&euro;68.68<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin &ndash; Fingal<\/td><td>&euro;206.25<\/td><td>&euro;115.23<\/td><td>&euro;71.44<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin &ndash; South Dublin<\/td><td>&euro;202.25<\/td><td>&euro;116.92<\/td><td>&euro;72.17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>&euro;200.21<\/td><td>&euro;102.47<\/td><td>&euro;71.77<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin &ndash; Dublin City<\/td><td>&euro;195.79<\/td><td>&euro;115.71<\/td><td>&euro;71.90<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork County<\/td><td>&euro;192.37<\/td><td>&euro;108.57<\/td><td>&euro;71.06<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>&euro;183.52<\/td><td>&euro;100.68<\/td><td>&euro;68.80<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>&euro;181.39<\/td><td>&euro;113.42<\/td><td>&euro;73.59<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>&euro;172.17<\/td><td>&euro;90.24<\/td><td>&euro;62.01<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>&euro;172.12<\/td><td>&euro;101.05<\/td><td>&euro;68.69<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>&euro;167.97<\/td><td>&euro;90.50<\/td><td>&euro;69.45<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>&euro;167.22<\/td><td>&euro;100.98<\/td><td>&euro;59.92<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>&euro;166.34<\/td><td>&euro;97.30<\/td><td>&euro;67.69<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>&euro;164.46<\/td><td>&euro;103.04<\/td><td>&euro;66.85<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>&euro;162.00<\/td><td>&euro;102.33<\/td><td>&euro;68.01<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>&euro;159.87<\/td><td>&euro;88.61<\/td><td>&euro;66.46<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>&euro;159.44<\/td><td>&euro;96.29<\/td><td>&euro;67.33<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>&euro;159.00<\/td><td>&euro;90.12<\/td><td>&euro;67.98<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>&euro;157.72<\/td><td>&euro;90.54<\/td><td>&euro;67.50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>&euro;157.24<\/td><td>&euro;88.94<\/td><td>&euro;61.55<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>&euro;156.94<\/td><td>&euro;91.13<\/td><td>&euro;63.21<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>&euro;156.54<\/td><td>&euro;75.00<\/td><td>&euro;62.14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>&euro;156.40<\/td><td>&euro;85.04<\/td><td>&euro;64.26<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>&euro;155.08<\/td><td>&euro;92.02<\/td><td>&euro;67.33<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>&euro;153.48<\/td><td>&euro;98.47<\/td><td>&euro;74.11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>&euro;151.00<\/td><td>&euro;85.55<\/td><td>&euro;63.69<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>&euro;149.53<\/td><td>&euro;84.29<\/td><td>&euro;70.02<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>&euro;147.97<\/td><td>&euro;80.12<\/td><td>&euro;64.35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>&euro;146.56<\/td><td>&euro;88.68<\/td><td>&euro;63.31<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>&euro;177.92<\/td><td>&euro;101.82<\/td><td>&euro;68.95<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100082#WRAA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":1207,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100082#WRAA01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1208,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[51516\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100082#WRAA01900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the status of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016; when same will be enacted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1209,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, I am committed to the early enactment of this legislation.

Therefore the provision of aftercare services should not be seen as an event, but something that builds on the skills and capacity that young people have learned and developed during their time in care.<\/p><p>Tusla has undertaken an extensive review of policy as it relates to Aftercare Service Provision and developed a suite of policies and guidance documents to support the delivery of aftercare services.<\/p><p>Legislative provision for aftercare has been strengthened by the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015, which imposed a statutory duty on Tusla to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person, following an assessment of need. The Act created an explicit statement of Tusla&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports. An eligible child for the purpose of this statutory entitlement is any child who has spent 12 months in the care of the State in the 5 years between the ages of 13 and 18 years  old, while an eligible adult is any young person aged 18, 19 or 20 who has spent at least 12 months in the care of the State between the ages of 13 and 18 years. Specific legislative provision is in place for aftercare to continue until a young person is 23 years of age where they are finishing a course of education. <\/p><p>Aftercare encompasses a range of services, which can include direct financial support in the form of the aftercare allowance. The purpose of the allowance is to cover the day to day costs associated in supporting a young person as they progress in education or accredited training.<\/p><p>To qualify for an aftercare allowance at 18 years of age an eligible adult must be attending an accredited education course or training programme as outlined in their aftercare plan, and agree to engage with aftercare service requirements and provide updates on their progress.<\/p><p>Tusla does not collect the number of young people who seek or receive an aftercare allowance for the purpose of supporting them in education\/accredited training.Tusla does however maintain records of those who are in education\/accredited training.  All young adults who are in accredited training\/education are entitled to financial support for this purpose  <b>.<\/b><\/p><p>At the end of September 2018, there were 1,257 young persons in aftercare in education\/accredited training.<\/p><p>It should be noted that aftercare is a service for adults, and their engagement with Tusla in relation to aftercare is purely on a voluntary basis.

The economy is recovering strongly and will underpin employment growth and the availability of productive work for those on the Live Register. The Action Plan for Jobs sets out Ireland&rsquo;s policies in support of enterprise and employment growth. The most recent Pathways to Work<b><i><\/i><\/b>strategy, for the period 2016-2020, continues to focus on addressing long-term and youth unemployment by introducing new measures to ensure that the long-term and young unemployed take up a substantial share of the jobs being created by economic recovery. The strategy includes some additional actions, which are ongoing or have been completed, in relation to addressing long-term and youth unemployment:<\/p><p>- the roll out of JobPath  to engage more systematically with this group; the JobPath service  has provided activation support to over 180,000 long term jobseekers since  its inception in 2015. Jobseekers have benefitted from intensive engagement with a personal advisor to assist their return to employment.<\/p><p>- targeted wage subsidies  under JobsPlus, including JobsPlus Youth; <\/p><p>- reserved places for the  long term unemployed on employment and training programmes. (Latest available data indicates that approximately 55,000 people are availing of a range of activation programmes targeted primarily at the long term  unemployed);  <\/p><p>- the continued provision of activation services to the long term unemployed by Local Employment Services and Jobclubs. In 2018, 26,000 customers have engaged with these services; and<\/p><p>-  the launch of the Youth Employment Support  Scheme (YESS) targeted specifically at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed or who face significant barriers to gaining employment.  YESS provides young jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic work  and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement,  helping them to increase their employment prospects. <\/p><p>Latest available data from the CSO Labour Force Survey shows that the number of persons recorded as working part-time, but underemployed, was 115,800 in the third quarter of 2018, representing a decrease of 4.5% in year on year terms  from the third quarter of 2017. This cohort currently represent approximately 4.8% of the total labour force (2.417m).<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s Public Employment Service (PES) is managed by my Department and delivered directly by the Intreo service to provide a range of activation and employment support services to those who wish to avail of its services, on a walk-in basis. It is a priority of my Department  to deliver the necessary supports and innovations to facilitate a fair chance to gain work, particularly full-time work,  as more and more jobs become available.<\/p><p>November 2018 saw a continued trend downwards in the number of people on the Live Register to 196,261 &ndash; representing a year on year decrease of 15.8% since November 2017, and a  decrease of almost 30% over a two year period.  <\/p><p>On a seasonally adjusted basis, the Live Register total recorded a monthly decrease of 3,100 people (-1.5%) in November 2018, bringing the seasonally adjusted total to 207,200. The number on the seasonally adjusted Live Register in November 2018 is also the lowest number recorded since May 2008 (when it was 201,756).<\/p><p>The Live Register trend for young people is similar, with the number of claimants aged 18-24 declining from 80,000 in 2011 to approximately 20,000 in November 2018. Since 2011, the month-on-month decline in Live Register numbers has been more rapid for the under 25 year cohort than for those over 25.<\/p><p>Three out of five people on the Live Register are now classified as short term claimants. The number of long term claimants has decreased by almost 34% - to 80,557 &ndash; over a two year period.<\/p><p>Many of those who have left the Live Register and returned to work will have been helped to do so by supports from my  Department and the buoyant recovery created by government policy to reduce unemployment. <\/p><p>This policy approach, and continuing economic recovery, will build on substantial improvements in the labour market that have been seen over the last few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100086#WREE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social

They are not employees of my Department or public servants, and as such were not subject to pay reductions under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) which only applied to public servants.  My Department funds wages and training costs in respect of CE participants and supervisors &ndash; it does not and has not provided provision for funding for CE supervisor pensions.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the issue of CE supervisor pensions is being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments, including my own Department, are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal.<\/p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State funded Community and Voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. <\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious that any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100086#WREE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Sign Language","counter":1411,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100086#WREE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1412,"qnumday":551,"qnumall":"[52035\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100086#WREE01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the progress made to enact the Irish Sign Language Act 2017.","asker":"1259","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1413,"content":"<p>The Irish Sign Language Act, 2017 was signed into law in December 2017 and recognises Irish Sign Language as a native and independent language. <\/p>  <p>  Section 9 of the Irish Sign Language Act, 2017 provides that\u00a0the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection may, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, provide funds to \u00a0facilitate users of Irish Sign Language to access social, educational, and cultural events and services (including medical) and other activities as specified in guidelines made by the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  The Sign Language Interpreting Service (SLIS), which is mainly funded by the Citizens Information Board(CIB) has prepared draft guidelines for how such a scheme might operate and these guidelines have been submitted to CIB and are under active consideration.<\/p>  <p>  When CIB have completed this task, the guidelines will be submitted to me\u00a0for approval, as is required under the provisions of the Act.

In this regard the Department continues to engage with relevant stakeholders to inform its approach to developing its public employment services, with an emphasis on maintaining a quality service not just to unemployed jobseekers but increasingly to other client groups of the Department, including people with disabilities.\u00a0 For example, the Department as part of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities, established a Make Work Pay Inter-Departmental Group chaired by Professor Frances Ruane comprising representatives from key Departments, agencies and three independent experts. This group reported in 2017 and its recommendations are now being followed up including via a consultative forum of key stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the Minister for Education and Skills established the National Skills Council in April 2017. This council is charged with ensuring that Ireland can anticipate and respond to current, future and rapidly changing skills needs across all sectors in the labour market \u00a0while developing and retaining workplace talent.\u00a0 Membership of the National Skills Council is, as was the case with the Labour Market Council, representative of the key stakeholders with interest in labour market developments.

Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents,\u00a0cost rental will make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of\u00a0our main urban\u00a0centres\u00a0as places to live\u00a0and\u00a0work.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As laid out in the National Planning Framework, the Government is planning\u00a0for an\u00a0expected population increase of almost one million people by 2040. This growth\u00a0will necessitate the delivery of\u00a0some\u00a0500,000 new homes over the next 20 years. The State will\u00a0be proactive in contributing to the delivery of the housing that we need by 2040 and cost rental will need to form a significant part of Ireland's\u00a0housing system in the future. <\/p>  <p>  Under the cost rental model, minimising retained earnings, land and other delivery costs,\u00a0while securing very competitive European Investment Bank (EIB)\u00a0financing, means that\u00a0affordable rents can be achieved. The final rents, for any given project, will be set after all associated costs are determined, following on from the competitive construction and management tender processes. Cost rental homes will be targeted\u00a0at households earning low to moderate incomes\u00a0up to a\u00a0maximum of &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for dual applicants. <\/p>  <p>  Cost rental is new to Ireland and in order to drive delivery, a number of important early mover projects are being advanced, delivering important lessons in terms of cost rental in an\u00a0Irish setting.\u00a0There are\u00a0two\u00a0pilot cost rental schemes being advanced: one\u00a0at Enniskerry Road, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown,\u00a0and\u00a0one\u00a0at Emmet Road in Inchicore.\u00a0It is expected\u00a0that 50 cost rental units and 105 social homes will be made available on the\u00a0Enniskerry Road\u00a0site. While the final tenure-mix on the Emmet Road site will be decided by Dublin City Council and informed by the detailed site development process, it will likely include 140 social housing homes, with the remaining 330 homes predominantly provided by the City\u00a0Council\u00a0under cost rental arrangements.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The tenders are currently being assessed for the Enniskerry Road Project, and it is anticipated that construction will commence in the first quarter of 2019.\u00a0With regard to\u00a0the Emmet Road site, while this project is at an earlier stage of development, Dublin City Council has appointed a dedicated project manager and a project team to drive the project forward. In addition to pre-existing consultative arrangements, the Council is also facilitating\u00a0a special\u00a0Consultative Forum specifically for this project. <\/p>  <p>  Cost rental will initially be managed on an administrative basis, and my Department is preparing a draft administrative cost rental framework in collaboration with the Housing Agency and the local authorities involved in the pilot projects. The invaluable learning from these pathfinder projects will inform further cost rental projects to be rolled out across other suitable sites. My Department is also working with the European Investment Bank to leverage its advisory and research capacity so that broader international lessons on the operation of cost rental can\u00a0inform Ireland's approach.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the funding and financing\u00a0arrangements, I have made it clear that direct Exchequer funding will be provided for any social housing element of these mixed-tenure developments. Indeed, part of the Emmet Road site has been identified as a &ldquo;Housing with Support&rdquo; demonstrator model under Rebuilding Ireland and will deliver 52 homes, due for completion in 2020. This element of the Emmet Road\u00a0project has been approved for funding of circa &euro;15 million under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme, with a contribution of &euro;450,000 from the HSE\/Department of Health towards additional communal facilities for the residents. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Government has made &euro;310m available to local authorities to fund facilitating infrastructure to deliver affordable housing from its sites. The funding is available for cost rental projects and will contribute to reducing costs even further.\u00a0\u00a0The terms of any loan funding arrangements put in place for individual projects will be determined on a case by case basis.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging with the National Development Finance Agency and\u00a0the new Land Development Agency\u00a0to examine the optimum\u00a0funding and delivery options to support\u00a0cost rental delivery at scale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100086#WREE05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic and Social Research Institute","counter":1458,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100087#WRFF00300"},{"type":"question","counter":1459,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[51520\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100087#WRFF00400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his views on a recent ESRI report which indicates that the construction workforce here is too small to produce the level of social and affordable housing needed; if he has liaised with his ministerial colleagues in relation to the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1460,"content":"<p>The recently published Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) report\u00a0on the construction industry indicates that\u00a0much of the additional labour required for housing supply and other construction and infrastructural work\u00a0may have to be secured through inward net migration.\u00a0 However, the report concludes the Irish economy would not appear, at present, to be unduly constrained in terms of labour market. <\/p>  <p>  Increasing housing supply generally, and social and more affordable housing in particular, is, and will remain, a top Government priority.
