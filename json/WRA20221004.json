On 30 August, I laid the foundation stone for Phase 2 of the Ulster Canal restoration which is fully-funded by Government including through the Shared Island Fund, and on track to be completed next year.<\/p>  <p>  On 29 September, I and the Minister for Housing, Heritage and Local Government announced 25 awards totalling more than &euro;4.3 million under the Shared Island Local Authority Development Funding Scheme, at an event in Cavan which brought together 23 different Councils from across the island. Through the Scheme they are now working in cross-border partnerships to progress feasibility work over the next year on new collaborative investment projects, with a view to accessing further funding in both jurisdictions for delivery stage, including through the Shared Island Fund. Projects address shared concerns for the island including on biodiversity, sustainable tourism, circular economy, innovation; and cultural and creative industries.<\/p>  <p>  The Shared Island research programme commissioned by my Department is continuing. Final reports from the Economic and Social Research Institute will be published later this month on productivity levels on the island; and, next month, on coordination of renewable energy policies and electricity infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s focus is on inclusive civic engagement with all communities and political traditions. The Shared Island Dialogue series has so far directly involved some 2,000 citizens and civic representatives through 11 dialogue events. On 29 June, I addressed a Dialogue with over 150 young people in attendance in Derry on the theme of Identities on a Shared Island. The next Dialogue will be on Arts and Culture at Queen&rsquo;s University in Belfast on 13 October, with participation by Minister Catherine Martin TD for the Government and Executive Minister for Communities Deirdre Hargey MLA. The Dialogues are being made available online and reports are being published, to inform wider civic and political discussion.<\/p>  <p>  On 29 September, I participated in the launch of the first report of the All-Island Women&rsquo;s Forum; and on Monday (3 October) I launched the report of the iCommunity hub led by The Wheel and Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action. Both projects followed on from our Shared Island engagements, and supported by the Government are forging significant new civic connections and making recommendations on common concerns for communities across the island. The Government will positively consider their recommendations, as all Departments work to develop new investment, policy and cooperation projects to contribute to our Shared Island initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400070#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":11,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 41 to 65, inclusive, resubmitted.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Programmes","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400070#WRA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[44929\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400070#WRA01200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his views on the national reform programme for the European Semester 2022 that was published by his Department in April 2022.","asker":"1522","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[44930\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400070#WRA01300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his views on the national reform programme.

This would include headquarters for central Government Departments, State security services, etc. <\/p>  <p>  The overall conclusion that can be drawn from the recently published Spending Review Paper is that, when the State is acquiring significant property for office accommodation, the new build or purchase options should be considered on a case by case basis in accordance with the parameters of the Public Spending Code, particularly if there is a long-term requirement, subject always to the prevailing market conditions and available funding. <\/p>  <p>  To meet its strategic objectives of modernising the estate and making it more efficient, OPW constantly look to appraise the potential of the existing Owned state accommodation portfolio for future redevelopment of sites, refurbishment opportunities and potential asset recycling prospects.  This is done in parallel and in conjunction with ongoing appraisal, monitoring and managing of opportunities which arise from within the Leasehold Estate.  The extensive research undertaken for the Review provides the OPW with an important evidence base on which to ground decisions on the overall development of the portfolio into the future.<\/p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan (2021 &ndash; 2030), the OPW has been successful in securing funding for a broad range of projects, which includes a number of office developments that will further enhance the balance of leased and owned accommodation. One of the major capital projects that is being funded by the EU within Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), is the deep energy retrofit of the state owned Tom Johnson House in Dublin 4, which will reduce the buildings primary energy use by 75% and become the new headquarters of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications. OPW will continue to appraise development and redevelopment opportunities on existing state owned sites with a view to seeking additional funding for investments that will meet the operational needs of client departments and agencies in modern energy efficient buildings.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, the OPW have an ongoing programme of fabric upgrades and energy efficiency retrofit projects in central government buildings to enhance the overall condition and performance of our buildings. This will ensure the enhanced performance of existing buildings and avoid the need to replace these buildings through the commercial office market.  <\/p>  <p>  The Blended Working Policy Framework for the Civil Service was published in March 2022, and Departments and Agencies are currently in the process of finalising their Departmental Blended Working Policies. Inevitably, the decisions currently being formulated across each Department and Agency on patterns of attendance in the office will have a direct impact on how the physical office space will be utilised into the future. The Chairman of the OPW has recently written to all Secretary Generals across Government asking them to consider the use of their existing accommodation in the context of long term Blended Working. Departments are being asked to account for the full optimisation of existing accommodation in the context of their Blended Working policies.<\/p>  <p>  Lastly, the Spending review paper notes the opportunity to acquire properties at a lower rent in locations outside of the Central Business District. Each property acquisition is looked at on a case by case basis, and in the context of the business needs of each Client Department. If the Client Department has confirmed that it is feasible to locate the accommodation requirement outside of the Central Business District, OPW will examine this opportunity and assess available properties in the context of the Public Spending Code.  <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Spending Review paper provides an evidence base for long term decision making on the future direction of the office accommodation portfolio. Every requirement will continue to be assessed on a case by case basis in the context of the business needs of client departments, the urgency and scale attached to the accommodation request, the overarching OPW Estate Strategy, the duration of the requirement, and the availability of capital funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry","counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB01200"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[48263\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the amount of funding that has been allocated from the carbon tax to the agricultural sector to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":65,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government recognises the special economic and social role that agriculture plays in Ireland, but also commits to the creation of schemes that will encourage and incentivise farmers to farm in a greener and more sustainable way.

This work was supported by a Cross-Border Technical Co-ordination Group. These groups have met on numerous occasions since, most recently on 14 September this year, to coordinate on the identification of areas of potentially significant flood risk, to share information and agree approaches to the production of flood mapping in border areas and to coordinate on the identification of measures and the preparation of Flood Risk Management Plans.<\/p>  <p>  The Erne catchment was assessed under the OPW&rsquo;s Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Programme (CFRAM), in close co-operation with DfI Rivers. The study considered increasing watercourse conveyance of the Erne system to lower water levels as a measure to reduce flood risk. This study revealed that water levels in the majority of the Erne catchment in Ireland, remain unchanged regardless of any works that could be carried out in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Flood Risk Management Plan for the Erne River Basin developed under CFRAM and published in May 2018 included a flood relief scheme for Cavan Town. Cavan County Council as the Lead Authority, in partnership with the OPW, are progressing this scheme. Byrne Looby were appointed in May 2022 as the engineering and environmental consultants to deliver the project.<\/p>  <p>  The Cavan Town flood relief scheme is being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, where the Government is providing an investment of &euro;1.3 billion on flood relief measures over the next decade.  When completed, the proposed flood relief scheme will protect some 110 properties - 54 residential and 56 non-residential properties.<\/p>  <p>  The development of flood relief schemes involves five distinct, sequential and related stages. Currently the Cavan Town flood relief scheme is at Stage 1. The detailed scheme programme schedules that this stage will be concluded in Q.1 2025.<\/p>  <p>  Consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the general public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the proposals within the scheme. The first stakeholder and public consultation event was recently held in Cavan on 13 September 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW does not have Arterial Drainage Schemes on the River Erne system in County Cavan and is not responsible for channel maintenance in the area in accordance with its statutory requirements under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. However, parts of the Erne catchment are a Drainage District for which the local authority is responsible for ongoing maintenance.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW has no plans for further catchment-wide arterial drainage schemes. However, to target the management of flood risk outside of cities, towns and villages, in 2009 the OPW introduced the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme. The purpose of this Scheme is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas. Funding of &euro;463,302 has been approved for Cavan County Council under this scheme since 2009.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"question","counter":81,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[48284\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding the development of improved flood defences for Arklow town; if his Department is committed to having open public engagement on the proposed works; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":82,"content":"<p>The Arklow Flood Relief Scheme is being progressed by Wicklow County Council, with full funding provided by The Office of Public Works (OPW).  <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme was granted planning approval from An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la in July of this year, following a 2-day Oral Hearing on the Compulsory Purchases Order process in January, where members of the public were provided with a platform to formally voice their objections and communicate their views to An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la.  <\/p>  <p>  Presently Wicklow County Council is drafting consultancy briefs to bring the scheme to the next stage, with a view to appointing detailed design consultants in 2023.  <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme will protect the town of Arklow against coastal and river flooding.

I have provided &euro;85.9 billion in core expenditure. This funding will support the sustainable delivery of public services and infrastructure, and invest in the quality of life in Ireland to support a strong, fair and equal society into the future. This expenditure will ensure investment in our public sector workforce, improvements in our public services and investment in digitalisation and climate initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  In addition I have outlined non-core expenditure of &euro;4.5 billion which will provide for the continued support of the economy and society for the external challenges we face. Economic activity rebounded strongly as society reopened following the abatement of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, new challenges have emerged. The cost of living is increasing for many households. The war in Ukraine has meant the provision of significant humanitarian supports. Non-core allocations provide for measures in respect of a continued response to: Covid-19; Ukraine; and Brexit. This approach ensures resources can be provided on a temporary basis to respond to these challenges and then unwound when no longer required.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s aim is to deliver sustainable public expenditure, and Budget 2023 seeks to balance the need to protect the real value of public services and support citizens without adding further to inflationary pressures.<\/p>  <p>  Sustainable expenditure over the medium-term will be delivered through a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) which provides for:<\/p>  <p>  - Setting the core expenditure growth rate at sustainable levels; and<\/p>  <p>  - Providing ongoing improvements in public services.<\/p>  <p>  This Framework must be responsive to the economic and fiscal context.

Taking account of these developments, a temporary upward adjustment is being made to the MTEF.

This is done in parallel and in conjunction with ongoing appraisal, monitoring and managing of opportunities which arise from within the Leasehold Estate. <\/p>  <p>  Managing an office accommodation portfolio of this size and diversity present significant challenges, particularly in terms of modernisation.  For instance, due to OPW&rsquo;s heritage remit there will always be a proportion of OPW&rsquo;s office portfolio in heritage buildings. Such heritage buildings, by their nature, present very complex challenges. The OPW&rsquo;s existing office accommodation portfolio has a disproportionate amount of buildings dating from the early 1950&rsquo;s to the early 1990&rsquo;s. In many cases, these buildings are now raising significant issues for Client Departments, and are in need of major reinvestment.<\/p>  <p>  In order to address the ageing profile of the office accommodation, significant projects are currently underway to improve the condition and quality of the portfolio These projects have been supported by capital funding under the National Development Plan, and the National Recovery and Resilience Plan.

In addition, extensive analysis was conducted in the NDP in relation to sectoral demands, the macroeconomic context and a highly engaged public consultation process. The levels of capital spending, at close to 5% of GNI*, are already among the highest in the EU and are close to the limit of the overall capability to deliver in the coming decade. In these circumstances, the work detailed as part of the NDP provides assurance that the total quantum of the NDP allocation and the sectoral shares within that continue to be appropriate as part of Budget 2023.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Parks","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB06000"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[48290\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB06100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide an update on measures the Office of Public Works has made in collaboration with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce the 30 km\/h speed limit in the Phoenix Park.","asker":"1570","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>The Phoenix Park is a historic landscape of international importance and one of the largest designed landscapes in any European city.

The EU&rsquo;s Temporary Protection Directive provides the legal framework for assisting Ukrainians entering the EU who are officially called Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection (BOTPs). The Government&rsquo;s overall humanitarian response is coordinated with our EU partners and other countries. Because of the sudden and unprecedented numbers of new arrivals in the State, over such a short period of time, the Government, of necessity, has had to use a range of accommodation sources to facilitate displaced Ukrainians.  These include hotels, guesthouses, former religious buildings, sports halls, youth hostels, scout dens, arenas, holiday villages and tented camps as well as space in privately owned homes pledged through the Irish Red Cross.<\/p><p>On 11<sup>th<\/sup>April, the Government agreed that the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH) would lead on addressing the medium and long-term need to develop capacity for Ukrainian arrivals including the possible provision of modular accommodation. A Task-force was set up, led by the DHLGH, to oversee a 3-streamed approach to modular, refurbishments and new builds. <\/p><p>Arising from a Memorandum from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, considered on 26<sup>th<\/sup>April, the Government decided on a range of measures to boost the supply of accommodation for refugees arriving from Ukraine. These measures included a rapid build, volumetric modular units, option the evaluation of which was to be led by the Office of Public Works (OPW).<i><\/i><\/p><p>The OPW in conjunction with the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) representing specialist modular manufacturers and main contractors, developed an exemplar design and specification to ensure Building Regulation compliance. The design is based exclusively on rigid frame volumetric structures which represents the best method, having regard to the need for quality, speed, and simplicity of design and production, to achieve the scale of programme required. <\/p><p>The modular prototype that has been designed is a highly energy efficient (BER A2) durable single storey unit (with a useful life of 60 years). The 60 year lifespan was chosen to be consistent with housing standards and to maximise the long-term value to the exchequer, of the significant upfront investment involved, by providing units that can meet future accommodation needs, once the humanitarian crisis, induced by the War in Ukraine, has passed. <\/p><p>On 28<sup>th<\/sup>June, 2022, the Government authorised the roll-out of a modular homes programme to provide accommodation for 2,000 Ukrainians, predominantly women and children, in 500 family units at several sites across Ireland.

Sisk and Son is the main contractor that has been engaged to manage the site enabling works and to arrange for the procurement, transportation and installation of the modular units. Site evaluation works are being undertaken by my Office in collaboration with Sisk to finalise the list of sites necessary for the programme.

All other instruments, if liable to stamp duty, must be stamped by Revenue. The requirement to submit instruments to Revenue for stamping was provided for in section 12 SDCA 1999 and subsequently by the e-Stamping Regulations for the electronic filing of instruments, which came into operation on 1 June 2011.<\/p>  <p>  Section 127 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act (SDCA) 1999 provides that an unstamped instrument may not be used in evidence or for any purpose except as evidence in criminal proceedings or in civil proceedings by Revenue to recover stamp duty.  Accordingly, I am advised by Revenue that where there is a requirement to have an instrument stamped by Revenue and that requirement is not satisfied, apart from the circumstances outlined, section 127 provides that the instrument may not be used in evidence, including to prove title to the property which is the subject of the instrument. Banks and other bodies are not excluded from these requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Where a liability to stamp duty arises on an instrument of assignment of a chose-in-action and the instrument is not stamped, then, in accordance with section 127 SDCA 1999, the instrument may not be used in evidence or for any purpose except as evidence in criminal proceedings or in civil proceedings by Revenue to recover stamp duty. Prior to 7 December 2006, stamp duty was chargeable on debts such as debentures and bonds including mortgages securing loans on property situated in the State and any subsequent transfer of such debts where the amount secured exceeded &euro;254,000.  Section 100 Finance Act 2007 terminated this charge for such &lsquo;debt&rsquo; documents executed after this date. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding Dail Question  No. 242 (Ref: 48543\/22), I am also advised by Revenue that as stamp duty is a self-assessed duty, Stamp Certificates issue automatically once the return has been filed and any payment due, including, interest, surcharges or penalties, has been paid in full. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue is obliged to treat personal and business information of all taxpayers in the strictest of confidence and therefore it is not in a position to publish copies of certificates.

The scheme is aimed at businesses whose average unit gas or electricity price has risen by over 50% compared with their average unit gas or electricity price for the same period in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Pending State Aid approval, it is intended that the scheme will be up and running before the end of the year. Payments will be backdated to include September 2022. Whilst the finer details of the scheme are being finalised, in general, qualifying businesses will be able to apply to Revenue for a cash payment, representing an advance credit for energy expenses that are deductible for income and\/or corporation tax purposes. The credit will be calculated as 40% of the excess of the 2022 bill over the 2021 bill, capped at &euro;10,000 per business unit per month.  Overall caps at business level will also apply as set out in the EU Temporary Crisis Framework. <\/p>  <p>  The first thing any business can do to mitigate high energy bills is to take all steps possible to reduce energy use. A good first step to achieving greater energy efficiency is for businesses to gain a better understanding of their current usage.

Businesses can save their results and then monitor their performance over time. <\/p>  <p>  An Energy Audit voucher is available to many businesses from the SEAI. The Support Scheme for Energy Audits pays for a high-quality energy audit for SMEs that spend more than &euro;10,000 annually on energy.

The EU Working Time Directive is primarily a health and safety directive and its purpose is to lay down common minimum safety and health requirements for organising the working time of employees in all EU Member States.  <\/p><p>  Article 6 of the EU Directive on Working Time provides for limits to working time of not more than 48 hours a week on average (including any overtime).  The EU Directive provides that, when calculating limits to weekly working time, the hours worked may be averaged over a &ldquo;reference period&rdquo;.  This allows longer hours to be worked in certain weeks, provided that correspondingly shorter hours are worked in other weeks.<\/p><p>Section 15 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 transposes this EU Directive regarding working time.  For most employees the reference period is four months. For night workers it is two months.  For employees whose work is subject to seasonality (e.g. tourism or agriculture), or where employees are directly involved in ensuring continuity of essential services (e.g. hospitals, airports) or production (e.g. electricity), the reference period is six months.  The 48-hour average week may be averaged over a period of up to 12 months for employees who have entered into a collective agreement with their employer if that collective agreement is approved by the Labour Court.  Section 33 of the 1997 Act provides that an employer can employ an employee who has also worked for another employer but only where the aggregate of the periods for which such an employee does work for each of such employers respectively in that relevant period does not exceed the 48 hour total. Whenever the limit is breached the employer and employee shall each be guilty of an offence.<\/p><p>  The 1997 Act also provides for an uninterrupted minimum daily rest period of 11 hours, and at least 35 hours of uninterrupted weekly rest. These rest requirements along with the 48 hour (maximum) working week act as a safeguard to ensure that employees do not work excessive hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400073#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Prices","counter":244,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400073#WRD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":245,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[47940\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400073#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will discuss concerns regarding the energy crisis with an organisation (details supplied) to ensure workers in this industry are protected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":246,"content":"<p>I regularly meet and discuss concerns with members of the business community, labour representatives and other enterprise stakeholders.

In particular, my Department convenes the Business Energy Users Sub-group which was set up to assess the impacts of rising energy costs on businesses and to help inform the Government response. This includes business representative groups, as well as officials from my Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, Enterprise Ireland, and IDA Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the scale of the energy crisis, and the impact it is having on business energy costs. With this in mind, a significant package to help businesses with escalating energy costs and to plan for the future was announced in Budget 2023. <\/p>  <p>  This package includes the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme, which will provide qualifying businesses with up to 40% of the increase in electricity or gas bills - when compared to last year - up to a maximum of &euro;10,000 per month. This is intended to aid small businesses most and will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners. The scheme will be backdated to September and will run until at least February 2023. Through supporting businesses in meeting rising energy prices, this scheme will help protect the jobs of those working in impacted sectors. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is a new Growth &amp;amp; Sustainability Loan Scheme, which will make up to &euro;500 million in low-cost investment loans of up to 10 years available to SMEs, with no collateral required for loans up to &euro;500,000. A minimum of 30% of the lending volume will be targeted towards Environmental Sustainability purposes.  <\/p>  <p>  The reduced rate of VAT on gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9% has been extended until the 28th February 2023. We are also raising awareness around energy efficiency, helping businesses reduce the amount of energy they use in the first place and improving take-up of the approximately 20 existing schemes that we already have in place for business to help them reduce their energy costs. These include the Green4Micro programme and the Climate Toolkit for Business. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, small businesses can currently receive an energy audit voucher from SEAI to get professional advice on how to increase efficiency and reduce their costs. Other financial assistance includes the SEAI Community Grant and grants for microgeneration. <\/p>  <p>  I would also encourage any businesses seeking assistance to contact their Local Enterprise Office. The Local Enterprise Offices act as a &lsquo;first stop shop&rsquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance, and act as a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service for all government supports available to business owners throughout the country.

Gas and electricity retail markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime wherein electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. Operating within the overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the independent regulator, CRU, which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999.<\/p>  <p>  In cases where apartment blocks or groups of buildings are supplied with heat, rather than fuel, commercial rates apply, as the energy service operator is purchasing the fuel at a large scale for this purpose. In this regard, under the Multi-Unit Developments Act, 2011, Owners&rsquo; Management Companies are precluded from entering contracts of duration greater than three years, and this provides a possibility to renegotiate energy supplier contracts.<\/p>  <p>  District heating, within a structured framework, is a technology that, inter alia, offers the potential to diversify fuel supply used to heat the building sector;\u00a0can offer flexibility in fuel choice; and the ability to adapt to changes in the economic and policy landscape. The Climate Action Plan 2021 contains actions to\u00a0provide a solid basis for the appropriate expansion of district heating in Ireland, including the establishment of a multi-disciplinary District Heating Steering Group, which was established earlier this year. The Steering Group has met eight times to date and oversees a number of Working Groups that are conducting in-depth solutions based analysis of the key areas that must be addressed in order to support district heating. The Steering Group is working on recommendations to ensure that a robust governance and regulatory framework is put in place to support the expansion of district heating. This will help ensure consumer protection, and considerations in this regard encompass legacy group heating schemes that are already in operation.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland will soon initiate a pilot feasibility study to explore the technical viability and implications of moving existing group heating schemes to renewable energy sources.

Near Zero Energy Building requirements for new dwellings were introduced into the Building Regulations in April 2019 by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Many of the techniques required to achieve NZEB, such as improved fabric and renewables, have been introduced on a gradual basis into Part L of the Building Regulations since 2007.

This includes a new Electricity Cost Emergency Benefit Scheme through whereby &euro;550.47 (exclusive of VAT) will be credited to each domestic electricity account in three payments of &euro;183.49 in each of the following billing periods - November\/December 2022, January\/February 2023 and March\/April 2023 to an estimated 2.2 million domestic electricity accounts, including pay as you go accounts. The estimated cost of this scheme is &euro;1.211 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Under the previous Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment, a credit of &euro;176.22 (excluding VAT), was applied to all domestic electricity accounts through April, May and June 2022. It used the single eligibility criterion of an MPRN to ensure payments to each domestic electricity account as early as possible without any additional means testing. The payment was applied to domestic electricity accounts i.e. those which are subject to distribution use of system charges at the rate for urban domestic customers (DG1) or the rate for rural domestic customers (DG2).Upon the scheme&rsquo;s conclusion on 30 June 2022, over 2.1 million domestic electricity accounts had received the payment, with the value of these payments totalling almost &euro;377 million. This means 99.36% of all eligible domestic electricity accounts had the credit applied. The\u00a0need to use the meter point registration number (MPRN) as the unique\u00a0identifier, while ensuring a very broad reach and no\u00a0application or means testing,\u00a0does result in a relatively small number of households\u00a0not being able to access the payment.<\/p>  <p>  While the vast majority of people who rent their homes have their own MPRNs, there may be\u00a0some who could have arrangements whereby their landlord holds the MPRN and energy costs are paid to the landlord in a variety of ways. There is no data set identifying this cohort. However, my Department has worked with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Residential Tenancies Board to make people aware of the RTB mediation services available to tenants in the event landlords did not pass on the payment to tenants in these situations. The RTB has reported that contacts with them on this matter\u00a0were extremely low with regard to the first Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  My Department\u00a0also continues to\u00a0engage with the Department of Social Protection on how to support people struggling to pay with their energy\u00a0costs in the context of existing supports for meeting household bills. I note the comprehensive set of measures introduced as part of the Budget 2023 cost of living package aimed at supporting those most in need, including the expansion in eligibility for the Fuel Allowance and\u00a0an additional lump sum payment of &euro;400 for households in receipt of the Allowance, bringing\u00a0its\u00a0total amount for this winter\u00a0to a total of &euro;1,334.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400073#WRD06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":293,"content":"<p>Question No. 152 answered with Question No. 151.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":295,"content":"<p>Question No. 373 answered with Question No. 365.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":296,"content":"<p>Question No. 374 answered with Question No. 365.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":297,"content":"<p>Question No. 375 answered with Question No. 365.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":298,"content":"<p>Question No. 376 answered with Question No. 365.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":300,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400074#WRO00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":299,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400074#WRO00600"},{"type":"question","counter":300,"qnumday":377,"qnumall":"[48099\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400074#WRO00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason that prior teaching service by a teacher, which has not been reckoned for an incremental credit as teaching, cannot be reckoned as a credit for non-teaching experience (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":301,"content":"<p>The criteria for the award of Incremental Credit is outlined in Circular 10\/2001 for primary teachers and Circulars 29\/2007 and 29\/2010 for post primary teachers as agreed in the first instance, by the Teacher Conciliation Council (TCC). \u00a0This Council is comprised of representatives of the teacher unions, school management bodies, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Department of Education chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p>  <p>  These circulars provide for the recognition of both prior teaching service and prior relevant non-teaching service for incremental credit purposes.

As part of this, the CRU decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis which must be reflective of the market, or wholesale, value of the electricity, in line with the requirements of Article 21(2)(d) of the recast Renewable Energy Directive. We are aware that suppliers have published a range of CEG tariffs from &euro;13.5c\/kWh up to &euro;20c\/kWh which allows customers to shop around and switch suppliers to obtain the best rates for selling and purchasing electricity. <\/p><p>  It is important to note that a key aspect of the eligibility criteria for the CEG is that microgenerators must meet the definition for &lsquo;renewables self-consumers', as per the recast Renewable Energy Directive, This places a focus on generating electricity for one's own consumption, and thereafter with an entitlement to receive remuneration for excess electricity fed into the grid. <\/p><p>  This remuneration is different to the retail electricity market and the prices a domestic electricity consumer is charged by their supplier. Retail prices take account of the cost to purchase electricity on the wholesale market, while covering the operational costs of the company and their operating margin; and also remaining competitive in the marketplace.

They are also leading to windfall gains for some energy companies across Europe, particularly those companies involved in the production of fossil fuels and those who are producing energy at a much lower cost than the cost of gas.ESB&rsquo;s generation and supply businesses are required to operate separately, so increased profits from ESB&rsquo;s generation business cannot be used to offset costs incurred by Electric Ireland. Group profits are invested in critical networks, renewable generation and other important energy infrastructure, as well as used to pay tax and dividends to the Government.<\/p><p>Formal dividend policies are in place for all the Commercial Semi State Bodies (CSSBs) operating in the energy sector. These have been developed via the Shareholder Expectations Framework and, in each case, seek to strike an appropriate balance between the payment of dividends and re-investment in the business. Where the dividend target is based on adjusted profits after tax, higher profits arising in any given year in the ordinary course would fall within the scope of the normal targeted dividend payments. <\/p><p>ESB is experiencing greater than forecast profits and would be expected to return significantly higher Dividends in accordance with existing dividend policies. As a shareholding Minister, I have no specific power to direct ESB to pay a dividend.\u00a0 It would be a matter for the Board to determine at their discretion in any year whether a dividend should be declared when, in their opinion, the profits of the company justify such payment.

The mechanism by which this is done, be it by windfall taxes, dividends, or EU regulations is being finalised with a view to identifying the optimum solution. <\/p><p>On Friday I attended a meeting of the Council of Energy Ministers to finalise and approve the proposal, which is expected to raise additional revenues to be used to reduce the cost of energy for households and businesses. <font color=\"#0A0A0A\">\u00a0Decisions were taken on three matters in an agreed package including: (i) a windfall tax or levy on the surplus profits made by fossil fuel companies<\/font>with activities in the crude petroleum, natural gas, coal and refinery sector<font color=\"#0A0A0A\">; (ii) another levy on excess revenues that low-cost power producers make from soaring electricity costs; and (iii) \u00a0a mandatory 5% cut in electricity use during peak price periods.

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity. This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, including those relating to the installation of solar panels on the roofs of houses, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions for apartments and educational\/community\/sports buildings. <\/p>  <p>  The matter of solar development and the potential impact on protected structures has been a primary consideration of my Department throughout the development of the draft regulations.<\/p>  <p>  Both the Act and the Regulations contain provisions for the protection of, inter alia, protected structures by way of restrictions on exempted development. These provisions apply to the current solar planning exemptions and have not been amended as part of the current review.<\/p>  <p>  Section 57 of the Act clarifies the position with regard to planning exemptions for protected structures to provide that &ldquo;[&hellip;] the carrying out of works to a protected structure, or a proposed protected structure, shall be exempted development only if those works would not materially affect the character of: (a) the structure, or (b) any element of the structure which contributes to its special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, article 9 of the Regulations provides that development shall not be exempted development if it would, inter alia, &ldquo;consist of or comprise [&hellip;] the excavation, alteration or demolition&hellip;of places [&hellip;] of archaeological, geological, historical, scientific or ecological interest, the preservation, conservation or protection of which is an objective of a development plan [&hellip;]&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to what would materially affect the character of a protected structure and any uncertainty as to when planning permission is required, a person may contact the relevant planning authority and seek a declaration under section 5 of the Act that will confirm the position. In addition, a declaration in relation to a protected structure may be sought under section 57 of the Act by the owner or occupier of the structure.<\/p>  <p>  It will be open to any person to seek planning permission for proposed development affecting a protected structure. Buildings of architectural heritage significance have their role to play in climate change mitigation and there will be cases where the installation of solar panels will be acceptable but this is a matter for the planning authorities to decide on a case-by-case basis, either through the declaration processes or the planning system.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case in which a planning authority or the Board is or may be concerned, except in very specific circumstances, which do not apply in this case. <\/p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made.

This\u00a0will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation on the DEIS programme to in the region of &euro;180million.<\/p>  <p>  Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. <\/p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process aims to identify those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage or the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.\u00a0 The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at\u00a0www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools\/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed.\u00a0The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019\/2022 which can be found\u00a0on the gov.ie website.<\/p>  <p>  Following the processing of the appeal received regrettably there was no change to the outcome of the initial application of the refined DEIS identification model to the school. My Department, however, will continue to support the school and the school community as they deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to their students and young learners. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023.

The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400077#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":594,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400077#WRN01700"},{"type":"question","counter":595,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[47987\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400077#WRN01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a school (details supplied) in County Kerry will be permitted to retain its current teaching allocation in 2023 given the likelihood of future enrolments from Ukrainian families moving into the area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":596,"content":"<p>The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.<\/p>  <p>  For the 2022\/23 school year,\u00a0the staffing schedule for\u00a0primary schools has been improved by one point and schools\u00a0will be provided with class teachers on the basis of\u00a01 teacher for every 24 pupils which is a historical low ratio, with lower thresholds applying to DEIS Urban Band 1 schools.<\/p>  <p>  The staffing process contains an appeals mechanism for schools\u00a0to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria\u00a0to an independent Primary Staffing Appeals Board.\u00a0 Details of the appeal process are available in Circular 25\/2022.<\/p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy has been informed that its staffing appeal has been approved on\u00a0 a provisional basis, pending confirmation of the school's enrolment reaching the required retention figure on 30th September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400077#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":597,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400077#WRN02000"},{"type":"question","counter":598,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[48051\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400077#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a school bus ticket will be issued to a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1596","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":599,"content":"<p>The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.\u00a0 In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures.<\/p>  <p>  Ticket registration for the 2022\/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications\/registrations were received for mainstream school transport.

We have seen 392 new special classes open, bringing the total of special classes to 2,543 opened nationwide for the 2022\/23 school-year. The 392 new special classes for 2022\/23 is broken down by 260 at primary level and 132 at post primary level.<\/p><p>For 2023, a further 370 special classes will open, taking the total number of special classes to over 2,900 in 2023.<\/p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the types and locations of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at www.ncse.ie. <\/p><p>NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for the next school year 2023\/2023. Every support will be made available to schools to progress the opening of special classes in the shortest possible timeframe<\/p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.<\/p><p>My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.<\/p><p>I want to reassure you also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400078#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":644,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400078#WRP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":645,"qnumday":395,"qnumall":"[48388\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400078#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the capital expenditure that has been incurred for the building, equipment and furnishing of post-primary schools in areas (details supplied); the expenditure for the acquisition of sites; the expenditure that has been incurred for the transportation to school of students attending schools in temporary locations during such building; the number of new and additional post-primary school places created; and the number new post-primary schools completed, respectively by county in each of the years 2011 to 2021 and to date in 2022, in tabular form.; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":646,"content":"<p>The information requested is not readily available.

A late date of entry into insurable employment can result in an unusually low divisor, and  consequently a higher yearly average than would be representative of the number of contributions<\/p>  <p>  To this end, the National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that the current &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system, be replaced with a &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; (TCA), which would make the level of pension directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life, with significant pension credits granted to people who have taken time out of the workplace to perform caring duties.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2018, the Government announced an Interim TCA to calculate the entitlement of pensioners who reached state pension age on or after 1 September 2012 (i.e. those born on or after 1 September 1946) and who had a reduced rate pension entitlement based on post Budget 2012 rate bands. All pensioners who have reached state pension age since September 2012, therefore, have seen both Yearly Average and interim TCA methods applied and they receive whichever rate is most beneficial.<\/p>  <p>  In September, I announced the Government's intention for a phased\u00a010-year transition to the TCA method and the abolition of the Yearly Average approach for calculating individual State Pension (Contributory) entitlement, to commence from January 2024.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The current model of Interim TCA method (also known as the Aggregated Contribution Method) will become the definitive TCA model, i.e., 40 years, or 2,080 contributions, required to qualify for a maximum State Pension (Contributory) payment rate.\u00a0\u00a0The TCA model includes provision for 10 years of PRSI Credits and 20 years of HomeCaring periods, but with a cap of 20 years combined PRSI Credits and HomeCaring periods.\u00a0 This facilitates a more equitable approach as pension outcomes are in line with the total number of contributions paid and credited, with significant provision for years  of caring in the home.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400079#WRQ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Rates","counter":729,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400079#WRQ03400"},{"type":"question","counter":730,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[48074\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400079#WRQ03500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if an alternative tax year can be used to calculate the illness benefit payment rate for a person (details supplied) given that their employment was restricted in 2020 according to Government guidelines during the Covid pandemic; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":731,"content":"<p>Illness Benefit is a social insurance scheme provided by my Department to those who cannot work due to illness and who have the required number of Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The rate of Illness Benefit payable to a person is based on their average weekly earnings while in employment in the relevant tax year.

The Department is charged with identifying where a person has an income support need and providing that income support, for example in the form of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, a disability allowance, or a carer's allowance.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The main income supports to carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.\u00a0Spending in 2022 is expected to amount to over &euro;1.5 billion.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The two principal conditions for receipt of\u00a0Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are that full time care and\u00a0attention is required and being provided, and that the means test which applies is satisfied. Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is primarily aimed at carers on low incomes who live with and look after certain people who need full-time care and attention. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that eligibility for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is not contingent on a particular disability or illness or the severity of disability or incapacity of the person being cared for.<\/p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payment of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally. This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency - be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring. The application of a means-test not only ensures that the recipient has an income need but also that scarce resources are targeted to those with the greatest need.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Last year I made significant changes to the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance with the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance increasing to &euro;350 per week for single carers, and to &euro;750 per week for a couple. I also an increased the capital disregard for carers from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. The changes took effect in June and mean that many Carers on a reduced rate moved to a higher payment. In addition, Carers who up to now did not qualify for a payment due to means will be brought into the Carers Allowance system for the first time.<\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to provide the estimated annual cost of providing a non means tested full rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy. While the Department can establish how many people are in receipt of a reduced payment and where Domiciliary Care Allowance is in payment, the Department of Social Protection has no administrative data on the level capacity\/incapacity of the child.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are other income supports available for carers provided by the Department of Social Protection that are not means-tested; these include:<\/p>  <p>  - The Carers Benefit payment is an entitlement based on social insurance contributions. Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is a payment made to insured people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person(s) in need of full-time care. It is payable for a period of 2 years (104 weeks) for each care recipient and may be claimed over separate periods up to a total of 2 years (104 weeks). <\/p>  <p>  - Domiciliary Care Allowance is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.\u00a0 It is not means tested. As part of Budget 2023, I increased the Domiciliary Care Allowance rate by &euro;20.50 to &euro;330 per month with effect from January 2023. \u00a0There is no restriction on the number of children in respect of whom Domiciliary Care Allowance may be claimed. In other words, a person caring for more than one child who qualifies for Domiciliary Care Allowance may claim the monthly allowance for each child. <\/p>  <p>  - The annual Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is available to all carers providing\u00a0full-time care to a person with a disability or an older person,\u00a0regardless of the carer&rsquo;s means or social insurance contributions. The\u00a0objective of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is to support carers in their\u00a0caring role and carers may use the grant in a manner that is appropriate\u00a0\u00a0to their needs. The grant is paid in respect of each person being cared\u00a0for to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers. As part of\u00a0Budget Measures 2021, I increased the rate of the grant by &euro;150.\u00a0 The current rate of &euro;1,850 came into effect from June 2021. The Carer's\u00a0Support Grant is automatically paid to people in receipt of Carer's\u00a0Allowance (full and reduced rates), Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Domiciliary Care allowance in June of each year. <\/p>  <p>  Last week, as part of Budget 2023, I announced a further range of measures for carers including:<\/p>  <p>  - A Cost of Living Double Payment to carers in October,<\/p>  <p>  - A &euro;500 Cost of Living payment for people receiving Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant which will be paid in November,<\/p>  <p>  - Carers will also receive the Christmas Bonus Double Payment in early December,<\/p>  <p>  - A &euro;12 increase in the maximum rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit with effect from January 2023 with proportionate increases for people receiving a reduced rate,<\/p>  <p>  - A &euro;2 increase for each Qualified Child bringing rates to &euro;50 for Over 12s and &euro;42 for Under 12s from January 2023, and<\/p>  <p>  - The Half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will be disregarded in the means assessment for Fuel Allowance with effect from January 2023.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I also announced that, in respect of the Domiciliary Care Allowance, along with the rate increase above that this allowance will be available in respect of children with severe illness or disability who remain in hospital for up to six months after birth.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep the range of income supports provided to family carers by this Department under review and will ensure that consultations with carers' representative groups continue so that the overall objectives of the carer income support schemes provided are met. However, any further changes to the current supports provided by this Department would have implications for overall spending and could only be addressed in an overall budgetary context.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400080#WRR01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":769,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[48366\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400080#WRR01400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will take into account mortgage repayments in the means test system for the carer's allowance in cases in which the parent of a child who is incapacitated, is applying for the carer's allowance for their child on a full-time basis and they are providing this care in the home in which the mortgage is being repaid; her views on whether this would provide a more accurate and fairer representation of a household's day-to-day financial situation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":770,"content":"<p>The system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need.\u00a0 The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.\u00a0\u00a0This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  By its nature, the means test takes account of the income a person or couple has in terms of cash, property\u00a0- other than the family home -\u00a0and capital.\u00a0\u00a0It does not take account of a person&rsquo;s expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I announced significant\u00a0improvements to the means test\u00a0for Carer's Allowance, in recognition of the vital role that carers play in society.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The general weekly income disregard for Carer's Allowance increased from June 2022 from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person, and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for a couple.\u00a0 This will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for the scheme, and those currently in receipt of a reduced payment may now receive a higher payment.<\/p>  <p>  The capital disregard was also increased in June from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.\u00a0 This will allow carers who have accumulated savings, often to provide care for a loved one, to retain an entitlement to Carer's Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, as part of Budget 2023, I was pleased to announce a &euro;12 increase in weekly payments from next January.

Tusla provides a continuum of services including early intervention and family support services, child protection and welfare services and alternative care services to identify and respond to the needs of the children and families who are referred. <\/p>  <p>  Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website. Reports can also be made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS). Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by AGS or Tusla but usually both agencies work together in such cases.<\/p>  <p>  Where immediate or potential danger is identified to a child from a parent or guardian, this referral is treated with the highest priority and response by Tusla. In the first instance Tusla will ensure, under its Signs of Safety national practice guidance, that the child is safe and that an immediate safety network is identified to support the child and parents. Simultaneously, Tusla will endeavour to work in partnership with the parent(s) or guardian(s) to assess the cause of the difficulties and provide, or refer to, the necessary services. A safety network for the child will be identified and implemented under the Signs of Safety national practice model to ensure the immediate safety of the child or children within the family. Where it is assessed, following completion of an intake and initial assessment process, that significant child protection concerns exist and potential risk of harm to the child by the parents is identified, a child protection case conference is convened. At such a conference a decision may be made to place the child on the child protection notification system (CPNS). Where this threshold of risk is not met (that is, a child protection case conference is not required or the child is not placed on the CPNS), a Tusla led safety plan will be implemented for the child. <\/p>  <p>  If the outcome of the initial screening and visit to the child and family as part of the initial social work preliminary enquiry is that a child cannot stay in the care of their parent or guardian due to immediate risk of significant harm to the child&rsquo;s safety or life, consideration will be given to whether there are appropriate extended family members to provide immediate care for the child and also whether consideration of admission to foster or residential care, age appropriate to the child&rsquo;s care needs, is necessary to ensure the child&rsquo;s \/young person&rsquo;s safety. An admission to care will occur either with the voluntary consent of the parent(s) or guardian(s) or by Tusla making an application to the district court for an emergency care order or interim care order application.<\/p>  <p>  In some circumstances where child protection concerns exist in relation to new born infants Tusla, following a detailed assessment by the social work teams, may consider as appropriate to the child&rsquo;s safety and the parent&rsquo;s needs, whether a residential parenting assessment unit for mother and baby is required. This would potentially be a matter for Court oversight and representation by legal teams. The appointment of a Guardian ad litem would also be considered by the Court in these circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Where necessary Tusla seeks to engage relevant services and professionals to provide appropriate supports for parents. Acute crises for parents that necessitate interventions by mental health or addiction services would be a matter for the HSE in close liaison with Tusla teams in respect of care arrangements of the children concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla is also tasked with providing family support services in accordance with Section 8 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013, which are provided directly and by commissioning family support services through its community and voluntary sector partners.<\/p>  <p>  Family support services are focused on early intervention with the aim of promoting and protecting the health, well-being and rights of children, young people and their families. At the same time, particular attention is given to those who are vulnerable or at risk. <\/p>  <p>  The number of family and community supports are wide and varied.  Tusla is engaged in the following family and community supports: <\/p>  <p>  - Family Resource Centres<\/p>  <p>  - Family therapeutic services<\/p>  <p>  - Prevention Partnership Family Support<\/p>  <p>  - Parenting Information\/ Parenting 24\/7<\/p>  <p>  - Child and Youth Participation <\/p>  <p>  - Meitheal<\/p>  <p>  - Psychological Services<\/p>  <p>  - Early Years (pre-school)<\/p>  <p>  - School Age Services<\/p>  <p>  - Alternative Education and Registration Services<\/p>  <p>  These services include those delivered directly by Tusla, including those provided under the Prevention, Partnership, and Family Support (PPFS) service, and those which are funded or co-funded by Tusla. Tusla also directly supports family support services through structures such as Family Resource Centres (FRCs) and the Area Based Childhood Programme. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has also established Child and Family Support Networks (CFSNs), which are collaborative networks of community, voluntary and statutory providers. CFSNs seek to improve access to support services for children and their families.  Each network consists of services that play a role in the lives of children and families in that area. Local CFSNs co-ordinators can be contacted to provide further details on the services available in a local area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400081#WRS01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Transport","counter":833,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400081#WRS02000"},{"type":"question","counter":834,"qnumday":459,"qnumall":"[47908\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400081#WRS02100","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of domestic flights for work purposes taken by him, Ministers of State in his Department and Department staff for each of the years 2019 to 2021 and to date in 2022, in tabular form.","asker":"1468","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":835,"content":"<p>There were no domestic flights taken by the DCEDIY Minister, Minister of State or any official during the period from 2019 to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400081#WRS02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Protection","counter":836,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400081#WRS02300"},{"type":"question","counter":837,"qnumday":460,"qnumall":"[47936\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400081#WRS02400","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the delays in payments to persons hosting Ukrainian refugees (details supplied).","asker":"1613","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":838,"content":"<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine on 24 February, and the invoking of the temporary protection Directive by the European Union shortly afterwards, my Department has worked intensively as part of the cross-governmental response to the Ukraine crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The operational challenges brought about by responding to the conflict are significant.

It also provides for the identification of remains and their return to family members, where possible. <\/p>  <p>  The legislation was developed in response to the abhorrent situation at the site of the former Mother and Baby institution in Tuam, Co. Galway, where it was confirmed that children&rsquo;s remains had been discovered that were interred in a manifestly inappropriate manner and the Government was advised that a full forensic-standard excavation, recovery and identification of those remains could not take place under current legislation. To avoid delays in responding to any similar situations that may arise in the future, the Act is not site specific and also allows for excavations and identification programmes at other institutional sites should manifestly inappropriate burials be discovered.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Act provides for significant consultation in relation to an intervention. Most notably, the Act requires the appointment of an Advisory Board to guide and support the Director of an intervention in his or her role. The Board, which is to be chaired by a former coroner or someone with coronial expertise, will have members with a range of expertise and backgrounds, including scientific experts, former residents and\/or family members of the deceased. A Director is required to consult with the Board at regular intervals, including at key decisions points in an intervention. Other consultation and engagement mechanisms include a requirement that a Director make final arrangements for recovered remains in line with the wishes of family members as well as a requirement that a Director provide regular updates on an intervention to family members, stakeholders and the public.<\/p>  <p>  The Act provides that, following the establishment of an Office of Director, a relevant Minister appoint a Director to manage and oversee an intervention. My officials are currently liaising with the Public Appointments Service in relation to the recruitment process for a Director of Authorised Intervention, Tuam. The criteria and other relevant material relating to the recruitment and appointment of the Director will be published as part of the recruitment process. Preparations are also underway in my Department for the appointment of an Advisory Board and the details of the appointment process will be available in due course.<\/p>  <p>  Tendering for the specific expertise required to undertake an intervention is a matter for a Director appointed to manage and oversee the process. In this regard the Act requires that a Director ensures that excavation, recovery and post-recovery analysis of remains is undertaken by appropriately qualified persons at a forensic standard and in accordance with international best practice and professional rules and guidelines. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Vienna Protocol was prepared to provide guidance in relation to the treatment of remains of people of Jewish origin. The Institutional Burials Act was not designed to contain specific provisions regarding different religious or ethnic groups. However, it does provide for a Director to have regard to any known religious practices of the deceased when making final arrangements for remains where there are no family members or stated wishes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400081#WRS05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":864,"content":"<p>Question No. 468 answered with Question No. 467.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":865,"content":"<p>Question No. 469 answered with Question No. 467.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":866,"content":"<p>Question No. 470 answered with Question No. 467.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":868,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[48118\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400081#WRS05500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 412 of 20 September 2022, if he will examine the information (details supplied) and reconsider the request for those workers in Section 56 agencies who have not had their pay restored, to receive a pay increase in line with inflation and the cost-of-living; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":869,"content":"<p>Section 56(14) of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 stipulates that 'an arrangement under this section shall not give rise to an employment relationship between a service provider, its employees or agents on the one hand and the Agency on the other'.

In December 2021, Government adopted the 25 recommendations contained in an Expert Group report, <i>Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC).<\/i>On 15 September, I launched Together for Better, the new funding model for early learning and childcare. This new funding model will support delivery of ELC and SAC for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families.<\/p><p>Together for Better brings together three major elements, the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, including the Access and Inclusion Model, the National Childcare Scheme and Core Funding, in line with the Employment Regulation Orders coming into effect.<\/p><p>Core Funding is the new funding stream worth &euro;266 million in 2023 to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and improve affordability for parents as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.  <\/p><p>As a condition of receiving Core Funding, a Partner Service agrees not to increase the fee for any Service Type which was extant on September 30 2021 or introduce an extra charge for any component of that Service Type.  The fees policy for each service is outlined in the Parent Statement, a copy of which must be shared with parents within a month of Core Funding beginning or the parent joining the service, whichever is the later. This gives parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensure that increases to NCS subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time.<\/p><p>To date, over 90% of eligible services have become Partner Services under Core Funding, committing to working in partnership with the State for the public good, and to a freeze on parental fees. A list of Partner Services is available here: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie\/together-for-better\/ <\/p><p>Budget 2023 introduced further enhancements to the NCS. From January 2023, any family who is not already at the maximum hourly subsidy will see an increase in their subsidy. All families who would currently receive the minimum (universal) subsidy of 50c per hour will receive &euro;1.40. <\/p><p>For those who receive a subsidy under the income assessed subsidy, the amount of the increase will taper down as they approach the maximum hourly subsidy rate. The reason for this is that the aim is to reduce co-payments by an average of 25 per cent; those currently in receipt of the highest subsidies pay the lowest co-payments.<\/p><p>The amount of increase individual families will see in their per hour subsidy, will differ widely depending on their current subsidy.<\/p><p>As the State does not employ early years educators and school-age childcare practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector.  However, there has recently been an important and historic development with the setting of new minimum hourly rates for various roles in the Early Years Services sector.<\/p><p>On 15 September 2022, the first ever Employment Regulation Orders for the Early Years Services sector came into effect, setting new minimum hourly rates of pay for various roles in the Early Years Services Sector as follows:<\/p><p>- &euro;13.00 for Early Years Educators\/ School-Age Childcare practitioners;<\/p><p>- &euro;14.00 for Early Years Lead Educators \/ School-Age Childcare co-ordinators;<\/p><p>- &euro;15.50 for Graduate Early Years Lead Educators \/ School-Age Childcare co-ordinators<\/p><p>- &euro;15.70 for Deputy Managers;<\/p><p>- &euro;16.50 for Managers; and <\/p><p>- &euro;17.25 for Graduate Managers.<\/p><p>The Orders are being supported by Government&rsquo;s Core Funding scheme which commenced on the 15<sup>th<\/sup>September, and will see increases in funding to early learning and childcare services to support improvements in staff wages, alongside a commitment to freeze parental fees. It is estimated that 73% of those working in the sector will see their wages rise as a result of the Employment Regulation Orders with the wages of 50% of employees in the sector expected to rise by 10% or more, and the wages of 20% of employees are expected to rise by 20% or more.<\/p><p>I am also committed to addressing other challenges which may impact on the recruitment and retention of staff in the sector. In December 2021, I published &quot;Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC), 2022-2028&quot;. Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare. One of its five &quot;pillars&quot; comprises commitments aimed at supporting recruitment, retention and diversity in the workforce, and it includes actions to raise the profile of careers in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400082#WRT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":913,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400082#WRT04100"},{"type":"question","counter":914,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[48515\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400082#WRT04200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he will provide the accommodation capacity of each direct provision centre in County Wicklow by centre for each year since they were first used; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":915,"content":"<p>Please see information below, as requested by the Deputy: <table>    <tr>       <th>Direct Provision Centres Co.

I am conscious of the extremely positive impact these organisations have on improving outcomes for children, young people and families all over Ireland. <\/p><p>I understand that where the Deputy refers to Section 38 and Section 39, he is referring to the Health Act 2004, which is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) agreement reached between the Department of Health and HSE and trade unions representing staff in certain section 38 &amp;amp; 39 organisations is a matter for the Minister for Health.<\/p><p>The Child and Family Agency Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Tusla, which included the transfer of certain functions of the Health Service Executive to the new Agency. The Act was signed into law on the 15th December 2013 following substantial consultation and legislative scrutiny.<\/p><p>Community and voluntary organisations who provide valuable services to help Ireland's children and families had, prior to the establishment of Tusla, been receiving funding from the HSE. Since establishment of Tusla in 2014, many of those organisations began to receive their funding from Tusla. The arrangements that Tusla enters into with a person or organisation for the provision of child and family services have been subject to the provisions of Part 8 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. In accordance with Section 56 of that Act, Tusla commissions service providers in over 600 community and voluntary sector bodies to deliver services on its behalf. Such relationships are then governed under a service level agreement. These service level agreements provide clarity to all involved on what funding is to be provided and what service is expected in return for that funding.<\/p><p>The service providers operate independently of Tusla and are responsible for their own internal resource management including the recruitment of employees and the terms and conditions under which their staff are employed. The remuneration of the staff of these bodies is therefore a matter for these organisations as employers.  <\/p><p>The commissioning of services is an operational matter for Tusla. Section 56 (2) requires that Tusla determines the maximum funding it proposes to make available during the course of each year under each arrangement and the level of service it expects to receive in return for that funding. <\/p><p>Section 56 (14) is clear that Tusla's arrangements with such providers do &quot;<i>not give rise to an employment relationship between a service provider, its employees or agents on the one hand and the Agency on the other<\/i>'.<\/p><p>The net funding available to Tusla is determined annually as part of the estimates process and notified to the agency through my annual Performance Statement. In response to the Performance Statement, Tusla will prepare a Business Plan for 2023. In this way the precise level of funding to be allocated to such section 56 organisations for the delivery of specific services will be determined by Tusla, having regard to the overall level of funding available in 2023. <\/p><p>Following Budget 2023, I am pleased to announce that Tusla's funding allocation will be &euro;935m in 2023, an increase 4% on 2022. This underlines my commitment to supporting Tusla and its service delivery partners. The Government greatly appreciates the valuable work of the community and voluntary sector to assist Tusla with its statutory remit and in achieving its strategic objectives. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400082#WRT05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":930,"content":"<p>Question No. 492 answered with Question No. 491.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pay","counter":932,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400083#WRU00200"},{"type":"question","counter":933,"qnumday":493,"qnumall":"[48570\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400083#WRU00300","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the reason that section 56 organisations were excluded from pay restoration (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":934,"qnumday":494,"qnumall":"[48571\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400083#WRU00400","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the reason that Section 38 organisations were excluded from public sector pay agreements and pay restoration when re-designated Section 56 organisations (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":935,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 493 and 494 together.<\/p>  <p>  Section 56(14) of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 stipulates that 'an arrangement under this section shall not give rise to an employment relationship between a service provider, its employees or agents on the one hand and the Agency on the other'.

As in any statutory scheme, a core principle of the scheme is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment for applicants as part of the means assessment process. All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. <\/p>  <p>  The Supplementary Welfare Allowance is not included in the list of income disregards for the purposes of the Student Grant Scheme as it is, generally speaking, a short term temporary payment made whilst awaiting a decision on an established\/long term social welfare payment. As soon as a person goes on to an eligible payment e.g. disability allowance, this would be considered a change in circumstances (under the Student Grant Scheme -see details below).<\/p>  <p>  Where the Supplementary Welfare Allowance is held for 15 consecutive calendar months, it is deemed an eligible long-term payment for the special rate of maintenance under the Student Grant Scheme.  The Disability Allowance is also an eligible long term payment for the special rate of Student Grant and is an income disregard if it is being paid to the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  I am not familiar with the particulars of this case however, students can determine their eligibility at susi.ie\/eligibility\/income\/. The student may also wish to discuss his eligibility for SUSI assistance by calling the SUSI Support Desk on 0818 888 777.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined above, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same.<\/p>  <p>  The change of circumstances provision is a well-established procedure and it can also operate at scale.  For example, over 10,000 applicants declared a change of circumstance in the 2020\/21 academic year.

This additional level of support towards free tuition fees will benefit c.94,000 additional students. <\/p>  <p>  The reduction will be administered with the assistance of the Higher Education Institutions a student is attending. It is anticipated that students paying the student contribution in instalments will have the amount reduced from their next instalment by the HEI.

Officials are working with the HEA and the sector to finalise the details of this allocation and HEIs will communicate with students directly.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore I have been clear and consistent in stating that I believe the value of the student contribution share, as paid by students and families compared to the states contribution, is too high. <\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2023, I made two changes to student contribution thresholds reduce the cost of education for students and families (for college year 2023\/24): <\/p>  <p>  - increased the income limit from &euro;55,240 to &euro;62,000 for students to avail of the 50% Undergraduate Student Contribution <\/p>  <p>  - new support to the value of &euro;500 for families on qualifying incomes earning between &euro;62,000 and &euro;100,000. <\/p>  <p>  In considering the matter of the payment of the remaining &euro;2,000 contribution for academic year 22\/23, my Department has previously requested that higher education institutions put in place arrangements to facilitate the payment of the student contribution in instalments. The standard payment instalment option is of payment in two instalments and aligns with the two semesters of the academic year.<\/p>  <p>  As autonomous bodies the institutions are responsible for implementation of policy and procedure in relation to the collection of the student contribution outside the general scheme of payment in two instalments. It is important to acknowledge that HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways to student needs.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays a vital role in enforcing road traffic law and in making our roads safer for all road users, including vulnerable road users, such as cyclists.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is responsible by law for the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters and deployment of resources. As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Minister Ryan that the protection of vulnerable road users is prioritised in the new Road Safety Strategy. Protecting vulnerable road users involves a range of actions aside from legislative and law enforcement measures. Improvements in infrastructure, such as dedicated cycle lanes, will reduce the danger by keeping vulnerable road users separate from motorized traffic. The Government has committed to investing up to &euro;1.8 billion in cycling and walking infrastructure during its lifetime. I understand that the Road Safety Authority also engages in public information and education initiatives to raise driver awareness of the specific risks to vulnerable road users.    <\/p>  <p>  As regards the establishment of a dedicated online portal for the submission of video evidence of potential violations of road traffic legislation, the Deputy may be aware that the current Traffic Watch facility allows for members of the public to report driver behaviour to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Matters reported via this facility are forwarded to the relevant District Office for investigation. Similarly, citizens may make complaints to any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or through the Garda website.<\/p>  <p>  Under Action 29 of the Road Safety Strategy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will explore the potential of an online portal for road users to upload footage of road traffic offences which could assist in prosecution. This action is due to be completed by Q4 of this year.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, there are strict standards in legislation relating to photographic evidence obtained by Garda&iacute;. While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed that private dash cam footage may be used during a prosecution, its use must be in accordance with best evidential practices and entails ensuring structures exist around continuity of evidence.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Transport has further advised that any decision to allow film by members of the public to be used in evidence in road traffic cases would raise questions of reliability of, and possible tampering with, the apparatus used, as well as potential privacy issues. It might also raise questions about why Garda apparatus was held to a standard not required of private individuals, if both were ultimately to be treated as reliable evidence. <\/p>  <p>  Road traffic enforcement remains a core policing function of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda National Roads Policing Bureau ensures a consistent approach to road safety and enforcement of road traffic legislation across the country. This is achieved through coordination of enforcement measures and development of policy based on research and analysis of statistics and by engaging in campaigns in partnership with other State Agencies, notably the Road Safety Authority.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to emphasise that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to the employment of specific enforcement operations.<\/p>  <p>  I would of course encourage any member of the public to report any incidents of dangerous driving directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400084#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":1002,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400084#WRX00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1003,"qnumday":556,"qnumall":"[48528\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400084#WRX00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps that are being taken to facilitate the travel of minors following the suspension of the re-entry visa for non-national children; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1004,"content":"<p>The requirement for a re-entry visa for children under 16 remains suspended until further notice.

It is envisaged that these measures will be supported by a significant package of additional capacity supports to GP practices; consultations are to be held with the IMO on how to best to implement these capacity supports. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, and while GPs are self-employed practitioners and therefore may establish practices at a place of their own choosing, the Government recognises there is a need to support rural GP practices and to make establishing a rural practice a more attractive prospect. The proposed package of capacity supports announced in Budget 2023 builds on steps already taken by the Government to increase the number of GPs working throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement the additional annual expenditure provided for general practice will have increased by &euro;211.6m per annum by 2023.

The ICGP aims to have 350 training places available for new entrants per year by 2026.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, preparatory work has commenced on a strategic review of GP services to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future.

The completion of Phase One of the roll-out, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in fully operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Regional Health Areas across the country.<\/p><p>Phase Two of the roll-out of the Model of Care will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, provided through the public health system. In this regard, funding was secured in Budget 2023 to support access to advanced AHR treatments, including, crucially, to allow the commencement of Phase Two of the roll-out of the Model of Care.<\/p><p>  This investment will facilitate the first steps to be taken towards the provision of a complete publicly-provided fertility service, which is the ultimate objective of Government. In particular, it will allow the historic development of the first National Advanced AHR Centre, delivering IVF and ICSI through a wholly public clinic. This is scheduled to open in the early part of 2024 and will provide a nationwide service, with all six Regional Fertility Hubs having equity of access for onward referral to it, via a shared care pathway. Subject to the provision of additional funding in future, it is envisaged that additional National Advanced AHR Centres will be developed and become operational on a phased basis elsewhere in the country.<\/p><p>  The 2023 allocation will also be utilised to support the Regional Fertility Hubs in order to expand their scope of services next year by introducing the provision of IUI (intrauterine insemination), a significant, yet less complex and less intrusive, component of AHR treatment. <\/p><p>  Separately, as an interim measure, I have instructed that some funding be made available to support access to advanced AHR treatment via private providers from September 2023. <\/p><p>  My officials, in conjunction with NWIHP, are now planning for the operationalisation of both the publicly- and privately- provided service, including the development of a national eligibility framework, as well as determining how the interim funding for private treatments will be provided to individual eligible patients. I expect that this process will involve, where appropriate, engagement with relevant stakeholder groups. <\/p><p>  Overall, my Department and the Government is fully committed, through the full implementation of the Model of Care for Infertility, to ensuring that patients always receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced AHR treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system. The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400089#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1310,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400089#WREE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1311,"qnumday":698,"qnumall":"[48506\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400089#WREE01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of recommendations that have been actioned with regard to a report on mental health services in County Roscommon; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1312,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400089#WREE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1313,"content":"<p>Question No. 699 answered with Question No. 588.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1314,"content":"<p>Question No. 700 answered with Question No. 588.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disease Management","counter":1315,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400089#WREE02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1316,"qnumday":701,"qnumall":"[48510\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400089#WREE02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the directive or clinical recommendations that the HSE gives its medical consultants for prescribing insulin pumps for adults diagnosed with type 1 diabetes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1517","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1317,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400089#WREE02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1318,"content":"<p>Question No. 702 answered with Question No. 591.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1319,"content":"<p>Question No. 703 answered with Question No. 592.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":1320,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400089#WREE02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1321,"qnumday":704,"qnumall":"[48520\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400089#WREE02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical doctors presently registered to work in the State by gender (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1616","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1322,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware the Medical Council recently published its 2021 Workforce Intelligence Report.

Throughout the pandemic, the overall national response to COVID-19 has had a specific and sustained focus on older persons, particularly those resident in nursing homes.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Act 2007, as amended, provides the overarching regulatory framework for the nursing home sector with further detailed requirements set out in Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and Quality Standards. Under the Health Act 2007, as amended, and related Regulations, the registered provider is responsible and accountable for the quality of care and safety of residents in nursing homes (designated centres) and all nursing homes are required to have a clear complaints procedure in place. Part 10 of the Care and Welfare Regulations sets out the requirements in this regard. The person-in-charge of the nursing home will be able to provide information on the complaints process in place in the nursing home and assistance on how to make a complaint. If a complainant is unhappy with the response received, he or she can appeal the decision as provided for in the Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Ombudsman can also examine complaints relating to the administrative actions of nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the nursing home concerned.<\/p>  <p>  In cases of complaint about a healthcare professional, the resident or family can also complain directly to the employee's professional regulatory body, for example the Nursing and Midwifery Board or the Irish Medical Council.<\/p>  <p>  For those nursing homes that are under the aegis of the Health Service Executive (HSE), there is a HSE-wide complaints process. Details of this process can be accessed on the HSE website at www.healthcomplaints.ie. <\/p>  <p>  Separately, HIQA welcomes information in relation to designated centres that come within its regulatory remit. As a regulator, HIQA has no legal role in examining individual complaints, however, the Authority does take into account all information it receives, including complaints from the public, when carrying out inspections and this range of information informs a risk-based approach to regulation. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, my Department is examining complaints processes across the nursing home sector including information on best practice, the level of standardisation, and the views of key stakeholders including residents and families, with a view to determining the need to further develop enablers such as policy, legislative and\/or guidance instruments to strengthen and enhance current arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, the Patient Advocacy Service (PAS), which currently supports residents in HSE-operated nursing homes to make complaints, will begin its rollout to private nursing homes at the end of 2022.

The Fourth Progress Report on implementation of the recommendations of Expert Panel is available here.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2022, a Public Health Reform Expert Advisory Group (PHREAG) commenced its work with Terms of Reference approved by Government. It was tasked with identifying learnings from the public health components of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland and internationally with a view towards strengthening public health including health protection generally and future public health threat and pandemic preparedness specifically. Further details on the PHREAG are available here.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2022, the Minister for Health established the COVID-19 Advisory Group (CAG), to consider and advise on how best to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s medium to long-term preparedness for future challenges posed by COVID-19. The CAG has considered lessons learned from the pandemic in its work. The recommendations of the CAG, with relevant World Health Organization (WHO), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and European Commission guidance, have informed my Department&rsquo;s strategic approach to the management of COVID-19 for autumn\/winter 2022\/2023.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has indicated that a comprehensive evaluation of how the country managed COVID-19 will provide an opportunity to learn lessons from our experiences in dealing with a pandemic over the past two years. This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar type emergency arrives. Consideration is being given as to what the best model for this evaluation will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400089#WREE04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1336,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400089#WREE04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1337,"qnumday":710,"qnumall":"[48574\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400089#WREE04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason that a person (details supplied) remains waiting for their cataract operation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1338,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The issues raised were considered in the context of Budget 2023 deliberations.<\/p><p>  On Tuesday 27th September, I announced details of my Department&rsquo;s 2023 Budget. The 2023 Estimates provide a gross Vote of &euro;2.14 billion, the highest ever level of funding for the Department, and represents an increase of &euro;283m on the 2022 provision, or a 13% increase overall, to support farmers, fishers, and rural and coastal communities.<\/p><p>  This budget supports farm families dealing with the immediate and ongoing fallout of the illegal invasion of Ukraine and lays the groundwork for strategic supports for the sector over the next five years, through the new &euro;10 billion CAP Strategic Plan (CSP).  I have secured up to &euro;500m in 2023 to support farmers in their efforts to tackle the challenges in climate, biodiversity and water quality, including funding for 30,000 places in a new flagship agri environment scheme, ACRES.  I am introducing an &euro;8m grant aid scheme to support the spreading of lime, as well as an enhanced Multi Species Sward \/ Red Clover scheme, helping  farmers deal with rising fertiliser prices and move towards the reduction of chemical fertiliser. I have also secured an increase in the TAMS budget to &euro;90m, to fund the proposed large-scale investment in on-farm renewables for farmers, subject to the approval of the European Commission. This will help fund the proposed increase to 60% grant rate and a standalone investment ceiling of &euro;90,000 for solar installation.<\/p><p>  Separately, I am seeking EU Commission approval for a new scheme to continue the beef welfare measures which were previously funded under BEEP-S. This new scheme will sit alongside the new &euro;150\/cow Suckler Carbon Efficiency Scheme, and a &euro;20 million Sheep Welfare Scheme, maintaining the budget for targeted beef and sheep supports of over &euro;100 million. Beef and sheep farmers will also be well placed to benefit from the enhanced supports for fodder aid, for environmental measures and the supports available for the supports available for farmers transitioning to organic farming.<\/p><p>  While taxation policy is primarily the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Finance, I work closely with him to ensure that it is consistent with the Government's priorities for the agri-food sector.<\/p><p>  I am delighted that we agreed a new Accelerated Capital Allowance for Slurry Storage. This will drive further investments in slurry storage and management, consequently improving water quality, facilitating nutrient-use efficiency that reduces dependence on expensive artificial fertilisers, and reducing emissions. This measure is a strong signal of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting farmers in improving environmental sustainability.<\/p><p>  We also agreed on the renewal of vital tax reliefs including Stamp Duty Relief for Young-Trained Farmers and Stock Relief for Young-Trained Farmers and Registered Farm Partnerships. Generational renewal is critical to the future of the agri-food sector and national taxation measures, together with the support available under the CAP, represent a substantial commitment to young farmers. The renewal of Capital Gains Tax Relief for Farm Restructuring and Stamp Duty Relief for Farm Consolidation encourage the consolidation of farm holdings, reducing fragmentation and improving the operation and viability of farms. <\/p><p>  The Government has provided welcome supports in response to the current cost of living crisis. The Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme will provide important support to businesses including farmers and food businesses. The continuation of the reduction of excise duty on agricultural diesel to nil will also help alleviate costs for the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400091#WRGG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":1449,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400091#WRGG04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1450,"qnumday":748,"qnumall":"[48027\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400091#WRGG04500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the Forestry Service can refuse a non-grant aid application for an afforestation licence on the basis of the productivity of the site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1451,"qnumday":749,"qnumall":"[48028\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400091#WRGG04600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the Forestry Service can refuse a non-grant aid application for an afforestation licence based on species selection; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1452,"qnumday":750,"qnumall":"[48029\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400091#WRGG04700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a reaction and nitrogen survey is a requirement for non-grant aid application for an afforestation licence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1453,"qnumday":751,"qnumall":"[48030\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400091#WRGG04800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the basis on which the Forestry Service can decide that land is unplantable on a non-grant aid application for an afforestation licence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1454,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 748 to 751, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Under Section 32 of the Forestry Act 2014 and Regulation 20 of the Forestry Regulations 2017 I am empowered and in some cases I am statutorily obliged to refuse an application for an Afforestation Licence, whether or not the applicant has also applied for financial assistance under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme, on a number of grounds.<\/p>  <p>  - These grounds relate to the protection of the environment generally, ensuring of good forestry practice, the preservation of amenities, public health or safety, protection from flooding, and preservation of water quality; and specifically to the prevention of adverse impacts or significant effects on human health, animal or plant health, water quality, archaeological  site or features, areas of special amenity, European sites, or nature conservation.

These are primarily addressed through herd restrictions, enhanced use of novel blood tests such as gamma interferon, implementation of the wildlife programme and trace animal testing.<\/p>  <p>  The combined efforts of all stakeholders in the TB programme in Roscommon is making an effective contribution towards the continued reduction in TB levels in Roscommon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400092#WRHH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes","counter":1498,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400092#WRHH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1499,"qnumday":765,"qnumall":"[48575\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400092#WRHH03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when an appeal by a person (details supplied) will conclude; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1500,"content":"<p>I inform the Deputy that the Agriculture Appeals Office operates independently of my Department.<\/p><p>I have been advised that the records of the Agriculture Appeals Office indicate that an Appeals Officer decision issued concerning an appeal from the person-named in July 2019.<\/p><p>The Appeals Office received a request for a review of this decision from the person named and the Director issued her decision on this in April 2021.<\/p><p>The Director issued her decision on this request, revising the decision of the Appeals Officer in April 2021 and I am advised that, in the circumstances, the appeal is now closed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400092#WRHH03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":1501,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400092#WRHH03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1502,"qnumday":766,"qnumall":"[48589\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400092#WRHH03900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will publish and provide a copy of a report (details supplied) which was supposed to accompany a project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1612","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1503,"content":"<p>A legal and regulatory review of forestry licensing was carried out by Philip Lee agency and, following extensive stakeholder engagement, their Report was published on 29th June, 2022.
