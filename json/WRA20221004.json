On 30 August, I laid the foundation stone for Phase 2 of the Ulster Canal restoration which is fully-funded by Government including through the Shared Island Fund, and on track to be completed next year.<\/p>  <p>  On 29 September, I and the Minister for Housing, Heritage and Local Government announced 25 awards totalling more than &euro;4.3 million under the Shared Island Local Authority Development Funding Scheme, at an event in Cavan which brought together 23 different Councils from across the island. Through the Scheme they are now working in cross-border partnerships to progress feasibility work over the next year on new collaborative investment projects, with a view to accessing further funding in both jurisdictions for delivery stage, including through the Shared Island Fund. Projects address shared concerns for the island including on biodiversity, sustainable tourism, circular economy, innovation; and cultural and creative industries.<\/p>  <p>  The Shared Island research programme commissioned by my Department is continuing. Final reports from the Economic and Social Research Institute will be published later this month on productivity levels on the island; and, next month, on coordination of renewable energy policies and electricity infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s focus is on inclusive civic engagement with all communities and political traditions. The Shared Island Dialogue series has so far directly involved some 2,000 citizens and civic representatives through 11 dialogue events. On 29 June, I addressed a Dialogue with over 150 young people in attendance in Derry on the theme of Identities on a Shared Island. The next Dialogue will be on Arts and Culture at Queen&rsquo;s University in Belfast on 13 October, with participation by Minister Catherine Martin TD for the Government and Executive Minister for Communities Deirdre Hargey MLA. The Dialogues are being made available online and reports are being published, to inform wider civic and political discussion.<\/p>  <p>  On 29 September, I participated in the launch of the first report of the All-Island Women&rsquo;s Forum; and on Monday (3 October) I launched the report of the iCommunity hub led by The Wheel and Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action. Both projects followed on from our Shared Island engagements, and supported by the Government are forging significant new civic connections and making recommendations on common concerns for communities across the island. The Government will positively consider their recommendations, as all Departments work to develop new investment, policy and cooperation projects to contribute to our Shared Island initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400070#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":11,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 41 to 65, inclusive, resubmitted.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Programmes","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400070#WRA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[44929\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400070#WRA01200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his views on the national reform programme for the European Semester 2022 that was published by his Department in April 2022.","asker":"1522","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[44930\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400070#WRA01300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his views on the national reform programme.

This would include headquarters for central Government Departments, State security services, etc. <\/p>  <p>  The overall conclusion that can be drawn from the recently published Spending Review Paper is that, when the State is acquiring significant property for office accommodation, the new build or purchase options should be considered on a case by case basis in accordance with the parameters of the Public Spending Code, particularly if there is a long-term requirement, subject always to the prevailing market conditions and available funding. <\/p>  <p>  To meet its strategic objectives of modernising the estate and making it more efficient, OPW constantly look to appraise the potential of the existing Owned state accommodation portfolio for future redevelopment of sites, refurbishment opportunities and potential asset recycling prospects.  This is done in parallel and in conjunction with ongoing appraisal, monitoring and managing of opportunities which arise from within the Leasehold Estate.  The extensive research undertaken for the Review provides the OPW with an important evidence base on which to ground decisions on the overall development of the portfolio into the future.<\/p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan (2021 &ndash; 2030), the OPW has been successful in securing funding for a broad range of projects, which includes a number of office developments that will further enhance the balance of leased and owned accommodation. One of the major capital projects that is being funded by the EU within Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), is the deep energy retrofit of the state owned Tom Johnson House in Dublin 4, which will reduce the buildings primary energy use by 75% and become the new headquarters of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications. OPW will continue to appraise development and redevelopment opportunities on existing state owned sites with a view to seeking additional funding for investments that will meet the operational needs of client departments and agencies in modern energy efficient buildings.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, the OPW have an ongoing programme of fabric upgrades and energy efficiency retrofit projects in central government buildings to enhance the overall condition and performance of our buildings. This will ensure the enhanced performance of existing buildings and avoid the need to replace these buildings through the commercial office market.  <\/p>  <p>  The Blended Working Policy Framework for the Civil Service was published in March 2022, and Departments and Agencies are currently in the process of finalising their Departmental Blended Working Policies. Inevitably, the decisions currently being formulated across each Department and Agency on patterns of attendance in the office will have a direct impact on how the physical office space will be utilised into the future. The Chairman of the OPW has recently written to all Secretary Generals across Government asking them to consider the use of their existing accommodation in the context of long term Blended Working. Departments are being asked to account for the full optimisation of existing accommodation in the context of their Blended Working policies.<\/p>  <p>  Lastly, the Spending review paper notes the opportunity to acquire properties at a lower rent in locations outside of the Central Business District. Each property acquisition is looked at on a case by case basis, and in the context of the business needs of each Client Department. If the Client Department has confirmed that it is feasible to locate the accommodation requirement outside of the Central Business District, OPW will examine this opportunity and assess available properties in the context of the Public Spending Code.  <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Spending Review paper provides an evidence base for long term decision making on the future direction of the office accommodation portfolio. Every requirement will continue to be assessed on a case by case basis in the context of the business needs of client departments, the urgency and scale attached to the accommodation request, the overarching OPW Estate Strategy, the duration of the requirement, and the availability of capital funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry","counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB01200"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[48263\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the amount of funding that has been allocated from the carbon tax to the agricultural sector to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":65,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government recognises the special economic and social role that agriculture plays in Ireland, but also commits to the creation of schemes that will encourage and incentivise farmers to farm in a greener and more sustainable way.

This work was supported by a Cross-Border Technical Co-ordination Group. These groups have met on numerous occasions since, most recently on 14 September this year, to coordinate on the identification of areas of potentially significant flood risk, to share information and agree approaches to the production of flood mapping in border areas and to coordinate on the identification of measures and the preparation of Flood Risk Management Plans.<\/p>  <p>  The Erne catchment was assessed under the OPW&rsquo;s Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Programme (CFRAM), in close co-operation with DfI Rivers. The study considered increasing watercourse conveyance of the Erne system to lower water levels as a measure to reduce flood risk. This study revealed that water levels in the majority of the Erne catchment in Ireland, remain unchanged regardless of any works that could be carried out in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Flood Risk Management Plan for the Erne River Basin developed under CFRAM and published in May 2018 included a flood relief scheme for Cavan Town. Cavan County Council as the Lead Authority, in partnership with the OPW, are progressing this scheme. Byrne Looby were appointed in May 2022 as the engineering and environmental consultants to deliver the project.<\/p>  <p>  The Cavan Town flood relief scheme is being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, where the Government is providing an investment of &euro;1.3 billion on flood relief measures over the next decade.  When completed, the proposed flood relief scheme will protect some 110 properties - 54 residential and 56 non-residential properties.<\/p>  <p>  The development of flood relief schemes involves five distinct, sequential and related stages. Currently the Cavan Town flood relief scheme is at Stage 1. The detailed scheme programme schedules that this stage will be concluded in Q.1 2025.<\/p>  <p>  Consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the general public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the proposals within the scheme. The first stakeholder and public consultation event was recently held in Cavan on 13 September 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW does not have Arterial Drainage Schemes on the River Erne system in County Cavan and is not responsible for channel maintenance in the area in accordance with its statutory requirements under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. However, parts of the Erne catchment are a Drainage District for which the local authority is responsible for ongoing maintenance.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW has no plans for further catchment-wide arterial drainage schemes. However, to target the management of flood risk outside of cities, towns and villages, in 2009 the OPW introduced the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme. The purpose of this Scheme is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas. Funding of &euro;463,302 has been approved for Cavan County Council under this scheme since 2009.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"question","counter":81,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[48284\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding the development of improved flood defences for Arklow town; if his Department is committed to having open public engagement on the proposed works; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":82,"content":"<p>The Arklow Flood Relief Scheme is being progressed by Wicklow County Council, with full funding provided by The Office of Public Works (OPW).  <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme was granted planning approval from An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la in July of this year, following a 2-day Oral Hearing on the Compulsory Purchases Order process in January, where members of the public were provided with a platform to formally voice their objections and communicate their views to An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la.  <\/p>  <p>  Presently Wicklow County Council is drafting consultancy briefs to bring the scheme to the next stage, with a view to appointing detailed design consultants in 2023.  <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme will protect the town of Arklow against coastal and river flooding.

I have provided &euro;85.9 billion in core expenditure. This funding will support the sustainable delivery of public services and infrastructure, and invest in the quality of life in Ireland to support a strong, fair and equal society into the future. This expenditure will ensure investment in our public sector workforce, improvements in our public services and investment in digitalisation and climate initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  In addition I have outlined non-core expenditure of &euro;4.5 billion which will provide for the continued support of the economy and society for the external challenges we face. Economic activity rebounded strongly as society reopened following the abatement of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, new challenges have emerged. The cost of living is increasing for many households. The war in Ukraine has meant the provision of significant humanitarian supports. Non-core allocations provide for measures in respect of a continued response to: Covid-19; Ukraine; and Brexit. This approach ensures resources can be provided on a temporary basis to respond to these challenges and then unwound when no longer required.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s aim is to deliver sustainable public expenditure, and Budget 2023 seeks to balance the need to protect the real value of public services and support citizens without adding further to inflationary pressures.<\/p>  <p>  Sustainable expenditure over the medium-term will be delivered through a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) which provides for:<\/p>  <p>  - Setting the core expenditure growth rate at sustainable levels; and<\/p>  <p>  - Providing ongoing improvements in public services.<\/p>  <p>  This Framework must be responsive to the economic and fiscal context.

Taking account of these developments, a temporary upward adjustment is being made to the MTEF.

This is done in parallel and in conjunction with ongoing appraisal, monitoring and managing of opportunities which arise from within the Leasehold Estate. <\/p>  <p>  Managing an office accommodation portfolio of this size and diversity present significant challenges, particularly in terms of modernisation.  For instance, due to OPW&rsquo;s heritage remit there will always be a proportion of OPW&rsquo;s office portfolio in heritage buildings. Such heritage buildings, by their nature, present very complex challenges. The OPW&rsquo;s existing office accommodation portfolio has a disproportionate amount of buildings dating from the early 1950&rsquo;s to the early 1990&rsquo;s. In many cases, these buildings are now raising significant issues for Client Departments, and are in need of major reinvestment.<\/p>  <p>  In order to address the ageing profile of the office accommodation, significant projects are currently underway to improve the condition and quality of the portfolio These projects have been supported by capital funding under the National Development Plan, and the National Recovery and Resilience Plan.

In addition, extensive analysis was conducted in the NDP in relation to sectoral demands, the macroeconomic context and a highly engaged public consultation process. The levels of capital spending, at close to 5% of GNI*, are already among the highest in the EU and are close to the limit of the overall capability to deliver in the coming decade. In these circumstances, the work detailed as part of the NDP provides assurance that the total quantum of the NDP allocation and the sectoral shares within that continue to be appropriate as part of Budget 2023.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Parks","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB06000"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[48290\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400071#WRB06100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide an update on measures the Office of Public Works has made in collaboration with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce the 30 km\/h speed limit in the Phoenix Park.","asker":"1570","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>The Phoenix Park is a historic landscape of international importance and one of the largest designed landscapes in any European city.

The EU&rsquo;s Temporary Protection Directive provides the legal framework for assisting Ukrainians entering the EU who are officially called Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection (BOTPs). The Government&rsquo;s overall humanitarian response is coordinated with our EU partners and other countries. Because of the sudden and unprecedented numbers of new arrivals in the State, over such a short period of time, the Government, of necessity, has had to use a range of accommodation sources to facilitate displaced Ukrainians.  These include hotels, guesthouses, former religious buildings, sports halls, youth hostels, scout dens, arenas, holiday villages and tented camps as well as space in privately owned homes pledged through the Irish Red Cross.<\/p><p>On 11<sup>th<\/sup>April, the Government agreed that the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH) would lead on addressing the medium and long-term need to develop capacity for Ukrainian arrivals including the possible provision of modular accommodation. A Task-force was set up, led by the DHLGH, to oversee a 3-streamed approach to modular, refurbishments and new builds. <\/p><p>Arising from a Memorandum from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, considered on 26<sup>th<\/sup>April, the Government decided on a range of measures to boost the supply of accommodation for refugees arriving from Ukraine. These measures included a rapid build, volumetric modular units, option the evaluation of which was to be led by the Office of Public Works (OPW).<i><\/i><\/p><p>The OPW in conjunction with the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) representing specialist modular manufacturers and main contractors, developed an exemplar design and specification to ensure Building Regulation compliance. The design is based exclusively on rigid frame volumetric structures which represents the best method, having regard to the need for quality, speed, and simplicity of design and production, to achieve the scale of programme required. <\/p><p>The modular prototype that has been designed is a highly energy efficient (BER A2) durable single storey unit (with a useful life of 60 years). The 60 year lifespan was chosen to be consistent with housing standards and to maximise the long-term value to the exchequer, of the significant upfront investment involved, by providing units that can meet future accommodation needs, once the humanitarian crisis, induced by the War in Ukraine, has passed. <\/p><p>On 28<sup>th<\/sup>June, 2022, the Government authorised the roll-out of a modular homes programme to provide accommodation for 2,000 Ukrainians, predominantly women and children, in 500 family units at several sites across Ireland.

Sisk and Son is the main contractor that has been engaged to manage the site enabling works and to arrange for the procurement, transportation and installation of the modular units. Site evaluation works are being undertaken by my Office in collaboration with Sisk to finalise the list of sites necessary for the programme.

The credit will be calculated as 40% of the excess of the 2022 bill over the 2021 bill, capped at &euro;10,000 per business unit per month.  Overall caps at business level will also apply as set out in the EU Temporary Crisis Framework. <\/p>  <p>  The first thing any business can do to mitigate high energy bills is to take all steps possible to reduce energy use.

The EU Working Time Directive is primarily a health and safety directive and its purpose is to lay down common minimum safety and health requirements for organising the working time of employees in all EU Member States.  <\/p><p>  Article 6 of the EU Directive on Working Time provides for limits to working time of not more than 48 hours a week on average (including any overtime).

This allows longer hours to be worked in certain weeks, provided that correspondingly shorter hours are worked in other weeks.<\/p><p>Section 15 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 transposes this EU Directive regarding working time.  For most employees the reference period is four months. For night workers it is two months.  For employees whose work is subject to seasonality (e.g. tourism or agriculture), or where employees are directly involved in ensuring continuity of essential services (e.g. hospitals, airports) or production (e.g. electricity), the reference period is six months.  The 48-hour average week may be averaged over a period of up to 12 months for employees who have entered into a collective agreement with their employer if that collective agreement is approved by the Labour Court.  Section 33 of the 1997 Act provides that an employer can employ an employee who has also worked for another employer but only where the aggregate of the periods for which such an employee does work for each of such employers respectively in that relevant period does not exceed the 48 hour total. Whenever the limit is breached the employer and employee shall each be guilty of an offence.<\/p><p>  The 1997 Act also provides for an uninterrupted minimum daily rest period of 11 hours, and at least 35 hours of uninterrupted weekly rest.

In particular, my Department convenes the Business Energy Users Sub-group which was set up to assess the impacts of rising energy costs on businesses and to help inform the Government response. This includes business representative groups, as well as officials from my Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, Enterprise Ireland, and IDA Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the scale of the energy crisis, and the impact it is having on business energy costs. With this in mind, a significant package to help businesses with escalating energy costs and to plan for the future was announced in Budget 2023. <\/p>  <p>  This package includes the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme, which will provide qualifying businesses with up to 40% of the increase in electricity or gas bills - when compared to last year - up to a maximum of &euro;10,000 per month. This is intended to aid small businesses most and will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners. The scheme will be backdated to September and will run until at least February 2023. Through supporting businesses in meeting rising energy prices, this scheme will help protect the jobs of those working in impacted sectors. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is a new Growth &amp;amp; Sustainability Loan Scheme, which will make up to &euro;500 million in low-cost investment loans of up to 10 years available to SMEs, with no collateral required for loans up to &euro;500,000. A minimum of 30% of the lending volume will be targeted towards Environmental Sustainability purposes.  <\/p>  <p>  The reduced rate of VAT on gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9% has been extended until the 28th February 2023. We are also raising awareness around energy efficiency, helping businesses reduce the amount of energy they use in the first place and improving take-up of the approximately 20 existing schemes that we already have in place for business to help them reduce their energy costs. These include the Green4Micro programme and the Climate Toolkit for Business. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, small businesses can currently receive an energy audit voucher from SEAI to get professional advice on how to increase efficiency and reduce their costs. Other financial assistance includes the SEAI Community Grant and grants for microgeneration. <\/p>  <p>  I would also encourage any businesses seeking assistance to contact their Local Enterprise Office.

Gas and electricity retail markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime wherein electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. Operating within the overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the independent regulator, CRU, which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999.<\/p>  <p>  In cases where apartment blocks or groups of buildings are supplied with heat, rather than fuel, commercial rates apply, as the energy service operator is purchasing the fuel at a large scale for this purpose. In this regard, under the Multi-Unit Developments Act, 2011, Owners&rsquo; Management Companies are precluded from entering contracts of duration greater than three years, and this provides a possibility to renegotiate energy supplier contracts.<\/p>  <p>  District heating, within a structured framework, is a technology that, inter alia, offers the potential to diversify fuel supply used to heat the building sector;\u00a0can offer flexibility in fuel choice; and the ability to adapt to changes in the economic and policy landscape. The Climate Action Plan 2021 contains actions to\u00a0provide a solid basis for the appropriate expansion of district heating in Ireland, including the establishment of a multi-disciplinary District Heating Steering Group, which was established earlier this year. The Steering Group has met eight times to date and oversees a number of Working Groups that are conducting in-depth solutions based analysis of the key areas that must be addressed in order to support district heating.

Improving these homes has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier and cheaper to heat and light.   Near Zero Energy Building requirements for new dwellings were introduced into the Building Regulations in April 2019 by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Many of the techniques required to achieve NZEB, such as improved fabric and renewables, have been introduced on a gradual basis into Part L of the Building Regulations since 2007. These incremental improvements have effectively eased the transition and minimised the additional effort and costs required to achieve the NZEB performance for dwellings.<\/p>  <p>  The NZEB requirements make it more attractive for builders and homeowners to further incorporate renewable technologies and move away from fossil fuels for heating.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A modelling and cost study was carried out by an external cost economic consultant for the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for NZEB.

This includes a new Electricity Cost Emergency Benefit Scheme through whereby &euro;550.47 (exclusive of VAT) will be credited to each domestic electricity account in three payments of &euro;183.49 in each of the following billing periods - November\/December 2022, January\/February 2023 and March\/April 2023 to an estimated 2.2 million domestic electricity accounts, including pay as you go accounts. The estimated cost of this scheme is &euro;1.211 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Under the previous Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment, a credit of &euro;176.22 (excluding VAT), was applied to all domestic electricity accounts through April, May and June 2022. It used the single eligibility criterion of an MPRN to ensure payments to each domestic electricity account as early as possible without any additional means testing. The payment was applied to domestic electricity accounts i.e. those which are subject to distribution use of system charges at the rate for urban domestic customers (DG1) or the rate for rural domestic customers (DG2).Upon the scheme&rsquo;s conclusion on 30 June 2022, over 2.1 million domestic electricity accounts had received the payment, with the value of these payments totalling almost &euro;377 million. This means 99.36% of all eligible domestic electricity accounts had the credit applied. The\u00a0need to use the meter point registration number (MPRN) as the unique\u00a0identifier, while ensuring a very broad reach and no\u00a0application or means testing,\u00a0does result in a relatively small number of households\u00a0not being able to access the payment.<\/p>  <p>  While the vast majority of people who rent their homes have their own MPRNs, there may be\u00a0some who could have arrangements whereby their landlord holds the MPRN and energy costs are paid to the landlord in a variety of ways. There is no data set identifying this cohort. However, my Department has worked with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Residential Tenancies Board to make people aware of the RTB mediation services available to tenants in the event landlords did not pass on the payment to tenants in these situations. The RTB has reported that contacts with them on this matter\u00a0were extremely low with regard to the first Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  My Department\u00a0also continues to\u00a0engage with the Department of Social Protection on how to support people struggling to pay with their energy\u00a0costs in the context of existing supports for meeting household bills.

They are also leading to windfall gains for some energy companies across Europe, particularly those companies involved in the production of fossil fuels and those who are producing energy at a much lower cost than the cost of gas.ESB&rsquo;s generation and supply businesses are required to operate separately, so increased profits from ESB&rsquo;s generation business cannot be used to offset costs incurred by Electric Ireland. Group profits are invested in critical networks, renewable generation and other important energy infrastructure, as well as used to pay tax and dividends to the Government.<\/p><p>Formal dividend policies are in place for all the Commercial Semi State Bodies (CSSBs) operating in the energy sector. These have been developed via the Shareholder Expectations Framework and, in each case, seek to strike an appropriate balance between the payment of dividends and re-investment in the business.

The ten-year rule was adopted in recognition of the need to strike a balance between achieving standards that offer the customer confidence, comfort and safety, and allowing industry members to operate successfully.\u00a0\u00a0I would note that the Irish 10-year rule for standard taxis and hackneys is not particularly onerous by comparison with other jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  Wheelchair accessible taxis and hackneys are permitted to operate up to 15 years of age. No maximum permissible age is prescribed for limousines in recognition of both the vintage nature of many of these vehicles and their generally reduced mileage.<\/p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 pandemic, standard age limits for taxis and hackneys were extended on several occasions, and are currently extended through to the end of 2022.  This change helped ensure no operator exited the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle.<\/p>  <p>  Within the last month a series of global circumstances has, in the NTA&rsquo;s view, considerably worsened the capability of taxi and hackney licence holders to secure new vehicles, with lead times of one year not uncommon already. Therefore, the NTA has recently proposed to temporarily extend the maximum permissible age for taxis and hackneys with a current final operation date in 2023 and 2024, such that no current vehicle licence holder is forced out of the industry because a replacement vehicle cannot be purchased.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA opened a public consultation on this proposal on 19 September 2022, which runs until 12 October 2022.

That release put the number of people deemed to be in the rental sector (excluding social housing tenants) at just over 600,000. Importantly, due to the method by which the data is collected (PPS numbers), the total is deemed to be overwhelmingly comprised of adults, as well as an underestimate of the actual number of people renting.<\/p>  <p>  There are just over 100,000 people in supported tenancies (HAP, RAS, AHBs). When these are excluded the number of eligible tenants falls to c. 500,000.

That brings the estimated number of eligible tenants to just under 400,000.

On Budget Day this Tuesday, Minister McGrath and I announced a &ldquo;cost-of-living&rdquo; package of once-off measures worth &euro;4.1 billion. This was accompanied by budgetary measures for 2023 worth &euro;6.9 billion.<\/p>  <p>  The total size of Budget 2023 is &euro;11 billion. This package builds on the fiscal supports the Government has already provided, with the aim of helping families, individuals and businesses deal with the rising cost of living.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Property Tax (LPT) was introduced in 2013 to provide a stable and sustainable funding base for local authorities and is a significant base-broadening measure. LPT has yielded over &euro;4 billion for Local Authorities since its introduction.<\/p>  <p>  All property owners benefit from the essential local services LPT helps to fund. The proper functioning of these services is important for every community and household. If the tax were abolished, the funding gap would ultimately need to be met by the Exchequer in the form of increased general taxation. For these reasons, I do not plan to abolish the Local Property Tax. <\/p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 provides for a cut in the main rate of the tax and widening of the valuation bands to make the changes affordable in accordance with the Programme for Government commitment. As these changes were implemented for the 2022 LPT year, this meant that the majority of homeowners saw either a decrease or no change in their LPT liability. Where increases arose, the majority were by a single band. <\/p>  <p>  The LPT legislation provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain circumstances to assist individuals who may have difficulty paying the tax. A qualifying person may opt to defer, or partially defer, payment of the tax. The deferred tax remains as a charge on the property, and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed.<\/p>  <p>  It is also possible to apply for a deferral on the grounds of hardship if a person suffers an unexpected and unavoidable significant loss or expense. Further information regarding the deferral of LPT is available on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie\/en\/property\/local-property-tax\/deferral-of-payment\/index.aspx<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it has engaged extensively with residential property owners who are experiencing financial difficulties, to agree flexible LPT payment arrangements that best suit their circumstances and avoid unnecessary hardship, and Revenue has assured me that this will continue to be the case.<\/p>  <p>  Any property owners experiencing financial difficulties can avail of a wide range of flexible payment options both in respect of 2022 liabilities and for any previous years where liabilities remain outstanding. The full range of payment options, which includes phased arrangements, are available to property owners on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie\/en\/property\/local-property-tax\/paying-your-lpt\/index.aspx.<\/p>  <p>  The LPT payment compliance rate for 2022 currently stands at 96%. Payment of the LPT for 2023 is not due until January 2023, at the earliest.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, property owners experiencing difficulties in meeting their LPT obligations can contact Revenue through MyAccount at www.revenue.ie or by calling the LPT helpline (01) 7383626.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400076#WRF05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400076#WRF05700"},{"type":"question","counter":401,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[48092\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400076#WRF05800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 372 of 8 September 2022, if he will provide a breakdown on a local-authority basis of the amount derived from the 108,744 properties brought within the scope of local property tax for the year 2022 to date.","asker":"1489","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":402,"content":"<p>Further to the Deputy's question of 8 September 2022, I am advised by Revenue that the following table presents a breakdown of the Local Property Tax (LPT) liability associated with the 108,744 properties brought within the scope of LPT for the year 2022, on a Local Authority basis.

Currently individuals with incomes of less than &euro;13,000 are exempt from USC, which can include modest occupational pensions. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has one of the most progressive personal income tax systems in the world, which plays a crucial role in the process of income redistribution. Our redistributive tax system has been acknowledged by the IMF, the OECD and the ESRI. In my view, a broad-based, progressive income tax system, where the majority of income earners make some contribution but according to their means, is the most fair and sustainable income tax system in the long term. As such, I have no current plans to amend the current treatment of pensions for USC purposes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400077#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":410,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400077#WRG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":411,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[48228\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400077#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to review the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector between today&rsquo;s date and the expiration of the 9% rate in February 2023; and if the rate will be abolished on the last day of February 2023.","asker":"1489","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":412,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the 9% rate for the tourism and hospitality sectors was reintroduced in Budget 2021 from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021 at an estimated cost of &euro;401m.

Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any CAT is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives gifts or inheritances that are in excess of the relevant Group threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess.  There are three Group thresholds:<\/p>  <p>  - the Group A threshold (currently &euro;335,000) applies, inter alia, where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) of the disponer;<\/p>  <p>  - the Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, nephew, niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer;<\/p>  <p>  - the Group C threshold (currently &euro;16,250) applies in all other cases.  <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, where a person receives a gift or inheritance from his or her aunt or uncle, the Group B threshold of &euro;32,500 will apply.  CAT will be payable by the person at a rate of 33% to the extent that the benefit received, when aggregated with any prior gift or inheritance received since 5 December 1991, exceeds this threshold, unless a specific relief or exemption applies.  <\/p>  <p>  There is an exemption from CAT, provided for in section 84 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, for gifts and inheritances taken exclusively for the purpose of discharging qualifying expenses of an individual who is &lsquo;permanently incapacitated&rsquo; by reason of physical or mental infirmity.<\/p>  <p>  Permanently incapacitated in this context, means being unable to support oneself by earning an income from working. Qualifying expenses mean expenses relating to medical care including the cost of maintenance in connection with such medical care. A gift or inheritance of this nature will be exempt from CAT where Revenue is satisfied that it will be used for such purposes.

All other instruments, if liable to stamp duty, must be stamped by Revenue. The requirement to submit instruments to Revenue for stamping was provided for in section 12 SDCA 1999 and subsequently by the e-Stamping Regulations for the electronic filing of instruments, which came into operation on 1 June 2011.<\/p>  <p>  Section 127 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act (SDCA) 1999 provides that an unstamped instrument may not be used in evidence or for any purpose except as evidence in criminal proceedings or in civil proceedings by Revenue to recover stamp duty.  Accordingly, I am advised by Revenue that where there is a requirement to have an instrument stamped by Revenue and that requirement is not satisfied, apart from the circumstances outlined, section 127 provides that the instrument may not be used in evidence, including to prove title to the property which is the subject of the instrument. Banks and other bodies are not excluded from these requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Where a liability to stamp duty arises on an instrument of assignment of a chose-in-action and the instrument is not stamped, then, in accordance with section 127 SDCA 1999, the instrument may not be used in evidence or for any purpose except as evidence in criminal proceedings or in civil proceedings by Revenue to recover stamp duty. Prior to 7 December 2006, stamp duty was chargeable on debts such as debentures and bonds including mortgages securing loans on property situated in the State and any subsequent transfer of such debts where the amount secured exceeded &euro;254,000.  Section 100 Finance Act 2007 terminated this charge for such &lsquo;debt&rsquo; documents executed after this date. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding Dail Question  No. 242 (Ref: 48543\/22), I am also advised by Revenue that as stamp duty is a self-assessed duty, Stamp Certificates issue automatically once the return has been filed and any payment due, including, interest, surcharges or penalties, has been paid in full. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue is obliged to treat personal and business information of all taxpayers in the strictest of confidence and therefore it is not in a position to publish copies of certificates.

I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, which is to ensure that the first revaluation of commercial and industrial properties in all rating authority areas in over 160 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, and on a phased basis. This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue. <\/p>  <p>  The latest phase of the programme is comprised of the revaluation of rateable properties in the rating authority areas of Clare, Donegal, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown (second revaluation), Galway, Kerry and Mayo County Councils and Galway City Council. This phase has already been postponed due to the Covid 19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability across ratepayers based on modern valuations and economic circumstances. In local authorities that have not yet been revalued, their valuations and, by extension, their rates liabilities are based on economic circumstances and property values that pertained in 1988. <\/p>  <p>  Revaluation ensures equity and fairness in the rateable valuation system. Following revaluation there is a much closer and uniform relationship between contemporary rental values and the commercial rates liability of properties. In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the business rates burden relative to the modern rental value of the property that they occupy.<\/p>  <p>  While an individual occupier&rsquo;s rates liability may increase or decrease, the revaluation will not increase the overall commercial rates income of the Local Authority as the rates income of each Local Authority is capped in the year following a revaluation. <\/p>  <p>  In those local authority areas revalued to date, most ratepayers post revaluation have seen their rates liability reduce. The last completed phase of revaluation comprised the revaluation of more than 30,000 rateable properties in the local authority areas of Cavan, Fingal, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow County Councils.

This will facilitate the making available of some 2,000 sites for homes by 2025 and can be availed of by both Laois County Council and Offaly County Council to help meet affordable housing need.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the First Home Scheme, launched in July this year, supports first-time buyers in purchasing new houses and apartments in the private market through the use of an equity share model, similar to that employed in the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme.

Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity. This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, including those relating to the installation of solar panels on the roofs of houses, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions for apartments and educational\/community\/sports buildings. <\/p>  <p>  The matter of solar development and the potential impact on protected structures has been a primary consideration of my Department throughout the development of the draft regulations.<\/p>  <p>  Both the Act and the Regulations contain provisions for the protection of, inter alia, protected structures by way of restrictions on exempted development. These provisions apply to the current solar planning exemptions and have not been amended as part of the current review.<\/p>  <p>  Section 57 of the Act clarifies the position with regard to planning exemptions for protected structures to provide that &ldquo;[&hellip;] the carrying out of works to a protected structure, or a proposed protected structure, shall be exempted development only if those works would not materially affect the character of: (a) the structure, or (b) any element of the structure which contributes to its special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, article 9 of the Regulations provides that development shall not be exempted development if it would, inter alia, &ldquo;consist of or comprise [&hellip;] the excavation, alteration or demolition&hellip;of places [&hellip;] of archaeological, geological, historical, scientific or ecological interest, the preservation, conservation or protection of which is an objective of a development plan [&hellip;]&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to what would materially affect the character of a protected structure and any uncertainty as to when planning permission is required, a person may contact the relevant planning authority and seek a declaration under section 5 of the Act that will confirm the position. In addition, a declaration in relation to a protected structure may be sought under section 57 of the Act by the owner or occupier of the structure.<\/p>  <p>  It will be open to any person to seek planning permission for proposed development affecting a protected structure. Buildings of architectural heritage significance have their role to play in climate change mitigation and there will be cases where the installation of solar panels will be acceptable but this is a matter for the planning authorities to decide on a case-by-case basis, either through the declaration processes or the planning system.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case in which a planning authority or the Board is or may be concerned, except in very specific circumstances, which do not apply in this case. <\/p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made. In this regard, the process for finalising the solar regulations has commenced and is expected to be completed imminently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400081#WRL03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":735,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400081#WRL03600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Transport","counter":734,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400081#WRL03500"},{"type":"question","counter":735,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[47914\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400081#WRL03600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of domestic flights for work purposes taken by him, Ministers of State in his Department and Department staff for each of the years 2019 to 2021 and to date in 2022, in tabular form.","asker":"1468","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":736,"content":"<p>The following are details of domestic flights taken by me, the Ministers of State, and staff in my Department in each of the years from 2019 to 2021 and to date in 2022. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>Number of flights<\/th>       <th>Route<\/th>       <th>No of Passengers<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>       <td>N\/A<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2022<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>Dublin-Kerry-Dublin<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400081#WRL03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":737,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400081#WRL03800"},{"type":"question","counter":738,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[47939\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400081#WRL03900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will seek a human rights observation mandate for MINURSO when its mandate comes for renewal at the United Nations Security Council in October 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1570","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":739,"content":"<p>Ireland has a long tradition of contributing to UN peace-support missions and we have maintained a continuous presence in UN peace support operations since 1958.

A five year Equipment Development Plan for continued re-equipment was developed on a civil military basis and was published in June 2020.  The Equipment Planning process recognises the need to maintain and upgrade military capabilities having regard to emerging priorities, operational requirements and changes in technology. This is an ongoing iterative process.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of defensive equipment acquisition and upgrade projects for which there will be capital expenditure in the coming years. These include the midlife upgrade of the Army's fleet of 80 Mowag Piranha III Armoured Personnel Carrier vehicles which is well underway as well as the completion of the delivery of an additional 30 Armoured Utility Vehicles. In addition, the Army's non-armoured fleet continues to be updated with over 220 vehicles due for delivery in 2022.    <\/p>  <p>  In relation to air-based capability, the programme for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft is well underway with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023. Alongside the recently acquired PC-12 aircraft some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of all of these enhanced capabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  The Naval Service Vessel Renewal and Replacement Programme is ongoing and the programme includes radar and other equipment upgrades along with the replacement of Naval Service Reserve motor launches. The programme of works for the midlife refit and upgrade of L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n has been completed, while works are ongoing on L&Eacute; Niamh. Marine Advisors have been appointed to support the procurement of multi-role vessel to replace the flagship, L&Eacute; Eithne, with work underway that will inform a public tender competition in due course. Two Inshore Patrol Vessels have been purchased from the New Zealand Government to replace L&Eacute; Orla and L&Eacute; Ciara and it is expected these vessels will be transported to Ireland in 2023 following the completion of a programme of works. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Defence has received a capital allocation under the national development plan of &euro;566 million over the 2022 to 2025 timeframe. The Defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141 million, with an increased allocation of &euro;176 million for 2023. This is following Government approval for a move over a six-year period to a level of Defence Forces&rsquo; capability equivalent to &lsquo;Level of Ambition 2&rsquo; (LOA2), as set out in the capability framework devised by the Commission on Defence Forces, which will entail funding increases to reach a Defence budget of approximately &euro;1.5 billion (at January 2022 prices) by 2028 through the annual Estimates. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and the Report of the Commission, while building on the significant investment programme over recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400082#WRM02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":781,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[48234\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400082#WRM02700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if refurbishment works have commenced at a building (details supplied) at Renmore Barracks.","asker":"1495","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":782,"content":"<p>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that works on this major refurbishment building project at the USAC,  accommodation block in Renmore Barracks have commenced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400082#WRM02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":784,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[48235\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400082#WRM03000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the amount that has been spent on the refurbishment of Custume Barracks, Athlone in each of the years 2020, 2021 and to date in 2022; and the nature of works that were carried out in each of the years in tabular form.","asker":"1495","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":785,"content":"<p>The Defence Forces Infrastructure Development Plan (IDP) in 2020 sets out a programme of anticipated project delivery based on requirements identified from a survey of all DF installations and on the achievement of the high-level goals set out in White Paper 2015.  <\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to note, as advised by the military authorities, that the following maintenance and refurbishment works were undertaken on a devolved basis at Custume Barracks for the 2020- 2022 period. <table>    <tr>       <th>Nature of works completed<\/th>       <th>Contract Value<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 Roof Repairs<\/td>       <td>&euro;22,999.64<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Refurbishment of Abultions <\/td>       <td>&euro;32,915.00<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 External refurbishment (Roads   &amp;amp; Carparking)<\/td>       <td>&euro;139,112.64<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Painting &amp;amp; Decoration<\/td>       <td>&euro;59,833.17<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 External refurbishment (Roads   &amp;amp; Carparking)<\/td>       <td>&euro;94,607.74<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Refurbishment of offices<\/td>       <td>&euro;22,546.00<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Ventilation and screening   upgrade<\/td>       <td>&euro;38,817.00<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Roof &amp;amp; chimney repairs<\/td>       <td>&euro;94,108.63<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>General refurbishment<\/td>       <td>&euro;51,357.73<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Building energy management   system upgrade<\/td>       <td>&euro;164,787.25<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total <\/td>       <td>&euro;721,084.80<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400082#WRM03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":787,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[48236\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400082#WRM03300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the amount that the Defence Forces spent on purchasing chemical biological, radiological and nuclear suits for the Permanent Defence Forces in 2021 and to date in 2022, in tabular form.","asker":"1495","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":788,"content":"<p>Under the Framework for Major Emergency Management the Defence Forces can be tasked in aid of Civil Power to provide operational support in a response to a national chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) incident in order to mark, cordon, monitor, measure, decontaminate, retrieve and dispose of any CBRN devices and matter so found.

Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process aims to identify those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage or the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.\u00a0 The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at\u00a0www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools\/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed.\u00a0The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019\/2022 which can be found\u00a0on the gov.ie website.<\/p>  <p>  Following the processing of the appeal received from the school regrettably there was no change to the outcome of the initial application of the refined DEIS identification model to the school.

The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023.

This\u00a0will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation on the DEIS programme to in the region of &euro;180million.<\/p>  <p>  Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. <\/p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process aims to identify those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage or the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.\u00a0 The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at\u00a0www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools\/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed.\u00a0The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019\/2022 which can be found\u00a0on the gov.ie website.<\/p>  <p>  Following the processing of the appeal received regrettably there was no change to the outcome of the initial application of the refined DEIS identification model to the school. My Department, however, will continue to support the school and the school community as they deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to their students and young learners. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023.

The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400083#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":832,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400083#WRN01700"},{"type":"question","counter":833,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[47987\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400083#WRN01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a school (details supplied) in County Kerry will be permitted to retain its current teaching allocation in 2023 given the likelihood of future enrolments from Ukrainian families moving into the area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":834,"content":"<p>The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.<\/p>  <p>  For the 2022\/23 school year,\u00a0the staffing schedule for\u00a0primary schools has been improved by one point and schools\u00a0will be provided with class teachers on the basis of\u00a01 teacher for every 24 pupils which is a historical low ratio, with lower thresholds applying to DEIS Urban Band 1 schools.<\/p>  <p>  The staffing process contains an appeals mechanism for schools\u00a0to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria\u00a0to an independent Primary Staffing Appeals Board.\u00a0 Details of the appeal process are available in Circular 25\/2022.<\/p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy has been informed that its staffing appeal has been approved on\u00a0 a provisional basis, pending confirmation of the school's enrolment reaching the required retention figure on 30th September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400083#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":835,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400083#WRN02000"},{"type":"question","counter":836,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[48051\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400083#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a school bus ticket will be issued to a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1596","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":837,"content":"<p>The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.\u00a0 In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures.<\/p>  <p>  Ticket registration for the 2022\/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications\/registrations were received for mainstream school transport.

For 2023, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 special needs assistants in our schools next year. <\/p><p>For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.<\/p><p>In 2023, there will be a significant investment in the expansion of the National Council for Special Education, with a total full-year investment of &euro;13 million, in over 160 additional staff. This investment is being undertaken so that the NSCE can respond effectively, compassionately and quickly to the increased need in our education system so that children and their families are fully supported and achieve the best possible education outcomes.<\/p><p>My Department and the NCSE continue to work very closely in planning for the delivery of new places required to meet forecasted demand.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that this approach is delivering.

A late date of entry into insurable employment can result in an unusually low divisor, and  consequently a higher yearly average than would be representative of the number of contributions<\/p>  <p>  To this end, the National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that the current &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system, be replaced with a &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; (TCA), which would make the level of pension directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life, with significant pension credits granted to people who have taken time out of the workplace to perform caring duties.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2018, the Government announced an Interim TCA to calculate the entitlement of pensioners who reached state pension age on or after 1 September 2012 (i.e. those born on or after 1 September 1946) and who had a reduced rate pension entitlement based on post Budget 2012 rate bands.

The Department is charged with identifying where a person has an income support need and providing that income support, for example in the form of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, a disability allowance, or a carer's allowance.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The main income supports to carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.\u00a0Spending in 2022 is expected to amount to over &euro;1.5 billion.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The two principal conditions for receipt of\u00a0Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are that full time care and\u00a0attention is required and being provided, and that the means test which applies is satisfied. Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is primarily aimed at carers on low incomes who live with and look after certain people who need full-time care and attention. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that eligibility for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is not contingent on a particular disability or illness or the severity of disability or incapacity of the person being cared for.<\/p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payment of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally. This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency - be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring. The application of a means-test not only ensures that the recipient has an income need but also that scarce resources are targeted to those with the greatest need.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Last year I made significant changes to the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance with the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance increasing to &euro;350 per week for single carers, and to &euro;750 per week for a couple. I also an increased the capital disregard for carers from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. The changes took effect in June and mean that many Carers on a reduced rate moved to a higher payment. In addition, Carers who up to now did not qualify for a payment due to means will be brought into the Carers Allowance system for the first time.<\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to provide the estimated annual cost of providing a non means tested full rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy. While the Department can establish how many people are in receipt of a reduced payment and where Domiciliary Care Allowance is in payment, the Department of Social Protection has no administrative data on the level capacity\/incapacity of the child.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are other income supports available for carers provided by the Department of Social Protection that are not means-tested; these include:<\/p>  <p>  - The Carers Benefit payment is an entitlement based on social insurance contributions. Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is a payment made to insured people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person(s) in need of full-time care. It is payable for a period of 2 years (104 weeks) for each care recipient and may be claimed over separate periods up to a total of 2 years (104 weeks). <\/p>  <p>  - Domiciliary Care Allowance is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.\u00a0 It is not means tested. As part of Budget 2023, I increased the Domiciliary Care Allowance rate by &euro;20.50 to &euro;330 per month with effect from January 2023. \u00a0There is no restriction on the number of children in respect of whom Domiciliary Care Allowance may be claimed. In other words, a person caring for more than one child who qualifies for Domiciliary Care Allowance may claim the monthly allowance for each child. <\/p>  <p>  - The annual Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is available to all carers providing\u00a0full-time care to a person with a disability or an older person,\u00a0regardless of the carer&rsquo;s means or social insurance contributions. The\u00a0objective of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is to support carers in their\u00a0caring role and carers may use the grant in a manner that is appropriate\u00a0\u00a0to their needs. The grant is paid in respect of each person being cared\u00a0for to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers.

Tusla provides a continuum of services including early intervention and family support services, child protection and welfare services and alternative care services to identify and respond to the needs of the children and families who are referred. <\/p>  <p>  Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website. Reports can also be made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS). Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by AGS or Tusla but usually both agencies work together in such cases.<\/p>  <p>  Where immediate or potential danger is identified to a child from a parent or guardian, this referral is treated with the highest priority and response by Tusla. In the first instance Tusla will ensure, under its Signs of Safety national practice guidance, that the child is safe and that an immediate safety network is identified to support the child and parents. Simultaneously, Tusla will endeavour to work in partnership with the parent(s) or guardian(s) to assess the cause of the difficulties and provide, or refer to, the necessary services. A safety network for the child will be identified and implemented under the Signs of Safety national practice model to ensure the immediate safety of the child or children within the family. Where it is assessed, following completion of an intake and initial assessment process, that significant child protection concerns exist and potential risk of harm to the child by the parents is identified, a child protection case conference is convened. At such a conference a decision may be made to place the child on the child protection notification system (CPNS). Where this threshold of risk is not met (that is, a child protection case conference is not required or the child is not placed on the CPNS), a Tusla led safety plan will be implemented for the child. <\/p>  <p>  If the outcome of the initial screening and visit to the child and family as part of the initial social work preliminary enquiry is that a child cannot stay in the care of their parent or guardian due to immediate risk of significant harm to the child&rsquo;s safety or life, consideration will be given to whether there are appropriate extended family members to provide immediate care for the child and also whether consideration of admission to foster or residential care, age appropriate to the child&rsquo;s care needs, is necessary to ensure the child&rsquo;s \/young person&rsquo;s safety. An admission to care will occur either with the voluntary consent of the parent(s) or guardian(s) or by Tusla making an application to the district court for an emergency care order or interim care order application.<\/p>  <p>  In some circumstances where child protection concerns exist in relation to new born infants Tusla, following a detailed assessment by the social work teams, may consider as appropriate to the child&rsquo;s safety and the parent&rsquo;s needs, whether a residential parenting assessment unit for mother and baby is required. This would potentially be a matter for Court oversight and representation by legal teams. The appointment of a Guardian ad litem would also be considered by the Court in these circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Where necessary Tusla seeks to engage relevant services and professionals to provide appropriate supports for parents. Acute crises for parents that necessitate interventions by mental health or addiction services would be a matter for the HSE in close liaison with Tusla teams in respect of care arrangements of the children concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla is also tasked with providing family support services in accordance with Section 8 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013, which are provided directly and by commissioning family support services through its community and voluntary sector partners.<\/p>  <p>  Family support services are focused on early intervention with the aim of promoting and protecting the health, well-being and rights of children, young people and their families. At the same time, particular attention is given to those who are vulnerable or at risk. <\/p>  <p>  The number of family and community supports are wide and varied.  Tusla is engaged in the following family and community supports: <\/p>  <p>  - Family Resource Centres<\/p>  <p>  - Family therapeutic services<\/p>  <p>  - Prevention Partnership Family Support<\/p>  <p>  - Parenting Information\/ Parenting 24\/7<\/p>  <p>  - Child and Youth Participation <\/p>  <p>  - Meitheal<\/p>  <p>  - Psychological Services<\/p>  <p>  - Early Years (pre-school)<\/p>  <p>  - School Age Services<\/p>  <p>  - Alternative Education and Registration Services<\/p>  <p>  These services include those delivered directly by Tusla, including those provided under the Prevention, Partnership, and Family Support (PPFS) service, and those which are funded or co-funded by Tusla. Tusla also directly supports family support services through structures such as Family Resource Centres (FRCs) and the Area Based Childhood Programme. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has also established Child and Family Support Networks (CFSNs), which are collaborative networks of community, voluntary and statutory providers. CFSNs seek to improve access to support services for children and their families.  Each network consists of services that play a role in the lives of children and families in that area.

These investigations have sought to establish the facts relating to the operation of the institutions, as well as the manner in which those who were resident in them were treated. <\/p><p>In establishing the independent statutory Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes in February 2015, the then Government sought to ensure an independent and thorough investigation of what happened to vulnerable women and children in these institutions during the period 1922 to 1998.

In this apology, An Taoiseach acknowledged the failings of the State, over many decades, to protect vulnerable citizens, and to uphold their fundamental rights.

It also provides for the identification of remains and their return to family members, where possible. <\/p>  <p>  The legislation was developed in response to the abhorrent situation at the site of the former Mother and Baby institution in Tuam, Co. Galway, where it was confirmed that children&rsquo;s remains had been discovered that were interred in a manifestly inappropriate manner and the Government was advised that a full forensic-standard excavation, recovery and identification of those remains could not take place under current legislation. To avoid delays in responding to any similar situations that may arise in the future, the Act is not site specific and also allows for excavations and identification programmes at other institutional sites should manifestly inappropriate burials be discovered.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Act provides for significant consultation in relation to an intervention. Most notably, the Act requires the appointment of an Advisory Board to guide and support the Director of an intervention in his or her role. The Board, which is to be chaired by a former coroner or someone with coronial expertise, will have members with a range of expertise and backgrounds, including scientific experts, former residents and\/or family members of the deceased. A Director is required to consult with the Board at regular intervals, including at key decisions points in an intervention. Other consultation and engagement mechanisms include a requirement that a Director make final arrangements for recovered remains in line with the wishes of family members as well as a requirement that a Director provide regular updates on an intervention to family members, stakeholders and the public.<\/p>  <p>  The Act provides that, following the establishment of an Office of Director, a relevant Minister appoint a Director to manage and oversee an intervention. My officials are currently liaising with the Public Appointments Service in relation to the recruitment process for a Director of Authorised Intervention, Tuam. The criteria and other relevant material relating to the recruitment and appointment of the Director will be published as part of the recruitment process. Preparations are also underway in my Department for the appointment of an Advisory Board and the details of the appointment process will be available in due course.<\/p>  <p>  Tendering for the specific expertise required to undertake an intervention is a matter for a Director appointed to manage and oversee the process. In this regard the Act requires that a Director ensures that excavation, recovery and post-recovery analysis of remains is undertaken by appropriately qualified persons at a forensic standard and in accordance with international best practice and professional rules and guidelines. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Vienna Protocol was prepared to provide guidance in relation to the treatment of remains of people of Jewish origin. The Institutional Burials Act was not designed to contain specific provisions regarding different religious or ethnic groups.

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. To date, more than 50,000 people have arrived in Ireland and in excess of 39,000 of those have been referred to this Department seeking accommodation from the State.<\/p><p>Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging.

In December 2021, Government adopted the 25 recommendations contained in an Expert Group report, <i>Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC).<\/i>On 15 September, I launched Together for Better, the new funding model for early learning and childcare. This new funding model will support delivery of ELC and SAC for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families.<\/p><p>Together for Better brings together three major elements, the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, including the Access and Inclusion Model, the National Childcare Scheme and Core Funding, in line with the Employment Regulation Orders coming into effect.<\/p><p>Core Funding is the new funding stream worth &euro;266 million in 2023 to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and improve affordability for parents as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.  <\/p><p>As a condition of receiving Core Funding, a Partner Service agrees not to increase the fee for any Service Type which was extant on September 30 2021 or introduce an extra charge for any component of that Service Type.  The fees policy for each service is outlined in the Parent Statement, a copy of which must be shared with parents within a month of Core Funding beginning or the parent joining the service, whichever is the later. This gives parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensure that increases to NCS subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time.<\/p><p>To date, over 90% of eligible services have become Partner Services under Core Funding, committing to working in partnership with the State for the public good, and to a freeze on parental fees. A list of Partner Services is available here: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie\/together-for-better\/ <\/p><p>Budget 2023 introduced further enhancements to the NCS. From January 2023, any family who is not already at the maximum hourly subsidy will see an increase in their subsidy. All families who would currently receive the minimum (universal) subsidy of 50c per hour will receive &euro;1.40. <\/p><p>For those who receive a subsidy under the income assessed subsidy, the amount of the increase will taper down as they approach the maximum hourly subsidy rate. The reason for this is that the aim is to reduce co-payments by an average of 25 per cent; those currently in receipt of the highest subsidies pay the lowest co-payments.<\/p><p>The amount of increase individual families will see in their per hour subsidy, will differ widely depending on their current subsidy.<\/p><p>As the State does not employ early years educators and school-age childcare practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector.  However, there has recently been an important and historic development with the setting of new minimum hourly rates for various roles in the Early Years Services sector.<\/p><p>On 15 September 2022, the first ever Employment Regulation Orders for the Early Years Services sector came into effect, setting new minimum hourly rates of pay for various roles in the Early Years Services Sector as follows:<\/p><p>- &euro;13.00 for Early Years Educators\/ School-Age Childcare practitioners;<\/p><p>- &euro;14.00 for Early Years Lead Educators \/ School-Age Childcare co-ordinators;<\/p><p>- &euro;15.50 for Graduate Early Years Lead Educators \/ School-Age Childcare co-ordinators<\/p><p>- &euro;15.70 for Deputy Managers;<\/p><p>- &euro;16.50 for Managers; and <\/p><p>- &euro;17.25 for Graduate Managers.<\/p><p>The Orders are being supported by Government&rsquo;s Core Funding scheme which commenced on the 15<sup>th<\/sup>September, and will see increases in funding to early learning and childcare services to support improvements in staff wages, alongside a commitment to freeze parental fees. It is estimated that 73% of those working in the sector will see their wages rise as a result of the Employment Regulation Orders with the wages of 50% of employees in the sector expected to rise by 10% or more, and the wages of 20% of employees are expected to rise by 20% or more.<\/p><p>I am also committed to addressing other challenges which may impact on the recruitment and retention of staff in the sector. In December 2021, I published &quot;Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC), 2022-2028&quot;. Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare. One of its five &quot;pillars&quot; comprises commitments aimed at supporting recruitment, retention and diversity in the workforce, and it includes actions to raise the profile of careers in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400089#WRT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":1203,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400089#WRT04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1204,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[48515\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400089#WRT04200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he will provide the accommodation capacity of each direct provision centre in County Wicklow by centre for each year since they were first used; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1205,"content":"<p>Please see information below, as requested by the Deputy: <table>    <tr>       <th>Direct Provision Centres Co.

I am conscious of the extremely positive impact these organisations have on improving outcomes for children, young people and families all over Ireland. <\/p><p>I understand that where the Deputy refers to Section 38 and Section 39, he is referring to the Health Act 2004, which is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) agreement reached between the Department of Health and HSE and trade unions representing staff in certain section 38 &amp;amp; 39 organisations is a matter for the Minister for Health.<\/p><p>The Child and Family Agency Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Tusla, which included the transfer of certain functions of the Health Service Executive to the new Agency. The Act was signed into law on the 15th December 2013 following substantial consultation and legislative scrutiny.<\/p><p>Community and voluntary organisations who provide valuable services to help Ireland's children and families had, prior to the establishment of Tusla, been receiving funding from the HSE. Since establishment of Tusla in 2014, many of those organisations began to receive their funding from Tusla. The arrangements that Tusla enters into with a person or organisation for the provision of child and family services have been subject to the provisions of Part 8 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. In accordance with Section 56 of that Act, Tusla commissions service providers in over 600 community and voluntary sector bodies to deliver services on its behalf. Such relationships are then governed under a service level agreement. These service level agreements provide clarity to all involved on what funding is to be provided and what service is expected in return for that funding.<\/p><p>The service providers operate independently of Tusla and are responsible for their own internal resource management including the recruitment of employees and the terms and conditions under which their staff are employed. The remuneration of the staff of these bodies is therefore a matter for these organisations as employers.  <\/p><p>The commissioning of services is an operational matter for Tusla. Section 56 (2) requires that Tusla determines the maximum funding it proposes to make available during the course of each year under each arrangement and the level of service it expects to receive in return for that funding. <\/p><p>Section 56 (14) is clear that Tusla's arrangements with such providers do &quot;<i>not give rise to an employment relationship between a service provider, its employees or agents on the one hand and the Agency on the other<\/i>'.<\/p><p>The net funding available to Tusla is determined annually as part of the estimates process and notified to the agency through my annual Performance Statement. In response to the Performance Statement, Tusla will prepare a Business Plan for 2023. In this way the precise level of funding to be allocated to such section 56 organisations for the delivery of specific services will be determined by Tusla, having regard to the overall level of funding available in 2023. <\/p><p>Following Budget 2023, I am pleased to announce that Tusla's funding allocation will be &euro;935m in 2023, an increase 4% on 2022.

As in any statutory scheme, a core principle of the scheme is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment for applicants as part of the means assessment process. All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. <\/p>  <p>  The Supplementary Welfare Allowance is not included in the list of income disregards for the purposes of the Student Grant Scheme as it is, generally speaking, a short term temporary payment made whilst awaiting a decision on an established\/long term social welfare payment. As soon as a person goes on to an eligible payment e.g. disability allowance, this would be considered a change in circumstances (under the Student Grant Scheme -see details below).<\/p>  <p>  Where the Supplementary Welfare Allowance is held for 15 consecutive calendar months, it is deemed an eligible long-term payment for the special rate of maintenance under the Student Grant Scheme.  The Disability Allowance is also an eligible long term payment for the special rate of Student Grant and is an income disregard if it is being paid to the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  I am not familiar with the particulars of this case however, students can determine their eligibility at susi.ie\/eligibility\/income\/. The student may also wish to discuss his eligibility for SUSI assistance by calling the SUSI Support Desk on 0818 888 777.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined above, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same.<\/p>  <p>  The change of circumstances provision is a well-established procedure and it can also operate at scale.  For example, over 10,000 applicants declared a change of circumstance in the 2020\/21 academic year.

Undergraduate students eligible for SUSI supports have this contribution paid, in part of in full, on their behalf under my Departments Student Grant Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The once off reduction of &euro;1,000 relates specifically to the student contribution payable by student&rsquo;s eligible for free tuition fees under my Department's free fees schemes in academic year 22\/23 and will reduce the student contribution payable from &euro;3,000 to &euro;2,000 in 22\/23. In this regard all full time undergraduate students eligible for free fees and paying the student contribution will benefit from this measure.<\/p>  <p>  In the 2021\/22 academic year there were over 246,000 enrolled in HEA-funded higher education institutions. As the 2022\/23 academic year is only now getting underway, we do not have enrolment figures yet however I can advise the Deputy that in 22\/23 it is estimated that over 149,000 Irish and EU full time undergraduate students will be eligible for free fees. This means in addition to the SUSI eligible students receiving a student contribution support (estimated at over 55,000 in academic year 22\/23) an estimated 94,000 free fees eligible students will benefit from this measure alone at a cost of c.&euro;95.6million.<\/p>  <p>  Students not eligible for the free fees schemes pay a full tuition fee as determined by the higher education institution attended. These institutions are autonomous bodies and the level of fee payable by students who do not meet the requirements of the free fees scheme is a matter for the relevant institution to determine. In this regard a student contribution does not apply and therefore the once off student contribution reduction of &euro;1,000 in 22\/23 cannot benefit students that are not eligible for free fees.<\/p>  <p>  However, for tuition fee students supports are available to full time students via the statutory based Student Grant Scheme. The Student Grant Scheme, administered by SUSI, provides grant assistance to students pursuing an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. Students can determine their eligibility at susi.ie\/eligibility\/income\/.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the cost of living measures I secured additional supports for students including:<\/p>  <p>  - A once-off reduction of up to 33% in the contribution fee for apprentices;<\/p>  <p>  - A once-off extra payment for all student maintenance grant recipients;<\/p>  <p>  - A once-off increase of &euro;1,000 in the support to SUSI qualified Post Graduate students, increasing from &euro;3,500 to &euro;4,500;<\/p>  <p>  - A further &euro;8 million investment in the Student Assistance Fund  for the 2022\/23 academic year.<\/p>  <p>  For any student experiencing difficulties currently, there is a significant allocation to the aforementioned Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.

Staff facilities will also be catered for in the provision of a staff canteen, locker rooms and administration support offices. <\/p><p>The Irish Prison Service has now commenced work on the development of a new Strategic Plan for 2023 &ndash; 2025 which will include specific strategic objectives on further enhancing the prison estate. <\/p><p>The commitments included in the new Strategic Plan will be in line with funding allocated to the Irish Prison Service in the current National Development Plan.<\/p><p>In relation to prison developments the National Development Plan includes:  <b><\/b><\/p><p>- Investment for the improvement of facilities in Shelton Abbey, Loughan House Open Centre, the D&oacute;chas Centre, and Wheatfield Place of Detention;<\/p><p>- Priority projects at Castlerea and Portlaoise Prisons in respect of the necessary construction of new kitchens; and<\/p><p>- Other investment to be progressed over the years 2022 to 2025 include, ICT infrastructure and systems, fleet modernisation, video-linking infrastructure, safety, security and carbon reduction refurbishment works and general upgrading of equipment and facilities.<\/p><p>All such developments are subject to cost benefit analysis and are progressed in line with the Public Spending Code obligations.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware significant growth has been experienced in the remand prison population in recent years which has resulted in significant pressure on remand prison facilities including Cloverhill Prison. The Irish Prison Service is currently undertaking a strategic assessment exercise on the potential for additional accommodation at Cloverhill Prison in line with the requirements of the Public Spending Code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400092#WRW03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1373,"content":"<p>Question No. 546 answered with Question No. 545.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":1374,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400092#WRW03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1375,"qnumday":547,"qnumall":"[48245\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400092#WRW03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of each category of public order training courses that were provided to garda&iacute; in the Westmeath and Roscommon-Longford Garda division in 2021 and to date in 2022, in tabular form.","asker":"1495","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1376,"content":"<p>I have contacted An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the information requested by the Deputy.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays a vital role in enforcing road traffic law and in making our roads safer for all road users, including vulnerable road users, such as cyclists.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is responsible by law for the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters and deployment of resources. As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Minister Ryan that the protection of vulnerable road users is prioritised in the new Road Safety Strategy. Protecting vulnerable road users involves a range of actions aside from legislative and law enforcement measures. Improvements in infrastructure, such as dedicated cycle lanes, will reduce the danger by keeping vulnerable road users separate from motorized traffic. The Government has committed to investing up to &euro;1.8 billion in cycling and walking infrastructure during its lifetime. I understand that the Road Safety Authority also engages in public information and education initiatives to raise driver awareness of the specific risks to vulnerable road users.    <\/p>  <p>  As regards the establishment of a dedicated online portal for the submission of video evidence of potential violations of road traffic legislation, the Deputy may be aware that the current Traffic Watch facility allows for members of the public to report driver behaviour to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Matters reported via this facility are forwarded to the relevant District Office for investigation. Similarly, citizens may make complaints to any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or through the Garda website.<\/p>  <p>  Under Action 29 of the Road Safety Strategy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will explore the potential of an online portal for road users to upload footage of road traffic offences which could assist in prosecution. This action is due to be completed by Q4 of this year.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, there are strict standards in legislation relating to photographic evidence obtained by Garda&iacute;. While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed that private dash cam footage may be used during a prosecution, its use must be in accordance with best evidential practices and entails ensuring structures exist around continuity of evidence.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Transport has further advised that any decision to allow film by members of the public to be used in evidence in road traffic cases would raise questions of reliability of, and possible tampering with, the apparatus used, as well as potential privacy issues. It might also raise questions about why Garda apparatus was held to a standard not required of private individuals, if both were ultimately to be treated as reliable evidence. <\/p>  <p>  Road traffic enforcement remains a core policing function of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda National Roads Policing Bureau ensures a consistent approach to road safety and enforcement of road traffic legislation across the country. This is achieved through coordination of enforcement measures and development of policy based on research and analysis of statistics and by engaging in campaigns in partnership with other State Agencies, notably the Road Safety Authority.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to emphasise that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to the employment of specific enforcement operations.<\/p>  <p>  I would of course encourage any member of the public to report any incidents of dangerous driving directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400093#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":1402,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400093#WRX00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1403,"qnumday":556,"qnumall":"[48528\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400093#WRX00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps that are being taken to facilitate the travel of minors following the suspension of the re-entry visa for non-national children; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1404,"content":"<p>The requirement for a re-entry visa for children under 16 remains suspended until further notice.

The Guide advises that doctors should: <\/p><p>- make sure that patients have given their consent to conduct the consultation through telemedicine and consent to any treatment provided <\/p><p>- follow guidance in relation to advertising on websites or similar media  <\/p><p>- protect the privacy of patient information through effective security measures  <\/p><p>- protect patients&rsquo; privacy by following the guidance on confidentiality and medical records  <\/p><p>- comply with data protection principles if transferring any personal patient information to other jurisdictions <\/p><p>- inform the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner of the consultation <\/p><p>- be satisfied that the services provided through telemedicine are safe and suitable for patients.<\/p><p>Under <i>Directive 2011\/24\/EU<\/i>on the application of patients&rsquo; rights in cross-border healthcare, doctors providing telemedicine services are considered to be providing services in the EU Member State in which they are established.  Such doctors are required to comply with the legislation, including the regulatory requirements, of that Member State only. If a doctor based in Ireland is providing telemedicine services in Ireland or in any Member State they must be registered with the Medical Council in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400095#WRZ04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1566,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400095#WRZ04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1567,"qnumday":609,"qnumall":"[48071\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400095#WRZ04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when CH07 will have a clinic for adults with ADHD; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1568,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400095#WRZ04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"question","counter":1570,"qnumday":610,"qnumall":"[48072\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400095#WRZ05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the services that are available in the Dublin 6 area for adults diagnosed with ADHD; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1571,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400095#WRZ05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Policy","counter":1572,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400095#WRZ05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1573,"qnumday":611,"qnumall":"[48073\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400095#WRZ05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the obligations that exist upon a telehealth provider that closes down their service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1574,"content":"<p>GPs are private practitioners, most of whom hold a GMS contract for the provision of services without charge on behalf of the HSE for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. <\/p>  <p>  When a patient on a GP's GMS panel is transferred to the GMS panel of another GP, the patient's former GP, subject to the written consent of the patient, transfers the patient's medical records (or a summary thereof) to their new GP.

This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar type emergency arrives. Consideration is being given as to what the best model for this evaluation will be.<\/p>  <p>  Since the start of the pandemic, there has been significant and ongoing consideration of the impact of COVID-19 and the evolution of the response to it, as evidence and knowledge emerged and as national and international understanding of the virus evolved. Throughout, this has included a specific and sustained focus on older persons, and in particular, those resident in nursing homes. Various examinations and reports with a focus on COVID-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons have been undertaken.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, the independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established in May 2020, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort in nursing homes and to provide real-time learnings and recommendations to inform the ongoing approach to the management and mitigation of risk to older persons resident in nursing homes as the pandemic evolved. This report outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes, based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  One of the most important things we can take from the experiences of the past two years is our learning and understanding of the challenges facing the nursing home sector. Through engagement with key stakeholders in this sector, including residents, their families and advocacy groups, we are committed to implementing the recommendations of the Nursing Homes Expert Panel and a programme of reform is ongoing across health agencies and stakeholders to ensure an improved quality of service and experience for residents into the future. <\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has already been made in implementing the recommendations of the Expert Panel, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, and work to progress medium and longer term reform recommendations is ongoing. Four Expert Panel Progress Reports have been published, the latest published on 21 June 2022, and all Progress Reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400096#WRAA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":1626,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400096#WRAA04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1627,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[48147\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400096#WRAA04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide confirmation of the opening hours of the minor injuries unit in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital Cashel; the number of patients who have attended this service in 2021 and to date in 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1612","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1628,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400096#WRAA04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1629,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400096#WRAA04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1630,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[48148\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400096#WRAA05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the case of a child (details supplied) will be examined; if an appointment will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1509","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1631,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400096#WRAA05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Abortion Services","counter":1632,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400096#WRAA05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1633,"qnumday":630,"qnumall":"[48150\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400096#WRAA05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of submissions that have been made to the three-year review of the abortion law that were received in the public submissions process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1461","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1634,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, The Review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 commenced in line with statutory and Government commitments in December 2021.

The completion of Phase One of the roll-out, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in fully operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Regional Health Areas across the country.<\/p><p>Phase Two of the roll-out of the Model of Care will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, provided through the public health system. In this regard, funding was secured in Budget 2023 to support access to advanced AHR treatments, including, crucially, to allow the commencement of Phase Two of the roll-out of the Model of Care.<\/p><p>  This investment will facilitate the first steps to be taken towards the provision of a complete publicly-provided fertility service, which is the ultimate objective of Government. In particular, it will allow the historic development of the first National Advanced AHR Centre, delivering IVF and ICSI through a wholly public clinic. This is scheduled to open in the early part of 2024 and will provide a nationwide service, with all six Regional Fertility Hubs having equity of access for onward referral to it, via a shared care pathway. Subject to the provision of additional funding in future, it is envisaged that additional National Advanced AHR Centres will be developed and become operational on a phased basis elsewhere in the country.<\/p><p>  The 2023 allocation will also be utilised to support the Regional Fertility Hubs in order to expand their scope of services next year by introducing the provision of IUI (intrauterine insemination), a significant, yet less complex and less intrusive, component of AHR treatment. <\/p><p>  Separately, as an interim measure, I have instructed that some funding be made available to support access to advanced AHR treatment via private providers from September 2023. <\/p><p>  My officials, in conjunction with NWIHP, are now planning for the operationalisation of both the publicly- and privately- provided service, including the development of a national eligibility framework, as well as determining how the interim funding for private treatments will be provided to individual eligible patients. I expect that this process will involve, where appropriate, engagement with relevant stakeholder groups. <\/p><p>  Overall, my Department and the Government is fully committed, through the full implementation of the Model of Care for Infertility, to ensuring that patients always receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced AHR treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system. The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400100#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1836,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400100#WREE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1837,"qnumday":698,"qnumall":"[48506\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400100#WREE01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of recommendations that have been actioned with regard to a report on mental health services in County Roscommon; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1838,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400100#WREE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1839,"content":"<p>Question No. 699 answered with Question No. 588.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1840,"content":"<p>Question No. 700 answered with Question No. 588.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disease Management","counter":1841,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400100#WREE02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1842,"qnumday":701,"qnumall":"[48510\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400100#WREE02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the directive or clinical recommendations that the HSE gives its medical consultants for prescribing insulin pumps for adults diagnosed with type 1 diabetes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1517","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1843,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400100#WREE02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1844,"content":"<p>Question No. 702 answered with Question No. 591.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1845,"content":"<p>Question No. 703 answered with Question No. 592.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":1846,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400100#WREE02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1847,"qnumday":704,"qnumall":"[48520\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400100#WREE02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical doctors presently registered to work in the State by gender (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1616","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1848,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware the Medical Council recently published its 2021 Workforce Intelligence Report.

Throughout the pandemic, the overall national response to COVID-19 has had a specific and sustained focus on older persons, particularly those resident in nursing homes.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Act 2007, as amended, provides the overarching regulatory framework for the nursing home sector with further detailed requirements set out in Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and Quality Standards. Under the Health Act 2007, as amended, and related Regulations, the registered provider is responsible and accountable for the quality of care and safety of residents in nursing homes (designated centres) and all nursing homes are required to have a clear complaints procedure in place. Part 10 of the Care and Welfare Regulations sets out the requirements in this regard. The person-in-charge of the nursing home will be able to provide information on the complaints process in place in the nursing home and assistance on how to make a complaint. If a complainant is unhappy with the response received, he or she can appeal the decision as provided for in the Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Ombudsman can also examine complaints relating to the administrative actions of nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the nursing home concerned.<\/p>  <p>  In cases of complaint about a healthcare professional, the resident or family can also complain directly to the employee's professional regulatory body, for example the Nursing and Midwifery Board or the Irish Medical Council.<\/p>  <p>  For those nursing homes that are under the aegis of the Health Service Executive (HSE), there is a HSE-wide complaints process. Details of this process can be accessed on the HSE website at www.healthcomplaints.ie. <\/p>  <p>  Separately, HIQA welcomes information in relation to designated centres that come within its regulatory remit. As a regulator, HIQA has no legal role in examining individual complaints, however, the Authority does take into account all information it receives, including complaints from the public, when carrying out inspections and this range of information informs a risk-based approach to regulation. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, my Department is examining complaints processes across the nursing home sector including information on best practice, the level of standardisation, and the views of key stakeholders including residents and families, with a view to determining the need to further develop enablers such as policy, legislative and\/or guidance instruments to strengthen and enhance current arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, the Patient Advocacy Service (PAS), which currently supports residents in HSE-operated nursing homes to make complaints, will begin its rollout to private nursing homes at the end of 2022.

Throughout the pandemic, the response has been underpinned by our core national priorities of protecting the most vulnerable in society from the severe impacts of the disease, minimising the burden on the healthcare system, and continuing to keep schools and childcare facilities open. <\/p>  <p>  The COVID-19 pandemic is not over. The Office of the Chief Medical Officer continues to closely monitor the epidemiological profile of the disease and provide advice in relation to ongoing decision-making processes in respect of the pandemic. The importance of ongoing vigilance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and specifically in relation to the autumn\/winter 2022\/2023 period, has been signalled through international guidance. Work has been underway in my Department with regard to preparedness and contingency planning for the coming winter season, which is traditionally a very challenging time for our health and social services. <\/p>  <p>  Government has previously acknowledged the importance of reviewing the response to the pandemic. Since the beginning of the response, there has been a clear national commitment to continue to learn from the pandemic and, where necessary, to ensure that the public health-led approach evolves, as evidence and learning materialises.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health has taken an adaptive approach to the elements of the response falling within its remit. It has continuously worked to capture and to apply lessons learned from the national and international COVID-19 response to date. The Department has demonstrated its commitment to learning lessons from pandemic response across multiple domains to date. <\/p>  <p>  In May 2020, Government established the Nursing Home Expert Panel which examined and advised on the COVID-19 response in long-term residential healthcare settings. The Expert Panel&rsquo;s report was published on 19th August 2020 is available here. The Fourth Progress Report on implementation of the recommendations of Expert Panel is available here.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2022, a Public Health Reform Expert Advisory Group (PHREAG) commenced its work with Terms of Reference approved by Government. It was tasked with identifying learnings from the public health components of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland and internationally with a view towards strengthening public health including health protection generally and future public health threat and pandemic preparedness specifically. Further details on the PHREAG are available here.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2022, the Minister for Health established the COVID-19 Advisory Group (CAG), to consider and advise on how best to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s medium to long-term preparedness for future challenges posed by COVID-19. The CAG has considered lessons learned from the pandemic in its work. The recommendations of the CAG, with relevant World Health Organization (WHO), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and European Commission guidance, have informed my Department&rsquo;s strategic approach to the management of COVID-19 for autumn\/winter 2022\/2023.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has indicated that a comprehensive evaluation of how the country managed COVID-19 will provide an opportunity to learn lessons from our experiences in dealing with a pandemic over the past two years. This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar type emergency arrives. Consideration is being given as to what the best model for this evaluation will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400100#WREE04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1862,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400100#WREE04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1863,"qnumday":710,"qnumall":"[48574\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400100#WREE04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason that a person (details supplied) remains waiting for their cataract operation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1864,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

I have also secured an increase in the TAMS budget to &euro;90m, to fund the proposed large-scale investment in on-farm renewables for farmers, subject to the approval of the European Commission. This will help fund the proposed increase to 60% grant rate and a standalone investment ceiling of &euro;90,000 for solar installation.<\/p><p>  Separately, I am seeking EU Commission approval for a new scheme to continue the beef welfare measures which were previously funded under BEEP-S. This new scheme will sit alongside the new &euro;150\/cow Suckler Carbon Efficiency Scheme, and a &euro;20 million Sheep Welfare Scheme, maintaining the budget for targeted beef and sheep supports of over &euro;100 million. Beef and sheep farmers will also be well placed to benefit from the enhanced supports for fodder aid, for environmental measures and the supports available for the supports available for farmers transitioning to organic farming.<\/p><p>  While taxation policy is primarily the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Finance, I work closely with him to ensure that it is consistent with the Government's priorities for the agri-food sector.<\/p><p>  I am delighted that we agreed a new Accelerated Capital Allowance for Slurry Storage. This will drive further investments in slurry storage and management, consequently improving water quality, facilitating nutrient-use efficiency that reduces dependence on expensive artificial fertilisers, and reducing emissions. This measure is a strong signal of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting farmers in improving environmental sustainability.<\/p><p>  We also agreed on the renewal of vital tax reliefs including Stamp Duty Relief for Young-Trained Farmers and Stock Relief for Young-Trained Farmers and Registered Farm Partnerships. Generational renewal is critical to the future of the agri-food sector and national taxation measures, together with the support available under the CAP, represent a substantial commitment to young farmers. The renewal of Capital Gains Tax Relief for Farm Restructuring and Stamp Duty Relief for Farm Consolidation encourage the consolidation of farm holdings, reducing fragmentation and improving the operation and viability of farms. <\/p><p>  The Government has provided welcome supports in response to the current cost of living crisis. The Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme will provide important support to businesses including farmers and food businesses. The continuation of the reduction of excise duty on agricultural diesel to nil will also help alleviate costs for the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400102#WRGG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":1975,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400102#WRGG04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1976,"qnumday":748,"qnumall":"[48027\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400102#WRGG04500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the Forestry Service can refuse a non-grant aid application for an afforestation licence on the basis of the productivity of the site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1977,"qnumday":749,"qnumall":"[48028\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400102#WRGG04600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the Forestry Service can refuse a non-grant aid application for an afforestation licence based on species selection; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1978,"qnumday":750,"qnumall":"[48029\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400102#WRGG04700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a reaction and nitrogen survey is a requirement for non-grant aid application for an afforestation licence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1979,"qnumday":751,"qnumall":"[48030\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400102#WRGG04800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the basis on which the Forestry Service can decide that land is unplantable on a non-grant aid application for an afforestation licence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1980,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 748 to 751, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Under Section 32 of the Forestry Act 2014 and Regulation 20 of the Forestry Regulations 2017 I am empowered and in some cases I am statutorily obliged to refuse an application for an Afforestation Licence, whether or not the applicant has also applied for financial assistance under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme, on a number of grounds.<\/p>  <p>  - These grounds relate to the protection of the environment generally, ensuring of good forestry practice, the preservation of amenities, public health or safety, protection from flooding, and preservation of water quality; and specifically to the prevention of adverse impacts or significant effects on human health, animal or plant health, water quality, archaeological  site or features, areas of special amenity, European sites, or nature conservation.
