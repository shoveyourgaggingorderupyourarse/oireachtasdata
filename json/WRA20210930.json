It is a priority for Ireland&rsquo;s membership, and we are currently providing leadership on the Council as co-chair of the Informal Expert Group (IEG) on Climate and Security together with Niger.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the Open Debate was to deepen substantive awareness of how climate is relevant to the work of the Security Council, and the impacts of climate change on situations of conflict, and to outline what actions the Council can take within its mandate to anticipate, advance and shape action on climate-related security risks. UN Secretary-General, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres and a civil society activist provided important briefings to the Council on these issues. <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach noted that, where climate change is a factor in exacerbating instability and undermining peace and security, the Security Council should use the tools at its disposal to tackle the related issues. He urged the Council to act, and noted Ireland&rsquo;s intention to convene discussions on a thematic resolution on climate and security. <\/p>  <p>  Council members broadly welcomed Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to advance this agenda, with most supporting the tabling of a thematic resolution.\u00a0A small number noted their view that Climate change should be dealt with in broader development-related organs, fora and processes outside of the Security Council.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the Open Debate, Ireland and Niger intend to convene further discussions with all Council members, with a view to being able to adopt a thematic resolution.

Ireland always endeavours to participate in meetings in\u00a0all Council formations\u00a0in order to ensure that Ireland's position is articulated fully and that Ireland's influence on policy development is maximised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000075#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":190,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 89 to 96, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000075#WRE00700"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[47105\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000075#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the current strength of all branches of the Defence Forces; if further recruitment is required to bring each branch of the Forces up to optimum strength; if issues regarding salary, pay and conditions are being addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[47121\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000075#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the measures being taken to reach the approved threshold of 9,500 in the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 99 together.<\/p><p>As at 31st August 2021, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force was 8,550 personnel comprised of 6,927 Army personnel, 723 Air Corps personnel and 900 Naval Service personnel. While the Government remains committed to returning to, and maintaining the agreed strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, there are a number of factors, many of which are hard to predict, which will impact on the timeframe within which this will be achieved.<\/p><p>I have acknowledged the on-going staffing challenges in the Defence Forces\u00a0and these\u00a0have been well-documented. Initiatives to counter those challenges and play a role in restoring and retaining capacity and boosting specialist numbers include:<\/p><p>- Continuing Recruitment, which has resulted in a total of 406 personnel being inducted as at 27th September.\u00a0 A further 95 General Service recruits have accepted offers and will commence training on the 4th October.\u00a0 The Cadet competition is at offer stage and the process is expected to close on the 22nd October.\u00a0 Further inductions are also anticipated.\u00a0<\/p><p>- The scope of direct entry competitions was expanded in 2021, from 10 competitions, to also include a new Air Corps Aircraft Technician competition which resulted in 3 recent inductions. Additionally, direct entry terms and conditions continue to be revised to further improve intakes. In 2021, the maximum age of entry for Technicians was increased to 29 and flexibility in the starting rate of pay of some Naval Service specialists was progressed.\u00a0<\/p><p>- The re-entry campaign for former members of the PDF continues and has resulted in 1 re-commissioned officer and 28 re-enlisted personnel, to date, in 2021.<\/p><p>- The sea-going service commitment scheme and an extension of a tax credit, both for sea-going Naval Service personnel, are examples of targeted measures that I have introduced which are aimed at retaining experienced personnel. This follows the reintroduction of a successful service commitment scheme for Flying Officers in the Air Corps.<\/p><p>There has been significant progress on pay arising from increases from recent pay agreements, the most recent of which was\u00a0a 2% increase on annualised salaries from\u00a01st October 2020. The new public service pay agreement &ldquo;Building on Momentum&rdquo; provides for an increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater, on October 2021, with further increases to follow.<\/p><p>I am confident that the pay benefits delivered by the\u00a0Public Service pay Agreements, in tandem with the implementation of the\u00a0PSPC's recommendations will\u00a0improve recruitment and\u00a0retention challenges currently being experienced by the PDF.\u00a0 15 projects, most of which are now complete, were undertaken to facilitate the implementation of the PSPC&rsquo;s recommendations. These included projects focused on a broad range of non-pay measures and also included 4 projects relating to immediate pay which have provided immediate benefits to PDF members totalling some &euro;10m, as well as initiatives that will lead to further improvements. I have recently received the final report for the Review of Recruitment project and the Workforce Planning Project is being progressed through the joint civil\/military Strategic Human Resources Group.\u00a0 These projects will inform recruitment and retention policy.<\/p><p>Additionally, the independent Commission on\u00a0the Defence Forces is examining a range of recruitment and retention matters and I look forward to receiving their recommendations, which will be considered and implemented as appropriate.<\/p><p>My focus remains on retaining and restoring the PDF to its full capacity but there is no quick fix to the challenges facing the Defence Forces today. As I have outlined, there has been significant work undertaken to date, and such work continues, but it will take time to see the full effect of the measures introduced.<\/p><p>More information is available at the following link: <ahref=\"https:\/\/data.oireachtas.ie\/ie\/oireachtas\/debates\/questions\/supportingDocumentation\/2021-10-01_pq97-30-09_en.xlsx\">Ranks<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000075#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":196,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[47125\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000075#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he has had any recent engagement with the representative organisations from the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1591","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":197,"content":"<p>The Defence (Amendment) Act 1990 and Defence Force Regulations S6 provided for the establishment of Representative Associations for members of the Permanent Defence Force.

The National Cyber Security Centre in his Department is the national response authority for cyber security incidents. But, of course, response to cyber threats is a whole-of-Government challenge with inputs in the security domain from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  The primary responsibility of the Defence Forces relates to the defence and security of\u00a0their own networks and systems. However, as in any emergency situation, once Defence systems are supported, the Department of Defence and Defence Forces provide support to the National Cyber Security Centre. For example, during the recent cyberattack on the HSE, the Defence Forces played an important role in supporting the response to it including provision of operational support to the HSE and, in particular, logistical and organisational support.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, in the delivery of measures to improve the Cyber Security of the State. This is being done\u00a0in line with the Programme for Government commitment to implement the National Cyber Security Strategy, recognizing the potential and important role of the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  To this end, officials from the Department of Defence\u00a0and members of the Defence Forces are actively involved in implementing the National Cyber Security Strategy such as through secondment of an officer\u00a0to the Cyber Security Centre of Excellence in Estonia and departmental membership of the Inter-Departmental Committee overseeing\u00a0implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  This Inter-Departmental Committee has recently been charged with the additional work of overseeing the plan to significantly expand the National Cyber Security Centre so that it can further develop its competence and capacity to help defend and protect IT systems and key services into the future.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  For operational security reasons, no public comment will be made regarding Defence Forces Cyber Capability but\u00a0I would note that the establishment of an independent Commission on the Defence Forces underpins the Government's commitment to ensuring that the\u00a0Defence Forces are fit for purpose, both in terms of meeting immediate requirements and also in terms of seeking to develop a longer term vision beyond 2030. Amongst the issues that the Commission is examining are Defence Force capabilities, structures and staffing in a number of areas.

Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). Given that prices are not regulated, they are set by all suppliers as entirely commercial and operational matters by them. The position of successive Governments, for almost twenty years, has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices and to support competition to drive down prices.\u00a0 Data from approved price comparison sites shows that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers and this can mitigate the impact of price rises for consumers.    Protections are in place for those falling into difficulty with their energy bills. Under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them. Suppliers must also provide every opportunity to customers to avoid disconnection and must identify customers at risk of disconnection and encourage them to engage with them as early as possible. Suppliers are also obliged to offer a range of payment options, such as a debt-repayment plan for a customer in arrears. Where possible, suppliers must also offer customers with difficulties paying their bills a prepayment meter or budget controller. <\/p>  <p>  Income supports including the Fuel Allowance and the Household Benefits Package are available from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) to help households with the costs of heating their homes. The Fuel Allowance payment, of &euro;28.00 per week for 28 weeks, which is a total of &euro;784 from October to April, will be provided to approximately 370,000 low-income households. The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs. In addition, the Minister for Social Protection also provides an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme. This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year. In addition, DSP also funds an exceptional needs payment, which can include support with fuel bills in some cases. <\/p>  <p>  Improving the energy efficiency of a home can also help to protect households from energy poverty.

At the outset, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies as to what terms and conditions apply in relation to the provision of cover to specific individuals or businesses.\u00a0 This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).<\/p>  <p>  It is my understanding that generally, insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer such insurance products and what terms to apply.\u00a0 These can include age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle.\u00a0 In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration.\u00a0 In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the repayment schedule. In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors.\u00a0 Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specific situation of cardiac patients, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland to get a view.\u00a0 It noted that life insurance products are designed to provide financial support to customers in the event of death or ill-health and insurers are keen to ensure that cover is available where it is needed.\u00a0 They set out that it is not standard practice to automatically decline cover for any cohort of applicants, including those with cardiac conditions.\u00a0 They noted that an insurer is obliged to assess the risk involved as part of any application for a life insurance policy and this will be specific to the individual applicant, and that the availability of this product depends on a number of factors.\u00a0 In this regard, applicants are asked questions about various conditions, like asthma, bronchitis, strokes and any specific cardiac conditions in order for the insurers to assess the risk involved.\u00a0 They concluded that all applicants are assessed against the same criteria, and if higher risk is identified as a result of this assessment then the policy will be adjusted accordingly, and that cover may be declined if the applicant poses a risk beyond the insurer&rsquo;s threshold.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the points made in relation to the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, as the Deputy will be aware\u00a0it is no longer part of the Single Market, including for insurance. As part of the extensive preparations for the end of the withdrawal transition period, European and domestic regulatory authorities, including the Central Bank of Ireland, instructed relevant UK\/Gibraltar firms to make and implement contingency plans to ensure that they could continue to provide services to their EU customers post-Brexit.\u00a0 I understand from the Central Bank that a significant majority of these undertakings implemented such measures.\u00a0 Therefore, these insurers should be able to continue to offer insurance business to Irish customers. Insurance Ireland also informed my officials that it is unaware of any insurer selling life insurance in Ireland that has exited due to Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider.

It recognises the fact that a business cycle runs over several years and that it would be unfair to tax income earned in one year and not allow relief for losses incurred in another. Loss relief works by allowing a deduction for losses incurred in one accounting period against profits earned in another period.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query,\u00a0section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 precludes Revenue officials from directly or indirectly disclosing taxpayer information to third parties unless this is specifically provided for in legislation. Therefore it is not possible to provide estimates based on such a small cohort of taxpayers.\u00a0 However, based\u00a0on public information as to pre-COVID-19 profitability levels,\u00a0 a limit (be it 25% or 50%) on the Corporation Tax losses forward that can be used in one year would likely not yield significant additional tax, due to the amounts of losses forward available to the relevant companies.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A five-year restriction on the carry forward of losses could mean that these companies would no longer be able to use the historic losses that are being carried forward since the financial crisis. However, the likely additional tax yield from such a measure would depend on future profitability levels of the banks and it is not possible to estimate this accurately at present. It is further noted that, if losses forward were to be restricted in this manner, future profitability is likely to be offset to some extent by current losses arising during the pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to understand that the State is actually getting value from these tax losses through share sales. In addition, despite the scale of losses accumulated, the banks contribute to the Exchequer through the financial institutions levy. <\/p>  <p>  In 2018 Department of Finance officials produced a detailed technical note for the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on the subject of both bank losses and corporation tax losses more generally (see www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/436ff7-technical-note-on-the-potential-consequences-of-changes-to-the-treat\/).

Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.<\/p>  <p>  This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational\/community\/religious buildings; thereby reducing the regulatory and financial burden associated with this type of development.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, my Department is in the process of commissioning the development of detailed aviation safeguarding maps which will identify and delineate specific but limited areas in the vicinity of airports and aerodromes (referred to as exclusion zones) within which the exemptions will not apply. This mapping process will take approximately nine months to complete.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst this work is ongoing, my Department proposes to advance interim regulations, adopting a temporary, albeit more stringent, radial approach incorporating initial defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes. These interim regulations, allowing for increased solar panel planning exemptions, will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country, only excluding those limited exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes.<\/p>  <p>  The draft interim regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001\/42\/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. The SEA process, involving a public consultation on the proposals, is currently underway and is expected to be completed by mid-December 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Following the public consultation and consideration of any submissions received, and as required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the process for\u00a0finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with interim exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is now expected to be completed in early 2022. As outlined, pending the finalisation of the aforementioned aviation safeguarding maps, these interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the proposed new solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in\u00a0close proximity\u00a0to airports and aerodromes.<\/p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed in early 2022.

The aim was to provide rent certainty to tenants and landlords by moderating medium-term rent levels.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to better protect tenants with affordability challenges by extending the operation of RPZs until the end of 2024 and prohibiting any necessary rent increase in a RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). This measure significantly reduced the level of permissible rent increases for the estimated 74% of all tenancies which are in RPZs. <\/p>  <p>  When introducing these measures,\u00a0I was very clear on the need to carefully monitor inflation. At that time, HICP inflation averaged 0.73% p.a. over the previous 3 years but had risen to 1.6% p.a. in the year ending June 2021. I needed to revise the RPZ rent control relatively quickly in July, on a basis that could be independently verified.

The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the Customs Union and Single Market produced inevitable and unwelcome consequences for the island. Even with the Withdrawal Agreement and Trade and Cooperation Agreement in place, the seamless trade we enjoyed with  Great Britain when we were both members of the Single Market cannot be replicated as was. The Government has dedicated substantial time and resources into preparing for Brexit since 2016 and continues to do whatever it can to mitigate against disruption caused by Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  At an early stage in the Withdrawal Agreement negotiations, both the UK and the EU acknowledged the unique circumstances on the island, recognising the necessity of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border and protecting North-South cooperation. The full implementation and effective operation of the Good Friday Agreement and all subsequent agreements is an utmost priority for this Government. The Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland, which is an integral part of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement, was designed and agreed by the UK and the EU to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement and gains of the peace process, while at the same time protecting the integrity of the EU Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place within it.<\/p>  <p>  I am in regular and ongoing contact with political leaders and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland in relation to the implementation of the Protocol, as well as with Commission Vice President Maros &Scaron;efcovic, fellow EU Member State colleagues, and British Government counterparts.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Our approach, shared by our EU colleagues, continues to be informed by engagements with people and businesses across Northern Ireland, taking on board genuine concerns as we seek realistic solutions within the framework of the Protocol. Throughout these engagements, the clear message we have received is that most people in Northern Ireland &ndash; especially those in the business community &ndash; want the Protocol to work well.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, stability, certainty, and predictability are required to realise the opportunities which the Protocol presents for Northern Ireland. This can only be achieved by the UK and the EU jointly agreeing solutions to outstanding issues. In this regard, we welcome the continuation of technical talks between the two sides and the latest meeting of the Specialised Committee on the Protocol on 24 September.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We take unionist concerns in relation to the Protocol seriously and we will continue to listen and engage with those concerns, just as we have with the perspectives of everyone across Northern Ireland. It is important to reiterate that the Protocol makes no change to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We remain confident that solutions do exist, within the parameters of the Protocol, for the issues that have arisen to date. The EU has consistently demonstrated a considered, credible, solution-driven approach to these issues. We will continue to encourage the UK to work in partnership with the EU in a spirit of positive and constructive engagement in order to identify pragmatic and sustainable solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000080#WRKK04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Policy","counter":475,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000080#WRKK04200"},{"type":"question","counter":476,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[43423\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000080#WRKK04300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to, and his views on, the emerging famine in southern Madagascar, the world&rsquo;s first climate-induced famine as described by the UN World Food Programme.","asker":"1562","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":477,"content":"<p>In response to the emerging famine in southern Madagascar, the consequence of three consecutive years of drought compounded by Covid-19, in July I approved a grant of &euro;0.5m in Irish Aid funding to the World Food Programme's activities in Madagascar.

In these discussions, Ireland has called for a peaceful and negotiated political settlement, and we have placed a very strong emphasis on the need for any new administration to guarantee the protection of civilians, to fulfil Afghanistan&rsquo;s obligations under international law, and to respect human rights, especially for Afghan women and girls.\u00a0We have highlighted the worsening humanitarian situation as a top priority, and have also consistently called for the safe, secure, orderly and unhindered departure of foreign nationals and at-risk Afghans who wish to leave the country.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  On 9 September, I chaired a Security Council debate on the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). Speaking at that meeting, I stressed that Kabul airport and Afghanistan&rsquo;s land borders must be fully open and operational, both to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and to ensure that Afghans and foreign citizens can safely depart. I also emphasised the need for full and safe humanitarian access to allow life-saving support to reach all Afghans, and called for the full respect of the human rights of all Afghans, including women and girls as well as minorities. <\/p>  <p>  It is critically important that the UN can continue to do its vital work in Afghanistan and, in this context, Ireland played an active role in the negotiation of UN Security Council Resolution 2596, adopted on 17 September, which renewed the mandate of UNAMA for a further 6 months. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland was also actively engaged in the negotiation of Resolution 2593, which was adopted on 30 August. This called on the Taliban to respect its commitments to allow the safe, secure, and orderly departure from Afghanistan of Afghans and foreign nationals who want to leave, and for the re-opening of Kabul Airport and enhanced airport security. <\/p>  <p>  We supported the Security Council Press Statement of 27 August, which was issued in response to the appalling terrorist attacks near Kabul Airport, and which called on all relevant parties to respect and facilitate the safe evacuation of civilians. Ireland was also actively engaged in the negotiation of the Security Council Press Statement adopted on 16 August, which emphasised the need for all parties to respect their obligations under International Humanitarian Law in all circumstances, including those related to the protection of civilians, and underscored the particular vulnerability of humanitarian and medical personnel, interpreters and other international service providers.<\/p>  <p>  We will continue to prioritise the situation in Afghanistan in our work on the Security Council, and to do whatever we can to help ensure that at-risk Afghans can safely leave the country. <\/p>  <p>  Our work on the Security Council complements our other activities in support of the Afghan people, including our ongoing efforts to provide refuge here in Ireland for some of those who are most at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000080#WRKK06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Visits","counter":496,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000081#WRLL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":497,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[47199\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000081#WRLL00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to make an official visit to Israel later in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":498,"content":"<p>I hope to visit a number of countries in the Middle East, including Israel, before the end of this year.

To this end, UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres launched a peacekeeping reform initiative in 2018, known as Action for Peacekeeping. This aims to refocus peacekeeping with more targeted mandates, stronger operations, increased support for political solutions, and better-equipped and trained forces to strengthen protection of civilians. <\/p>  <p>  In 2021, the Secretary-General has launched a new phase of reform with Action for Peacekeeping Plus, which incorporates the use of technology and the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda across its priorities.

Each conflict is unique in its character, scale and complexity, and as such cannot be ranked by any single set of criteria of severity.<\/p>  <p>  This month alone, at the UN Security Council, Ireland has highlighted human rights issues in meetings relating to: climate and security; small arms and light weapons; UN peacekeeping transitions, as well as in regard to conflicts in Afghanistan; Libya; South Sudan; Sudan; Syria and Yemen.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The particular human rights violations and abuses encountered by women and children, including sexual and gender based violence issue, crosscuts all of our engagement on both conflict and human rights.\u00a0 In addition to co-chairing the Security Council&rsquo;s Informal Expert Group on Women, Peace and Security, Ireland is also a member of the UN Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict which addresses the issue of child soldiers and ensures follow up of the recommendations at country level. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Longer-term, we also support the reform of the Security Council itself and continue our efforts in this regard.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also has a long tradition of contributing to UN and EU peace-support missions, including in some of the world&rsquo;s most complex and intractable conflicts. Ireland has maintained a continuous presence in UN peace support operations since 1958, and has more than 550 personnel in United Nations mandated missions overseas.\u00a0 The Government is committed to participation in peacekeeping operations as a tangible contribution to the development of global peace and security.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  On 9 September, I was very pleased to preside over the unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 2594 on peacekeeping transitions that was drafted and negotiated by Ireland. This important resolution provides a framework for ensuring that the reconfiguration of a UN presence is properly planned for and resourced, particularly with respect to protecting civilians and upholding human rights. It also encourages national governments to develop national plans, policies and strategies for the protection of civilians.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>Ireland also engages actively at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC). At the 47th  \u00a0session of the Council beginning on 21 June, Ireland made national statements on a broad range of thematic issues and country-specific human rights situations including in regard to violence against women. Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador also delivered a national statement in response to the report from UN Special Rapporteur on\u00a0Trafficking\u00a0in Persons, Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally, with whom my Department meets regularly. Ireland provides core funding to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) with whom we work in partnership on the many aspects of counter-trafficking responses including prevention, protection, and prosecution\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At the ongoing 48th session of the Human Rights Council Ireland&rsquo;s national statement under item four highlighted grave concerns about the human rights and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan; Tigray and neighbouring regions of Ethiopia; the occupied Palestinian territory; and Yemen. It additionally highlighted our serious concerns about the human rights situation in Belarus and Myanmar where elected politicians, together with media and civil society face severe restrictions on their rights to freedom of movement and expression. In the context of increased authoritarian restrictions globally, Ireland will also join a Joint Statement supporting the right to peaceful protest.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is also member of the core group presenting the HRC resolution in response to the current report from the Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen. This is the only UN mandated international, independent mechanism working towards accountability for the Yemeni people. Our Ambassador also intervened in response to reports from the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar and the Commission of Inquiry on Syria.<\/p>  <p>  At European Union (EU) level, Ireland is an active participant and contributor to the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, which works globally to support the preservation of peace, the prevention of conflicts and the strengthening of international security.\u00a0Human Rights issues feature prominently at the meetings I attend at the EU Foreign Affairs Council.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my officials engage extensively on human rights issues at the relevant Council-level working parties including on the EU&rsquo;s Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime which strengthens the EU&rsquo;s ability to take collective action against perpetrators of human rights violations. Ireland&rsquo;s Embassies also engage actively in support of the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy (2020-24); on EU led Human Rights dialogues; and through financial support from Irish Aid in relevant countries.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland prioritises accountability, including for crimes such as genocide or ethnic cleansing, not only as a means of pursuing justice for victims, but also as a crucial component to create stability and peace in post-conflict situations. A strong international criminal justice system is central to fighting impunity. While states bear the primary responsibility to investigate the most serious international crimes, including war crimes and genocide, Ireland regards the International Criminal Court as the cornerstone of such a system. Ireland, together with its EU partners is a consistent and strong supporter of the Court. We will continue to support and defend the Court throughout and beyond our term on the United Nations Security Council, whilst ensuring that accountability remains one of the key principles underpinning our engagement at all levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000081#WRLL04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":539,"content":"<p>Question No. 219 answered with Question No. 218.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":540,"content":"<p>Question No. 220 answered with Question No. 218.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":541,"content":"<p>Question No. 221 answered with Question No. 218.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":542,"content":"<p>Question No. 222 answered with Question No. 218.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":543,"content":"<p>Question No. 223 answered with Question No. 218.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":544,"content":"<p>Question No. 224 answered with Question No. 218.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":545,"content":"<p>Question No. 225 answered with Question No. 218.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":547,"content":"<p>Question No. 226 answered with Question No. 218.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":548,"content":"<p>Question No. 227 answered with Question No. 218.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East","counter":549,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000082#WRMM00400"},{"type":"question","counter":550,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[47411\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000082#WRMM00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent of restrictions imposed on democratically-elected party or opposition party representatives in Bahrain or other locations throughout the east or Middle East; the extent to which the international community has engaged with the victims; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":551,"content":"<p>Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels.

The roots of hunger lie in poverty, deprivation and exclusion, exacerbated by conflict and climate change: COVID-19 has amplified all of these drivers. Insecurity is a barrier to providing timely and effective assistance. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been a long-standing champion of global efforts to reduce hunger and starvation, working with a range of development and humanitarian partners. <\/p>  <p>  At last week&rsquo;s Food Systems Summit, Ireland played a key role in the coalition on Zero Hunger. The action of this coalition, in the run up to the December Nutrition for Growth Summit in Japan, will focus on mobilising resources, and focusing efforts on coordinated, effective interventions in priority hunger hotspots. <\/p>  <p>  At the UN Security Council, Ireland is playing a leading role on hunger, in particular through our work on Resolution 2417 on hunger and conflict. Discussions at the Council also address issues such as starvation as a weapon of war and the denial or impeding of humanitarian access.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish National Task Team for Rural Africa, a collaboration between my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, a number of State agencies, NGOs and representatives of Irish agribusiness companies, has made a number of recommendations to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s food systems contribution in Africa. Work is ongoing to implement those recommendations, including better coordination and targeting of the provision of Irish expertise on nutrition in Africa. <\/p>  <p>  At present, Ireland holds a seat on the Executive Board of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), which provides an opportunity to champion issues of hunger and nutrition in its work, as well as across the Rome-based Agencies. <\/p>  <p>  Together with our EU and UN partners, and through our Embassies on the ground, we will continue to closely monitor hunger crises across the globe, supporting political efforts to resolve conflicts, advocating for resource mobilisation, and championing effective responses. In 2020 (the last year for which figures are available), Ireland spent at least &euro;193 million on projects that addressed hunger. As set out in A Better World, Ireland&rsquo;s international development policy, our overseas assistance will continue to target those furthest behind, and continue to relentlessly focus on preventing hunger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000082#WRMM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":556,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000082#WRMM01100"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[47414\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000082#WRMM01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the degree to which the international community continues to respond to the activities of the Boko Haram, Al Shabaab or other such organisations involved in the kidnapping and imprisonment of women and girls; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":558,"content":"<p>Ireland strongly condemns the continued violence perpetrated by Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab.

Also, as a Member State, Ireland contributes to the significant European Union development and humanitarian response in Somalia, and in countries affected by Boko Haram.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Since 2015, Irish Aid has contributed &euro;27 million in humanitarian funding to alleviate the conditions of people in distress across the Lake Chad region.\u00a0 This includes funding to Concern Worldwide, Goal, and Plan International Ireland, as well as to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Through the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS) and the UN Peacebuilding Commission, the United Nations is helping stabilise the situation in the Lake Chad region.

Ireland is Chair of the Somalia Sanctions Committee at the UN Security Council.

Ireland also deploys one expert to the civilian mission EUCAP Sahel Niger. 14 Defence Forces personnel are deployed in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA).

It is intended that at the end of 2023, mental health and wellbeing support within the Defence Forces will be delivered in a coordinated, multi-disciplinary and directed manner that is designed to produce the best outcomes for the organisation and the military personnel and their families.<\/p>  <p>  On 2nd November 2020, the\u00a0Deputy Chief Of Staff (Support) issued an order for the convening of the Defence Forces Mental Health and Wellbeing Standing Committee which has responsibility for the implementation of the strategy. The Committee is chaired by the Officer In Charge of the Defence Forces Personnel Support Services and includes representatives of all subject matter experts in the area of mental health and wellbeing within the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  The committee has selected 15 milestones from the strategy for initial consideration during 2021. Each Milestone has been allocated to a working group consisting of selected members of the Standing Committee and other key personnel and subject matter experts as required. Work plans have been created and the Working Groups report monthly to a full meeting of the Standing Committee. At these meetings progress achieved is assessed and guidance offered to counter obstacles or to provide direction for action. <\/p>  <p>  At the end of 2021, completed Working Group reports with associated documents will form the basis for a report on the working of the Standing Committee for the period, along with interim reports for Working Groups which are scheduled to continue into 2022. It is expected that the Defence Forces will then be in a position to proceed with the implementation of a Mental Health Strategy for 2024-2029, which will look to build on the progress achieved and ensure the effective delivery of mental health and wellbeing within the Defence Forces to the end of the decade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000082#WRMM02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Corps","counter":575,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000082#WRMM03000"},{"type":"question","counter":576,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[46795\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000082#WRMM03100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of pilots who applied to re-enter the Air Corps; the number of applications approved; the number refused; the number awaiting a decision; the number under appeal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1495","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":577,"content":"<p>A Recommissioning Scheme\u00a0was introduced in 2019 to\u00a0target particular capability gaps of a specialised or technical nature, where vacancies exist.\u00a0<\/p><p>Defence Force Regulation CS4 governs the number of personnel allowable at each rank across the Defence Forces.

The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish Waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Economic Zone. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. I am advised that the fleet is managed to ensure maximum availability to meet operational requirements.<\/p>  <p>  On any given patrol day the Naval Service can carry out a number of taskings on behalf of other State agencies such as the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners. <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service. <\/p>  <p>  The replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi-role vessel, MRV, is the immediate project currently under way.

Specially trained Designated Contact Persons (DCPs) are available to assist complainants. The formal procedure requires that a complaint is made in writing. <\/p>  <p>  Chapter 2 of Administrative Instruction A7 provides another formal mechanism for individuals, under Section 114 (1) and 114 (2) of the Defence Act, 1954, to seek redress of wrongs or to make a complaint.

My Department is actively monitoring the issue and has sought data and evidence-based proposals from sectoral representatives. <\/p>  <p>  The primary data-source for the ELC and SAC sector is the Pobal Annual Early Years Sector Profile. In the most recent published report (the 2019-20 report, published in 2021), 44% of services reported challenges in recruiting suitably qualified staff over the past 12 months. While this figure was down 9% from the previous year, it remains very high. The staff turnover rate has similarly fallen from 23% to 18%, but remains unacceptably high.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Recruitment and recruitment difficulties in the sector are undoubtedly linked to poor terms and conditions in the workforce, with for example the average pay being &euro;12.45 per hour.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the need for significant improvement in pay and working conditions for practitioners in ELC and SAC services. The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy.<\/p>  <p>  As the State does not employ early learning and childcare practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to doing what is in my power to improve wages and working conditions. That is why last December I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions in the sector and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee (JLC). In agreement with IBEC\/Childhood Services Ireland, and SIPTU, I appointed Dr Kevin Duffy, former Chair of the Labour Court, to be the independent chair of this process.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of Dr Duffy&rsquo;s report, on 11 March I wrote to the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, recommending the establishment of a JLC for the sector. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, the Labour Court recommended establishment of a JLC, and Minister English accepted the Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendations. The Establishment Order came into effect at the beginning of July. The JLC will provide an opportunity for unions and employer representatives to work together to determine wages and working conditions for ELC and SAC.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, work on a Workforce Development Plan for ELC and SAC continues, with a final report expected by the end of the year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000085#WRPP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":721,"qnumday":288,"qnumall":"[47247\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000085#WRPP00900","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a demand for more childcare places outside of ECCE hours; the steps he is taking to address demand; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":722,"content":"<p>My Department closely monitors developments in relation to early learning and childcare capacity.

It has also supported the sector to increase the number of places available - by 27,433 places nationally since 2015. New data on capacity was collected in May and June 2021, and is expected to be available in the latter part of the year. This will allow the Department to update our data on capacity at a Local Authority level, which will inform future planning and funding priorities.

These recommendations recognise the very significant impact of the previous testing and tracing requirements on children in these settings. The changes which came into effect on 27 September 2021 are as follows:  <\/p>  <p>  - Automatic contact tracing of close contacts in childcare facilities and primary education will be discontinued (not including special education facilities). <\/p>  <p>  - Testing of asymptomatic close contacts in childcare facilities and primary education will be discontinued (not including special education facilities). <\/p>  <p>  - Children aged 12yrs or under, who are identified as close contacts in childcare, educational settings, special education settings or other non-household settings and who are asymptomatic will no longer be required to restrict movements, unless indicated by the local public health team. <\/p>  <p>  - Children aged 12yrs or under who are identified as household close contacts in household settings will still be required to restrict movements and get tested, regardless of symptomatic status.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the public health advice remains that any child aged 12yrs or under who displays symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should rapidly self-isolate and not attend school or socialise until 48 hours after they are symptom free.<\/p>  <p>Further information is available in the Guidance for COVID-19 Contact Tracing for Children (>3 months to under 13 years of age) published by the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre, available at\u00a0www.hpsc.ie\/a-z\/respiratory\/coronavirus\/novelcoronavirus\/guidance\/educationguidance\/Contact%20tracing%20under%2013s.pdf<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The recommendations which have come into effect are based on what has been learned throughout the pandemic, primarily  <\/p>  <p>  - Children seem more likely than adults to have no symptoms or to have mild disease <\/p>  <p>  - Investigation of cases identified in school settings suggests that child to child transmission in schools is uncommon and not the primary cause of Sars-CoV-2 infection in children, particularly in pre-school and primary educational settings <\/p>  <p>  - Children are rarely identified as the route of transmission of infection into the household setting  <\/p>  <p>  - Children are not more likely than adults to spread infection to other people.<\/p>  <p>  On that basis, from a public health perspective there is no clinical need for information to be routinely shared with contacts of cases and Public Health do not recommend telling parents of other children that there has been a case of COVID 19 within a class or group. Sharing of health data relating to positive cases in the manner envisaged in the question should only be done on the advice of Public Health and according to the provisions of the Infectious Disease Regulations. Since the provisions of the Infectious Disease Regulations no longer apply in this instance, it is important to note the importance of an individual&rsquo;s confidentiality not being broken by others, in line with normal GDPR requirements. It is important that families are aware of the need to ensure they do not send children in to school and childcare facilities or to participate in activities if the child has new symptoms consistent with COVID 19. In these circumstances they should observe their child and contact their GP as appropriate. It is also important to regularly re-enforce the benefit to all of continuing to abide by infection prevention control and mitigation measures in place within school and childcare facilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the changes in guidance outlined above do not apply to special educational needs (SEN) schools or SEN-specific classes or children attending respite care. In these circumstances close contacts amongst children may well still be identified and asked to restrict their movements, following a Public Health Risk Assessment conducted by a public health doctor. However, close contacts will generally be requested only to restrict their movements for 5 days and be referred for one COVID-19 test. This is to balance the observation period required for children for signs of infection, with testing at the most relevant time, whilst not prolonging restricted movements and the harms to children from these restrictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000086#WRQQ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Care","counter":792,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000086#WRQQ02100"},{"type":"question","counter":793,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[47202\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000086#WRQQ02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the appointment of the specialist community diabetes teams under the Enhanced Community Care Programme; if the service will be available to all persons with diabetes free of charge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":794,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000086#WRQQ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":795,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000086#WRQQ02400"},{"type":"question","counter":796,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[47203\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000086#WRQQ02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the lack of funding for orthodontic treatments for children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":797,"content":"<p>I secured a substantial increase in funding for the HSE in 2021 to fund improved service provision across all parts of the health sector.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the HSE that over\u00a0800 dental professionals are employed in the HSE\u00a0dental and orthodontic service, including\u00a0Consultant Orthodontists (10.3 WTE)\u00a0and\u00a0Specialist Orthodontists specialists (39.3 WTE).

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p>  <p>  At the request of my Department, the HIQA are conducting a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) on a school based HPV mop-up vaccination programme (for those that were previously eligible and missed or turned down the vaccine). The HIQA has confirmed that this HTA has been added to its work programme for 2021\/2022 and I have requested that my officials give consideration to the outcome of this work in the context of the immunisation programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000087#WRRR05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":904,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000087#WRRR05300"},{"type":"question","counter":905,"qnumday":351,"qnumall":"[47318\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000087#WRRR05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of ambulance calls in the past three months; the average ambulance call-out time to arrival at the scene of a patient, by functioning area, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1595","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":906,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000087#WRRR05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Complaints Procedures","counter":908,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000088#WRSS00200"},{"type":"question","counter":909,"qnumday":352,"qnumall":"[47319\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000088#WRSS00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to a recent statement in reference to ongoing maternity restrictions (details supplied), the complaints procedure that has been established to allow women to lodge a complaint while accessing maternity services across each of the 19 maternity units.","asker":"1520","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":910,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000088#WRSS00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":911,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000088#WRSS00500"},{"type":"question","counter":912,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[47320\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000088#WRSS00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to a recent statement (details supplied), if an update will be provided on the random spot checks for compliance with the easing of restrictions across the 19 national maternity units; if this commitment has been implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":913,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000088#WRSS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":914,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000088#WRSS00800"},{"type":"question","counter":915,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[47321\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000088#WRSS00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive a hospital appointment.","asker":"1596","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":916,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

This funding is being used to support hospitals in addressing backlogs, extending clinic times, providing additional clinics, increasing diagnostic capacity and providing locum\/temporary support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important that our focus remains on the implementation of the National Cancer Strategy across the areas of\u00a0prevention, diagnosis, treatment and patient supports, as well as on supporting cancer services to progress against the background of Covid-19, and the impact of the ransomware attack on the health service in May 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Decisions on the funding of cancer services next year will be made in the context of Budget 2022. The Irish Cancer Society has presented a pre-budget submission and I can assure you that their views will be taken into account in the Service Planning process for next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000089#WRTT01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treatment Purchase Fund","counter":978,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000089#WRTT01400"},{"type":"question","counter":979,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[47439\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021093000089#WRTT01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total sum spent on, by or through or allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund since its inception by year to date;
