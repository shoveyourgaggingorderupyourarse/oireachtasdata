The proposal is flawed and will make the housing crisis even worse.  The Taoiseach says the levy is to ensure that industry contributes to redress schemes for defective blocks and pyrite.  However, the reality is that this is not a levy on the industry at all.  The Government's scheme is really a levy on those desperately seeking to buy or build a home, because companies will simply factor it in.  They will pass on the increase to customers and it will inevitably push up prices that, as the Taoiseach is aware, have already soared beyond their Celtic tiger peak.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland has warned that the levy could increase the price of a home by an eye-watering &euro;4,000.  Incredibly, it will also force homeowners with defective blocks in Mayo, Donegal, Clare and Limerick to pay even more to fix their homes, which is crazy.<\/p>  <p>  We are in the middle of an unprecedented housing disaster.  For so many, affordability is a pipe dream and now the Government's levy will hit ordinary people in the pocket while they struggle with sky-high housing costs.  Taoiseach, imagine for a moment that you were a member of the generation locked out of home ownership - dealing with extortionate rent so you cannot save for a deposit, with a historic lack of supply pushing up house prices and with the financial muscle of cuckoo funds sending those prices skyrocketing further - and then you hear that the Government, which should be working to get house prices down, is going to introduce a measure that will add thousands of euro to the price of a home.  Imagine that.  Taoiseach, imagine you were a first-time buyer who, after scrimping and scraping for years, was finally able to afford a home and then the Government comes along with this levy to make it harder again, or that you were one of those living in a house with defective blocks which is crumbling all around you while you have been crying out for a credible and fair remediation scheme, or that you were one of those who bought an apartment, duplex or other home riddled with Celtic tiger era fire safety defects and you have been left with no scheme at all.  Could the Government honestly look any of those people in the eye and tell them that the levy is about them?  It is a levy that puts the burden and pain on ordinary home buyers instead of where it belongs - on the banks, the profits of big developers and those responsible for defects.

The <i>Irish Mail on Sunday<\/i>reported that State lender, Home Building Finance Ireland, has entirely financed the construction of 211 apartments in Clonsilla.  It has not financed homes that will be owned by the State or apartments that will be leased on a cost-rental basis.  These are apartments that have been block-bought by one of the biggest and wealthiest institutional landlords in the country, Urbeo.  The State is entirely financing this deal but the ultimate beneficiary will be an investment fund charging sky-high rents for these apartments when they are completed.<\/p><p>Meanwhile, the <i>Business Post <\/i>has reported on an extraordinary intervention by another investment fund in north County Dublin, which is hoovering up starter homes in Castleview in Swords.  Typically, these homes sell for between &euro;200,000 and &euro;350,000.  Earlier this year, a three-bedroom, end-of-terrace home sold for a gigantic &euro;1.7 million and another home in the estate went for a huge &euro;850,000.  On just one day in April, this fund, ICAV, bought nine homes in Castleview.  Prices for seven of these homes did not reach the dizzying heights of &euro;1.7 million but they were all sold for a premium of between &euro;20,000 and &euro;88,000 over the median market price.<\/p><p>Last year, the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il: &quot;The Government does not believe that funds should be competing with owner-occupiers or first-time buyers in buying up houses that have already been built.&quot;  Is he standing over that statement today?  For a first-time buyer eager to buy a home in Castleview earlier this year who missed out, the Taoiseach's commitment to prioritise first-time buyers will ring hollow indeed.  Despite his assurance that investment funds would not compete with first-time buyers, it is clear they continue to do so.<\/p> <p>They are having a considerable distortive effect on the market.  How are first-time buyers, or any ordinary buyer, supposed to compete with a fund that can pay such a premium for three-bedroom terraced homes?  The funds are willing to spend so much because the State is entering into long-term lease agreements for these homes, which will see the funds' large investments handsomely repaid over 25 years.<\/p> <p> Will the Taoiseach apologise for misleading the House when he stated that investment funds should not compete for homes with first-time buyers?  Will he give a commitment that State funds will not be used to bankroll developments for investment funds?  Will he act to stop investment funds from snapping up family homes that are desperately needed by first-time buyers and owner occupiers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400005#C01100","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664889600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising these two important issues.  The weakness and distortion in her presentation have to do with her use of the word that the two individual cases she has identified &quot;typify&quot; the Government's response.  They do not typify the Government's response at all and she should know that well.  By this I mean that the State itself is building and, through the approved social housing bodies, providing thousands and thousands of social homes and affordable homes as an overall proportion of the number of houses that are being built.<\/p><p>In 2021, non-household entities purchased 11,600 units, or 20% of the total units purchased, which was down from 22% in 2020 and 2019.  When I say &quot;non-household entities&quot;, this includes the State, approved housing bodies and private companies.  The State accounts for the largest single share of purchases within the non-household category, at 32% of purchases by non-households.  The institutional purchasers - this involves all units in terms of apartments - purchased just 9% of total units sold last year.  First-time buyers accounted for 26% of all properties purchased in 2021.  As I said earlier, more first-time buyers bought their first homes in the past 12 months than in any year since 2008.  The State's purchases are largely concentrated in houses, with 66% of State purchases being houses.<\/p><p>Regarding Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, the Deputy will recall that, during Covid and as a direct response to the initial impact of Covid-19, HBFI launched a time-bound initiative - the momentum fund - to allow it to provide finance for larger prime residential projects that were experiencing difficulties at that time in accessing finance.  This was an agile and time-bound response, which was in keeping with HBFI's mandate.  It was a step-in initiative.  The end date for the momentum fund approvals was 31 December 2021.  As such, it does not typify, but it was a response that HBFI took at the time to try to make sure that supply continued and projects got finished.  Overall, the only way we can resolve and make inroads into the housing issue is by supply.<\/p><p>In respect of the article in the <i>Business Post<\/i>, my understanding is that that was a fund that bought from a fund.  It was not competing with first-time buyers in that case.  Where units are already assigned to social housing with leases of 25 years, at the time of sale, these properties are required to remain in social housing for the entirety of their leases.  Therefore, any subsequent sale of those properties would not be in competition with purchasers seeking a home, nor would it increase the cost to the State of leasing the units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400006#D00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1664889600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>When this phenomenon was brought to the Taoiseach's attention a couple of years ago, he seemed completely unaware of it.

The attempts to exclude some will not help the overall effort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400007#E00800","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1664889900,"counter":47,"content":"<p>T&aacute;imid ag bogadh ar aghaidh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400007#E00850","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1664889900,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Why are the funds buying them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400007#E00900","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1664889900,"counter":49,"content":"<p>The Deputy knows there is a limit on what they can do now.

The Union of Students in Ireland, USI, has said that the situation is the worst it has ever been.  Students in Galway are sleeping in tents and are protesting not just at the deficit in accommodation, but also at the absolute absence of student accommodation in this State.  Last September, representatives of USI were outside the gates of this House, protesting at the fact that thousands of students had been left without a place to live at the start of the new academic year.  At the beginning of this September, the chaplain of the new Technological University of the Shannon said he understood that the number of beds available to students in Athlone this year had fallen by 500 because of the unprecedented number of international protection applicants who have been housed in this region.  Perhaps the kindest thing we can say about all this is that it is an omnishambles, which has been made worse and prolonged as a direct result of Government policy and the failure to act quickly enough when it became clear that private and institutional on-campus accommodation was being gobbled up to meet the demands of what the Minister for housing has described as \"our international obligations\".<\/p>  <p>  I wish to focus on another element of this crisis.  We are now confronted with a very real danger that access to third level education will again become the preserve of the wealthy and those fortunate enough to have very high incomes.  This is what is happening.  With rent levels now routinely approaching &euro;1,000 per month, it is next to impossible for the majority of students to afford this without incurring substantial debt or deferring indefinitely.  Even those on the highest rate of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants cannot afford such rates.  This is not only tragic but ironic, given that it was the admirable actions of statesmen like Donogh O'Malley which proved instrumental in opening our education system to those who had been excluded because of a lack of means.  Over 50 years ago and under one Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, access to education became a right.  Under the current Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for housing and the Taoiseach's Government, this may yet regress to become a privilege.  It does not make any difference if this is not the Taoiseach's intention.  It is the result of the Government's policies, which are plain to see.  <\/p> <p>I accept that the Minister, Deputy Harris, has secured a reduction in costs in the budget but all of those benefits will remain purely theoretical - or, I might even say, academic - if getting to college goes the same way as home ownership more generally, which is a fading dream for an entire generation.  Will the Taoiseach commit to re-establishing the education disadvantage committee, which did great work and which can become a forum to tackle this issue and the barriers to third level education?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400007#E01200","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664890500,"counter":53,"content":"<p>First of all, I would say that the situation is challenging in respect of student accommodation.  It is reflective of the wider issues in terms of housing supply and new construction, and also viability issues in terms of land that universities own but are not in a position to develop with developers on the basis of what they believe is a viability gap between the cost of that student accommodation if it was to be built and what students could realistically be prepared to pay.  The Minister has met with the presidents and chairs of all the traditional universities and the technological universities to discuss any immediate proposals they may have identified for additional student accommodation provision in the short to medium term.  The Department is continuing to work with them in that regard.  That said, the University of Galway was in a position this academic year to provide an additional 670 bed spaces which will come on stream not immediately but later this year.<\/p>  <p>  There is an issue of viability in terms of the cost of building which is somewhat similar to what we had to do with the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme.  We introduced the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme to deal with the viability gap in brownfield sites in built-up dense areas of inner cities.  The market is saying it cannot build on such sites for affordable prices and the State has had to intervene to try to bridge that viability gap.  The same has applied in respect of student accommodation and we are looking at mechanisms to see how we can do that.<\/p>  <p>  Successive Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers, include me in the late 1990s and early 2000s, took measures that have resulted in very high participation rates in third level education in Ireland.  Ireland enjoys one of the highest participation rates in third level education in Europe.  That said, I accept that accommodation and its cost is the big problem for students.<\/p>  <p>  This year the Ministers, Deputy Harris and Michael McGrath, brought in a range of measures in the budget to support students, not least the reduction of fees by &euro;1,000.  The SUSI grant of &euro;17.4 million will allow a once-off extra payment, equivalent to one month's maintenance, to be made to all student maintenance grant recipients by December.  A once-off increase of &euro;1,000 will support postgraduate students who meet the eligibility criteria for a postgraduate fee contribution grant.  That grant will now go up to &euro;4,500.  Some &euro;8 million is being put into the student assistance fund.  A once-off payment of &euro;500 is being made in 2022 to PhD students who receive an Irish Research Council or Science Foundation Ireland award.  The Minister has taken a range of other measures to offer relief to students in 2023-24 and make things a bit more manageable for them during what is a very difficult period with the energy situation.  We have brought in the rent credit of &euro;1,000.  It will be of value of &euro;1,000 to renters, &euro;500 in 2022 and &euro;500 in 2023.  Student accommodation is capped under the rent pressure zones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400008#F00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1664890500,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I acknowledged the measures that were brought in to alleviate the pressures.

This is a real barrier for students now and it will deter many students from going to college.  Unfortunately, college and third level education will become a preserve of the wealthy if action is not taken on this issue.  I ask the Taoiseach if his Government will reinstate the education disadvantage committee to try to focus on this issue and deal quickly with it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is talking about meeting \"international obligations\" but he also needs to focus on meeting the needs of our student population.

We need analysis.  I do not believe that this will allow or facilitate third level education becoming the preserve of the rich.  I do accept, however, that we need to take urgent measures - it will take time to get new blocks built - to bridge the viability gap between what universities say they can realistically construct in purpose-built student accommodation and what they could subsequently rent out to students at affordable prices.  At the moment that gap is far too wide.  Now they are asking the State to intervene to try to bridge that gap.

A large part of the carbon budget was supposed to go towards that.  I have talked to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine many a time about this.  I have gone to marts when it has not been popular for Opposition Deputies to stand up and to agree with a new policy in the line of the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, the areas of natural constraint, ANC, policy or the new organic payment that is coming out.<\/p>  <p>  The new agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, payment, however, appears to be a problem.  Over the weekend I was inundated with calls from planners who were given a draft, had an information day and were told that would be it and that this is what we are going on.  I will give the Taoiseach an example.  If you did 2 ha in a riparian zone, you got &euro;3,000.  Lo and behold, all those planners who had done out the new plan for farmers, because they were trying to get ahead of the posse, ended up being told Friday evening, sorry but it is being cut to 1 ha at &euro;1,530.  I am not blaming the Minister for this, and we know the debacle that went on in forestry, but, funnily enough, the hierarchy in forestry seems to be the same hierarchy for this environmental scheme.  There are two years to prepare for it at the moment.  The generic land-mapping system is giving trouble.  The whole basis of where we are going in this scheme is very hard for a smaller farmer on 30, 40 or 50 acres, whom the scheme should be targeted at to make sure we get as many people in as possible.  I know there is talk of 30,000 people going into the scheme but, at the moment, unless, first of all, the final spec is given to planners, there will be a serious difficulty.  I am not imagining this.  I got it in the ear all weekend.  Second, the deadline needs to be extended to at least the end of November.  Third, we need to rejig whatever went out on Friday evening on the riparian zone.  We also need to make the scheme more workable for the 30, 40 or 50 acre farmer.  Will the Taoiseach, along with his Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as a Government, make this as workable as we can for those smaller farmers and come clean to the planners who are at it at the moment?  What has happened is that plans are done out already and now they have to be changed again since last Friday evening.  When you ring Paddy and tell him he was getting &euro;3,000 but now is getting &euro;1,530, the Taoiseach knows what he will get on the phone from those planners.

As he will know, the new ACRES is worth about &euro;1.5 billion over five years, the largest ever and 50% higher than the amount for the previous scheme.  The riparian scheme remains 2 ha for &euro;3,000.  That has not been cut or changed.  It is important that clarity is out there.<\/p> <p>I have just confirmed with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine that there is no change to that.  It is a scheme that we want to see rolled out as quickly as possible.  As the Deputy knows, about &euro;1.5 billion has been retained from carbon tax revenues to fund and contribute to this ambitious agri-environmental scheme.  We anticipate 50,000 participants, with a maximum payment of up to &euro;10,500 for individual farmers.  Under the next CAP programme, which starts in 2023, some &euro;723 million of carbon tax funding has already been allocated to support sustainable farming practices through a flagship agri-environmental climate measure and there is a variety of other supports there.<\/p> <p> We want to make the scheme as workable as possible but if there are issues with the roll-out of the scheme that Deputy Fitzmaurice feels need modification to make it more workable, I have no doubt that the Minister and the team in the Department will be more than willing to engage and respond.  This is a very important scheme in the context of the overall agenda ahead.  If we are to maintain food security and sustainable food production and meet our climate obligations, we need workable solutions.  Farming is interested in workable solutions.  We need to plant many more trees than we are currently planting.  There are issues that we have to address in terms of the land use change and forestry chapter of the climate action plan.  We want to create funding streams for farming and agriculture and to have sustainable food production.<\/p> <p> Overall, I hear what the Deputy is saying but I want to assure him that we are up for making this as workable as possible.

However, for smaller farmers in the west of Ireland and many other parts of Ireland, it is more difficult.  When those farmers were in the previous scheme - the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme - they might have received &euro;3,500 or &euro;4,000.  They did not get the full scheme payment because they did not have enough area to do so, but some of those farmers are down on money with the new system.  I ask for flexibility for that group of farmers.<\/p>  <p>  Also, there is a thing in it that we never in our lives were told to do.

My second proposal is that the Government could extend the days on which disconnections are banned to any day with a \"Y\" in it, up to the end of winter, at least.  The third is that the Government could introduce a version of the Covid emergency credit, which allowed pay-as-you-go customers an emergency credit of &euro;100 for gas.

There will be a significant emphasis on additional assessment components outside of the traditional final written exams.<\/p>  <p>  We have made an unprecedented commitment to students with special educational needs and their families.  We are making an investment of over &euro;2.6 billion to build on progress made to date around additional classes, teachers and supports.<\/p>  <p>  We have provided for a once-off &euro;1,000 reduction in the undergraduate student contribution fee.

All apprenticeship fees will be reduced by one third this year and over 8,000 additional apprenticeship places will be supported.

We are also addressing cost as a barrier to higher education, including changes to the student contribution and enhancements to the SUSI grant.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2019, five technological universities have been established and since last year, as part of CAO reform, apprenticeships have been included on the application system for students.

Similarly, the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, raised concerns regarding students from disadvantaged backgrounds and that the refusal by the Government to invest appropriately will only serve to widen inequality in Irish society.  Indeed, research published recently by Dr. JoAnne Mancini of Maynooth University provides evidence of just how deep educational inequality in Ireland really is.

In Dublin 4, 99% of children go on to higher education, compared with just 28% of children in Dublin 8.  That is one example; I could give more.

According to information received by Conradh na Gaeilge under a freedom of information request, the State Examinations Commission has expressed great concern about the decision to move paper one of the Irish leaving certificate to fifth year and the grave consequences that would have for students' education, particularly male students.

GDP is not the correct metric.  GNI* is a more appropriate metric given the particular composition of the Irish economy and the influence of foreign direct investment, FDI.  In the OECD Programme for International Student Assessments, PISA, the Irish education system stands up pretty well in respect of literacy, numeracy and so forth, but we need to continue to develop.  That is why we will have a record number of new school buildings and extensions completed this year and into 2023.  The pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced for the past three years in a row and that will continue.  The DEIS scheme is also being widely expanded.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Bacik&rsquo;s point on junior certificate students, which was also raised by Deputy Cathal Crowe, I do not have a specific date on the junior certificate examination results yet.  It seems the State Examination Commission, which is responsible, concentrated originally on the leaving certificate and then the appeals arising from that examination because students would be depending on the appeals outcomes for progression to third level.  I will speak to the Minister and revert to the Deputies on a potential date for that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Bacik also mentioned the pathfinder programme.  The Department of Education is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainability in school buildings and its performance has been recognised at both national and international levels, winning sustainable energy awards for excellence in design and specification.  The schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents must achieve an A3 building energy rating, which is typically a 20% higher performance than is required by the current building regulations, along with 10% of primary energy being provided by photovoltaic and infrastructure provision for electrical vehicle charging.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2017, the Department of Education and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, have been involved in an energy-efficient retrofit pathfinder programme for schools built prior to 2008.  To date the programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland with work on an additional nine schools added in 2021 under way.  In 2022, six additional schools are undergoing deep retrofit to a building energy rating of B with renewable heating systems.  This is jointly funded, with a &euro;28 million budget from the Departments of Education and the Environment, Climate and Communications.  It is administered by the SEAI and the planning and building unit of the Department of Education.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett, I am aware of the issue in respect of education psychologists and counsellors and I will follow up with the respective Ministers in respect of the issue.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy raised the issue of the Gaeltacht.

It is much more challenging and complex than just a simple mantra.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy P&aacute;draig O&rsquo;Sullivan raised the issue of the school completion programme, which was also raised on the margins of the recent public sector pay agreement.  I spoke on it at the IMPACT conference.  I am anxious that the programme move back to the Department of Education because it is an integral part of the education agenda and objectives.  It was also part of the 1998 Act, with both the educational disadvantage committee and the idea of school completion being a core aim of education.  There have been moves in that direction between Tusla and the Department of Education.  I will provide more detail if I can get it in respect of completing that move.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Cathal Crowe raised the issue of the junior certificate, on which I have already given an answer.  He also raised the school transport scheme.  We should endeavour to continue that, not least because it is a cost-of-living measure that saves families about &euro;650, but it also gets people out of cars and into buses.  That is good for climate action, the environment and towns and villages as it reduces congestion.  There always has to be balance when we start providing free schemes because capacity and affordability become issues.  In respect of schools, however, we should work towards a model that takes the cost out of it and incentivises the utilisation of buses and trains as opposed to cars.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400018#Q00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committees","time":1664895600,"counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400018#Q00400"},{"type":"question","time":1664895600,"counter":168,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[43924\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400018#Q00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment will next meet.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1664895600,"counter":169,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[44835\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400018#Q00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment will next meet.","asker":"1478","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1664895600,"counter":170,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[44918\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400018#Q00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment will meet next.","asker":"1501","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1664895600,"counter":171,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[45728\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400018#Q00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment will next meet.","asker":"1698","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1664895600,"counter":172,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[46787\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400018#Q00900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment will next meet.","asker":"1521","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1664895600,"counter":173,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[46789\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400018#Q01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment will meet next.","asker":"1519","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1664895600,"counter":174,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[48634\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400018#Q01100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment will next meet.","asker":"1522","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1664895600,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 14, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment first met on 8 July 2020.

The Deputy's party has a view that we should just give a blank cheque to the energy companies.  We believe in giving supports to the consumers, not to the energy companies.  We want to support the customers and reduce their bills and, at the same time, use the windfall tax and the solidarity payment to help the overall taxpayer in terms of meeting the needs of households, protecting jobs and businesses and so on, which is important.<\/p> <p> Deputy Bacik raised the matter of caps.  There are two issues.  The European approach to caps is different from the Sinn F&eacute;in Party's view or the United Kingdom Government's view, in that some - not all - are looking at wholesale caps.  What happened in Portugal and Spain had unintended consequences for energy security and supply.  France ended up buying a lot of it because it cost less.  This is a very complex market and we have to be extremely careful.  We have a particular supply line from the UK and Norway, which is important in terms of energy security.  I do not believe in any arbitrary cap that would undermine that security of supply.  Having spoken to people in Europe - we had a meeting yesterday ahead of the meeting we are having later this week in Prague - the European Commission will in all likelihood be tasked with seeing if it can come up with a realistic set of proposals, which will be difficult to do for 27 member states because everyone is in a different situation.  The idea that you could have a uniform mechanism is a bit unrealistic.  For example, Hungary, Bulgaria and other countries have particular dependencies.<\/p> <p> Deputy Cathal Crowe raised the issue of the Green Atlantic wind farm and the whole area of the west of Ireland.  I think I dealt with this issue.  We would be prepared to support courses and programmes in third level in the region.<\/p> <p> Deputy Barry asked for whom the economic recovery was.  It was for the 400,000 workers who were unemployed when this Government came into office and who are now working.  That is fundamentally what the economic recovery is about.<\/p> <p> In terms of prepay, there are mechanisms that the Government, with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, is taking to try to alleviate the pressures in that area to make sure that people are not cut off or nothing untoward happens.<\/p> <p> Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan raised the matter of the tax warehousing facility and supports for businesses.  We are concentrating in the initial phase on the temporary business aid scheme.  This is in line with the European Union's temporary aid crisis framework.  We do not envision the full panoply of schemes that we used for Covid-19, but we are going to keep the situation under review.  We have to see how this scheme works in terms of uptake and at what level of sufficiency is reached.  We are limited at the moment in terms of the temporary crisis framework that Europe deploys.  Europe itself is reviewing that.<\/p> <p> I think that covers everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400019#R01800","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664896800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Foster carers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400020#S00200","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1664896800,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Apologies.

I have met Prime Minister Liz Truss MP on two occasions since her appointment on 6 September.  We also spoke by phone.  I had a good call with the Prime Minister on 9 September.  During that call, I offered my sincere condolences to her and to the British people on the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth Il and paid tribute to the Queen's contribution to reconciliation and good relations on these islands.  I also congratulated the Prime Minister on her new role and we agreed to keep in close contact in the period that followed.<\/p>  <p>  On Tuesday, 13 September, the Prime Minister and I attended the service of reflection on the life of Queen Elizabeth II at St. Anne's Cathedral in Belfast, where we spoke briefly.  Given the solemnity of that occasion, we did not have a political discussion.  At the Prime Minister's invitation, I met her at No. 10 Downing Street on the morning of Sunday, 18 September, on the eve of the state funeral for her majesty.  I can inform the House that the Prime Minister indicated that she was keen to have a positive British-Irish relationship.  As near neighbours, we discussed a number of common and important issues, namely, energy, the cost of living, the situation in Northern Ireland and the protocol.  We agreed that an opportunity existed for the EU and the UK to find a negotiated outcome to issues around the Northern Ireland protocol.<\/p>  <p>  I attended the British-Irish Association conference in Oxford on 2 and 3 September.  During that time, I addressed the association, which was a special honour, given that it was its 50th anniversary.  I also took part in a questions and answers session with those attending.  In my address, I focused on the importance of the spirit of partnership that was needed to underpin the Good Friday Agreement as we approach the 25th anniversary, having witnessed the benefits of peace, strengthened relationships and growing prosperity.<\/p>  <p>  While in Oxford, I also met with the Vice President of the European Commission, Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d, where we had a good discussion on issues surrounding the Northern Ireland protocol.<\/p>  <p>  I continue to believe it is possible to reach a satisfactory outcome on the protocol through a process of negotiations.

Meanwhile, the Biden Administration continues to exert pressure on the UK to resolve these problems.

The top rate of income tax in this country, however, is 40%.  This is the same rate that the Tories were attempting to bring it down to and were forced to retreat.  The latest development is that backbench Tories are in revolt against a move to cut, in real terms, payments to social welfare recipients, that is, to have increases in those payments that are lower than the rate of inflation.  Again, this is something this Government actually did just last week.  Our budget proposals included a series of measures to increase and have new rates of tax for those earning more than &euro;100,000.

I speak having returned just last week from the British Labour Party's conference in Liverpool, where I was glad to lead the delegation from our Labour Party.  I was also very glad to meet with Peter Kyle and Stephen Doughty and to hear assurances from them on their intentions if and when the Labour Party is next in government in Britain.

To answer in general all the Deputies who have raised issues in this regard, following my meetings with the British Prime Minister, and her meetings with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, there is a preference on all sides for a negotiated settlement.  If negotiations commence, let us give them space.  I do not think we should be using language such as \"U-turns\" or anything like that.  We want a negotiated solution in the best interest of relationships in Europe and Britain in the first instance, and then in terms of the island of Ireland and harmonious trading relationships as well.  If such negotiations commence, there will be difficulties.  They will not be simple.  Space should be provided to allow an opportunity to get a negotiated settlement.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Durkan raised the issue of the shared island.  When I spoke about providing space, that was a reference to the first part of the question.  Of course we discussed the protocol, but I think the language being used is that we would prefer a negotiated solution to these issues.  Regarding the shared island initiative, concerning the comments of Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others, that is the real dialogue that is going on.  Up to 3,000 people have now engaged in the shared island dialogue in different sectors, in respect of, for example, the All-Island Climate and Biodiversity Research Network and the All-Island Women's Forum.  I attended a very good conference held under the auspices of the latter organisation recently in Dublin.  Just yesterday, I was at an event organised by The Wheel and the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action, which are the umbrella bodies for voluntary and community associations North and South.  They have developed an iconic project to undertake a North&ndash;South approach to voluntary organisations and we have funded that through the shared island initiative.  Therefore, I am very much heartened by the youth dialogue that has occurred and the new Irish tourism enterprise.  A whole range of dialogues have occurred and these have involved at least 3,000 citizens.  It is hard work, but it is the painstaking approach.  I say that because building reconciliation and trust is not about just holding one assembly where people get together into a room and everything is solved.  I do not think that will work.  I think what will be involved will be the long and painstaking building of bridges.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to what the research side of the shared island initiative has brought about, we have commissioned for the first time ever comprehensive research into the different systems that exist in areas such as health, education, enterprise and the services sector, to be undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute and the National Economic and Social Council.  Weighty outcomes and outputs have resulted, particularly on school completion rates in the North versus the Republic.  There are lessons to be learned from that information.  Then there is the &euro;1 billion we have provided to fund projects in this regard.  We have developed a very rich vein of activities.  I appreciate the work of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and it unanimously endorsed this approach when we met.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with what Deputy Brendan Smith said.  The outgoing minister of state for Northern Ireland, Conor Burns, undoubtedly did a great deal of constructive work during August in meeting representatives of different organisations.<\/p>  <p>  I think I have covered the points Deputy Haughey made about the chance to reset the relationship.  We raised issues in this regard.  The British Government has been contributing to some aspects of the shared island initiative in respect of research centres.  I refer to using research expertise available in Britain, Northern Ireland and here to study issues of mutual interest.  Turning to the question Deputy Haughey raised concerning the restoration of the Northern institutions, I pressed very strongly for the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly.  Prime Minister Truss was adamant that, as far as she is concerned, those institutions should be restored.  Now I cannot give a timeline as to when negotiations between the EU and the British Government will result in an outcome.

As I have said on a number of occasions, following a decade of undersupply rents are still too high, homebuilding is still too low and too many people cannot afford to buy their own home.  Too many parents and grandparents are worried about where their children will live and far too many of our most vulnerable are without a safe and secure roof over their head.  That is why housing is the biggest priority for the Government - a priority backed by &euro;4.5 billion annually, as was outlined in the budget only last week.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All is the most ambitious housing plan in the history of the State and aims to build 300,000 new homes, 90,000 new social homes and at least 56,000 affordable homes by 2030.  It sets out a goal to eliminate homelessness by 2030 and breathe fresh life into derelict and vacant homes throughout the country.  It is a radical plan but it is realistic and realisable.  It is fully funded, underpinned by record State investment that puts home ownership back at the heart of Irish life for those who need it.<\/p>  <p>  The policy has four pathways to achieving housing for all: supporting home ownership and increasing affordability; eradicating homelessness, increasing social housing delivery and supporting social inclusion; increasing new housing supply overall, which we see happening this year significantly; and addressing vacancy and efficient use of existing stock.  I know how hard things are in the housing sector today but Housing for All, as a strategy, is starting to make a real difference with a fundamental step change in housing policy.  Across its four pathways, delivery is the key to making Housing for All a success and getting to grips with the housing crisis.  Whether anyone likes to acknowledge it, the combination of the Covid lockdowns and hyperinflation have had a negative impact on supply.  It is dishonest for anyone to ignore that.  However, real momentum is gathering in delivery.<\/p>  <p>  Since Housing for All was launched just over a year ago, we have: the highest home completions since 2008; the highest home commencements or new homes started on record; the highest planning permissions since 2008; 16,000 first-time buyers over the past 12 months alone; in excess of 20,000 more workers in the construction sector; falling vacancy levels; the first ever cost-rental homes - a tenure that has been discussed and debated in the House for years and we are delivering - and the first cost-rental tenants in place with hundreds more to follow; and the first affordable homes to purchase in well over a decade.<\/p>  <p>  We will exceed the target of 25,000 units this year - 24,600 to be exact - but we need to, and will, do much more under Housing for All.  As I stated previously, I will continue to use every weapon in our armoury to get bricks and mortar into the ground for homes working people can afford to buy and support those without adequate shelter.  To have a real impact, this must involve pragmatic measures with both the public and private sectors.  We cannot fight this housing crisis with one hand tied behind our back letting the perfect be the enemy of the good or ideology win over pragmatism.<\/p>  <p>  I am a firm believer in home ownership.  Housing for All is laying the foundations for home ownership for a generation.  To help accomplish this, we are building the first affordable purchase homes in more than a decade, and targeting 36,000 new affordable homes by 2030.  To report progress on that, under the local authority-led affordable purchase schemes, I have approved 27 schemes across the country that will deliver in excess of 1,800 homes approved under the affordable housing fund, to which I made further changes two weeks ago to increase the subvention the State can make in affordable purchase and to make significant changes as well to the cost-rental model to help the approved housing bodies, AHB, sector and local authority sector with the cost of increased rate inflation.  We are extending the help-to-buy grant - a grant that has helped nearly 35,000 homeowners buy their own home, to 2024.  We have established the game-changer first home scheme, the shared equity scheme, for which we have seen nearly 500 eligibility certificates issue since July.  This involves 500 people who are able to buy 500 homes and there will be hundreds and thousands more under this scheme.  Last weekend, at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis, I announced that I will extend the first home scheme to own-built homes across rural Ireland.  We have started rolling out &euro;50,000 grants to buy and refurbish empty and derelict homes in rural areas, towns and villages and city centres with the above-shop units available there.  We are bringing in pragmatic supports to help defray the cost of refurbishment of those properties.  In the four short weeks of August, without a big push behind it through a public information campaign, we received more than 200 applications.<\/p> <p>There is a real desire among people to take on those properties and to tackle vacancy.<br\/><br\/>We have introduced a tax credit worth &euro;1,000 for each individual renter in 2023 to help them fight the high cost of rent.  We have also reformed the tenant purchase scheme to allow pensioners to buy their homes.<br\/><br\/>I am particularly concerned about blockages in the planning system.  That is why, in tandem with the Attorney General, we have initiated the most comprehensive review of the planning system in a quarter of a century.  I expect a consolidated planning Bill to come before the House in the coming weeks and look forward to engagement with Deputies both in government and opposition to pass that important legislation.  We are setting out new guidelines to facilitate rural one-off homes.  I am amending planning guidelines to enable own-door homes and putting in place land value sharing, a residential zoned land tax and a vacant property tax to tackle land prices, promote development and penalise the underuse of land and homes.  I can also confirm to the House that I am eliminating the separate build-to-rent standards.  That means that, from the end of this year, every apartment application will involve a single build-to-buy standard and those apartments will be allowed to be sold and will not be restricted to rental.  As I said at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis, if it is good enough to rent, it should be good enough to buy.  We need to level the playing field between homeowners and investors.<br\/><br\/>I fully recognise the scale of the challenge of homelessness and the need to tackle social housing waiting lists.  Far too many are without shelter.  The personal impact of homelessness on individuals and families is devastating.  The key is to increase supply to give homeless people safe shelter.  Housing for All marks the biggest housing programme in our history.  A total of 90,000 new social homes will be built by 2030, more than ever before, and we will deliver more new-build social homes this year than in any year since the foundation of the State.  The ambitious Housing First strategy is being rolled out, with 282 tenancies to be set up this year, building on the success of last year.  Housing assistance payment, HAP, discretion rates have been increased, and I will soon set out the new HAP homeless rate.  We have expanded tenant <i>in situ<\/i>purchases to prevent homelessness.  To be clear to Deputies, I have instructed all local authorities that where a HAP tenant or a rental accommodation scheme, RAS, tenant has received a notice to quit from his or her landlord with the intention to sell, to purchase that home.  Since I made those changes in July and given full discretion to the local authorities, more than 300 additional homes have come in in a short time.  I want that expedited and expanded.  Budget 2023 has increased homelessness funding by 11%.  Minimum notice-to-quit periods have been extended and there have been rent supports of almost &euro;1.2 billion for some 500,000 renters.  We will launch a new youth homelessness strategy in the coming weeks.  Leasing is being phased out to refocus on direct delivery, but we will use it where it works, particularly when it is focused on housing our homeless community.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge that the pace of delivery can be frustrating.  However, with a fully funded plan, fully resourced local authorities and AHBs empowered to deliver, they will deliver at scale this year.  Delivery is what we need to tackle homelessness head-on.  Our plan, Housing for All, is a fully funded, multi-annual plan with homeownership and delivery at its heart.  No other party has put forward any credible alternative or any substantive plan.<br\/><br\/>That is all too clear when we look at some of the inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the alternative budget by the main Opposition party.  It commits to delivering an additional 2,900 new social homes in 2023 above Government targets.  Sinn F&eacute;in's cost per unit, however, as I said last week, makes no allowance for inflation or the supply chain issues that have arisen as a result of the war in Ukraine.  The figures are based directly on costs in 2021.  It is not credible for anyone to claim to be able to deliver more units more quickly with less money.<br\/><br\/>This debate may be an opportunity to say there is another enormous &euro;300 million black hole at the heart of Sinn F&eacute;in's rent tax credit, with more than 400,000 renters eligible.  The proposal put forward by the party would cost &euro;600 million, but it has budgeted for only half that.  It is an enormous black hole.  Our tax credit of &euro;1,000 per renter is real and will be received by tenants in 2023, and they need it.  I have not yet seen any published detailed costings, despite Deputy &Oacute; Broin promising he would publish them last week.  It is important for renters that they see real proposals and real costings.  We have put forward such costings in our budget.  I earnestly believe that it is crucial that people do not try to cynically exploit the housing crisis for their own political ends.  Renters are struggling to make ends meet.  That is why we have brought forward a real measure of &euro;1,000 in tax credits for them in 2023 and why we continue to expand affordable cost rental and the roll-out of that programme.<br\/><br\/>One thing that is crystal clear is that Sinn F&eacute;in, in the alternative housing plan it has put forward, continues its attack on homeownership.  The alternative budget proposes very clearly to abolish three key supports for homebuyers.  It is further proof that the party does not believe in homeownership.  It will scrap the help-to-buy grant, worth up to &euro;30,000, which has supported nearly 35,000 homeowners to get their deposits together.  It will scrap the first home scheme, which has started well, with hundreds of people having received eligibility certificates, first contracts being issued and the first keys being turned in doors since the launch of the scheme in July.  It is a targeted support to help homeowners and it is working and will expand even further.  It is not a second mortgage but an equity stake taken by the State.  It is helping people, many of whom are renters or who have been living at home with their folks for longer than they would wish or, indeed, longer than their parents would wish.  It is a real measure that has been brought forward and is working to support homeownership.  Inexplicably, Sinn F&eacute;in has said it will also scrap the new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe vacant and derelict property grants of up to &euro;50,000 to buy and to refurbish empty homes.  As I said, we have had approximately 200 applications for those grants.  All of us agree that vacancy and dereliction is a scourge.  We are moving forward to bring in schemes through repair and lease for our local authorities and targeted compulsory purchase order, CPO, programmes.  What is wrong with homebuyers and people who want to buy their own homes getting support from the State to take vacant properties, to buy them and to get assistance from the State to do up those homes?  Sinn F&eacute;in's position is inexplicable.<br\/><br\/>To be fair, Deputy &Oacute; Broin's position is not shared by many of his party's Deputies.  I welcome the support of Deputies Gould, Carthy, Kerrane and Cronin, to name but a few, in their questions about expanding and strengthening these schemes.  In the few minutes I have left I wish to advise the House that Deputy Cronin asked the Minister for Finance &quot;if he will revisit the help-to-buy scheme in terms of its loan-to-value ratio borrowing requirement being 70% when such threshold precludes significant numbers from accessing the scheme&quot;.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin's colleague wants people to access the scheme and wants the scheme changed to facilitate that.  Deputy Kerrane further asked &quot;if ... [the Minister for Finance] intends to extend eligibility for the help-to-buy scheme to pre-owned homes for first-time buyers&quot;.  This is a scheme that her party and its housing spokesperson want to abolish, yet she wants to change it and recognises the fact that the scheme is working.  Deputy Gould, who in many instances comes into this House and rightly raises vacancy and dereliction and who is Sinn F&eacute;in's junior spokesperson on housing, has asked me my &quot;views on whether the strict criteria for the location of suitable housing under the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund are too exclusionary and reducing access to the scheme&quot;.  I was happy to reply to the Deputy that I have expanded the scheme not just to towns and villages but to rural one-off homes and, indeed, to our cities.  He might not realise that his own party wants to exclude the scheme completely, abolish it and put it in the bin.<\/p> <p>The Deputy asked for changes to that scheme, which I have brought in, not at his request, I might add, but because we believe it makes sense.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin might have a sit down with Deputy Gould to explain the Sinn F&eacute;in housing policy.  <\/p> <p> Deputy Matt Carthy asked the Minister for Finance the reason purchasers of newly-completed homes at Loreto Wood in County Cavan are unable to avail of the help-to-buy scheme.  If Sinn F&eacute;in was in government, no one, not just people in Cavan but throughout the country, would be able to avail of the scheme because the party would abolish it.  It would also abolish the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe and first home schemes.  These are clear examples as to why Sinn F&eacute;in does not support homeownership.  On this side of the House, my party, Fianna F&aacute;il and our colleagues in government fully support homeownership.  Not only do we support it, we are doing something about it by bringing forward real measures that are going to help people.  <\/p> <p> Housing for All has unprecedented ambition and the realism to deliver homes and support home ownership.  Following a decade of undersupply and in difficult international conditions, it is starting to deliver real progress.  It is the only credible and funded plan put forward by any party.  To be clear, it is a multi-annual, fully funded plan that is delivering-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400022#U00700","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664899200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>The Minister has not read ours obviously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400024#W00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1664899200,"counter":239,"content":"<p>It is delivering for our people and is taking hold in challenging times.

The homelessness figures are too high and we need to do everything to tackle that.  He is also going to hear about the impact of homelessness on a lot of families and that is only right too.  I know that he is well aware of many of these issues.  He is going to hear a lot about the lack of properties available to rent, not just in Dublin and Cork cities but in many towns as well and that is only right because we are not there yet.  We have not solved the housing crisis yet but Housing for All is the plan to do that.<\/p>  <p>  I will come back to homelessness figures but first I thank the Minister for his efforts so far and for the difference he and his policies are making in my constituency.  I will give just a few examples.  More than 100 social homes have been built in my town of Clonakilty.  The Minister has been there and has met many of the families who were on waiting lists for years and years and now they have a home.  Now they have a key and a secure roof over their heads.  He was not just in Clonakilty; he also visited Skibberreen where more than 50 social homes have been completed and are now fully occupied.  Staying within my constituency, in Kinsale, again, more than 50 social homes have been built.  These are public homes that have been given over to the people who most needed them.  The same can be said of Dunmanway and Bandon.  In my constituency alone hundreds of families who would have regularly been into my office in desperation and in need of a home now have a secure roof over their heads.  That is something that we do not talk about or hear enough about in terms of delivery.  That is in a rural constituency where there was significant pressure in terms of social housing.  We are not there yet.  We have more to do.  We have a lot more to do but those homes have made a real difference for hundreds of families.  <\/p>  <p>  I also thank the Minister for signing off on a project that will deliver 112 local authority affordable purchase homes in Kinsale.  Those homes are not built yet and we have not seen the difference they will make but when they are built in 2023 and 2024, they will make a huge difference by giving an option to those who do not qualify for social homes but who cannot get a mortgage to allow them to buy a house at current prices.  The same will happen in Clonakilty, where 36 affordable purchase homes will be provided by the local authority.  We are seeing a difference.  There was no talk of affordable housing schemes a couple of years ago.  Now they are here and they will make a great difference for those who most need them.  <\/p>  <p>  We now need an information campaign for those individuals, couples and families who are having difficulty affording their own home.  We need to inform them of the measures in Housing for All that will help them.  People can avail of a number of pathways to make a home affordable.  The Minister mentioned the first-time buyer's grant that provides &euro;30,000 towards the purchase of a new home.  I understand he has just opened that up to self-builds as well, which is incredibly important.  When I talk to couples and families about how the shared equity scheme works, there is real interest in it.  Homes in Clonakilty typically cost &euro;300,000, for example.  A potential buyer may only be able to avail, through a mortgage and a first-time buyer's grant, of approximately &euro;220,000 but the fact that the State will now bridge the gap between &euro;220,000 and &euro;300,000 is a game-changer.  Yes, we need the supply and we need the houses to be available but it is a game-changer.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe, which is something that me and my colleagues, including Deputy Flaherty, have been campaigning on for a long time.  This scheme will enable first-time buyers to buy on-street or rural premises and renovate them, with &euro;50,000 available towards that renovation.  This is going to make a real difference.  It is not going to see the numbers on housing waiting lists tumble straight away but it will work gradually.  People will take it up, applications will come in and we will see a significant difference.<\/p>  <p>  There are still issues, one of which is the homelessness numbers I mentioned.  An issue in west Cork at the moment relates to those who have been served notice, which is a regular occurrence.  We thought that the allocation of social housing would free up rental accommodation but it has not done so because landlords are starting to leave the market.  They are selling up and giving notice to quit to their tenants.  Those tenants, because of the lack of rental property availability, have nowhere to go and we need to address that.  If local authorities have the option to buy those houses, they need to be instructed to do so.  Many individuals are ending up in emergency accommodation but Cork County Council only has one or two emergency accommodation options to call on in west Cork.  We would prefer if we did not need emergency accommodation options at all but, unfortunately, families and individuals are having to avail of them.  I urge the Minister to liaise with the council to try to source more emergency accommodation because, unfortunately, the demand is there.  That said, I believe that Housing for All will deliver for the people of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400024#W00400","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1664899200,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan and the Minister for sharing time.  I commend the Minister on Housing for All.  It is probably one of the most ambitious plans we have seen in the history of the State.  It is a huge plan, in terms of volume and aspiration but more importantly, in terms of the money and real commitment the Government has put behind it.  The Minister has energised the plan and the great thing about Housing for All is that it is not set in stone.  It is very much an evolving plan and we have seen that at several stages over the past year.  The Minister has been willing to tweak it and to make amendments to give it more momentum.<\/p>  <p>  There is almost a revolution in social housing taking place throughout the country.  For example, the keys to homes on the former Harris site on Richmond Street, an unused derelict garage site on a corner in Longford town, will shortly be handed out.  The street will be completely transformed by 14 new, fully accessible houses for disabled members of our community.  It is a fantastic development.  In Ballinamuck, north Longford there will be 12 similarly-built houses, using universal design, for elderly people and those with disability or mobility issues.  That really cuts to the heart of what social housing is about.<\/p>  <p>  At the core of Housing for All is a commitment to help those people who have struggled over many years - we make no bones about that - to secure housing.  For the first time, there is an ambitious plan.<\/p> <p>More important, we have Minister who is delivering on that plan.  It is great to see.  The greatest tribute to the Minister is that some of his greatest critics are now buying into the plan.  We see that in the numerous parliamentary questions he receives about Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe and the help-to-buy scheme.  It is a measure of the esteem in which many in the House now hold him that they acknowledge, albeit under the cloak of a parliamentary question, that the plan is right.  Not only is it right; it is also working.<\/p> <p> Regarding Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe, I do not think there is a county councillor or anybody in politics this country who, over the past 20 years, has not been besieged by people asking them to do something about dereliction and houses in rural Ireland that have lain empty for the past 20 or 30 years.  We now have Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe, which is exactly what was wanted.  It is very simple to apply for.  All people need to do is be a first-time buyer and, lo and behold, Sinn F&eacute;in says it is not going to work.  The only reason it says that is because it is the Minister's plan and part of Housing for All.  It is going to work, and we can see that in every county council across the country.  There are large numbers of expressions of interest in Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe.  I am delighted the Minister is extending the scheme to rural Ireland.  It will be a game changer for rural Ireland and is most welcome.<\/p> <p> The help-to-buy scheme is a great initiative.  If Sinn F&eacute;in had its way, it would be dismantled and thrown to one side.  Many families have benefited from the scheme.  We may find unity with Sinn F&eacute;in on giving consideration to pre-owned homes for first-time buyers.  There is a realisation that the plan is working and people may want to buy into it, which is most welcome.  The Minister is not a glory hunter, but he will share in the success of the plan and, ultimately, everyone in the House wants to get people housed.  Everybody is finally coming to the realisation and starting to admit that we finally have a plan that will get people housed.<\/p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett has left the Chamber, but I saw him on the plinth earlier today calling for us to raid the rainy day fund to buy houses in cases where people in receipt of HAP and RAS have received notice to quit.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say he has been addressing that issue since July, which is most welcome.  Not only has he done that, he has added 300 houses to the local authority housing stock.  Not only is the Minister pre-emptive but he is reactionary.  When he sees issues, he tackles them head on.<\/p> <p> Housing for All is working and will deliver on its key objectives.  As I said, it is probably the most ambitious plan we have seen since the foundation of the State.  It required a strong and determined Minister who was prepared to roll up his sleeves, and he is certainly doing that.  We are starting to see momentum building behind the plan.  I commend the work of the Minister to date and, as I said, I am delighted to see all sides of the House rolling in behind the plan and seeing the virtues of Housing for All.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400024#W00500","speaker":"1597","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664899800,"counter":243,"content":"<p>There was a moment where I felt I must have knocked my head and woken up in a parallel universe because what I have just heard over the past half an hour does not reflect the reality for tens of thousands of people on the streets.  As they say, self praise is no praise, with the greatest of respect to the Minister and his party colleagues.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has now been in office for almost two and half years and is almost at the midway point of its term of office.  It is true that it was delayed in putting its housing plan together, partly because it was asleep at the wheel and Fianna F&aacute;il supported Fine Gael in a confidence and supply agreement when in opposition.  We are only year into the plan but by almost every indicator, housing need for people in rural and urban Ireland, and across the generations, is worse now than when the plan was announced a year ago or when the Government took office almost two and a half years ago.  The Minister said the plan is delivering but the big question is delivering for whom.  The Government will hear from many of us in opposition the long list of people for whom the plan is not delivering.<\/p>  <p>  For example, the Minister has missed his social housing targets two years in a row and we have already had what is essentially an admission from the Government that it is going to miss its targets this year.  I have always said that I accept that part of the reason for the shortfall was Covid - there is no dispute about that - but it is not the only or, this year, the major reason.  I know that because I talk to city and county housing managers and they tell me, not just this year but also last year and the year before, there were a variety of reasons, including the continued overly bureaucratic systems imposed by the Minister's Department and others, that are slowing down larger complex projects.<\/p>  <p>  The real problem is not just that those targets are missed but that the Minister then simply discards those units altogether.  Instead of accepting that he needs to take those missed units and roll them into increased targets for subsequent years, they are lost.  To date, 8,000 promised social homes have not been, and will not be, delivered over the last two and half years, and that is an optimistic assessment of the output this year.  In fact, the Minister, on Thursday night, very quietly and on an obscure part of the Department's website, put up the social housing output figures for this year.  Some 1,700 new build social homes have been delivered by halfway through the year, just 20% of the 9,000 promised.  The Minister no longer talks about 9,000 social homes; rather, the figure is possibly 8,000 or less.  If it is anything less than 8,000, it will not be the largest social housing output in the history of the State because the late 1980s had a higher number than that.  Comparing units in that way ignores the fact that the population is far higher and levels of housing need today are greater than ever before.<\/p>  <p>  Homelessness is the measure by which any housing Minister will be assessed.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, was on this side of the House with me when Eoghan Murphy was Minister, and we expressed questions in his confidence when the homeless numbers were approaching 10,000.  They are now approaching 11,000.  Friday's figure was 10,800.  Within a month or two, unless something dramatic changes, and I hope it does, we will exceed the figure of 11,000.  A figure of 11,000 is not even the full figure because the Minister knows in Tusla funded domestic violence refuges, direct provision centres where people are trapped with leave to remain or hostels funded by the State, there are another 3,000 or 4,000 people in emergency accommodation.  In many local authority areas, emergency accommodation is full on many nights.  Approximately 60 families from Dublin are in emergency accommodation in Meath and Kildare.  There are 60 individuals from Dublin in emergency accommodation in Kildare.  That displaces the homeless population from those counties further and further afield.  <\/p>  <p>  On top of that, house prices are at historic highs and rising.  I heard one of the Minister's ministerial colleagues claim yesterday that house prices were falling.  I again thought I was in a parallel universe because no data anywhere show house prices are falling.  The rate of increase might be slowing, in particular in Dublin, but in the midlands and western seaboard counties, on the basis of the most recent house price reports, prices are escalating continuously.  Rents are at historic highs and rising.  There is no indication, in meaningful terms, of a slowing in those increases.<\/p>  <p>  Be it social or affordable housing output, homelessness, house prices or rents, all of the key indicators of whether a Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is doing a good job halfway through his or her term, this Minister, plan and Government are failing.  The question has to be asked as to why that is the case.  The reason is that the plan is based on the same failed housing policies as its predecessors.  It continues to be over reliant on the private sector and to under-invest in public housing.  Crucially, it is based on flawed assessments of actual public and private sector housing.<\/p>  <p>  One of the big scandals that will emerge in the coming months is when people see the detail of the extent to which the Minister and his Department suppressed the real data on emerging and pent-up housing need.  The idea that, on average, 33,000 new homes over the next decade is what is required is not accepted by anybody other than the Minister and his Department.  Independent academic experts, industry and even his housing commission know the real figure is probably somewhere between 40,000 and 50,000 public and private homes a year.  We are nowhere close to the Government's plan.<\/p>  <p>  The most misleading fact the Minister continues to use is the mysterious figure of &euro;4 billion.  The budget book does not lie; it tells us the actual level of direct capital investment by Government in public housing every year.  It is about &euro;1.8 billion.  It should be about &euro;1.5 billion, but last year and this year, the Government underspent by about a &euro;250 million, which overinflates the following year's figures by virtue of a carryover.  The Minister is not spending or allocating &euro;4 billion.  He is correct that there is borrowing by approved housing bodies, although we do not know what that level is at yet.  There is an annualised average figure from the Land Development Agency of &euro;750 million, but it will not reach that for a couple of years.<\/p> <p>When we get to the bottom of the actual spend each year, it will be significantly lower than the Minister's figure.<br\/><br\/>On top of that, as I keep reminding the Minister, his social housing targets are lower than those in the earlier Fine Gael national development plan and that is before we talk about the 8,000 lost units.  His affordable housing targets are an embarrassment.  In fact, he has cut the cost-rental equity loan target for approved housing bodies next year from 900 units, the figure they were meant to deliver this year but will not deliver, to 750 units.  His affordable purchase targets for the local authorities remain embarrassingly low.<br\/><br\/>The Minister is correct on a couple of figures.  He does not mislead us on all of the data he puts into the public domain.  Completions are up, but they are up from such a low level in 2018 and 2019 that they are nowhere close to tackling the crisis levels.  Commencements are also up, which I welcome, but they are nowhere close to what is required.  Planning permissions mean nothing if they are not commenced and that is something on which the Minister has yet to take action.<br\/><br\/>While I welcome the Minister's promise for legislation on planning reform, I hope he gives our committee adequate time for full pre-legislative scrutiny to ensure we do not make the mistakes of previous planning Acts and we get this right.<br\/><br\/>I will not rehearse the arguments I made about the budget but I will address the most telling of them.  At a time when housing need is greater than ever before, the total extra capital investment in housing by this Government in the budget is &euro;37 million and nothing more.  It is there for everybody to see in the budget book.  At a time when we need billions, we are only getting peanuts.<br\/><br\/>On top of that, the fact that there was no new initiative to prevent homelessness or accelerate exits from homelessness is shocking.  I welcome the Minister's very belated reopening of the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme but 300 homes are nowhere near enough.  It should have been opened at the start of the year.  Local authorities, as the Minister will hear from my colleagues, are still far too slow in taking up his instruction.  He should go further than he has to date and issue a circular to instruct local authorities to buy these properties to stop families and single people from becoming homeless.<br\/><br\/>If I had more time, I would go through all of the aspects of the Sinn F&eacute;in alternative budget, but I will correct three things for the Minister.  The first is with regard to figures from the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Local Government and Heritage from this year.  If the Minister is telling me his Department is giving me inaccurate figures, that is a separate issue, but I do not believe that is the case.  The second is that our renters tax credit is based on registered tenancies and putting a full month's rent back into those tenants' pockets.  The third is that it is also accompanied by a ban on rent increases which means tenants will get the benefit of the measure, unlike the Minister's credit, which is too small and provides no protection.<br\/><br\/>If the strongest point of attack the Minister has against us is quoting parliamentary questions that Deputies ask at the request of their constituents, he really has nothing to go on.  If he is trying to deflect from the chronic levels of homelessness and social and affordable housing need and the extent to which he directly continues to inflate house prices by bad schemes such as the help-to-buy and shared equity schemes, that says more about him than anybody else.<br\/><br\/>We have an alternative and a plan, that is, a change of Government and Minister and a housing plan that delivers the 20,000 public homes this State needs, not the bluff and bluster of the Minister, Deputy O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400025#X00200","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664900400,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I spoke to the housing officer in Kerry a fortnight ago who told me that three families in Kerry are becoming homeless every week.  That is three families who have, by and large, been in rented accommodation for the past ten, 12 or 15 years and now face going into one room in a homeless shelter before they can get somewhere else, if they can get somewhere else.<\/p><p>The housing crisis in Kerry is, similar to most of the country, at breaking point.  We have sky-high rents.  They were 15.4% higher in quarter 1 of this year compared with last year.  Rents are 100% up on the lowest point since the crash.  In Crystal Fountain, a former holiday home development in Tralee, the rent is &euro;1,300 per month, which is what people would pay in a middle-class area of Leeds.  Rents in new city centre, premium apartments in Deansgate in Manchester are &euro;1,100.  That is the level the rents in a rural town in the west of Ireland have reached.<\/p><p>There is little or no ability for first-time buyers to get on the ladder and a long social housing waiting list of up to 14 years.  Many people are falling foul of the social housing limits to which there has been no change.  In the case of one Kerry family that dealt with, their weekly income was &euro;25 under the limit but, because their oldest child who is a dependant moved in with her grandmother, their income is now back over the social housing income threshold, which has not increased since 2011.  They will be denied social housing.  This family is about to made homeless because they have been given a notice to quit.<\/p><p>The high spike in notices to quit since the restrictions is no coincidence because renters are now the victims of price gouging.  Landlords know they can charge what they want.  We need action to undermine the hold they have over renters.<\/p><p>First-time buyers are also facing in to the headwinds of this <i>laissez-faire<\/i>approach.  Social housing targets are being missed and Kerry, in addition to more social and affordable housing, could benefit from a revamped serviced sites fund.  There has been very little uptake of this scheme.  The budget provided only &euro;5 million extra for infrastructure such as water and electricity.

Homeless shelters in Limerick are full.  There is a waiting list to access what is supposed to be emergency accommodation and some people, even those who have been approved for emergency accommodation, can be waiting for weeks.  People are literally sleeping on the streets of Limerick which was not an issue for us for years.  We must all be able to do much better than that.  I ask the Minister to speak to every council on the issue of emergency accommodation because there simply is not enough of it available.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about vacancy and dereliction, describing them as a scourge.  He is right but some of the biggest offenders are local authorities.  The void system just does not work the way it should.  The council will apply for funding for a void.  It takes so long to come through that the house will be boarded up, as the Minister is aware.  This is not fair on the neighbours or people in emergency accommodation to look at derelict sites and boarded-up houses.  The system needs to change, as does the way in which the Department gives the council funding.  If the Minister is serious about delivering houses, this is the fastest way he can do it.  There are more than 200 council-owned houses vacant in Limerick as we speak.  The Minister tells me different, however.  It has been six or seven years since I was elected to the D&aacute;il and I have been hearing the same statements that getting the money to deal with voids is not a problem.  It is a problem.  Councils do not have it.  They do not get the funding on time when they ask for it.<\/p>  <p>  I was delighted to hear what the Taoiseach said today, which the Minister confirmed, about people in receipt of HAP and RAS.  This is news to me even though I deal with people every single day.  I ask the Minister to instruct the local authorities to intervene in this matter.  My local council has intervened once or twice, as far as I know, but not in all the cases.  Everybody who comes into my clinic has a notice to quit.  The number of people is incredible.<\/p>  <p>  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister last week.  I hope he does not misquote me on it, as he has done to some of my colleagues.

People are languishing on housing lists for up to 12 years.  There are people who are unable to afford asking prices for rent.  They cannot afford a place to live.  People in receipt of HAP do not have a hope.<\/p>  <p>  I will raise the case of a constituent living in east Meath who is on a Dublin City Council housing list but wishes to rent in east Meath under the inter-authority movement of HAP households.  She cannot find anywhere affordable in Dublin and is moving.  The woman is a lone parent with children who attend school in east Meath.  There is a severe shortage of rental homes in the area so she was thrilled to eventually secure a two-bedroom apartment for the extortionate price of &euro;1,600 per month.  The council in Dublin was willing to pay &euro;1,260 in HAP.  However, when it emailed the inter-county request to Meath County Council, it was refused permission on the grounds that the rent is not within market rent values for the area.  I wrote to Meath County Council and was told that HAP payments for a given household should not exceed rents for a relevant local area or have any inflationary affect on the market in the area.<\/p> <p>One might say that is fair enough but in reality that is the actual cost of renting a two-bed apartment.  Inflation is clearly caused by the dire lack of housing in east Meath and not by HAP payments.  What then are HAP tenants to do in a situation like this?  All this measure does is discriminate against HAP residents as these houses and apartments will be snapped up by non-HAP tenants who are desperate for accommodation despite the cost.  HAP tenants will therefore be locked out of rental properties.  As such, the HAP scheme is completely dysfunctional.  It was the cornerstone of Government housing policy all through the years, namely, shove people into private rented accommodation, give them no security of tenure and happy days for landlords.  Families across this State are being forced into homelessness as a result.  We now have the highest-ever homelessness figures in this State, as the Minister of State knows.<\/p> <p> There is no emergency accommodation available in County Louth - that is how dire this situation is.  We have young people emigrating because despite working in good jobs they cannot afford to live here.  We have households where three or four generations are living under the one roof.

One can only describe the housing situation as grim.  It is completely and utterly grim for families and of course individuals.  It used to be the case that if you were 11 years on the housing list in Galway city, you had a fair chance of being offered something.  Increasingly, I have people coming to me who have been 14 years on the housing list in Galway City and they have never once been offered a place to live.  That is stark.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue I raise is people who are availing of HAP and getting notices to quit.  This applies to both Galway City Council and Galway Country Council.  I have heard mention here that councils now apparently have the ability to buy all the houses where people are served notices to quit.  I would love nothing more than to see that happen because I am seeing notices to quit rising and rising for people who are on HAP and the council cannot buy those houses.  It is a really serious issue because those people are being pushed into homelessness.  There is not the capacity for all these people who are homeless.<\/p>  <p>  The third issue I raise is typified by two single men who have come to me in recent times.  They have had their rented accommodation be massively increased in price.  These are people in their 50s and 60s.  One of them is in shared rented accommodation.  One has seen his rent increased by 20%, which is of course not allowable in a rent pressure zone, but what is he going to do?  He knows there is nowhere else for him to rent and he will end up in homeless accommodation.  Another fellow is getting his rent raised from &euro;105 per week to &euro;120 per week when he is on &euro;208 per week.  What is he supposed to do?  How is he supposed to live?  How is he supposed to heat and how is he supposed to eat?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400027#Z00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1664901000,"counter":250,"content":"<p>The stated aim of Housing for All is that everyone in the State should have access to a home, to purchase or rent at an affordable price, that is built to a high standard, in the right place and offers a high quality of life.  The reality for most falls well short of that.<\/p>  <p>  Every week in my constituency office I have people coming in who are facing eviction.  They are frantically looking for a private rental and cannot find one.  There is nothing available or very little.  Anything that is available is totally unaffordable, in a very bad condition, or both.  If people are HAP tenants they are practically ignored by landlords who do not want to know.  An investor has bought up his third apartment block in Cavan town and they have raised the rents by 50% in some cases.  Those people are going to become homeless if they have not already.  Local authorities are unable to assist.  There are no bed and breakfast facilities available.  Most of them are accommodating refugees.  An employee in Cavan County Council contacted over 40 bed and breakfasts looking for emergency accommodation for a person and could not get anything.  There are no homeless facilities in Cavan-Monaghan.  The nearest is the Simon Community hostel in Dundalk but that is an hour and a half's journey away from Cavan town and there is no bus route.<\/p>  <p>  The funding from central Government for local authorities to turn around vacant homes and apartments, as well as for the maintenance of these properties, is not enough.  It is not happening.  It is taking a year and sometimes two for vacant properties to be reissued.  Before the Minister of State came in the Minister stated local authorities can now buy houses that go up for sale if they house HAP or RAS tenants.  I am not being told that by my local authority.  I have questioned it and it was told it is not permitted to buy houses, except in very rare circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a cohort of people slightly above the threshold for social housing.  Those people have no support to turn to whatsoever.  What are these families to do?  The Government recently raised the threshold in four local authorities but it needs to be raised in all of them.<\/p>  <p>  As party spokesperson on disability I mention the reality is even worse for disabled people who are being left to live with aged parents and then moved into institutions or emergency accommodation at the last minute when an aged person passes away.  That is not fair on the person who is looking for housing.  He or she may have been on the housing list for ten, 12 or 15 years.  He or she does not get any choice in where he or she lives.  The parents die worrying about their son or daughter.  It is totally unfair on them.  There is an onus on us to ensure we align with the UN Charter on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and that is not happening.  The reality is there is not enough housing for disabled people and what housing is available is often not adequately livable and does not have the independent living supports in place.  We need a properly planned and funded housing strategy that is going to deal with homelessness instead of allowing the situation to worsen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400027#Z00300","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1664901000,"counter":251,"content":"<p>At the start of this debate I thought I had stumbled into the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis.  It was quite an extraordinary defence, with all respect to the Acting Chairman.  I am sure he was there and I am sure he enjoyed it.  The defence of Housing for All is quite extraordinary and does not tally with the lived experience of the people I and most of us in this House represent.  I am talking about the experience they have in their everyday lives and the experience we have of representing people who are on housing lists and who are struggling to obtain their first homes.  By any metric Housing for All is failing.  It is failing to deliver an adequate supply of affordable housing for the country, it is failing to bring the rental crisis under control and it is failing to tackle the ever-increasing number of people experiencing homelessness.  Residential property prices have risen 8% in the last year alone.  Prices are now at similar levels to their Celtic tiger peak in 2007.  We know to our cost what happened next.<\/p>  <p>  It is incredible the Government would have us believe the strategy that has performed so poorly in bringing about secure and affordable housing is the only viable strategy and the only show in town.  Today I am hearing a doubling-down on a failed policy.  There is a total lack of ambition on display.  How could a Government that claims to be tackling the housing crisis and taking it seriously have a &euro;240 million underspend to be carried over into next year?  That underspend means missed targets and fewer people having homes.  The Government committed to building 9,000 social and affordable homes this year but we know that target will not be met.  Only 325 affordable purchase homes and 350 cost rental homes have been delivered so far.  That is simply not good enough.  We are to believe 9,100 social and affordable homes will be built next year but Housing for All&rsquo;s track record to date does not inspire any confidence whatsoever and nor does the Government&rsquo;s budget for 2023.  In real terms, only an additional &euro;38 million has been allocated to capital expenditure for housing.  The Government will say that there is an extra &euro;99 million allocated for current expenditure in social housing but that just means long-term leasing of social homes from private landlords and investors.  In other words, it is more of the same when we should be investing in building homes.<\/p>  <p>  We in the Labour Party have been calling for several years for the level of social and affordable housing to be brought up to 20,000, with 12,000 social homes to be built by local authorities and 4,000 each of affordable and cost rental homes.  We have costed this for everyone to see in our alternative budget proposals published two weeks ago.  That is what real ambition to tackle the housing crisis in this country looks like.  The Government is not meeting its own targets this year and has provided nowhere near enough resources to achieve what it says it wants to next year.<\/p>  <p>  I refer for a moment to the vacant homes tax.  The principle of such a tax is a welcome step towards increasing supply and is indeed one the Labour Party has been calling for for many years now.  However, we need to see it for what it is, namely, a short-term solution to a much wider systemic issue.  I fear there are so many exemptions that, like the Government&rsquo;s Housing for All plan, it will not actually achieve what it appears to set out to achieve.  It is so badly designed it will not make much of a difference at all.<\/p> <p>A serious concern that we would have is the exemption for derelict properties.  What is stopping a property owner from allowing their property to fall into dereliction to avoid paying the tax?  If we are going to have a vacant homes tax, let us do it properly and let us ensure we have the right balance of carrot and stick.  The stick that is being proposed at the moment is completely inadequate.<\/p> <p> Nor will we meet the modest Housing for All targets if the Government decides to proceed with the concrete levy as it is currently designed.  We are deeply concerned about the introduction of a proposal for an &euro;80 million concrete levy and how it is designed.  It is a badly thought-out move that will not only drive house prices up, but will also punish people who want to own their own homes, instead of developers and those responsible in the industry taking on the responsibility wherever possible.  We need to review the position on that.  We will have a much more extensive debate later this evening in the context of the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  The Labour Party called for a 2% levy on construction sector profits, which would raise approximately &euro;50 million a year.  That would be a lot more difficult for builders to pass on to those buying or building their own home.  It is extremely disappointing that no retrospective tax relief was provided in the budget for those already paying out for repairs to their homes due to construction defects.<\/p> <p> Housing for All has also completely failed renters.  Rents are and have been out of control for far too long.  The new renter's tax credit is tokenistic at best.  The Government will claim that it is putting money back into the pockets of renters but in reality it is putting money into the pockets of landlords.  They will inevitably raise rents next year and swallow up the small benefit that renters get out of this budget.  As it is, the credit is barely enough to cover a week's rent in Dublin, as the Minister of State knows.  As long as the Government refuses to freeze rents, as my colleague Deputy Alan Kelly did when he was housing Minister, the new tax credit will mean very little.  The Labour Party has been calling for a rent freeze for several years now.  Had the Government listened, we might not have found ourselves in the situation we are in now.  Instead, the Government has insisted on its market-knows-best approach and slapped Band-Aids on the issue here and there.  There have been some positives in cost rental over the last period but the fact is that it is not nearly enough, given the demand.  One simple measure that the Labour Party has proposed to increase the delivery of cost rental accommodation is to tie Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe funding to cost rentals.  This would mean that where the Government subsidises a developer for the development of apartments, it would be on the condition that these apartments become cost rental.  There is a logic to this.<\/p> <p> Month on month there are more and more people in emergency accommodation.  The latest figures show that 10,805 people, including 3,220 children, are homeless.  That does not even go near describing what the real figure is or the real extent of the problem.  The vast majority of people experiencing homelessness have come from the private rental sector.  Eviction rates are up nearly 60% in the first half of this year.  More robust protections for renters are urgently required.  The Minister of State will recall that in September of last year, the Labour Party brought forward a Bill that would afford greater protections to renters and freeze rents for three years.  The issue has been met with absolute radio silence by the Government since, despite some warm words from the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on the day.  It is manifestly ridiculous that commercial tenants have more rights in the commercial property sector if the property is to be sold.  Under our proposed law, those evictions would end.  The Government must act now to implement a temporary ban on evictions.  It is fair to say that the eviction ban introduced during the pandemic saved a very significant number of people from entering homelessness.  Why is the current crisis being treated differently?  The record levels of homelessness we are now seeing are this Government's greatest shame and the most glaringly obvious piece of evidence that its Housing for All plan has failed and is failing in real time.  Failure to temporarily ban evictions during this cost-of-living crisis can only mean one thing: more and more people in emergency accommodation and sleeping on the streets.<\/p> <p> Housing for All's objective was to ensure that every citizen in the State should have access to good-quality homes to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard in the right place, offering a high quality of life.  By every single one of those metrics it has failed.  Measurements do not lie.  It is time for the Government to go back to the drawing board and get serious about solving the housing crisis.  No more sticking-plaster solutions, unfit-for-purpose schemes or subsidies that merely prop up the profits of developers ultimately.  We must put an end to the excessive reliance on the private market to provide an adequate supply of affordable houses to buy or rent.  If there is one thing the Housing for All plan has taught us, it is that this excessive reliance is misconceived and irresponsible in the extreme.  Housing for All and the reliance on the private market have failed to deliver.  The Government has to take a new approach to housing.  That approach has to be State-led and must recognise that housing policy should be about providing homes to the people of Ireland, not about providing a new investment opportunity to the already well-off.  The supply and affordability crisis can only be solved through long-term, properly resourced State action that delivers affordable and secure housing once and for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400027#Z00400","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664901600,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue.

This is an area I have been beating the drum on for many years.  I remember back in 2014-15 designing what I then called the renovation and rent scheme.  It was adopted two years later by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage as the repair and lease scheme.  For me it was glaringly obvious even back then that we had thousands of units all over the country that were sitting empty, crumbling, yet they could well have been converted into homes.  At that time they could have been done a lot more affordably as well.  Right now there is still an opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe.  It is long overdue but it is a positive development.  This is important for our cities, towns and villages but also for the open rural countryside such as the part of County Kerry I come from, where we have old farmhouses and cottages that could be beautiful new homes for people with a relatively small investment.  In my own little parish between the Slieve Mish Mountains and Castlemaine Harbour on the Dingle Peninsula, I counted 50 such properties four years ago, 47 of which are still derelict right now.  Most of these properties could be homes, probably for between &euro;20,000 and &euro;100,000.  I hope Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe's extension to the open rural countryside will make a big impact on that figure.  It would also be important to really kick-start that initiative to give an incentive for the people who own those houses, and in some cases are hoarding them, to sell them to first-time buyers.  Such an incentive could be provided through capital gains tax.  It might encourage people to make those properties available.<\/p>  <p>  I am somewhat concerned that the vacant property tax might not go far enough.  If we are providing incentives, there also needs to be a stick in respect of people who are sitting on derelict properties in the middle of a housing crisis and who will not make them available for people who are desperately looking for a place to live.  Perhaps something could be done in respect of derelict properties such as has been done for vacant properties.  As we know, unless it is on the register there is not any particular stick.  We know that most rural countryside houses are not on any register anywhere.  That is something that should be looked at and I would like to see action on it.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like us to be imaginative in respect of planning laws.  Right now it is possible to extend for up to 400 sq. ft. on a property without planning permission.  Why not extend that to 800 sq. ft. in the open countryside or, within a 50 km limit, bring it up to 600 sq. ft. without having to go for planning permission and slowing down the process?  There are extremely punitive charges for reconnecting to electricity and water.  These bills make no sense whatsoever.  The utility companies will do well once these properties are reconnected.  They will make their money back.  They do not need punitive reconnection fees on young couples.  For first-time buyers that is something that should be dealt with.  Sure enough, apply an occupancy clause to ensure we do not have abuse of the system.  That is something that is glaringly obvious and should be done.<\/p>  <p>  When I look at County Kerry at the moment, there is fantastic work being done in the provision of new social homes in recent years with a lot of housing developments going on all over the county, which is very positive news.<\/p> <p>There are keys being handed out now at a pretty rapid rate, which is good to see.  However, there is very little, if anything, happening in relation to affordable homes.  There needs to be a certain percentage of each social housing development set aside for affordable homes for purchase.  It is something we are just not seeing.  These are the people who simply cannot afford to buy on the open market and do not qualify for social housing.  They are squeezed in the middle and are getting nothing.  That is an area that, with a small change, we can make an impact on.  That is something that has been raised with me many times in my constituency office.  I meet people in the county and they feel completely abandoned in that regard.  That is something that needs to be looked at.<\/p> <p> I wish to raise another point in the short time that I have left.  T&aacute; buairt mh&oacute;r orm faoi pholasa&iacute; tith&iacute;ochta sna Gaeltachta&iacute;, go h&aacute;irithe i gCorca Dhuibhne.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n fadhbanna againn.  N&iacute;l na daoine &oacute;ga in ann tith&iacute; a cheannach.  N&iacute;l siad in ann cead plean&aacute;la a fh&aacute;il &oacute; Chomhairle Chontae Chiarra&iacute; ach t&aacute; daoine, gan aon fhocal Gaolainn acu, in ann teacht isteach agus tith&iacute; a cheannach.  F&aacute;gann na daoine &oacute;ga &oacute; cheantar Corca Dhuibhe agus t&eacute;ann siad go Tr&aacute; L&iacute;, go Lios Tuathail, go Caisle&aacute;n na Maighne agus t&aacute; an teanga ag dul leo.<\/p> <p> We are fooling ourselves if we think that we are going to keep investing in the Irish language and keep it alive if the people who speak the language as their native tongue do not get to live in their area.  Surely, there has to be special protection status given in relation to housing in the Gaeltachta&iacute;.  We need a very strict enforcement of that.  What is there at the moment is not working and it is not being enforced.  The language is dying as a result of that.  Young people are not able to live in their own areas and the language is going with them out of the Gaeltachta&iacute;.<\/p> <p> Short-term housing is a massive problem.  The head has been buried in the sand for too long.  This is the elephant in the room, as far as I am concerned, coming from a very tourism-oriented county where we have a huge number of short-term properties on the market and very few, if any, long-term properties.  Taxation is the way of dealing with this.  Make it more affordable for people to put their property on the market for long-term rental and enforce the existing regulations, because they are not being enforced.<\/p> <p> Finally, too many people are being refused the local authority home loan scheme.  It is too punitive.  Having to put every household resident on the application form just simply does not make sense because many people are over 70 in households where children are trying to buy properties.  That needs to be addressed as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400028#AA00200","speaker":"1581","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664902200,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I was the Acting Chair for the first hour of the debate, so I have had time to reflect.  While there are difficulties out there and undoubtedly there is a crisis in not just the rental side of things but the overall general housing picture, Housing for All has had some positive impact on the crisis and that is sometimes lost in these debates.  We can all probably name different schemes across our own city and county across the country.  Looking at my own constituency, there are 150-odd units of social and affordable houses on Boherboy Road.  I look at Montenotte, where there will be 80 social and affordable houses delivered.  In addition, there are three or four schemes across Blackpool into Farranree and out to Bishopstown.  Many of those schemes did not happen for the past decade.  They are starting, albeit slowly.  They are starting now and will, in time, have a positive impact.<\/p><p>Just before me, Deputy Griffin mentioned the repair and lease scheme.  It is a big bugbear of mine because I see different counties, such as the Acting Chair&rsquo;s county of Waterford, that are excelling at the introduction of the repair and lease scheme and delivering a fairly steady stream of properties back to supply.  Unfortunately, some local authorities, including my own, for one reason or another, do not seem to be engaging with the repair and lease scheme as well as other local authorities are.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Noon, and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, to set targets for local authorities when it comes to delivering under those schemes.  It is incumbent on us to set ambitious targets that they have to deliver.<\/p><p>Cost rental was mentioned as well.  I was lucky enough, again, to have a scheme in my own town, Glanmire, where we have 30-odd units of cost rental currently out for advertisement and due to be filled shortly.  The scheme is very welcome, but it was inundated with applications.  It is clear that there is a market for that cost rental model, which will reduce rents from between 30% and 50%.  I would like to see a greater extension of that.<\/p><p>Unlike others, I was aware of the fact that local authorities can purchase housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies at the moment and have been able to do that for some time.  However, again, it seems to be that some local authorities are doing better than others.  My own local authority is currently working on a policy in relation to that.  The Minister mentioned that more than 300 houses across the country have been purchased to keep HAP and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, tenants <i>in situ<\/i>and that is very welcome.  I will remind my two local authorities of that figure in the morning.  However, as I said, it is very disparate and disjointed.  Clarity needs to be brought to that.<\/p><p>It is worth bearing in mind as well the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme as it was announced a number of months ago.  To be fair to the Minister, he listened in the past few months and again extended that.  I was looking at villages such as Carrignavar and Whitechurch in my area, which are only ten minutes from the city centre, but are largely rural villages.  People were restricted from availing of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund perhaps a couple of hundred metres from outside a village.  It is great it see that scheme extended as well.  The take-up on that will take off in the coming months because it is a worthwhile scheme.  It is worthwhile mentioning that many in the Opposition are against that scheme, which supplies a grant of up to &euro;50,000 for people to bring those derelict properties back into habitation.<\/p><p>As I have said to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, I am disappointed with some local authorities and their engagement with the single stage scheme.  The vast majority of local authorities engage with a four-step scheme for borrowing for the reintroduction of social housing into the market.  However, for some reason, there is very low take-up on the single stage scheme across the country in all local authorities, even in some local authorities in Dublin where one would think that there would be a higher demand than other local authorities.  Certain councils are not availing of it for any scheme whatsoever.  It is baffling for me, as a public representative, when I scheme where a local authority can avail of up to &euro;6 million not being accessed for one reason or another.  Local authorities are saying that they are reluctant to use it because of the risk involved.  Officials in the Minister&rsquo;s Department say that no such risk exists and local authorities will be covered.  Again, clarity needs to be brought to that.  We are sitting here, twiddling our thumbs, when that fund is available and accessible.  As I said, there is no restriction on the number of times that a local authority can apply for it and it is up to &euro;6 million per scheme.<\/p><p>Finally, there is a debate here tonight.  Over the past few days, I have made my opinion on it quite clear in relation to the concrete levy.  I am not against a levy; I am just against the timing of this.  Obviously, the Sinn F&eacute;in motion tonight will discuss it and a vote tomorrow will ensue.  It is worth remembering, when all the social media videos will be packaged and snipped at some time this evening and tomorrow, that it needs to be stated that all Opposition parties that I am aware of are in favour of the concrete levy scheme in one shape or another.  I apologise, as the Social Democrats is not.  The vast majority is.  People need to be reminded of that when all those social media videos hit Facebook, Twitter and Instagram at some stage in the next 24 hours.  Deputy Pearse Doherty said as recently as 28 September that he welcomed &quot;the defective concrete products levy.  It is clear, however, that the Government has not provided enough to fund the scheme.&quot;  Is he suggesting that there is a greater levy his Bill later?  I just hope that comes across in the videos and the social media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400029#BB00200","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1664902200,"counter":256,"content":"<p>It has been over a year since the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, launched the Government&rsquo;s housing plan, but very little has changed.  We see families across Dublin languishing on social housing lists for more than 15 and 16 years.  Only last week, we saw more than 10,800 people presenting as homeless, a new record.  Some 3,220 of those homeless are children.  That is some way of marking the one-year anniversary of this Government&rsquo;s housing plan.<\/p>  <p>  In the Minister, Deputy O'Brien's, two years in office, we have seen rents rise and rise, showing no sign of easing.  There is a shortage of properties to rent.

Constituents facing homelessness contact my office every single week.  It is clear that we need a ban on evictions as we enter the winter months to prevent more families from being forced into homelessness.  <\/p> <p> The Government is being told its targets for both social and affordable housing will not be met this year, so that means 2020, 2021 and 2022 will have seen this Government miss the low targets it set.  My party has presented any number of solutions to the Government in the past two years but the majority of them have fallen on deaf ears.  Therefore, its plan is falling flat on its face.  What is needed is a radical approach to housing.  There is a need for the Minister and his Department to get a serious grip on this because things are going to get a lot worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400029#BB00300","speaker":"1464","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664902800,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Housing for All is a good name but it is not delivering for all.  It is not delivering for families and workers in the flat complexes.  It is not delivering for families and workers in the flats who are paying significant rents.  They do not get them for free.  I know the Minister of State knows this but it will be a surprise to many.  There is an assumption that people living in the flats get them for free.  That is clearly not the case.  They work hard to pay the rent.  It is really important to remember that these are the same families who made up the front line during the pandemic.  If it had not been for the workers and families in the flats, there would not have been a front line during the pandemic.  The flats have little or no insulation, as the Minister knows.  Many of them have dampness and mould, and many are like wind tunnels.  There is an ongoing problem with rats and flooding, with sewage backing up into people's kitchens.  It is absolutely unacceptable.  I can say confidently that the flat complexes will be the last to be retrofitted and insulated.  I am convinced that the view of the Government is that people living in public housing will get everything last and will have to wait.  It shows the attitude of the Government towards people living in public housing.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All is not delivering for homeless people either.  As has been mentioned, over 10,800 people are now homeless.  Over 3,000 children are homeless.  This will have a huge impact on families for generations.  It is now well established that the children of people who experience homelessness are more likely to face homelessness again in the future.  Therefore, this is not just a problem of homelessness today; it is also a problem we are storing up for tomorrow.  Homelessness is a considerable challenge, and the Housing for All plan does not deliver for people in homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400030#CC00200","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1664902800,"counter":259,"content":"<p>The contributions we heard recently from Government backbenchers on this subject have been meaningful and considered.  They have made some valid comments on vacancy, dereliction, the problem of local authorities not using the one-stage approval process for social housing projects worth under &euro;6 million, and the contrast between what local authorities are saying and what the Department is saying.  I say there have been considered contributions because they contrast with what we heard in the first half-hour of this debate.  Instead of making a serious contribution, offering a serious, detailed analysis of Housing for All and giving his view on what is working well, what is not, and what he is doing to address the challenges, the Minister used most of his time to take what seemed to me to be some sort of delusional misstep from reality, praising everything in Housing for All as brilliant.  The rest of his time was used just to attack the main Opposition party.  The people suffering deeply from the housing crisis deserve nothing less than a serious, detailed consideration of Housing for All and the housing issue.  It is disrespectful in the extreme to people who are suffering from housing problems to see the type of behaviour in question.  It is welcome that others here are well able to make serious and meaningful contributions.  I acknowledge that.  Many in this House are able to contribute meaningfully.  It is what we should all be doing.<\/p><p>For the Minister to have been smirking and laughing for most of the time when people were raising serious points, before he left after 15 or 20 minutes of Opposition remarks, was not an appropriate response.  He is absolutely entitled to disagree but the matter should be treated with the utmost seriousness, which it deserves.  The fact is that, in the current housing disaster, the Government is not meeting the targets it set itself.  It is not spending the housing budget it has allocated for itself.  When I see some members of the Government &ndash; not all of them, to be fair &ndash; I wonder whether they do not realise the depths of this crisis and what is happening now.<\/p><p>The various housing metrics show that in the past year new rents have increased by 9%, house prices by 8%, and homelessness by a staggering 32%.  The number of children who are homeless and living in emergency accommodation has increased by 47%.  Homelessness has a profound impact on their development and well-being.  At the same time as they have been homeless, the profits of the largest developer in the country have gone up by 84%.  Rents have never been so high, nor have housing prices and the number who are homeless.  These are not accidents; they are the results of decisions.  This is having a devastating impact on people who are just trying to live a decent life and their families.<\/p><p>Let me give an example of a person who has been affected badly by the housing crisis.  It is by no means an example of someone who is suffering the most, or anything like that.  Niall is a lecturer in Trinity College, which is just down the road from here, and he is living in hostels because he cannot find somewhere more secure to live.  Over the past few weeks, according to him, he has developed a nagging cough because of his accommodation, which he has shared with up to ten people at a time, including with stag party groups in dormitories.  He states that the kitchen and laundry facilities are dismal and that it is hard to eat healthily.  He states that there is nowhere to sit and get work done in the evening and that he is going to college more and more tired each day.  This was not acceptable when it was students who could not find somewhere to live and who consequently lived in hostels mixed in with tourists and stag party groups.  It is not acceptable now when it is a lecturer or anyone else who has nowhere secure to live.<\/p><p>Homelessness outreach volunteers doing voluntary work in Dublin report time and again that when they are trying to help people to get into emergency accommodation, no beds are available.  Last week, they reported that a three-month-old and a two-year-old were left out on the streets at night as there was nowhere for them to go.  When the volunteers rang the various homelessness agencies, the only advice they could give was that the families should go to a Garda station.  That was the only advice because everywhere was full.  This is the reality of the homelessness and housing situation right now.<\/p><p>Over the weekend, we saw in the <i>Business Post<\/i>coverage by Cillian Woods of what has been happening in an estate in Swords.  It came to light only because a Deputy who lives there was selling his home and began to see a pattern.  What the article describes could well be, and presumably is, happening in many other estates around the country.<\/p> <p>On that estate in Swords, where homes are typically sold for approximately &euro;350,000, one house was sold this year for &euro;850,000 and another, incredibly, for &euro;1.7 million, both to investment funds.  These homes were originally bought by the Davy Platform ICAV from a company called Manustin Trading V Limited.  Another seven homes on the estate were bought from BAE Systems, a British weapons manufacturer.  A total of &euro;5.3 million was spent buying up nine homes on the estate, giving an average of approximately &euro;592,000 per home last April, when the median price in the area was &euro;352,000.  This is mind-boggling stuff.  It is highly plausible that the reason such high prices are being paid out for homes is that the investment funds that own them will likely be able to avail of 25-year long-term leases with the local authority.  However, that does not explain the figure of &euro;1.7 million for one property.  We know the local authority in the area is long-term leasing 18 homes on the estate.  I raised this issue with the Taoiseach earlier and, from his comments, he seemed to think this is okay because it is one investment fund selling to another.  I think it is treating these homes as financial assets, which is not in any way okay.<\/p> <p> There have been reports recently of 211 apartments being constructed in Clonsilla that were funded entirely by loans through the State's Home Building Finance Ireland.  Those 211 homes are being sold on to an investment fund called Urbeo.  Given this is being done through State-financed loans, these homes could and should have been built for affordable purchase, cost-rental or social housing.  Using State-backed finance in such a way that homes end up in the hands of investment funds is completely and utterly wrong and indefensible.  It is incredibly bad value for money and clearly pushes up the price of housing.  It would be much better for the State or local authorities to buy homes directly rather than creating these win-win situations for investment funds.<\/p> <p> The other issue I raise is one about which we should have heard from the Minister.  I asked him about it last week but he would not comment.  We know from media coverage that memorandums given to the Cabinet sub-committee show the Government will fall significantly short this year on the targets set for delivering affordable and social homes.  A capital underspend on housing of &euro;240 million in 2022 is forecast in the budget documents that were published last week.  We also know from the August fiscal monitor that capital expenditure on housing is more than 20% lower than it was this time last year.  How is it possible, with everything that is going on, that there is such a capital underspend on housing?  Why is it that the Minister comes in here and does not explain these issues to us or give a serious analysis of them and a serious explanation as to how he is committed to tackling them?  The contribution he made earlier does not in any way reflect the seriousness of this crisis or the seriousness with which most other speakers have treated it in the debate so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400030#CC00300","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664903400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Deputies Higgins and McAuliffe are sharing the next slot.

We all recognise there are still significant challenges to overcome.  However, it is important to recognise, too, that progress is happening.  House completions, commencements and planning approvals are up.  An additional 200 staff are being hired by local authorities to deliver on their housing targets.  More than 2,000 people have signed up to avail of the new affordable purchase scheme.  For the first time ever, cost-rental apartments are being let.  Throughout the country, we can see boots on sites and cranes on our skylines once again.  We are finally seeing an increase in housing supply.  That is the light at the end of this tunnel because it is what will drive down the cost of renting and buying.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that whenever we speak in this Chamber about housing, there are people and families at the centre of the debate for whom owning a home right now feels like a fairy tale or pipe dream.  They do not feel any progress is being made for them because they do not yet see a change in their circumstances.  That has to change and the statistics show it is changing.  In the past 12 months, 25,000 new homes  were completed.  Construction has started on another 29,000 houses and more than 44,000 homes have been approved for planning.  Completions, commencements, planning permissions, purchases and first-time buyer mortgage drawdowns are all trending in the right direction at last.  These indicators show Housing for All is working and change is happening.  It is not happening as quickly as any of us would like but it is happening and it must continue at a faster pace.<\/p>  <p>  The ultimate goal is to deliver 300,000 new homes by 2030 and record funding has been set aside to make that happen.  There is no denying the impact of external global challenges that were unforeseen this time last year.  However, as committed to last year, the Government will review its action plan in light of those challenges, looking at cost inflation, for example, and adjusting where necessary.  Does this mean we will reduce our targets?  Absolutely not.  It means we will reinforce them and back them up with further funds if needed.  That is the action for which I will fight and vote.<\/p>  <p>  Listening to the debate, one could be forgiven for thinking Sinn F&eacute;in Members have voted to support policies that deliver homes and drive affordability.  In fact, that is often not what happens in this Chamber.  They voted against the establishment of the Land Development Agency, which is the body set up to deliver public homes on public land.  The party did not propose an amendment to that legislation but simply voted against it.  It opposed the shared equity scheme even though it oversees a similar scheme in Northern Ireland.  It is against the help-to-buy initiative, which has helped 35,000 people to purchase their own home.  What does the party support?  From what I can tell, it has two flagship policies on housing, namely, to freeze rents and deliver public housing on public land.  These are nice, catchy sound bites but what do they mean?  If we want to see what a rent freeze would mean, we need only look at Berlin, where the situation got even worse for tenants after such a freeze was introduced, with the supply of rental properties drying up and landlords abandoning the market.  The rent freeze was eventually overturned by the courts.  It is a policy that might sound good but would, in reality, drive up rents and further exacerbate the situation.  Where will public land come from if Sinn F&eacute;in does not want a body like the LDA in place to deliver public land and transform that land into homes?<\/p>  <p>  I want to see public housing on public land, which is why I voted for the establishment of the LDA.  I also want to see the delivery of private homes, which is why I voted in favour of a project in my constituency that is seeing 1,000 homes, comprising a mix of public and private, being delivered right now.  Sinn F&eacute;in voted against that too.  While some in the Opposition are busy pushing populist policies and arguing over who builds homes, the Government needs to stay focused on getting those homes built.  That is what people care about the most.  I do not think many of my constituents care who builds houses; they just want good-quality, affordable homes.  That is what the Government's housing strategy needs to deliver as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400031#DD00300","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1664903400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The Opposition Members who have spoken so far have called for considered debate and claimed nothing has changed in the past year.  Those accusations were made by people who are no longer in the Chamber.  These are not tropes that should be thrown back and forth but it seems to be what is happening.  This issue is too serious for that and we need to consider it more holistically.<\/p>  <p>  It is not true that nothing has changed.  For a decade, we had undersupply and Governments that leaned into the market.  That is not the case anymore.  Now we have a &euro;20 billion multi-annual programme.  We have an affordable purchase scheme for the first time in a decade and an affordable rental scheme for the first time in the history of the State.  We have new taxes on stamp duty for vulture funds and a doubling of the obligation on developers to deliver social and affordable housing on private sites.  We have brought in new tools to deal with dereliction and to provide below-cost owner-occupied apartments and homes, led by local authorities and private developers.<\/p> <p>We have turned on all of the taps to try to increase the supply.  Things have changed regardless of what the Opposition may say.  One need only look at the legislation that has come through this House to fact-check that statement.<\/p> <p> The legislation has not made a difference as yet to supply.  Some of that has been due to the Covid-19 shutdowns and the supply chain problems related to Ukraine.  There has, however, been an increase in supply.  The previous speaker mentioned all the indicators going in the right direction.<\/p> <p> Let us look then at what is happening in my constituency of Dublin North-West.  A recent Part 8 planning application has been approved for the Whitehall and Shangan social housing and senior citizen sites.  We have 93 units in Shangan and 83 units in Whitehall on the Collins Avenue site.  We have also got social and senior citizens' sites being developed on Parkview and on the Church of Annunciation sites.  These would not have happened without Housing for All.  Dublin City Council and &Oacute; Cualann also have advanced plans at planning application stage for 52 units at St Joseph&rsquo;s Hill, Ballymun, 35 of which will be affordable purchase, again for the first time.  These are not the only affordable purchase houses in my area.  We will have more in Parkview, Balbutcher Lane, Sillogue Road, Oscar Traynor Road and Kildonan Road, and there will be more.  These are all public housing projects on public land that is being delivered as a result of Housing for All.  It is not true to say that nothing has changed because of the following facts.  We have the legislation that everyone can see on the Oireachtas website and there are the planning applications we are starting to see now in each of our constituencies.<\/p> <p> This supply is coming on stream.  It is affordable and is going to make a difference but we know it will take time.  How can one pass affordable housing legislation last year, whether one voted for or against it, and expect that supply 12 months later to have made a significant impact in the market?  That is not possible and people are pretending that it is.  <\/p> <p> What do we do?  We have seen an increase in the notices to quit and I am very concerned about the months ahead.  This Government over the past two years has introduced eviction bans where it was possible to do so in an emergency situation under the Covid-19 restrictions of not moving beyond the 5 km distance.  The Opposition has always called for an eviction ban but it equally calls for a right to housing to be inserted in the Constitution so that we can balance property rights and the right to a home.  If that was in the Constitution, it would allow us to make more interventionist moves on something such as an eviction ban.  The circumstances over these few months are coming to a position where, on an emergency basis, during the winter, perhaps as a winter initiative, the Government could put in place another eviction ban as we have done before because we need to take a short-term measure to prevent homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400031#DD00400","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664904000,"counter":265,"content":"<p>The Housing for All plan sets ambitious targets with the aim of delivering 300,000 new homes by the end of 2030.

Of the planned 300,000 new homes in this plan, these will include 90,000 social homes, 56,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost-rental homes.<\/p>  <p>  The first signs of growth in this sector are now appearing after a decade of undersupply due to various factors such as the banking collapse, and the subsequent recession, coupled with the enforced closure of many housing projects during the early months of the pandemic.  We then had the logistics difficulties and the subsequent inflation in the construction sector.  Now, we are having to work through the difficulties of the energy market brought about by the Ukraine war.<\/p>  <p>  According to the 2016 census, there are nearly 117,000 people living in homes in County Clare.  Overall, the vast majority, or nearly 90,000, are living in their own homes with just over half of that number with a mortgage.  There are 16,500 renting a property from a private landlord and there are just over 9,000 people living in social housing.

We have record rents, record homelessness and record house prices.  For a whole generation, having a home of one&rsquo;s own is just simply beyond reach.  People are having to decide between independence now and having one&rsquo;s money swallowed up by rent, or security later while having to wait at home with parents, even if one has children of one&rsquo;s own, well into one&rsquo;s mid-30s.  For others, they can have neither security later nor independence now.<\/p>  <p>  For people above social housing income limits and who cannot qualify for a commercial mortgage, there is little to nothing.  These are many people working hard, earning decent money and doing everything they have been encouraged to do, but they just do not have a chance and it is getting worse.<\/p>  <p>  We need to radically ramp-up affordable housing targets.  The Government targets for affordable purchase homes over the next five years make grim reading.  In Cork, the Government only intend to build 378 affordable homes over the next half decade in the city.  That is about 76 affordable homes per year in the city.  How anyone could think that is enough goes beyond me.  Recently, for one project of 32 houses in Glanmire, the council received 800 applications.<\/p>  <p>  I want to briefly mention income thresholds for social housing.  As it happens, I raised this with the senior Minister previously.  It is a scandal that these have not increased in more than 11 years.  More and more people are being knocked off the housing list and have lost that credit time, which is time that they had invested.  This is like money in the bank to people.  It is seven or eight years, then, the person is taken off the list and is left with nothing, with no place to go and with no real prospects of ever being able to afford a mortgage.  I have dealt in regard to this issue with several families recently and it is heartbreaking.  None of these people are expecting a home overnight and just want the chance to build up their time.  I urge the Minister of State to move on this.  I am unsure what objections are coming from within the Department and I know that the senior Minister himself is sympathetic.  If this is based on how many people are on the housing list, access HAP and so on - I cannot say if it is or not - that would be cynicism on a cruel level.  If that is the case it is unacceptable that calculations like that are keeping people off and knocking people off the housing list.  The price of everything is going up and we are still dealing with housing income limits that were too low six years ago, not to mind now.  This urgently needs to be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400032#EE00300","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1664904000,"counter":267,"content":"<p>The senior Minister stated earlier that the goal of the Housing for All policy is to support home ownership and to increase affordability.  In everything that the Government is doing, it will not radically improve the housing stock or make housing affordable.  In fact, in the first year of the policy, the Government has missed multiple targets and house prices and rents are increasing to such a degree that it is making it almost impossible for people to either buy their own home or rent accommodation.  The Housing for All policy is just another in a long list of failed housing policies and strategies put forward by successive Governments, including the Minister of State's Government, which has contributed to the crisis we have in housing at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  The senior Minister has put forward housing proposals that will not deliver social and affordable housing on the scale required, nor will his policy build houses that are affordable.<\/p> <p>In fact, the Government has admitted in Cabinet that its plans for construction of social and affordable housing are not on track.  A number of other crucial targets have been missed, such as the development of a healthcare model for the homeless and the empowering of local authorities to incentivise planning to convert vacant commercial properties into residential homes.  The Minister's housing plans, which include schemes such as the shared equity scheme, have proven in the past to result in inflated house prices and increased personal debt.  Housing associations, housing experts and economic organisations have judged his housing policy to be ill-conceived and ill-judged.<\/p> <p> The Government has, as in the past, placed too much reliance on private developers building social and affordable housing.  Local authorities should be the drivers behind the building of social and affordable housing, not private developers.  Investment funds are corrupting the housing market by buying up large swathes of housing estates and apartment blocks with generous discounts because they are bulk buying.  This distorts the housing market and gives unfair advantage to such financial groups over those struggling to get on the property ladder.  This housing policy does not give hope to people, especially at this time, when the homeless figures are scandalously at their highest.  The Government should acknowledge that these policies are failing and it is time to change course radically.<\/p> <p> It seems that many on the Government side are quoting the Opposition with regard to future housing plans.  As Deputy Paul McAuliffe mentioned, some of these plans are for four or five years into the future, such as the Church of the Annunciation site, Jamestown or Shangan, all projects that are well into the future.

I have been asking for it since several weeks before the summer recess.  It was refused before the summer, it was refused until now and, finally, the Minister has deigned to allow a debate but has left before the vast majority of the Opposition spokespeople on housing even have a chance to respond to his speech.  The reason I asked for this debate is because I think some of us have some things to impart to the Minister about just how dire the housing situation is out there but, again and again, the senior Minister leaves.  This is not the first time he has gone and left in his place a Minister of State who is not responsible for this area.  I am sick of it.<\/p><p>The contempt is not really even for the Opposition spokespeople.  It is for the people who are suffering, and I mean really suffering, from the housing crisis.  An email came to me today from Nenagh, County Tipperary.  It is from a woman, although I will not mention her name.  It reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \tMy husband, two children and I are homeless in Nenagh.  We have been told by the council that I earn too much to receive any help.  As such, we are staying in a tent.  As winter approaches, I am very worried for my children, who are both autistic, and how we will manage.  We have been applying for houses with no luck.  There are not very many available and landlords and realtors do not seem to want to give us a home.  I am emailing you to see if there is anything you could do to help us. <\/blockquote>  <p>She is contacting a Deputy in D&uacute;n Laoghaire about this but the Minister could not be bothered to stay and listen to her story.<\/p><p>In my own area, I am speaking for Magda, who is in a two-bedroom house.  She has been overholding because she got a notice to quit on grounds of sale on 2 August.  She lives in a council-built estate, where the house is on sale.  Because it is a corner house, three other houses could be built on that site if the Government stepped in and bought it.  Instead, who will buy it?  It will almost certainly be property investors.  At the current price, it certainly will not be the people affected by the housing crisis because it is being sold for &euro;650,000.  A person would need an after-tax of income of well over &euro;100,000 to have even a prayer of buying that house in a former council estate.  Four houses could be built on that site and it would prevent Magda from being evicted.<\/p><p>I am speaking for Debbie, who has been on the housing list since 2009, nearly 14 years.  She has three children and she is facing eviction on the grounds of sale.  We have asked the council, on Debbie's behalf, to buy that house.  We have been saying this to the Minister for years, in particular with regard to the St. Helen's Court debacle, where again a vulture fund bought that multi-unit apartment complex and has spent four years trying to evict all the tenants.  They are still there but the local authority has not stepped in and bought it and the tenants still have the sword of Damocles hanging over their head.  In the case of Debbie, we have asked the council to buy.  The Minister says that, in line with the request we have been making for a long time, he has instructed the local authorities to buy houses where people are facing eviction on foot of a notice to quit on grounds of sale.  What the Minister says is not true.  That is not what is happening.<\/p><p>I got an email today from a landlady who contacted D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in July.  She did not want to evict her HAP tenant because she is a decent person.  She is an accidental landlady and she has to sell, but she cannot sell because she will not put a HAP tenant into homelessness.  She contacted the council after the Minister said he had instructed local authorities to buy in situations like this.  She asked D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council if it would do it and it said, sorry, but it does not buy where there are tenants <i>in situ<\/i>.  This is after the Minister said he had informed councils to do this.  When I look at the circular, it is clear that it is much more qualified and subject to caveats than the Minister implied today when I asked him about it, and it uses terms like &ldquo;if resources allow&rdquo; and &ldquo;if the council&rdquo;.  There should be no ifs or buts.  We need a firm instruction to local authorities that where people are being evicted into homelessness, the local authorities will step in and buy those properties.  That just has to happen.  That is how we will stop the record numbers of people who are now homeless.  We need to look at where that spike is coming from.  These are families, mostly working families, who are being evicted for no reason other than landlords selling up to capitalise on high prices or accidental landlords who have no choice, but the Government will not step in and buy these properties.  It is crazy.<\/p><p>I would go further.  I really want to get this out there to the Minister as a serious debate.  We should be going further than that.  We have &euro;5 billion that we have just put into the rainy day fund.  This is the rainy day when it comes to the housing crisis.  There are 96,000 HAP, RAS and rent allowance properties out there.  We should write to every single one of those property owners and ask if they are interested in selling to the State.  It is costing the State and every taxpayer in this country far more money to pay them RAS, HAP, leasing costs and rent allowance than it would if the State owned that property.  There would be an immediate saving to the State and it would secure the future housing needs of all of the people in those arrangements.<\/p><p>Let us remember that every single one of the people in those arrangements has been let down by the State.  They are all on housing lists because the only way people can get HAP, RAS, leasing or rent allowance is to be on a housing list.  The State has let them down if they are on it for 15 or 20 years.  That should be done immediately.  We could make a serious and immediate impact, a practical impact in the here and now, if we do that.  We should also do it with all of the build-to-rent apartments that are being completed at the moment.<\/p> <p>Why on earth would we let international investment funds like the pension fund of the arms dealer British Aerospace, as we discovered in Swords, and all sorts of other international wealth asset management operations - the global rich - invest in Irish property to make a fortune by buying up these properties?  Is it better that they or the State own the property?  We would not be crowding out first-time buyers because first-time buyers cannot afford any of this anyway, and the State can afford it with the money in the rainy day fund.  The State could designate some of it for affordable purchase housing and the rest for social housing.  If we do not, British Aerospace or some other investment fund will buy it and lease it back at extortionate rates to local authorities and we will pay for it anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400033#FF00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664905200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>We pay for it twice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400034#GG00200","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1664905200,"counter":272,"content":"<p>This is insanity, yet the Government continues to allow it to persist, resulting in people entering into homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding income thresholds, I will return to the example of the woman in Nenagh.

I welcome the empty homes tax.  It is something that I have campaigned for in my party for a number of years.  It is important, regardless of what figure one chooses for the number of vacant homes.  A medium figure seems to be approximately 100,000.  If we do this right, the tax will provide a benefit as well as a significant possibility for tens of thousands of people.  Initially, though, we must change what we are doing.  I do not agree with the regulation setting out that the tax will only apply to properties that are occupied for less than 30 days in a 12-month period.  That is not good enough.  Nor should the vacant homes tax apply universally across the country.  My argument remains what it has always been, namely, we should go after all of those homes in rent pressure zones that are empty today.  The period for which they can be left vacant should not be greater than six months.  If someone's house is left vacant for six months, he or she should pay the vacant house tax on it.  There should be no exemptions other than sensible and appropriate ones, for example, if someone is in hospital or a nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  There is a model for all of this and it actually works.  Between 2017 and 2020, the empty homes tax in the city of Vancouver reduced the number of vacant homes by 30%.  In the same period, the number of lettings and new tenancies increased by 3% or 4%.  This was a major plus for families in Vancouver who were able to go into empty homes where no one had been living for at least six months of the year.  If we mean what we say as a Government, we should insist on the same happening in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  There are pressures from every direction against this tax, but the Government has made the principled decision to introduce it.  There are those who will shout and roar at it, but we must work with what we have and maximise our arguments in this House and on Oireachtas committees to make the tax an eventuality that works for thousands of people.  If we can open up 3,000 homes that are currently empty - they have roofs, doors and windows and all people need are the keys to get into them - to the people Deputies have mentioned as well as those whom I know in my constituency, it will make a significant difference.  It can and must be done.  It does not make sense to ignore all of the houses that are sitting empty.  The Ministers of State, Deputies Noonan and Peter Burke, should listen to me, look at the record and consider the facts.  If they do what I suggest, it will work.  It is working in other jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  Louth County Council has shown the way forward by taking over properties that have been abandoned and left vacant, refurbishing them and putting families in them.  This was done with more than 100 homes over three years at an average cost of less than &euro;200,000, including legal costs.  The Government must do more than it is doing now.  I have argued consistently for there to be one person in the Department to drive this with energy, get all of the local authorities to use compulsory purchase orders, and to get people up off their butts, looking for these homes and ensuring that they are occupied.  That is the task we are facing.<\/p>  <p>  Last Sunday's polls were stark, but real.  The main issue in this country is, and remains, housing.  It will always be housing unless and until those homes are filled.  Why would we not do this?  That is my challenge to the Government.  We cannot sit back and say that everything is great and that the Minister will do whatever he is going to do.  It not about him.  It is not even about us.  It is about all the people out there who are entitled to the full support of the State to fill empty homes and about tackling the people who leave those homes idle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400034#GG01400","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1664905200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Housing is the main issue.  I will speak in the context of the Limerick City constituency, which I represent.  My views are well known.  I welcome that the budget has amended the living city initiative and extended it until 2027, which means another five years.  I want to see people living in the city centre.  That is something on which I have worked.  Limerick city centre has a Georgian footprint.  I want living there to be affordable to young people so that it is an option when they are looking around for somewhere to live.  Currently, it is probably not affordable for them.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe grant is being extended through blanket coverage to every area in the country - rural, town and urban areas, including city centres.  This will make a considerable difference.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to discuss an issue that may have been missed.  Young people, including couples, are approaching me.  In many cases, they say that buying a second-hand home is cheaper than buying a new one.  This may not be known by the general public.  Therefore, the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme has significant potential in terms of assisting people to buy houses that are not being used.  If a house is derelict, the grant can increase from &euro;30,000 to &euro;50,000, which is a great deal of money.  Houses cost money, but people in this situation will be doing up existing houses.  This provides a large number of dual benefits and is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  On affordable housing, I welcome that affordable homes will be rolled out in Limerick, with 25 units in Br&uacute; na Gruad&aacute;n in Castletroy, which is where I reside.  As I have stated on the record previously, I would like every new estate to have 10% affordable housing.  Where land was purchased prior to 31 July 2021, developers are not required to provide 10% affordable housing, only 10% social housing, so long as they get planning permission before July 2026.<\/p> <p>I want to have this aspect examined again in respect of the overall model.  Regarding the constituency I represent, the social housing income limits are too low now.  They have not kept pace with the average cost of housing or average incomes.  When these limits were revised 11 years ago, the average income was around &euro;35,000.  Average income today is approximately &euro;45,000, an increase of 20%.  I am calling for a 5% increase across the board, including in respect of adult dependants and also for children.<\/p> <p> I say this because many people are coming to us who are just over the income limits for social housing.  What I wish to see in use all the time is an integrated model where we look after people in respect of social and affordable housing and allow them to live in their communities.  Many of the measures introduced are to be welcomed.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  If there are vacant houses, then they should be occupied.  In many cases, it is cheaper to buy and renovate them than to purchase or build a new house.  I also wish to see a change in the affordable side of things.  Every new estate built should have 10% affordable housing and 10% social housing.  This is a simple principle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400034#GG01500","speaker":"1593","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664905800,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter.

I welcome the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme and its extension to ensure it is available in rural communities.  Equally, we must have an appraisal of the existing planning regulations, even those concerning one-off housing.  I refer to the hoops people are being put through when trying to get planning permission for a modest house in a rural community.  We have also seen issues arising with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We must face these and look into the issues that have existed, and perhaps also at some of the decisions made previously.<\/p>  <p>  The opening contribution of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, contained several points.  He said that if housing was good enough to rent, then it was good enough to buy.  We must explore the situation regarding houses in rural communities, where people may be on an invalidity pension or might have money because of having had an accident.  People in those situations should be allowed to purchase their houses.  I am talking in particular about rural houses built by the county councils throughout the years.  These are houses built predominantly on sites provided by the tenants now resident in them.  I welcome the important decision in this regard that was made in February to extend an initiative in respect of pensioners, but it is also time we considered the invalidity pension and other State benefits and ensured that people who are in a position to purchase their houses can do so.  I say this because this is a win-win situation.  It would ensure that equity is returned to the county councils and that money is generated from it.  I ask the Minister of State to explore this aspect and to convey this point to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  It is crucially important.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the issue of State-owned land, and Deputy O'Donnell will be familiar with where I am going to talk about, Cork County Council owns land in Charleville that should be earmarked for housing.  It is zoned for housing and it has the requisite services.  The county council, the other local authorities and Irish Water installed services again recently when work was done on the streetscape.  This land should be made available for housing.  Too many hoops must be gone through in this regard.  We go out and try to get private land, and all the rest of it, but a vast amount of land is already available in this regard.  It should be available for housing.  My colleague, Councillor Ian Doyle, has been working at council level on this matter.  This aspect of the housing issue should be recognised and it should be examined.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, we announced some of the small village schemes last year for sewerage works to be done, including for Castlemagner in my constituency.  That scheme was announced in late September 2021.  The wastewater treatment plant there has great potential for upgrading.  It is centrally positioned.  When schemes like these are announced, they should be approached with seriousness and intent by the local authorities, the Department and Irish Water to ensure they are completed in a timely fashion and that the work does not drag on and go through hoop after hoop.  It must be ensured that it takes the shortest possible time to release land that is available and can be built on.  Addressing these issues, which occur across the country, in urban and, in particular, in rural areas, can help to answer the questions now being asked about the provision of housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400035#HH00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speech","time":1664905800,"counter":287,"content":"<p>The Government's targets for Cork city are to build 394 social houses and 76 affordable houses annually.  This shows us the lack of imagination, leadership and understanding of the Government, and especially the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, regarding this challenge.  I refer to the number of people evicted and served with notices to quit, and the thousands of people on our housing lists in Cork who cannot rent or buy accommodation, and then the Minister's solutions.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All has completely failed.  We have a Minister who has also completely failed with his plan.  It took him a year to pick out the plan and it does not work.  Just to give people an idea of the situation, there is much talk about social housing income thresholds and those limits.  The Government is keeping them at the current levels because it knows the figures would go up by tens of thousands of people if they were to keep pace with inflation.  We have people, such as bus drivers and other ordinary working people, who would have been entitled to go on the social housing lists, but if those people do any bit of good for themselves, they will be taken off.  These are facts.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 20 minutes ago, I spoke to a man who is homeless tonight in Cork city.  Paul is his first name, and I will not use his second name because I respect his dignity too much.  His two options were to go to Cork Simon or to the city's St. Vincent's Hostel.  Those were his only two choices.  This man worked all his life.  He did everything.  His landlord sold his property to an investment firm because it was going to turn it into a complex.  He has now been in emergency housing accommodation for more than a year and a half.  Furthermore, I had to phone Anglesea Street Garda station last week to get garda&iacute; to come out to a house to stop an illegal eviction.  That is what I had to do last week.  I thanked the Chief Superintendent for the work the Garda did, and I also commend the Community Tenants Action Union, CATU, and its volunteers who came and stood with the person concerned.<\/p>  <p>  We are in a crisis in housing like none experienced before.

I was not a bit surprised at the record homeless figures released last week.  Housing is required for everybody, for all the reasons that make life worth living, including safety, security, family, privacy, dignity, access to education and health.  When people do not have proper homes, lives often take a turn for the worst.<\/p>  <p>  I want to use my short time to show what a difference a home makes by talking about a constituent, a nana, who has just got an eviction notice to quit the apartment she has been renting come January 2023.  She has been on Kildare County Council's housing list for almost six years.  This woman is looking after her granddaughter in a formal fostering arrangement with Tusla.  To its credit, officials of the organisation have written to Kildare County Council in support of this woman and to request that she be permanently housed.  Her granddaughter cried with relief when she was allowed to stay with her nana.  Her grandmother, though, cried as well.  She had already lost the chance to look after her two grandsons because she had to give them up simply and solely because she did not have adequate accommodation and could not find any in north Kildare.  This grandmother only had a two-bedroom apartment and she needed one with three bedrooms to keep all her grandchildren together.  The two boys are in a lovely foster home, but they are losing the chance to be reared by their nana, who adores them and who they adore in turn, and to grow up with their sister simply because of their nana's housing situation.<\/p> <p>Think of the lost years in those children's lives, all the love, security, happiness and family bonding that they are losing out on because there is no proper housing available in north Kildare.  Can the Minister tell me how that makes sense for society or for that grandmother and those children?  How is this putting children first?  The 3,220 children who are homeless at present are not counted in the housing figures because they are considered homed but they are not at home with their grandmother where they should be.<\/p> <p> That was not the end of the crying yesterday.  Amid all the despair, I spoke to a woman who had secured a home.  She was crying as well but they were tears of relief.  We could hear it and I thought it would be my turn next to cry because there is nothing as basic as the four walls of a house.<\/p> <p> The Minister must stop evictions.

The aim of Housing for All, according to the executive summary, is \"access to a quality home to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard ... offering a high quality of life.\"  This was to be achieved in four ways, namely, supporting home ownership and increasing affordability, on which the Minister has failed; eradicating homelessness, increasing social housing delivery and supporting social inclusion, on which he has failed miserably; increasing new housing supply - he forgot to say for cuckoo funds mainly; and addressing vacancy and efficient use of existing stock - using an unenforceable 30-day occupancy rule which will cost more to police than it will yield.<\/p>  <p>  In the midst of a housing crisis that the Government now recognises, it is beyond belief that it would then come along and decide to apply a 10% levy on concrete blocks.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, clarify whether that levy will apply before VAT or does it include VAT because that would make it dearer again?<\/p>  <p>  The housing crisis is caused mainly by one problem.  We have a lack of supply, which has been worsened by a variety of actions taken by successive Governments over many years, including the imposition of extra taxes and charges, the implementation of planning requirements that have no basis in law and the adoption of county development plans that do not suit the needs of the areas they are developed to serve.<\/p>  <p>  Judging by some recent stories about where people are being accommodated and newly released homelessness figures, it is clear that we do not have the appropriate resources available to cater for the numbers of people in need of accommodation.  The fact that the numbers are increasing day by day is a sign of the Government's failure to deal with housing in a positive and effective way.  These are not numbers; they are people - children and their parents and grandparents.<\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where we have a lack of supply, one would think the Government would take measures to reduce the cost of building a house.  By refusing to remove excise on fuel and instead increasing the tax take by upping carbon tax and then taxing the tax, the Government has made it more expensive to run every vehicle needed in the process of building a house.  That includes the on-site machinery but also every vehicle used in the transportation of goods and materials to the building site.  All of these costs will be shouldered by the end buyer of the house - in the case of people building their own home it will put such ambition beyond the reach of many - or by the taxpayer footing the rental assistance bill of almost &euro;1 billion, including HAP, that is being paid out.<\/p>  <p>  Through VAT, the Government makes auctioneers and solicitors fees 23% more expensive.  The architect's fees will be 23% more expensive.  There will be VAT charged on mortgage services.  Most of the materials are already 23% more expensive due to VAT and we do not know whether this concrete levy will be 10% plus VAT or will include VAT.  It needs to be clarified whether the levy will be applied inclusive of or plus VAT?  Are we taxing the tax continuously?<\/p>  <p>  It is unbelievable that in the middle of possibly the worst housing crisis in the history of the State this Government has not considered measures rolled out across Europe to have new builds rated at zero VAT.  If it wants one big idea with which to help with building supply to solve homelessness once and for all, it should consider a zero VAT rate on new builds.  Housing for All, how are ye?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400036#JJ00200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1664906400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>The Government pitches the Housing for All plan as its proposal to alleviate the housing crisis.  Housing for All promises an increase in the supply of new housing to an average of at least 33,000 new units per year.  This promise included over 10,000 social homes each year, with 9,500 of these being new builds, and an average of 6,000 affordable homes for purchase or rent to help eliminate homelessness and address the waiting lists.  Yet homelessness is at a record level and people are queuing on the streets to view rooms, are being priced out of buying a home and are paying nearly half their wages on rent.<\/p>  <p>  Last weekend, the Taoiseach stated that housing was the single most important social issue facing the country, yet plans to allocate additional resources to the Residential Tenancies Board, promises to retrofit 2,400 social homes and a new register for short-term and holiday lets are only some of the promises made under Housing for All that have been delayed.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of Housing for All was to ensure we achieve a more sustainable housing system, with a planning system that is fit for purpose, to create long-term, vibrant communities with the necessary supporting infrastructure.  However, the conflict-of-interest claims against An Bord Plean&aacute;la's former deputy chairman, Mr. Paul Hyde, have eradicated the public's trust in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p>  <p>  The remit of An Bord Plean&aacute;la was expanded from one of dealing with appeals to one of making the first and final decision on housing developments.  This idea was the cutting edge of the Government's effort to get to grips with the housing crisis.  Fast-tracking the planning process worked, in theory, for the short term.  However, if the State's objective was to resolve the housing crisis, that task has not been achieved.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency of Louth and east Meath, I will acknowledge the recent social development at Ice House Hill in Dundalk.  However, with regard to planning, it is proving very difficult to get planning permission granted.  Recently, I had a family in my office looking for planning permission for a home for their son on a farm of more than 30 acres where they reside.  Their son met all local needs requirements yet was still refused planning permission after submitting various plans and moving the location of the planned dwelling.  This is only one of many cases of planning refusal being raised in my constituency office now.  It seems near impossible to get planning permission, especially in rural parts of the county.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, told the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis that he will remove planning rules which provide exemptions for the build-to-rent sector and that the shared equity scheme for first-time buyers will be extended to self-build homes.  This, he said, would be a \"game changer\" for rural Ireland.  This move is welcomed as it means that where there is a gap between the mortgage approved and the cost of a self-build, people can apply to the first home scheme to make up the difference.  However, more needs to be done to deal with the issues at the beginning of the process related to securing planning permission.  This would help people in rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  While the vacant home tax will increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase, in this time of crisis we must ensure that all houses are fully utilised.  The Housing for All plan introduced incentives and measures to bring vacant and derelict properties back into residential use whereby the local authorities were to incentivise people planning to convert vacant commercial properties into residential homes.  I have previously highlighted the work of Louth County Council in bringing these vacant properties back into the housing stock but we cannot have houses being left vacant.  In Dundalk, I guarantee there is at least one vacant house on every street in established communities that have appropriate services such as schools and shops.  Why are these houses being kept vacant?<\/p>  <p>  From dealing with the local authority, I know the only thing holding Louth County Council back is the lack of funding from the Government.  The Government&rsquo;s own targets state that we need 33,000 new homes each year.  Surely the way forward is to tackle these vacant homes first and bring them back to the market.  I ask that the Government provide additional capital funding to local authorities and approved housing bodies to purchase more homes and developments for the provision of social, affordable rental and affordable purchase homes.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to take into consideration the long-term consequences and requirements of housing tens of thousands of vulnerable people fleeing from the war in Ukraine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400036#JJ00300","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1664906400,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I had a debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, on a radio station over the weekend, during which he stated that the housing crisis could not be fixed overnight.  It is an incredible statement for a Minister to make at this stage.  Since Phil Hogan and Deputy Alan Kelly were Ministers, through to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, Eoghan Murphy and the current Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, Ministers all said that the housing crisis could not be fixed overnight.  It is a long night for the people on housing waiting lists, those in homelessness and those on the edge of survival because of increasing rents.<\/p> <p>All that time the crisis has got steadily worse.  We now have record numbers of people who are homeless, hitting 10,800 people accessing emergency accommodation, 3,220 of whom are children, in just the last month.  Does the Minister have any idea of the long-term damage it does to children to be homeless or living in emergency accommodation - the damage it does to their health, their mental health, their nutrition and their education?  This is the Government damaging a generation of children due to its policies on housing.<\/p> <p> Every year, approximately 100 people die of homelessness on the streets of Dublin.  The Government is not recording the number of people dying in any other county.  Dozens of other people are losing their lives in homelessness in the rest of the country and no State organisation sees fit even to record that number.  Many thousands of people are one rent increase away from poverty or homelessness.  This is absolutely a record-breaking Government: the highest house prices on record, the highest rents on record and, now, the highest number of homeless people on record.<\/p> <p> In the jaws of this emergency, this national humanitarian crisis, one would imagine the Government would have an urgency about it in respect of solutions in the budget it has just delivered, but that has not happened, unfortunately.  A promised vacant home tax plan, which was incredibly nebulous, was based on a house having to be occupied less than 30 days a year.  What are people going to do?  Are they going to take selfies in those homes for 31 days of the year?  Are they going to go to the local Garda station to sign on for 31 days of the year?  It is an incredible situation.  I heard two Fine Gael Deputies talk about how it is absolutely wrong that there are so many vacant homes in this State.  Let us be absolutely clear, however: Fine Gael has been opposing vacant home taxes since the start of this Government.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is ideologically opposed to the imposition of vacant home taxes and has said so and acted as such many times in his position as Minister for Finance.<\/p> <p> The residential zoned land tax announced in last year's budget is still in the future tense.  Long-term empty homes and empty sites in a crisis of this depth is a clear winner in the crowded race of Government ineptitude in respect of housing.  I say \"crowded race\" because the Government's actions in terms of ineptitude are incredible.  The Government closed building sites for a full quarter in 2021.  The country with the worst housing crisis in the whole of the European Union was the only country in the whole of the European Union that closed building sites.  It is incredible.  In an act of sheer ignorance and illiteracy, the Government has now decided to introduce a defective concrete products levy on products going into the building of houses.  What is wrong with the Government that it is starting to increase the taxes levied on building homes for people in the jaws of the worst housing crisis in the history of the State?  I and the majority of people in this country have no confidence in this Government's ability to fix the housing crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400036#JJ00400","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1664907000,"counter":294,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400037#KK00125"},{"type":"speech","time":1664907000,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan - to discuss recognition of qualified teachers in Cork Life Centre, and if the Minister for Education will make a statement on the matter; (2) Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire - to discuss a response to the consultation with survivors of institutional abuse; (3) Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v - to discuss continued and improved services in Clifden District Hospital, Galway; (4) Deputy Michael McNamara - to discuss why all agricultural cargo coming into Dublin for Shannon Airport is cleared and inspected in Dublin; (5) Deputy Emer Higgins - to discuss the progress on delivering new school buildings and-or extensions to schools in Dublin Mid-West; (6) Deputy Maurice Quinlivan - to discuss the recommendations of the Deloitte report on University Hospital Limerick; (7) Deputy Marian Harkin - to discuss when compensation payments will be made to farmers affected by the 2020 Shass Mountain landslide; (8) Deputy Neale Richmond - to discuss plans to expand Operation Citizen and high-visibility policing to combat antisocial behaviour; (9) Deputies Louise O'Reilly, Mark Ward, Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, Chris Andrews, R&eacute;ada Cronin and Darren O'Rourke - to discuss the need to urgently address chronic service delivery problems with Go-Ahead Ireland; (10) Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan - to discuss the Owenahincha wastewater treatment infrastructure; (11) Deputy Pauline Tully - to discuss issues of concern with the home care grant scheme for older people; (12) Deputy Thomas Gould - to discuss the barriers to housing facing those recently entered into recovery from addiction; (13) Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill - to discuss with the Minister for Justice the funding for domestic violence services in budget 2023; (14) Deputies Paul McAuliffe and Cormac Devlin - to discuss the Go-Ahead Ireland bus service in Dublin and ongoing issues with provision and reliability of bus services in Dublin; (15) Deputy Bernard J.

Regarding the First Home scheme, I am very pleased to see that the number of people registered across the State is nearly 1,700, with 423 certificates issued.  That is progress but, obviously, something has to be done differently in respect of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, where we do not come within that bracket because of the way house prices are there.  When the Minister introduced the scheme, he committed to a review of it after six months.  I am using this opportunity to remind him of that and to look for specific change that recognises the peculiar difficulties in D&uacute;n Laoghaire in that we just do not come within the scheme as it is.  Obviously, there are people there who would very much like to avail of the scheme, so I am just putting that on the radar again.<\/p>  <p>  The second matter relates to fire defects and apartments.  I am sure the Minister's office, like mine, has received a very considerable influx of correspondence from homeowners affected by apartment defects.  In my area, this issue has arisen in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, St. Gabriel's, Granitefield Manor and Cabinteely.  This was in advance of the working group report published back in July, but the issue has still arisen since then.  I think the Minister is aware of the practical issues faced by these homeowners and the impact on families in particular.  These apartments cannot necessarily be insured, moved on or sold, even if the family has outgrown the apartment.  The family of one gentleman in my constituency has expanded and they need more space, but he cannot sell the apartment, given its current condition and the uncertainty around resolving that.  I know that the Government has committed to addressing this, but what is the update on that?  Obviously, it is not within the budget and is a separate mechanism, but we need clarity on how that will be addressed not just for prospective buyers but also for those who have already rectified the issue on their own at huge expense.  Can any retrospective measure be introduced in that regard?  I urge the Minister to continue to make the remediation of fire defects in apartments a priority and to provide homeowners with an update where possible.<\/p>  <p>  The other thing I want to highlight relates to the overall rental crisis.  I acknowledge the Government's efforts in respect of tenants and additional supports for them.  I was disappointed not to see greater support for landlords.  I know that has been an unfashionable thing to say over recent years, but there are people coming around to the fact that there are two sides to every market and that we must keep landlords and, especially, small landlords - I have seen Deputies from People Before Profit refer to accidental landlords - in the market if there is to be a broad rental sector.  I acknowledge the change in respect of pre-letting expenses but I am referring to the tax treatment generally.  A landlord can write off, for example, a new bed or a new couch only over eight years, whereas the lifetime of that product in a regular rental apartment is four to six years.  As for capital expenditure, if a landlord invests in a property - for example, in a new bedroom, a new bathroom, a new kitchen or any other of those sorts of normal capital expenditures - he or she can claim that back tax-wise only on the sale of the property.  However, all that does is encourage landlords to sell properties.  There are many landlords who have been in the market for many years and who would like to remain there, and it is disappointing not to have seen more done on that side to try to keep those landlords in the market.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to refer to some of the planning changes.  I note the report today in the media by Savills which says the planning framework is out of date.  I have to question some of these comments by property interests in that regard.  I hear these questions about whether it was appropriate to dezone lands, much of which were on floodplains, and to concentrate activity in areas of the city.  I think there is something of a value play going on in that sector at the moment, and I think the sector would be better off focusing on how to commence the many thousands of apartments and dwellings in my constituency that have planning permission and actually deliver the housing rather than pointing to some unspecified field in Kildare and saying, \"Zone it and we will build.\"  It would be better to see them building what they have already.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to highlight the under-resourcing which I think is there in the planning sector generally as well as how many people are working in planning and local authorities and how that sits comparatively.  My most recent figure is that the numbers compare to those in about 2007, but the Minister may have a correction.  I know that the strategic workforce plan is being done by the local government sector.  One cannot build without planners.  The fees have not increased either, as far as I am aware, since 2001, 21 years ago, and there is only really 16% cost recovery in the sector.  It is not sustainable and it is, I think, adding to planning difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  I think I am out of time, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, am I?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400037#KK00300","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1664907000,"counter":298,"content":"<p>You are spot on time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400037#KK00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1664907000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>May I make just one further small point?

Contract posts are an issue in local authorities and one to which I will return another day.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing housing supply and delivering sustainable and affordable homes for people is the Government's top priority but the collapse of the private rental market is a huge concern.  This market is not going to recover in the short to medium term so market intervention is needed.  While the introduction over the past 12 months of three schemes, namely the First Home scheme, the local authority affordable purchase scheme and the revised local authority home loan scheme to support the purchase of affordable homes, is really welcome, we need to do a lot more.  It is vital that local authorities are allowed to make more acquisitions in 2023 to take some pressure off.  The Department needs to speed up the approval process for social housing projects and procurement, SHPP, the capital assistance scheme, CAS and the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, and speed up payments to the local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  I am particularly concerned by the lack of emergency accommodation, especially for victims of domestic violence.  Carlow does not yet have a refuge.  We have some safe homes provided by the local authority, which I welcome, but we do not have enough.  We have a two-family emergency accommodation unit but only one family is being housed in it at the moment because of Covid.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to speak about legislation that needs to be changed.  Currently local authorities cannot implement regulation 49 for people in social housing and need an approved housing body, AHB, to manage them.  There is no such thing as a temporary licence.  AHBs deal with RTB houses and they are the sensible model for that in terms of looking after it.  This kind of accommodation is so important.  What steps are being taken with regard to regulation 49?  I ask the Minister to respond on that.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister told the House today about 282 tenancies under the Housing First programme.  That programme needs to be extended and expanded because the current numbers are very low.  When we talk about supporting the most vulnerable, we must also see local authorities providing resources for Traveller liaison offers, TLOs.  We must also see an extension to the repair and leasing scheme in 2023.  I suggest that the acquisition ceiling limit for houses that require special adaptation grants be increased.  The energy efficiency programme requires better funding and I would like to see the removal of the fuel-poverty-provided funding for self-help grants.<\/p>  <p>  These are all major issues that, if addressed quickly, would play a significant role in enabling local authorities to provide housing faster.  Information is also an important issue.  I also want to ask the Minister about modular buildings which I have brought up several times in this Chamber.  I have introduced the Minister to various companies but I have had no feedback on this.  We need to see as many houses built as possible, as quickly as possible and modular housing can be a short-term, if not a long-term solution.  The modular method allows for the building of a lot of houses quickly and I ask the Minister to come back to me on that.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I want to reference the 10% concrete product levy announced in the budget.  I have had hundreds of phone calls about it from people who are building their first house, from farmers and many others.  I do not think there is a group that has not contacted me.  It is a huge concern and I ask that we look at it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400038#LL00100","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1664907600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I was listening to the debate in my office earlier.  One would think that this Government has built no houses but the reality is that 54,000 new homes have been brought into the system and we have provided over 9,000 social houses last year.  I very much welcome last week's extension of the grant for vacant and derelict houses to rural areas.  That will be beneficial in creating more supply.  My office has had numerous inquiries about that since it was announced.<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise a few issues that affect rural counties like Tipperary, which I serve, and highlight some problems that we have.  Some of the problems that rural counties have might be overlooked when we focus on the large urban centres.  While I was in my office I heard Deputy Boyd Barrett referring to a particular case in Nenagh.  I was talking to that lady today on the phone.  Tonight she is in a tent with her two children and her husband.  That is absolutely intolerable in a country like ours.  The threshold for housing support in Tipperary has not been raised.  The thresholds were raised in a number of counties in the recent past but Tipperary was overlooked.  With rents climbing the way they are at present, people who are on low incomes who are not entitled to housing support are not able to afford anywhere to rent.  That is the situation that this lady, her two children and her husband find themselves in tonight.  I urge the Minister to lift the threshold for housing support in Tipperary immediately.  I suggest that the figure should be &euro;35,000 for housing support so that people are able to afford the rents that are increasing rapidly.  Landlords are leaving the rental market and in the majority of cases, when the tenants of those houses come to me, they do not qualify for housing support and are finding it extremely difficult to access rental accommodation.  Help is needed there.<\/p>  <p>  The limit for Tipperary under the First Home shared equity scheme has been set at &euro;250,000 which is just not feasible in the context of the price of second-hand houses and the cost of building.  A ceiling of &euro;250,000 is too low and this scheme will not work in Tipperary as it stands.  The threshold needs to be lifted to &euro;300,000 if the scheme is to work in my county.  On the affordable housing fund, the county council has made representations to the Minister for three towns in the county, Thurles, Nenagh and Clonmel.  Affordable housing funding must be available for all three towns.  At the moment, we are outside that scheme but affordable housing is so badly needed in the county.  I urge the Minister to look at that to see what can be done.<\/p>  <p>  The next point I want to make relates to one-off housing.  The Tipperary county development plan was finalised in the last couple of months but instead of making it easier to build one-off housing, it has made it more difficult.  A lot of people have the ability to build houses in rural areas but the county development plan is being imposed on them.  Sight lines are now being determined by the width of the road.  I was with a man the other evening who told me the council is seeking a sight line of 110 metres because of the width of the road.  It is impossible for him to get that so he is not going to be able to build on the only suitable site he has.  Obstacles are being put in the way of people who want to build one-off houses in rural areas.  The county development plans have to come under scrutiny by the Minster.  We have to recognise that some people want to build houses in rural areas.  Obviously, safety has to be a concern but the way that the sight lines have been revised in the county development plan in Tipperary means that it will be much more difficult for people to get planning permission to build one-off houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400038#LL00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1664907600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Record house prices, record rent costs, record and growing levels of homelessness and the lowest home ownership rates in Ireland for generations; whatever spin the Minister wants to put on it, that is the legacy of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il housing policies in action.  Not content with creating a financial crash precipitated by a property bubble, they somehow managed to emerge from that crash with a housing crisis which, in turn, has become a housing emergency.  This was not an accident.  It happened because of a concerted strategy to make homes a commodity, to move away from the building and purchasing of houses by local authorities to a reliance on the private sector and a demonisation of those who need housing support.<\/p>  <p>  I have told the story previously of how, in 1990, my own family's lives were changed forever and for the better when we were allocated a council house.  We did not get a free house - nobody did.  Council tenants paid rent relative to their income and if circumstances changed, they purchased their home with a discount based on the number of years they were renting.  The funds from that purchase could then be used by the council to purchase another home.  It was a system that worked.  It created vibrant communities and a positive housing market.  Those who could purchase their own homes privately could do so at affordable rates and those who needed to rent could do so without seeing their entire income eaten away.<\/p>  <p>  I still recall that moment in the early 2000s when, as a local councillor, I contacted my town clerk to inform them that a house in the estate I grew up in was up for sale.  Up until that point, that house would immediately have been bought by the council but in this instance, the Department responsible for housing, under a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, refused the council permission to purchase and the house was purchased by a private landlord.  In the years since, the State has paid, via rent subsidies, many multiples of the cost that would have been involved in buying the house in the first place.<\/p> <p>The Government provided free houses all right, but it provided them to private vested interests.  The premise of this scandalous strategy remains.  Dismally low income limits prevent working families from accessing any housing supports.  So-called affordable housing is not affordable.  In counties like Monaghan, the Government is not even pretending to provide it.  Even if the Government reached any of its pathetic targets, we would still expect tens of thousands of people to remain locked into the private rental market.  The solution, in a nutshell, is to build public homes.  It is the only solution but this Government does not seem to have the political capacity to deliver it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400038#LL00300","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664908200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I would like to ask the Minister about the recent housing review published last week in the middle of the budget.  There are only five counties where the threshold for social housing was increased.  Surely the thresholds must be revised as soon as possible, considering the substantial rise in rents and property and the cost-of-living crisis the country faces now and into the near future, with inflation predicted to run close to 8%.  In Wexford, rents have risen by 14.7% and housing prices have increased by 70%.  In my constituency office, we hear every day from people who are marginally over the threshold - in some cases they are only &euro;1,000 to &euro;3,000 over it.<\/p><p>I will refer to a woman called Mary &ndash; that is not her real name - who worked hard to save and put herself through college, through part-time bar or restaurant work.  She has one child and works in children's mental health.  She did some extra hours last year due to heavy demand.  However, this year her hours were cut and her landlord put her rent up by &euro;200 per month.  Due to the fact that her earnings from last year put her over the limit, she cannot qualify for HAP or social housing.  She is now on far less money each week, has more rent to pay and still has to feed and look after her child.  Mary said she is seriously considering giving up her job altogether.<\/p><p>A couple were on the minimum wage and paying their way, but both lost their jobs and cannot afford their rent.  They were never in receipt of HAP or any other assistance or rent relief.  They do not qualify for social housing because their earnings in the previous year were above the threshold.  They are facing homelessness with four children and nowhere to go.  These examples are just the tip of the iceberg, and I am sure many Deputies in this House can supply many cases like those I have just described.  <\/p><p>The simple fact is that people on average wages only have what they earn in a given week.  That is why we need to change the current criteria and increase the threshold to cover what people were earning within the last three months of the current year.  Just as energy companies are promising to place a moratorium on disconnections, a moratorium on evictions should be enforced, in particular in the winter months, just as was done during the pandemic.  There should also be a freeze on rent increases.  Other European countries do this, and we should do the same.<\/p><p>We need an enlarged tenant <i>in situ<\/i>scheme.  Local authorities must be given the capital to buy the properties of existing tenants.  Acquisitions must be increased.  Such an approach offers solutions that are immediate and saves money in the long term because it does not require planning permission or new builds and reduces the carbon footprint.  Finally, homelessness in my county has increased by 113%.  We need a winter ban on evictions now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400039#MM00200","speaker":"1621"},{"type":"speech","time":1664908200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I had to pinch myself to see whether Housing for All was reality or fiction.  Between 2016 and 2021, some &euro;1.877 billion was paid in HAP and &euro;896 million was paid in RAS, but the State does not own any of the properties it has paid for.  It has not supplied any houses to make sure people are secure.  Landlords are leaving the market and the Government has done nothing about it.  It is failure after failure.  Even when a person has lived in local authority house for years and is now in a position to buy the house, he or she is not allowed to do so because the rules of the scheme state that the person has to show that a wage is coming into the house.  People want to provide for their sons or daughters and leave them a house, and are in a position to do so, but the State will not allow them to do this.<\/p>  <p>  Another staggering figure is the number of hidden homeless adults who can no longer afford to live outside of the family home.

I have been beating the drum for some time on the delivery of an affordable housing scheme, in all Mayo's main towns, following our exclusion from the national affordable housing five-year delivery plan, despite the existing problems.  I welcome Mayo County Council's recent submissions to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for an affordable housing scheme in Westport, comprising 11 three-bed units and two two-bed apartments.

It is a testament to where the council's priorities lie.  We need to get to a point at which the Oireachtas, which underpins the development of State money, holds local authorities to account on houses and decisions and works with councillors in this regard.  There can be no excuse for local authorities not to live up to what is required or lead the way on building houses, both social and affordable.<\/p> <p>We need to start policing the delivery by local authorities and chief executives, who should be held to account and appear before the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.

I welcome the new qualifying criteria under the Cro&iacute; Conaithe (towns) scheme, which supports the provision of additional housing in rural areas as well as urban ones.  That was something we brought to the Minster of State's attention numerous times.  The response to this initiative has been positive.  The &euro;30,000 grant for the refurbishment may not go far enough to incentivise applicants and I would like this doubled to &euro;60,000 in time.

It is reported the accommodation at these locations is mainly occupied by women and children but they are sharing it with men.  There are poor facilities, few controls and little supervision.  I ask the Minister of State to examine that as a matter of urgency.  It was reported today on our local radio and in the local paper.<\/p>  <p>  The ambition the Minister has for fulfilling the policies and dealing with the issue of housing does not seem to be shared by local authorities.  They fall far short of what their performance should or could be and there are a number of areas I can point to on that.  In County Carlow, a housing estate that has been constructed is currently having to go for planning permission again and it has been suggested to the new developer that he would have to demolish 14 houses to complete the site.  How does the Minister of State justify that in the face of a housing crisis?  What kind of headline does that set for those who are looking for houses and want to get off the streets, off a sofa or get in some way onto the housing ladder?  A housing site has been zoned in Kilkenny to take, say, 100 houses and 50 are complete with infrastructure there to take 100.  A road was completed and handed to Kilkenny County Council and now it has dezoned that land and, therefore, the site cannot be completed.  Those living on the half of the site that is completed and occupied are now demanding that the part of estate yet to be completed be given planning permission and moved ahead.  Those are just two examples of the disconnect between the Minister's ambition and the local authority in question.<\/p>  <p>  Small changes could be made.  There was a successful social housing programme in years when we could not afford it.  The councils took charge of it, they built the houses and they were responsible for procurement.  However, nowadays you have to go to the council for everything.  If you are transferring from one house to the other you have to get permission.  The council has to get permission to refurbish that house due to the cost and so on.  There are many other blockages of red tape and bureaucracy that could easily be removed if the council was given the permission to fulfil its own needs.  Councils are the holders of all the information on all the types of houses that are needed.  As other speakers have indicated is the case in other areas, a person cannot get a four-bedroom house from the local authority in Kilkenny and, therefore, the housing needs of that cohort cannot be fulfilled.  The planning of all this needs to be streamlined.  The Minister of State needs to give direction on the planning process and the delivery of these houses.<\/p>  <p>  The An Bord Plean&aacute;la scandal has not helped us, nor has the 10% levy or the fact that there illegal quarries that we may yet have to pay for because they are continuing to supply materials through the chain of delivery for the construction of houses and roads.  That needs to be examined.  I ask the Minister of State to look at these issues carefully and bring forward some sort of plan that will resolve it.<\/p>  <p>  Last of all, Irish Water continues to be a blocker of all developments.  It is preventing houses from being delivered in Bennettsbridge, Gowran, Paulstown and other villages in County Kilkenny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400041#OO00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1664909400,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  \"Housing for All\" is the wrong title because it would be more accurate and honest to say \"no housing for a substantial number of people\" and in particular, the 10,805 people who are homeless.  That is 7,585 plus 3,220, giving a total of 10,805.  It is important to read these figures out to the Minister of State because these are people who are homeless.  As I have asked repeatedly, and at the risk of boring him with repetition, at what point does the Government say our housing policy is not working?  Will it be 11,000 homeless or 15,000?  I wonder what figure will give the Government cause for reflection because it has not happened yet.<\/p>  <p>  Today in Galway city, homeless people being accommodated in bed and breakfasts must leave them at a particular hour, stay out all day and come back at 6 in the evening.  I understand in a number of premises no visitors are allowed.  This is what we are doing to people.  On top of that, I am reliably informed the council is saying its homeless accommodation is full.  If it was an exception I would understand but this is a direct result of the Government's policy and the previous Government's policy.  I had 17 years as a city councillor and from 2009, no local authority houses were built, full stop.  Shortly after that, the then Government brought in HAP, told us there was no other game in town and proceeded to house people in private accommodation on taxpayers' money, plus a top-up payment.  It used to be an under-the-counter payment and then it was a top-up payment.  The Government privatised the system of housing.  That is what it did.  The Government is putting more than &euro;1 billion into HAP alone.  Every time I stand up here heads are shaking as if we have an ideology.  I believe housing is a fundamental right.  Without shelter and security of tenure, you cannot participate in society.<\/p> <p>It is difficult even to be healthy with the constant moving and insecurity.  Let us look at some of the Government's own targets.  Nearly two thirds of all local authority home loans have been declined since the scheme opened at the start of the year.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the Housing Agency found that by 2021, the agency's completed acquisitions figure was 868 residential units, 54% of its target.  What does the Government do?  It continues with schemes that are actively bolstering the market.  Let us look at its very favourable help-to-buy scheme and the review that it did not publish until it had made the announcement.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe scheme promotes demand for new housing in a market where the problems that exist are unequivocally supply restraints.  [Let us look at this]  There are weaknesses in the help to buy scheme [the report authors are trying to help the Government with this very awkward sentence] and it cannot be concluded that it is sufficiently efficient to represent good value for money.  Consequently, we conclude that it should be withdrawn ... A rational approach would not design this scheme as it currently exists. <\/blockquote> <p>It cost &euro;200 million alone this year.  It is going to exceed &euro;1 billion from the time it was brought in.  It is helping those who are richer and do not need a deposit.  All of that is set out.  The Minister then takes the one sentence where it says the Government cannot do away with it now, it has to renew it for two years because it has become too big to fail.  It is embedded with the other policies that are bolstering the market.  What we need is public housing on public land along with many other changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400041#OO00300","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664910000,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I draw the attention of the Minister of State to proposals for a renewed repair and lease scheme that Simon Communities Ireland launched last Thursday.  It states that Housing for All has set out low targets for the delivery of properties under the repair and lease scheme with only 130 units envisioned for 2023.  Simon Communities Ireland proposes that a target of 5,000 vacant units in 2023 and again in 2024 be set, with the potential for review in 2025.  These homes would increase the social housing supply.  Each local authority would have individual minimum targets.  They go on to explain how it can be implemented.  I ask that the Minister of State bring that to the attention of the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All is not going to resolve the housing crisis and disaster we have been in in recent years.  In 1946, 26% of Irish households rented their homes from a private owner.  By 1991 that figure was down to 8%.  By then, most people who paid rent for their homes did so to their local authority, benefiting from reasonably well-regulated construction - not the thousands of homes that are now facing fire and building defects built during the Celtic tiger era - security of tenure, and protection from arbitrary increases.  This social contract was ripped up.  What Government ever sought a mandate to tear it to shreds?  No Government ever did.  The State, in effect Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, decided to bring back 19th century landlordism to reshape Ireland as a nation beholden to private property owners.  A recent ESRI report tells us that fewer than 20% of Irish people born in the 1950s or 1960s lived in rented accommodation in their mid-30s.  For those born in the 1970s this rises to just over 30%.  For those born in the 1980s it is more than 40%.  These figures are mirrored on the other side by a dramatic decline in homeownership among young people.  More than 60% of those born in the 1960s lived in a home they or their partner owned by the age of 30, whereas the comparable figure for those born in 1970 was 39% and for those born in the early 1980s it is 32%.<\/p>  <p>  The immediate symptom of the crisis is the increase in rents.  They have doubled in the past decade.  In Dublin, they are now 52% above the peak of the Celtic tiger era.  There are now 10,805 people in emergency accommodation.  This is the eighth consecutive month where the number of people accessing emergency accommodation has risen.  Some 3,220 are children, which means nearly three children become homeless day.  That is the reality for a lot of families.  We see it in our own constituency office.  Other Deputies have referred to it as well.  Emergency accommodation is practically full.  The hubs are full as well.  We had a young mother in our office the other day with her two-year-old child who is sofa surfing.  She is on HAP and cannot find accommodation.  She is very distressed.  Notices to quit and long-term living without a home are causing major stress.  Sam McGuinness from Simon Communities Ireland stated, \"The picture is ominous as we face into the cold, dark winter months ahead and no real clarity or hope in Budget 2023 to support exits out of homelessness.\"  Again, regarding public housing on public land, we have enough rezoned land to build 100,000 public houses over the next period and that has been the case for the past four years.  The Government is not resolving the crisis.  It is just not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400042#PP00200","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1664910000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Given that I have only two minutes, I will be brief and to the point.  The Minister and those on the Government benches can trumpet all the aspirational figures they want.  The stark reality is these targets are not being met and will not be met.  This plan is failing and will continue to fail.  It is failing primarily because it is built on a foundation of sand that is the Government&rsquo;s hard right-wing ideological belief that the market will provide, a blatant fallacy that time and time again has produced the same failed result, yet Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party remained wedded to it.  It must be some political form of Stockholm syndrome.<\/p>  <p>  At a recent meeting with Donegal County Council we were told that while they have a target of 878 housing units by 2026, their realistic output will leave them approximately 30% short of this figure.  They are hamstrung by the inability to fund appropriate land purchases.  The latest Housing for All quarterly report noted that in Donegal since its inception, AHBs have had no funding whatsoever approved.  I raised the issue of the financial matrix that is constraining AHBs in rural counties such as Donegal with the Taoiseach in March this year.<\/p>  <p>  Nothing has been done.  Since the budget last week, I have been inundated with calls from across the constituency from those near the income thresholds for social housing asking were they going to be kicked off the list.  Did the Government even consider this at all during its budget preparations?  Were the Ministers hoping it would be missed and that they would get to skim another raft of people off the list and claim it as a policy victory?  If they shorten the list, surely they are having success in providing housing.  The Government has increased the thresholds for only five of 31 local authorities last month.  There was not rhyme or reason as to how this decision was arrived at.  The Government does not know the true scale of the crisis because it does not want to know.  All the fancy infographics in the world will not change that.  The reality is that if the Government increases the social welfare figures, it is going to throw people off the list.  Is it going to change that?  Maybe it should announce now that people will not be removed from the list.  Unfortunately, I believe they will be and that will be a success as far as the Government is concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400042#PP00300","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1664910000,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies for making contributions in this important debate.  I have no doubt that no Deputy in this House, Government or Opposition, underestimates the gravity of the current housing challenge that is presented throughout all our communities.  All Members have family and friends who are feeling this acute crisis throughout the country that we are trying to respond to.  As a constituency Deputy doing clinics on a weekly basis, I too hear the frustrations of my constituents who are in very difficult situations trying to resolve housing solutions in a sustainable way for them and their families.  That is why our resolve to unlock this crisis is right across government and backed up by a &euro;4 billion multi-annual plan, a plan that has 213 actions trying to ensure that our State ramps up capacity and delivers much-needed sustainable homes right into our community.<\/p>  <p>  The evidence is there.  The hope is there for communities throughout the country.  Some 25,000 homes have been completed in the past year, with 28,000 homes currently under construction and new planning permissions, which have improved in the past year, for 44,000 homes.  Commencements are an on upward trajectory right across the economy, which is the evidence that communities can look at.  People can see builders in their communities delivering homes that are so much needed in all sectors, both public housing and private housing, which is so essential for our economy.  We have gone from the third lowest in the EU for house completions right into the top five.  That shows the significance of the improvements being made across our economy.<\/p> <p>Looking after the most vulnerable, as I do in my portfolio in the area of Traveller accommodation, we are hopefully, for the third year in a row, on the cusp of spending all our capital budget.  We will have a significant increase next year of 10%, which is vital for the communities I work with.  We continue to implement the expert review across government, ensuring we have a delivery mechanism &ndash; our programme board &ndash; to watch as a guardian over the 31 local authorities to ensure delivery.<\/p> <p> Viability is a key part of Government as we try to ensure that the many planning permissions granted throughout the State are unlocked and activated in order that communities feel the benefit.  Across this Government and the previous one, we have provided record funding for the urban regeneration and development fund to support our cities and regional towns to ensure compact and sustainable growth as we face a huge climate challenge.  Homes are being made viable for the private sector to unlock.  <\/p> <p> Our zoned land tax is being legislated for through the Finance Act and mapping processes are under way in the local authorities to ensure the days of speculating, sitting on and hoarding zoned land come to an end.  A significant taxation tool is coming down the line to ensure that communities feel the benefit of houses being delivered.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund is also to assist with viability, with which the majority of the Opposition disagrees, in rural towns throughout the country.  This will bring derelict and vacant homes back into use to support local towns and ensure schools can hold on to an extra teacher, GAA clubs can flourish and local shops can be kept open.  This is building sustainable communities, which is important.  We will shortly have the heads of Bill to provide for land value capture and sharing, another mechanism to ensure the State gets the value of the uplift from development gain through increasing property prices.<\/p> <p> These are radical measures that this Government is taking to try to tackle the housing crisis.  We will continue to see the benefit of all those mechanisms in the supply of new houses.  In addition, we have a vacant homes tax and ready-to-build scheme, which give people options. <\/p> <p> Many Deputies spoke about rural planning and the challenges that some communities face in that regard.  We can see from the rates that 85% of all rural planning applications are approved.  However, the Government is giving options.  If people cannot meet the threshold, they will have an opportunity to get a serviced site in their town or on its periphery and have that option to build their forever home.  That is what this Government is about - activating planning permissions and ensuring that communities have a chance to get sustainable tenancies.<\/p> <p> Believe me, every single week in my clinic I hear the voices of vulnerable people who are looking for communities.  I tell people every week in my home town of Mullingar that hundreds of new social homes are currently under construction.  I can point out to people who are frustrated and feeling the pain that in their community there are builders on site delivering new social homes.  There is a huge amount of hope that their problem will be resolved.  While I appreciate it is difficult in the short term, the hope is there.<\/p> <p> I will turn to what the Opposition, particularly Sinn F&eacute;in, is proposing to resolve this crisis.  I have heard the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, state in many television and radio debates that he could deliver 20,000 new public homes next year.  Notwithstanding the huge issues we have with capacity, we have 167,000 construction workers now working across the economy.  Notwithstanding the changes in supply chains following the war in Ukraine and other issues that have arisen as we try to grapple with price increases, Sinn F&eacute;in's silver bullet for increasing residential property building is to increase commercial stamp duty by 66%.  What does that do for the vital resources that make up the cake that runs our economy and builds all those social homes?  It stops enterprise, business expansion and farmers seeking to expand our agri-industry.  It stops all those key employers that are generating the resources this country so badly needs.  The Opposition will increase stamp duty by 66% to stop all that.  At a time of crisis, when this Government is trying to encourage landlords to stay in the marketplace and we know that 85% of landlords own either one or two homes, Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s answer is to charge an extra &euro;400 per unit through taxation.  It wants to tax small landlords more as they leave the marketplace.  That is the answer from the Opposition.<\/p> <p> We saw that the rent tax credit was totally unfunded in Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget.  Again, it is basing targets on the pricing strategies of 2021 when so much has changed.  We need to look hard when we are trying to offer solutions.  Sound bites can look good on social media as people look in.  However, the raw evidence is that Sinn F&eacute;in is trying to slow down an economy and almost bring it to a halt.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has been asked many times on national television how proposes to take construction workers from the commercial sector.  Doing that comes at a significant price.<\/p> <p> We have to try to continue to ramp up construction for all society and ensure completions remain on an upward trajectory.  We need to look at the evidence in our communities where builders are on site delivering high-quality A-rated homes to the best regulation now right across our country in a plan-led environment.  We have the right homes going into the right locations for the first time ever in this State.  We are getting away from the past when we had more than 10 million homes zoned and no infrastructure aligned to zoning.  We are now in a very good plan-led place.  I appreciate that it is frustrating for a cohort in society for whom we are trying to unlock this. <\/p> <p> I repeat that the evidence is there and we have to stick the course.  Across government, we will ensure that people get much sought-after homes and the opportunity of realising their dream, their rightly-held aspiration to own their own home.  That is what this Government is about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400042#PP00400","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Defective Concrete Products Levy: Motion [Private Members]","time":1664910600,"counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400043#QQ00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1664910600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \t&quot;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:  \tbelieves that: <blockquote> \t&mdash; the Defective Concrete Products Levy being proposed by the Government is badly designed and unacceptable; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; it means that the people in homes with defects, and first-time buyers, will foot the bill through increased house prices, as has been recognised by the Economic and Social Research Institute; <\/blockquote>notes the assertion by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland that this will add &euro;4,000 to the price of a house; and <br \/><br \/>calls on the Government to: <blockquote> \t&mdash; hold those most responsible for defects to account; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; introduce a defects levy focused on the banks, profits of big developers and those who were responsible for the defects.&quot; <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>As the House knows, tonight tens of thousands of people - homeowners, private rental tenants and social rental tenants - will sleep in defective homes.  We now have defective blocks in 13 counties across the State.  According to an independent report commissioned by the Government, we also have as many as 100,000 apartments, duplexes and houses with significant fire safety, balcony and water ingress defects.<\/p><p>The problem is that the party of the current Minister for Finance has always been exceptionally slow to respond.  It took several years of campaigning by homeowners affected by pyrite in Leinster before we eventually got a pyrite scheme.  It took several years and one death in Priory Hall before Fine Gael moved to redress those issues.  It took much longer and greater campaigning by homeowners in Donegal, Mayo, Clare and elsewhere, as well the Construction Defects Alliance, before we finally got some movement on those areas as well.<\/p><p>The problem, of course, is that there are still very significant issues with defective blocks.  The relevant legislation is not fit for purpose and needs to change.  We have not yet had sight of a scheme for people with apartments, duplexes and homes affected by wider Celtic tiger era defects.  In fact, the recent announcement by the Minister for Housing, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, indicates that there may be no scheme for those homeowners until the middle or latter end of next year, with no possibility of redress funding until 2024 at the earliest.<\/p><p>While many people were looking to budget 2023 for greater progress, there was deep disappointment.  One of the small facts that was missed in much of the budget debate is that the Government&rsquo;s own contribution to funding for defects has only been increased by &euro;5 million and there is, as I said, no scheme for others.<\/p><p>On top of that, the Government has taken an eminently sensible idea and is making an absolute mess of it.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in has always said, and will continue to say tonight, that industry has to make a contribution towards the cost of remediation.  On the basis of the estimates of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and those of the independent report on building defects, we could be looking at a figure of &euro;4 billion to &euro;5 billion for remediation alone.  Therefore, industry, particularly those most responsible, has to pay.  The problem, however, is that the Government is applying a very high levy to a very narrow section of the construction industry and to products.  That will result in very significant increases, particularly for those who already have to pay extra to remediate their own homes in Donegal, Mayo and elsewhere and those who are building their own homes, who are responsible for 20% of all new home completions.  Regarding small and medium-sized building contractors, who both Ministers know are already struggling to remain viable, an extra 10% on the price of core materials will push them over the edge and some out of business.<\/p> <p> The problem is that it does not have to be like this.  There are better ways to approach this levy.  Based on our knowledge of other jurisdictions, we have long argued that a levy should be applied much more broadly, not to one sector or group of products but right across industry, from quarries and block manufacturers to construction companies.  Second, it should focus on profits.  It should focus, in particular, on those companies and corporations with very significant and growing profits that have the ability to pay and absorb the increased cost without passing it on to the consumer.<\/p> <p> The Government completely leaves out construction companies and ignores banks, both of which contributed to the crisis and are profiting from it.  There has been no discussion of non-life-insurance industries.  We firmly believe it is possible to construct an industry contribution, a scheme, through legislation and negotiation with industry that would allow for a significant amount of additional revenue on top of the &euro;200 million we believe the Government should be putting towards the remediation of defects annually, not the &euro;65 million committed to by the Government for next year.  In particular, the focus should be on those who should and can pay and who, if the Government acted appropriately, would pay.<\/p> <p> There is a better way to do this.  I am aware that the Minister for Finance is both reasonable and intelligent, so he should please not introduce a levy that will force homeowners in Donegal, Mayo and Clare to pay an extra 10% on top of the gap he has already left them with, amounting to tens of thousands of euro.  He should not have struggling buyers, including first-time buyers, footing the bill, and he should not jeopardise small and medium-sized building contractors.  He should listen to our advice, take on board our proposals and work with us and the industry to have a fair system to ensure the latter pays 100% of the redress cost for all homeowners and tenants living in defective buildings across the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400043#QQ00300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664911200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>On numerous occasions, I have engaged with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the role of the banks in contributing towards redress for the affected families in this scandal.  I recall one exchange with the Minister for Finance when the D&aacute;il was sitting in the Convention Centre Dublin when he looked puzzled that banks, the mortgage lenders whose assets would be reduced to zero with houses impacted by defective blocks, would have their assets restored to full market value with the help of the State and that the banks were not being asked to play any role in any of it.  Worse than that, they were not making a financial contribution.  They have not assisted families with restructuring their loans or even writing down debt.  I can speak with authority only about my own county, Donegal.  The role of the banks there has been absolutely shameful.  Right up to this moment, families who have needed help from their banks to navigate this crisis to rebuild their lives have not been helped, yet the Government is not proposing a levy on the banking sector to assist in this crisis.  He is not even asking the banks to help the families affected, based on a recent response I got from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  That is just shocking.<\/p>  <p>  Consider the pyrite scandals that have affected families in north Leinster and Dublin, and also the defective block crisis, which concerns pyrrhotite, mica and pyrite in counties in the west and a growing number of other counties.  It is estimated that 13 or 14 counties are now affected.  We must also consider the tens of thousands of people in houses, apartments and duplexes who were failed by the Celtic tiger owing to greed, recklessness and the consequent defects.  Not one person has been brought to account, and not one cent has been taken from the people who delivered the misery all across the country.  Nobody has been brought to book.  The Minister said last October that he would appoint a senior counsel to look at a public inquiry to learn the lessons from these scandals.  A recent response I got to a parliamentary question states the Minister has not only not appointed a senior counsel but that he has not even provided the terms of reference.  I talked to campaigners in Donegal in recent days and noted they had not been consulted on terms of reference.  Can Members imagine any other country tolerating such a devastating impact on so many families, costing the taxpayer billions of euro and with nobody brought to book or held to account?  Not even a senior counsel has been appointed and no terms of reference have been provided.  For God's sake, does the Government not understand the hurt and devastation that people have gone through all across this country, in almost every county, because of the greed and recklessness and the relationship between builders, manufacturers and those who were in government throughout all the years in question?<\/p>  <p>  It gets even worse.  At a meeting of the housing committee in July, we listened to evidence from the experts on the legislation the Government was introducing.  We learned from them that, right now, there are quarries that are continuing to manufacture defective concrete blocks.  For Christ's sake, it is happening even as we speak.  The Minister talks about the billions that remediation would cost the taxpayer and everything that has to be done but he is still allowing quarries to manufacture defective concrete blocks.  There is no accountability or contribution, and this still goes on today.<\/p>  <p>  In this debate and in response to the bad decision the Government has made on the concrete levy, I have been asked to plead with the Government to demonstrate by its actions that it will have zero tolerance for the recklessness in question, which has destroyed people's lives, will hold those responsible to account, end the misery delivered to people and afford to the latter 100% redress no matter where they live in this State.  This is the opportunity tonight.  It is not just about this foolish concrete levy; it is also about showing people that what happened will never happen again and that the taxpayer will not be exposed.  Moreover, it is about showing that families will not have their lives destroyed.  That is my plea tonight.

This is while apartment dwellers such as those in The Crescent, Park West, are being told to magic up &euro;15,000 within six weeks, out of a total of &euro;67,000, which is required to fix a fire-safety issue.  There are 232 dwellings in the complex and they are occupied by people in their 20s, 30s and 40s and their children.  There are tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of others who expect to hear about the same issues.  Many of them expected to hear good news in the budget speech, but there was no sight of a sense of urgency or the 100% redress scheme to address the State's scandalous failure of regulation.  As one woman said when faced with a crippling &euro;15,000 demand:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThese are life changing debts to put a person into.  Myself and my husband work full-time to pay our mortgage, childcare and support our 3 children.  We have NOTHING LEFT at the end of each month, we cannot afford these charges which are levied on us through no fault of ours. <\/blockquote>  <p>In the Bridgefoot Court social housing complex, Dublin 8, residents got a letter in June asking them not to use the balconies until further notice, or until remediation works have been carried out, as the decking may not support people.  Think of that, of the chaos that would cause up and down the country.  It is on the Minister's watch that this is happening and it is on his watch that no scheme has been put in place to help people to ensure redress for something that is not their fault.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400044#RR00300","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1664911800,"counter":326,"content":"<p>The defective concrete products levy proposed by the Government is badly designed and will have the effect of increasing costs to homeowners.

Just like the insurance levy, the people are being saddled with the bill for a levy that it seems is due to go on indefinitely.  That is the way most people I know are looking at this.  The levy will possibly add &euro;4,000 to the price of a house - that is not our calculation; it comes from the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland - and for what?

This levy should be put on the banks, the profits of big developers and those who are responsible for the defects.

In the midst of a housing crisis when the Government continually pays lip service to its plan to make housing affordable, it expects the public to believe the way to do that is to increase the price of the main ingredients - blocks and concrete.  It was not Sinn F&eacute;in that said this levy would raise the cost of houses; it was the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland.  It stated that the levy will increase the cost of a home by &euro;4,000.  Those seeking to buy a home or extend their agricultural buildings cannot be left to foot the bill because this Government is so focused on blaming the bricks and blocks instead of those who have responsibility.  That responsibility lies with the developers, the banks and the insurers.  That is where the focus of this levy needs to be.<\/p>  <p>  When Government backbenchers have been outside the walls of Leinster House, they have been beside themselves to criticise this levy.  They, too, see that it is fundamentally flawed.  I bet the price of one of those blocks, however, that they will come in here tomorrow and vote in favour of the Government.  It is another exercise in misinformation - of saying one thing but doing something else.

However, I have spoken to apartment owners at Lakepoint in Mullingar.  I have heard their concerns.  I have seen them physically break down in tears at the thought of having to foot a bill for something they had no part in creating; something that was completely outside their control to address.  What is being asked of these people is truly shameful.  They are not the professionals in this situation.  The professionals have run off into the wind - they closed the doors and reopened under another name a few days later.<\/p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the Government to step up here.

Let me begin by acknowledging the common ground that exists here this evening.  There is the fact that the families and homeowners who have been afflicted by the trauma of seeing their homes crumbling in front of their eyes due to malpractice and reasons and factors that are entirely beyond their control deserve a response and help from us and for the State to play a leading role in the rebuilding of their homes, where appropriate, and in the fixing of the defects in other cases.  That is what the Government is doing in bringing forward broad and comprehensive legislation, which was opposed by most of the Opposition, to try to address this issue.  It is beginning with funding and then putting the resources in place to get this work done in the parts of the country affected by all the harm that mica has done.<\/p><p>As some Opposition speakers acknowledged, however, there are many other issues in our past or yet to come that will merit and need a full Government response to help homeowners and tenants with the defects in their properties.  In the time ahead, the Government will have decisions to make in respect of other issues, such as apartment defects and how we support those who are living in homes that have been affected by other issues.<\/p><p>Where the common ground falters, however, is on the thornier difficulty of how, if the State is going to take on commitments of many billions of euro, that will be paid for.  How will we find the money to respond to the future commitments we have without deprioritising the many other things on which this House, society and the economy want the Government to make progress?<\/p> <p>I acknowledge that with any measure I bring forward, there are risks.  There are also risks in the proposals that have been brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in but the greater risk as a Parliament is to convince ourselves that we can make commitments regarding spending many billions of euro and assume for a moment that there are not trade-offs in that regard because at a point in time there may be a need to raise money to meet the future commitments we have for the citizens in our State who need a response from this State and this Government.  That is at the heart of this levy.<\/p> <p> I was very struck at hearing the first round of Opposition speakers from Sinn F&eacute;in and how little time they spent talking about the levy.  They raised very many other matters and issues of great importance in making progress on mica and in fulfilling the commitments we have to homeowners who want and need a response from the Government.  Many other Deputies touched on other issues which the Government will have to contend with and indeed offered views on the current mica redress scheme.<\/p> <p> We were a fair bit into the speech of Deputy &Oacute; Broin before he addressed the levy.  The other Opposition Deputies who spoke on this important motion this evening touched on and addressed many other issues in the contributions with less time focusing on the levy.  The reason for that is that the approach of the Opposition can be summed up here this evening by making the case and demanding that the State spend more on a cause and on issues that myself, the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, and the Government acknowledges we need to do more on and are doing more on, but the Opposition, and mainly Sinn F&eacute;in, is calling on the State to do more and for the Government to spend more, but is against a proposal to do that.<\/p> <p> I know that the retort from Sinn F&eacute;in will be that we are generally in favour of this, which I will come to in a moment, but are against the specifics.  The problem with that approach is that it is ever thus with Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is in favour of something generally but is always against the specifics of doing it.  I had hoped that it would be different given the fact that Deputy Doherty welcomed this levy on budget day.  I had also hoped that it would be different given the frequent Sinn F&eacute;in motions, including its most recent motion which called on the Government to: &ldquo;ensure the [construction industry] contributes to the overall cost of [fixing this]&rdquo;.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn called on the: &ldquo;industry [to contribute] to the overall cost of remediating defective properties.&rdquo;  There were many other points in time when that call was made.<\/p> <p> If one looks at the measure the Government has brought forward which has a target of raising &euro;80 million, we, of course, accept the risks that are there in that regard.  The independent assessment we have done on the impact of this on construction is very different to the figures that have been quoted this evening.  There is a potential cost of between &euro;800 and &euro;1,600 for a typical three-bedroomed detached house or &euro;750 to &euro;1,100 for a six-floor apartment block with a basement.  I acknowledge that there are still costs and risks but they are very different to the ones that we have heard in the public debate so far.  I emphasise again the point that the greater risk in all of this, with all of the commitments that the Government may yet need to make, is to suggest to the House or for the Opposition to indicate that we can make commitments for many billions of euro on issues that we want and need to make progress on, but to indicate that there are ways of paying for this that are not without risk or consequences.<\/p> <p> I listened for clues from Sinn F&eacute;in this evening on how one would do this.  On the one hand the party wants a bigger levy, one of &euro;200 million.  This is 2.5 times the size of what was proposed this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400045#SS00400","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664912400,"counter":331,"content":"<p>That is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400046#TT00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1664912400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>There will be ample opportunity on the part of Sinn F&eacute;in to clarify as the evening goes on.

Does it not think that our ability to get more banks and more investment into our country to build more homes is not always or could also be affected by the demand and the case that is made for more levies there?<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Sinn F&eacute;in called upon the insurers and said that they should be levied.  As the party knows, there are levies in place which they already pay.  These are the same insurance companies that we want to provide cheaper and more insurance to our State.  I am not saying for a moment nor would I ever indicate to the House that these options are not worth consideration and debate but I am saying that those proposals for a bigger and broader levy also pose many other risks.

First is not to commit the money to those who were affected by mica to make a difference to their homes and lives.

I look forward to hearing the views on this issue, particularly on the Finance Bill, and the views of the House on the measures that are being brought forward.  I go back to where I began.

These are people who are trying to get on to the property ladder to buy for the first time.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that this Government is putting this concrete block levy on them.  We have repeatedly told this Government that its policies increased the price of houses.  House prices are now at an all-time high in the history of the State and that has happened under the watch of this Government.

Under the Government&rsquo;s design, this 10% levy is directly passed on to young couples and individuals who have saved and borrowed to build their new home or are in the process of buying a new home or a new apartment.

For the record, our amendment states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t&quot;further calls on the Government to:<br \/><br \/>- replace the Defective Concrete Products Levy with a levy on profits derived from construction; and<br \/><br \/>- commit to the introduction in the Finance Bill 2022 of retrospective tax relief for those already carrying out remediation works on their homes.&quot; <\/blockquote>  <p>Like many, and we have heard it ventilated here this evening, the Labour Party is concerned about the proposal for an &euro;80 million levy on concrete products on the basis that this will inevitably push up the price of new homes.  We have already heard straight from the horse&rsquo;s mouth, as it were, that contractors across the country intend to pass on the value of the levy on blocks and other concrete products to their customers.  No ifs, no buts, no maybes - that is what they plan to do and it is frankly inevitable.  This is especially problematic at a time when hard-pressed, would-be first-time buyers are scrimping and saving for every cent they can get their hands on to get a deposit together.<\/p><p>House prices in my own constituency grew 7% in the third quarter of 2022.  That is considered to be a slowdown, so the language the industry uses is very interesting.  It is compared with record growth in recent years, growth that in fact was not even seen during the so-called Celtic tiger years.<\/p> <p>Wages certainly have not increased to the tune of 7% for most people.  When we speak about slowdowns, all it means is that the rate of increase is slowing down.  Greater value or affordability is not provided for customers.  I know many proud and hard-working people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who greeted the news of the levy last week and how it would impact on their ability to purchase their own homes with grave concern.  They were deflated.  It was another obstacle placed in their way.<\/p> <p> When we discuss how the remediation schemes, which we all want to see supported, ought to be levied, we have to agree that the most significant contribution of all must come from the construction sector.  There is no doubt about that.  We can see the consequences of the era of self-regulation - non-regulation, more appropriately - that was presided over for many years.  We can see the impact on families who have experienced the trauma of having mica in their properties or on householders across the country who are living with the consequences of apartment defects.  Their experiences are shocking and well documented and have been aired in the Chamber time and again on behalf of the people we represent.  I agree with the T&aacute;naiste, who has stated that the costs must be socialised in some way.  That is inevitable, but the costs should not be socialised while the profits continue to be privatised by rogue players in the construction sector.  That is why our preference is for a levy on profits, thereby minimising the risk to would-be homeowners of even more inflated prices.<\/p> <p> The apartment defect scandal has left more than 100,000 dwellings with serious fire defects.  With one or two exceptions, builders have walked away consequence-free from tackling the defective buildings that they have left behind them.  Unfortunately, owners of defective apartments cannot walk away.  They are living with fear, anxiety and insecurity every day.  The unnecessary risk to the health and safety of residents of apartments with fire safety defects, which was identified clearly by the report of the working group on defective homes, is becoming real.  The impact is clear for all to see.  We know the consequences of defects for insurance cover, which is a nightmare scenario, but there is more to this than the financial cost.  The human cost of having a home crumble and crack before your eyes is devastating.  Stress and anxiety levels among apartment owners have increased significantly due to the ongoing risk to their health and safety and the ongoing financial and insurance uncertainty.<\/p> <p> To date, the issue of defects has been consequence-free for the construction sector, but not for the owners.  In this context, the construction industry's recent concerns and calls for mobilisation against the levy would be amusing were the situation not so serious.  This is the same advocacy and lobby group that said nothing on the issue of defects until mid-July when the prospect of a levy loomed large.  It did not even bother to show up at the Oireachtas housing committee's hearing on defects in late 2020.  The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, owned HomeBond but has paid out nothing to owners of defective homes.  Suddenly, it now seems to care for consumers and the impact on the value of homes when a levy is being imposed on the industry.  No one should be fooled - the CIF has not cared one jot about the hundreds of thousands of people living in unsafe apartments, given its record to date.  Instead, the idea has been perpetuated that there are bad apples around the place.  This is the bad apples theory, according to which the sector as a whole should not be scapegoated for the actions of a few.  However, the bad apples theory does not wash when we consider the systemic nature of the apartment defects problem.  Between 1991 and 2013, approximately 100,000 apartments were affected, mainly by fire safety issues, due to shoddy workmanship and irresponsible work, regulation and enforcement, or the lack of regulation and enforcement in some cases.  The theory does not acknowledge the fact that well-known companies which are members of representative bodies are still trading despite being responsible for defects and doing nothing to help desperate owners.  They have not been forced to do anything to help owners either.  All of this is the result of poor self-regulation, shoddy workmanship and a culture of impunity that has existed within the sector for far too long.  This culture needs to change urgently, as must the law.  There need to be consequences for those who are responsible for apartment defects and for making and selling defective and deleterious materials.  There needs to be a great deal more stick and a little less carrot.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State should note what has happened in the UK as regards construction defects.  There, those firms that are responsible for defects are under threat of being refused permission to build and sell homes.  We understand that the majority of building firms have agreed to remediate defects in their own buildings and to contribute an additional &pound;5 billion immediately to a building safety fund and a further &pound;3 billion over the next ten years through a building safety levy.  UK builders refusing to co-operate are being hit with refusals of permission to build and sell homes.  This is important, as it stops them in their tracks.  They cannot develop and trade if they do not play ball.  Inspiration could be drawn from the UK scheme in how we approach this issue, particularly in the Department of Finance's consideration of the measures in the finance Bill that will give effect to any levy that may be introduced.<\/p> <p> In our recent alternative budget, we called for a 2% levy on profits, which would raise &euro;50 million per year and would go some way towards financing redress.  That levy would be on profits, not product, which is an important distinction.  This would minimise the risk of any fallout from the levy being passed on to potential first-time buyers.<\/p> <p> Our amendment seeks to ensure that those affected by the apartment defects scandal and the mica scandal are compensated and supported in respect of remediation work that they have already undertaken.  We have long supported the Construction Defects Alliance's call for a retrospective tax credit for owners.  This would allow essential repair works to continue or to commence immediately.  While it is disappointing that no provision was made for this tax credit in last week's budget announcement, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage indicated that funding would be available in 2023 for amelioration measures.  We look forward to seeing precisely what he means.  For example, will consideration be given to short-term measures that provide for security and fire wardens where there are apartment defects, as called for by the Construction Defects Alliance?<\/p> <p> If we have learned anything from this crisis, it is that kicking the can down the road will only lead to worse problems being stored for the future.  We must learn from the experience of all of these scandals and ensure those who are responsible are held accountable.  It cannot always be up to the State to step in and resolve issues that have been created by private industry.  Private industry is responsible and accountable and it must make a contribution, but one that is properly designed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400047#UU00600","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664913600,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Deputies Cian O'Callaghan and Cairns from the Social Democrats are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400048#VV00200","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1664913600,"counter":348,"content":"<p>\"The introduction of the 10% levy on all concrete products is the actions [sic] of a 'rogue' Government.\"  These are not my words, but the words of the chairperson of the International and Small Business Alliance, ISBA, Mr. Seamus Maye, who says that there is no excuse for quarries and concrete producers not being held to account for the mica building block crisis.  The Government is gung-ho about introducing this levy.  It is reasonable to ask where the same enthusiasm is for ensuring strong, robust and effective regulation of the building industry.  Why is there not the same enthusiasm for going after those responsible for defects?  Why is the Government not ensuring the accountability of developers and companies that have caused incredible stress and trauma to families who are living in homes that are falling apart and have other defects?  If half the effort that is being put into constructing the new levy were put into strong, effective and robust regulation, we might get out of this vicious circle of more and more levies being introduced because regulation is not done properly in this country.  It is reasonable to ask how many more levies will be introduced and will hit people who are not responsible for a regulation.  As has been referenced, we have a number of levies in place already.<\/p> <p>These include the Insurance Compensation Fund levy.  This was in place between 1984 and 1992, and then brought back in 2012 following the collapse of Quinn Insurance.  It is a 2% levy paid on all non-life insurance policies to fund the administration of Quinn Insurance.  We have also had the Motor Insurers Insolvency Compensation Fund, with a 2% levy on gross motor insurance premiums.  This is paid for by everybody getting motor insurance.  We also have the bank levy, of course, which is being renewed and extended to the end of this year, albeit with reduced annual yields.  Additionally, we have had the electricity levy, namely, the large energy user rebalancing subvention, which has cost households an average of &euro;480 since its introduction.  How many more levies are parties in this House going to suggest or impose on people facing huge costs?<\/p> <p> The Social Democrats do not support the Government's levy of 10% on concrete blocks.  We do not support the introduction of levies that do not hold those responsible to account but that place additional costs on people trying to buy homes.  We support those seeking to buy homes who are faced with exceptional affordability challenges that will be compounded by these levies.  We also support homeowners affected, through no fault of their own, by construction defects, including those caused by pyrite, mica, fire safety deficiencies, water ingress and other such defects.  We do not support any attempts to divide these groups of people who are all struggling to provide safe and secure homes for their families.  We do support maximum accountability for those responsible for defects and defective materials.<\/p> <p> Given the huge costs, financial and human, of building defects, it is unforgivable and inexplicable that we do not have sufficiently robust and independent regulation of the construction industry.  Why is the Government not pursuing those responsible?  In recent years, we have heard from the Government that it will go after those responsible, but not a single case has been taken by the State to seek to recoup funds from those responsible for this disaster.  Why is it that the quarries producing the defective materials going into homes are still allowed to operate?  I asked the T&aacute;naiste about this last week and I felt his response was a kind of a case of shrugging his shoulders and wondering where the evidence was.  Expert evidence concerning this matter was presented to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage a few months ago.  Why is the Government not rigorously pursuing these quarries and getting them shut down to ensure no more defects are caused by the use of defective materials?  Why is the Government not being proactive on this issue?  Why are agencies of the State failing to act when the evidence of defects is right under their noses?  I will give an example shortly  Equally, after all the billions of euro spent remedying these defects, why do we not have a robust, statutory national building control authority?  All we have is the promise of one.<\/p> <p> I will give one example where this type of issue has been under the nose of State agencies and they have failed to act.  This is just one example of which I am aware, but I am sure there are plenty of others.   Fingal County Council knew of serious fire safety defects on an estate in north County Dublin.  This emerged when the council was acquiring Part V units.  The council fixed its own units, did not pursue the developer concerned for those building defects and did not tell the other residents on the estate that there could be a serious problem with their homes related to fire safety defects.  This was a county council, and it must be remembered that local authorities act as the planning authority, the building control authority and the fire safety authority.  In my view, the county council in this case ignored all its duties under the legislation regarding those three roles.  Fingal County Council became aware of these defects in 2007.  Subsequently, further evidence of these defects emerged when a fire broke out on the estate.  Thankfully, that happened during the day, which meant people were not asleep.  Smoke from the fire spread quickly into other homes in that block.  If that fire had happened at night, then it would have killed people.  <\/p> <p> This is what is happening in respect of the local authorities with responsibilities in this area, but I do not see the Government taking any action or seeking any accountability when State agencies have failed to carry out their duties as building control or fire safety authorities.  The Government is quick to bring in levies to place the costs on everybody else, but where is the action to ensure that the authorities meant to be doing their jobs in this regard actually do so?  We do not see the Government changing company law legislation to address the old trick where the directors of companies, including development and building companies, fold up the enterprises when there is a problem and then those directors head for the hills or set up a new company and continue trading and building.  Why is nothing being changed in company law to allow those directors to be held to account for building defects and fire safety breaches and to ensure there is accountability concerning these issues?   There has been nothing from the Government in this regard.<\/p> <p> What we need is a national building control regulator.  We need a robust system of independent inspections on building sites.  We also need independent regulation of the construction industry, and not regulation of the industry by its own lobby group, as the Government brought in this year via legislation in this House.  Additionally, we need compulsory defects insurance for builders and developers to weed out rogue builders and developers.  My proposed amendment to the Government's legislation, which would have brought this measure in, was voted down and not accepted.  Why did the Government do that?  Why is it not holding developers and builders to account?  Why is it always a case of shrugging the shoulders and trying to find ways of heaping these costs on individuals trying to buy homes?  Why is it not possible to find the time to hold developers and builders to account?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400048#VV00300","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664914200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>The costs of construction are rising sharply.  Yesterday, we learned that child homelessness increased by 40% over the past year in counties Cork and Kerry.  In the middle of a housing disaster, with thousands of families homeless and a whole generation trapped in a cycle of ever-increasing rents, it is increasingly expensive to build a home.  Somehow, the Government's response is to make it even more expensive.  This defective concrete products levy will add up to &euro;4,000 to the price of a house.  I reiterate that it will add &euro;4,000.  Even if a family benefited from every measure in last week's budget, that total would represent only a fraction of the costs this measure will impose on them.  It is precisely those people who need support to get homes that the Government is making pay the price for failures they had nothing to do with, at exactly the same time as those are trying to get their homes.<\/p>  <p>  The scandal around mica, pyrite and fire safety defects is due to a disgraceful lack of regulation during the early 2000s and irresponsible practices by some in the construction industry.  The Government's levy will especially hit families in rural areas who are more likely to be building their own homes.  At a time when it is harder than ever to stay in a rural area and have families settle in rural communities, the Government has burdened precisely these same young people with the cost of paying for Fianna F&aacute;il's mistakes.  Moreover, the Government knows this is wrong.  Numerous Government backbenchers pointed out this inequity in their speeches on the budget last week.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance spoke earlier about how no alternatives have been offered.  The ESRI has called for the levy to be scrapped and said that, instead, windfall corporation taxes should pay for the redress scheme.  It is not the case, therefore, that no one is offering an alternative; it is that the Government has opted to specifically penalise young families and those trying to build new homes in the middle of a housing crisis.  Members of the Government sat there shaking their heads earlier at the people making these points, but anything that could reduce the supply of new housing at a time like this, in this kind of housing crisis, is simply ridiculous.  Along with the Minister of State's party's litany of failed and costly housing policies, this Government is actively placing barriers in the way of young families having homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400049#WW00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1664914200,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Across the country, hundreds of thousands of people are living in homes affected by defects, whether these have been caused by mica, pyrite, fire safety deficiencies or other blatant defects.  Hundreds of thousands of people have been impacted.  Given the campaigning and the pressure from below, it is clear that the Government has been forced to concede redress schemes, such as the one for people affected by mica defects.  It is still an inadequate redress scheme.  The top line refers to 100%, but, in reality, in the small print, it is something like 80% redress.  The families affected by mica defects are not giving up on this and they are going to continue to fight.  The question of another major redress scheme, worth between &euro;1.5 billion and, more likely, the higher end of &euro;2.5 billion for apartment and duplex defects, is going to come on the agenda.<\/p>  <p>  The obvious question now is: who is going to pay for these?<\/p> <p>The Government's answer is that ordinary people will pay and it will not make those who are responsible pay.  On the one hand, new homeowners will pay this levy, and on the other, because the levy by itself is completely inadequate, the public in general will pay in terms of public funding, extra taxation, etc.<br\/><br\/>There is a continuous feature from the origin of this problem to the solution of how we deal with it and how we pay for it, which is the absolute consistent position of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to represent developers and builders.  That is who they represent.  That is whose interests they have represented in this all the way along.  We have hundreds of thousands of people in this crisis because we have the builders' parties in power.<br\/><br\/>I will go back all the way to 29 November 1989.  My attention was drawn to it.  It is referenced in Deputy &Oacute; Broin's book, <i>Defects<\/i>.  It is a very revealing debate on the Building Control Bill 1984.  What it reveals is that all of this was warned about.  All those decades ago, it was all warned about.  The then Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government knew about it, shrugged its shoulders and said that there would be no problem with the builders.  In the debate, the former Deputy, Mr. Eamon Gilmore, then spokesperson for the Workers' Party, stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tIt is quite clear that the intention in this section of the Bill is to introduce a system of self certification which will be the primary instrument used to give effect to building control.  It is a little misleading to suggest that the provision for self certification is some kind of an adjunct to the general provisions of the Bill and which can be exercised from time to time. It has been made crystal clear - this is my reading of the debate which took place before the adjournment of the D&aacute;il - that the central method by which it is intended building control will be exercised under this Bill is through the system of self certification.  In other words, a competent professional or whoever has designed a house, is responsible for the building of it and so on, would also be the person who would be able to say &quot;this building is fine&quot;.  That principle is not acceptable in commercial life.  If it was accepted in commercial life, why do building societies, when they are approving a loan for someone ..., decide they will not automatically accept the word of the professional representing the people ...<br \/><br \/>The principle being enshrined in this section is very dangerous.  It will expose people who are buying homes to buying products which are sub-standard against which they will have no comeback.  Under a later section of this Bill once a local authority take in a certificate of compliance and file it away one cannot take any action against them.  These people will have no worth-while come-back if a certificate of compliance does not properly ensure that a building meets the required standards. <\/blockquote> <p>All of what has come to transpire was warned and predicted.  The then Minister for the Environment, Mr. P&aacute;draig Flynn of Fianna F&aacute;il, stated, &quot;I cannot for the life of me understand the Deputy's preoccupation with rogue builders, certifiers and architects.&quot;  Mr. Gilmore responded, &quot;I come across a lot of them.&quot;  Mr. Flynn stated, &quot;If Deputy Gilmore buys a building without having put in place some checks ... then he is the one who is being negligent in protecting his own investment.&quot;  The then Government, a Fianna F&aacute;il Government, was warned at the time about all of this, about everything that would transpire as a consequence and they said that it was people's fault even though it is not people's fault.  How could they possibly have known?  If one bought a house with mica, one could not possibly have known.  If one bought a house with fire defects, one could not possibly have known.  If one bought a house with pyrite, one could not possibly have known.  What is consistent from 1989 to now is representing the interests of the builders and the developers, and that is what is happening here.<br\/><br\/>The 10% defective concrete products levy should be scrapped because it is clear that the cost will simply be passed on to ordinary people and make already unaffordable housing even more expensive.  It has been referenced how the SCSI has forecast that the levy could add &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 to the costs of an average three-bedroom semi-detached house.<br\/><br\/>It is a scheme that has been carefully designed to place no financial burden on developers and builders but, effectively, merely makes them collectors of a levy on ordinary people in need of a home.  It is yet another demonstration we have had over all these decades of the toxic relationship between developers and builders on the one hand and Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, as their political parties, on the other.<br\/><br\/>We need to pay for this.  That is agreed.  The Minister was on television last night asking to be shown a way that this levy will not be passed on and I agree that this levy will be passed on.  The way a levy that cannot be passed on should be designed is to go after the profits of the developers and construction industry, the profits of the banking sector, etc.  They should be hit at the point of profit.  Many of them are highly profitable and we need a levy on their large profits.  In Britain, post Grenfell, such a levy has been introduced.  It is entirely possible to do it here if the political will exists and if the builders and developers are not protected.<br\/><br\/>I do not accept that we cannot go after those who are directly responsible for, or guilty of the consequences of, the defects that we are seeing now.  With regard to the apartment and duplex defects, some of the companies still exist.  In many other cases, the same people still exist.  They are still building apartments and duplexes but they have simply reinvented themselves.  The same people who made significant profits are still active in the industry.  Some of them are still getting new public contracts.  We should go after them.<br\/><br\/>I will finish by making the point about the report on the defective apartments and duplexes.  It is now more than two months since the Government received the report from the working group that examined defects in housing.  That report is clear about the significant extent of defects, primarily fire defects, in apartments and duplexes.  If people are living in an apartment or a duplex built between 1991 and 2013, the chances are they are affected.  The chances are they will be faced, though they do not know it yet, with a bill on average of &euro;25,000.  More likely, in many cases, it will be significantly higher than that.  The working group estimates that of apartments and duplexes constructed between 1991 and 2013, the number that may be affected by one or more defect, that is, fire safety, structural safety or water ingress defects, is likely to range between 50% and 80%, which equates to between 62,500 and 100,000 apartments or duplexes.  That is one-in-20 homes in the State.  Effectively, it is 5%.  It is an immense issue that most people who are affected by it do not know that they are affected yet.  The then Minister, Mr. Flynn, said at the time that it would be the purchaser's fault but this is absolutely not people's fault.  They did everything they were supposed to do when their homes were built and when they bought them and they are faced with substantial bills to make their homes safe.<br\/><br\/>On budget day last week, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage brought a memorandum to Cabinet on the issue of defective apartments, but all he did was to announce the establishment of a new group to look into the report from the previous group and to report back before the end of the year.  We do not need months more of deliberation, etc.  We have the report of the working group.  It is clear on the extent of the problem.  It also includes, as one of the possible solutions, the only solution that will work, in my opinion, which is 100% redress.<br\/><br\/>We know what the issue is.  We know what the solution is.  We cannot expect apartment and duplex owners to simply wait more months as this is kicked down the road before some scheme is put in place that then takes months or years to be implemented.  The Government should move on it now.  It should have included redress in last week's budget and it should move on it immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400049#WW00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664914800,"counter":353,"content":"<p>We now move to the Regional Group and Deputies Canney, Fitzpatrick, T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Lowry.

I think the figure is correct.<\/p> <p> Furthermore, with regard to additional concrete products, to put a levy of 10% on precast concrete products is to put a levy of 10% on materials other than concrete that go in to make up these components, and that will drive up costs even further.

We need to fully assess the cost implications of this new levy because, let us not forget, this levy will affect not just housing but also major infrastructure projects due to significant extra costs.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the president of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association said the 10% levy will have \"huge implications for farmers\" building a slatted tank, slurry or silage storage facilities or grain storage facilities.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, now is not the right time to do this, in the midst of a housing crisis.  While construction has picked up strongly over the past year, with the commencements of nearly 30,000 homes during the second quarter of this year, mounting headwinds in the form of higher input costs and shortages of labour will mean that the momentum in the housebuilding market will slow.  The Taoiseach has said that the construction sector has to realise that, because of what happened, the levies are being put in place to deal with rogue behaviour, but ordinary people will pay the price.<\/p>  <p>  I in no way mean to portray the families affected by mica as not needing to receive redress, but let us stop playing a political game of football.  Why do we continuously look to plaster over problems rather than getting to their root causes?  Yes, more thorough inspections have been implemented, but more needs to be done in respect of building control regulations.  Would it not be more beneficial to invest this &euro;80 million towards a new building control scheme that would be independent and ensure building regulations were met on all new builds?<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned, we need to assess fully the implications of this new levy and how it will affect the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400051#YY00200","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1664915400,"counter":357,"content":"<p>In the middle of the most damaging housing crisis in the history of the State, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Greens propose to introduce a levy to make it worse, which is an incredible situation.  We have a record-breaking Government that has pushed house prices to their highest level in the history of the State, and in the budget the Government introduced a levy to ratchet them up even further.  The people are aghast at the complete detachment and incompetence of the Government when it comes to housing.  If a leaving certificate student of economics who knew nothing about the housing crisis surveyed its wreckage for even an hour, he or she would know that pushing up prices at this stage is absolutely the wrong thing to do.  That is the issue, and this is important.  The people really believe at this stage that Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Greens simply do not get it.  They are so removed from the experience of real people in the housing crisis that they do not understand it.  It is unbelievable that a government could think that this is the right thing to do in the middle of a housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The mica crisis is a direct result of Fianna F&aacute;il light-touch regulation.  Fianna F&aacute;il's friends from the Galway tent were allowed to produce dirt and sell it as a building material and were allowed to get away with it.  It was not an isolated incident in any way.  Fianna F&aacute;il operated light-touch regulation across society.  The banking crash was another example of that and of how much such regulation costs people.  When the time comes to pay for this crisis, however, the mica catastrophe, Fianna F&aacute;il does not turn to its old friends and to the cause of the crisis but, rather, seeks simply to make the victims of the housing crisis, the people who are suffering the most, pay for it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister should mark my words: the concrete levy is a tax on human misery and it will go.  There is no doubt about it.  The Government may stall and push against that but, in the end, it will not be able to fight the logic of getting rid of this levy and it will back down.

This has led to fury in west Cork among good, honest builders who know the customer cannot afford it and among the young people who want to start their lives by building their new homes.  The new levy which is designed to contribute to the cost of a national redress scheme for people whose homes were built using defective products is scheduled to come into effect on 3 April next.  However, it makes absolutely no sense and gives the quarries, including many that we know about, that are responsible for this mess a free pass.<\/p>  <p>  In the middle of a housing affordability crisis, initial assessments are that this new Government measure could add approximately &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 to the cost of an average semi-detached house in a housing estate, according to Mr. Conor O'Connell, director of housing, planning and development with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF.  This levy also comes at a time when the cost of concrete has already increased by approximately 30% since February 2021.  Industry representatives have explicitly stated there is no doubt but that the cost of this 10% levy will be passed on to the customer.  Therefore, this is not really a levy on the construction industry; it is levy on the first-time buyer, the purchaser of a home, the farmer building a slurry tank or a slatted shed, and the person who was going to build an extension to their house.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, stated the levy will add up to &euro;4,000 to the cost of a new semi-detached house and will challenge the viability and affordability of new homes.  <\/p>  <p>  Around 5,000 homes in Donegal are impacted by the mica crisis, with thousands more constructed with faulty blocks in counties Mayo, Sligo, Clare and Limerick and God knows, there are some in west Cork too.  Some braced their necks around here in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for many years, with what they carried on.  Ministers have been warned that the redress schemes could end up costing the taxpayer more than &euro;3.5 billion.  However, despite these costs and the pain and misery that has been caused to so many people, not a single person or quarry operator has been prosecuted.  Why?  Why is that the case?  The Government should answer that question.  We cannot be paying, coughing up for their sins.  The idea that this levy would even pay for the scheme is a complete red herring.  It would take more than half a century or possibly 80 years to make a dent in those costs.  The levy is nothing more than a free pass for those who are responsible for this crisis, including the Government, senior local authority officials and Ministers in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, all of whom allowed this mess to go unchecked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400052#ZZ00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1664916000,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for the opportunity to speak on this important motion, which I support.

It will also add millions to the cost of the Government's public works and social housing building.<\/p>  <p>  The price of concrete products and concrete blocks has already gone up by 30% in the last nine months.

The necessity to pursue the quarries, or at least investigate pursuing the quarries, has been obvious to every fair-minded person in the House and country for a long time.  Nobody could but be moved by the plight of the mica homeowners and something clearly had to be done for them.  One thing I took from my very limited meetings with them and their appearance before committees was their sense of injustice that they have suffered so much and there was apparently no attempt being made by the State to pursue the quarries.<\/p>  <p>  Some had, of course, made attempts individually, but it is very difficult to pursue some of these companies for a variety of reasons.  The quarrying sector is not renowned for being a home for shrinking violets.  There was great difficulty in pursuing some of them.  Some of these companies are huge and have access to the most expensive legal representation that can be provided and used that to fight these cases.<\/p>  <p>  They expected that the State might step into their shoes and take a case.  In a way, the legislation kind of provides for that because any single case is obligated to the Minister.  In theory, the Minister is pursuing the case.  At the time the legislation was brought through the House last summer, I proposed amendments that would at least require the Minister to come back before the House and state how many cases were continued, how many new cases were initiated and what the procedure was for looking at whether there was a case against a quarry.  However, the Government did not bother even looking at those amendments.  The way that legislation was rammed through the House without even looking at how we, as a society, might recover at least some of the money it is going to cost to put these unfortunate people back in the position they should have been had somebody not supplied them with defective concrete blocks, and done so for profit, was an incredibly arrogant act by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  I do not envy the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, is here tonight, because this is within the remit of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage who has been all over this.  He is being spoken about quite a lot as a leader at the moment, and a potential leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  During Leader's Question in the D&aacute;il last October, he said he was working extensively with Paul Gallagher SC, the Attorney General, to ensure those who are liable can be held to account and that he believes those who are responsible should contribute towards remediation and can contribute towards it.  He went on to say, \"I have engaged intensively with the Attorney General on this matter and he is working on mechanisms to ensure wrongdoing and liability on the part of quarries and other parties are fully penalised.\"  In November, he announced in a press release the contours of the scheme and said that a senior counsel would be appointed to look into the role of the industry and regulations in generating this controversy.<\/p>  <p>  Fast forward seven months to June, when the general heads of the Bill came before the committee and the Minister's acting assistant secretary was a witness.  Civil servants are not to blame for the actions of their Ministers.  Whatever about collective Cabinet and Government responsibility, the acting assistant secretary had to say that not only had no one been appointed, there were no terms of reference drawn up.  She said it was an urgent matter and the Department would get right onto it, but that we needed to pass the Bill first.<\/p>  <p>  It is now October.  Through all of this the clock is ticking, because for any civil action to recover, there is a limited period of time within which one can do so, which is after the date of knowledge.  From the time people realise their houses are affected by pyrite, there is a limited period of time within which a case can be taken.  Twelve months after the Minister told the House about his extensive discussions with the Attorney General, nothing has been done.  There have been no terms of reference or senior counsel, but what we have is a concrete levy which, in those circumstances, is unconscionable.

The Government will introduce a levy, knowing it will be passed on to the costs of the people who have to pay for building work.

This levy has drawn huge attention, and rightly so.  In the midst of a homeless crisis that has embarrassingly and shamefully reached record numbers, what sense is there in having those who are trying to build or buy their own homes, or who have to rebuild their own homes, pay a further levy?  It does not make sense.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, in my constituency of Clare, 16 planning applications were granted and a further 21 were received.  These are, of course, young couples who are first-time home builders and retired people who have worked hard and paid into the State their whole lives.

None of these people ripped off decent and hard-working people by selling them defective concrete products, causing their homes to crumble around them, yet they are the very people the Government levy has been designed to punish.<\/p>  <p>  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, as we know, has estimated that the imposition of this levy will tack on anywhere between &euro;3,000 and &euro;4,000 to the building of a three-bedroom home, which is the most common type in Ireland.  We know why there is a need for a redress scheme, namely, because there was no regulation and a lack of action for many years.  Everyone knows this, but why burden the ordinary person any more?  Deliver, if anything, a progressive levy that will fund the necessary work in the redress scheme and, just as important, deter such despicable acts as selling defective products from ever happening again.

The scandal of defective concrete products is one which this Government is committed to addressing.  We have already spoken about the redress scheme that this Government has put in place which will assist an estimated 7,500 householders who, through no fault of their own, have had their lives severely impacted by the supply of defective concrete products; products which they quite rightly expected to be manufactured to a suitable standard.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of the redress scheme is in the order of billions of euro and it is untenable and unwise to suggest that all of the costs of this should fall entirely to the hard-pressed taxpayer.  It is only just and right that the industry which, after all, caused the problem contributes towards making it right.  The Government has come up with real solutions to support those affected by defective block products, while ensuring that the cost of this is shared with the industry that caused the issues and problems in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  We have developed a levy which is targeted at the concrete industry and will raise a meaningful contribution towards the costs associated with redress for affected homeowners.  The Government has no intention of allowing those responsible for the unconscionable situation that the use of mica and pyrite in the manufacture of construction materials has given rise to not to be held to account.  Every possible avenue of recourse open to the Government will be pursued.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is currently advancing plans to appoint a senior counsel to review the defective concrete blocks issue and make recommendations on the options open to the Government to pursue potentially-liable wrongdoers, while the Government is united in its commitment to ensuring that an occurrence such as the defective concrete blocks debacle never happens again.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is also committed to establishing an independent building standards regulator to strengthen the oversight role of the State with the aim of further reducing the risk of building failures and enhancing public confidence in the construction-related activities.  The purpose of the independent building standards regulator will be to oversee building controls nationwide and to act as a custodian of the building controls management system.  <\/p>  <p>  The scheme is currently estimated to cost in the region of &euro;2.7 billion.  This is on the basis that it will support approximately 7,500 affected householders.  A redress scheme of this scale and nature is only possible if industry makes a contribution.  It would be unsustainable and unjust for the Irish taxpayer to shoulder the entire cost alone.  That is why the Government made a decision on the scheme last November.  It has also agreed that some of the costs associated with this scheme should be borne by industry.  This was widely reported at the time and it should not come as any surprise that the Minister for Finance will bring forward a levy to ensure the industry contributes to the cost of redressing the issues that originated with it.<\/p>  <p>  As was announced in his budget 2023 speech, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, proposes to introduce a levy on pouring concrete, concrete blocks and certain other concrete products which are used in the construction of buildings.  The levy has been set at a rate of 10% on the price of concrete products which will apply at the point of first supply of product in the State.  It is intended to come into force on 3 April 2023 and will be applied to all liable concrete products manufactured or used in the State.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed levy is only one among many actions this Government has taken and is taking to tackle the root cause of the defective concrete products issue.  In addition to the redress scheme, my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Heritage and Local Government is developing proposals for the establishment of the independent building standards regulator and this will allow the State to strengthen its oversight role with the aim of further reducing the risks in this area and in construction-related activity.<\/p>  <p>  I can also assure the D&aacute;il that the Government is committed to addressing all of the shortcomings that led to the use of the defective concrete products in the construction of people's homes.  The redress scheme was an obvious first priority to ensure homeowners were supported.  However, the Deputies and others will agree that more must be done.<\/p>  <p>  I will relate what has been said by one Deputy on the issue of the defective concrete blocks legislation, which provides for the State to take over a legal right or claim with regard to defective concrete blocks in a relevant dwelling against any party.  This will be a condition for those people who want to participate in the scheme to agree with.<\/p>  <p>  It will allow the State to pursue claims against wrongdoers and remove this burden from individual homeowners.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, is determined to pursue claims against wrongdoers, where such an option is considered possible, following the senior counsel review and the evidence gathered from homeowners as part of the application process under the enhanced scheme to adequately support any such claim.  The statute of limitations is being examined as part of that review to see whether such pursuit of claims can be made by the State in respect of all these properties where homeowners agree to sign up to the particular scheme.  We do not yet know whether that will be successful, but we are doing everything in our power to pursue it subject to the statute of limitations and to recover money from the wrongdoers and their insurance companies where possible.  The Government is determined to follow that route.<\/p>  <p>  There is a reference in the motion to the Society of Chartered Surveyors commenting in detail on how much it will cost, but it would be prudent for people to see the details of the finance Bill, which is to be published on 28 October, in order to have a full, comprehensive understanding of the specific details of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I think every single Member who spoke here tonight said that the industry, the wrongdoers and the suppliers must pay.  There is unanimous agreement that the taxpayers should not carry the full cost.  There is unanimous agreement in this House that the wrongdoers must be forced to contribute.  That is what we are doing.  We are going after the wrongdoers through the court, where possible, and we will make every effort to be successful in that regard.  We are putting a specific levy on the concrete projects mentioned which are in the schedule as announced on budget day and there is unanimous agreement that, through the industry, funds should be collected.<\/p>  <p>  The only point of difference is the specific method of implementing that charge on the industry.  There is a unanimous view that there should be a charge on the industry, which is the wrongdoer.  It must be pursued and the Government is determined to do so.  The taxpayer cannot bear the entire cost on his or her own and, therefore, it is only right that a levy or a charge be introduced on the industry in order that it makes a meaningful contribution to the overall scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400054#BBB00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1664917200,"counter":369,"content":"<p>If this was about the industry paying the price, of course, we would not be here this evening.  It is, quite frankly, naive of the Minister of State to think that this will not be passed on to people building their first homes and to those forced to rebuild their homes.  I listened to the response by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, earlier on, much of which he spent justifying why the banks and developers could not possibly be asked to pay.  He said that these are the people Sinn F&eacute;in always wants to go after, never mind the fact that they are the ones responsible.<\/p>  <p>  Of course there is no such concern for ordinary people which reminds me, as others have referenced, of when Fianna F&aacute;il wrecked the economy and the people were left to bail out the banks, and will continue to do so for generations.<\/p> <p>The people did not cause that either but again, why would the Government ever hold those who are actually responsible to account?<\/p> <p> I live in a rural area near a small village.  There are two family homes being built on my road.  They are the first family homes to be built by young couples since I was a child.  Building a home in rural area is already massively expensive.  Before you lay a block you spend hundreds on percolation, thousands on water and ESB connections and thousands on planning permission.  You pay thousands in development fees and get nothing in return.  It costs an awful lot of money because of inflation and every single type of building material increasing in price.  We have a housing crisis that is getting worse and the Government's proposal is to increase the cost of building a home; you could not make it up.  This proposal will punish people building their first home and punish those forced to rebuild their homes because everything they put into it is now crumbling around them.  It will punish people for the Government's failure to regulate the construction sector.  Rather than dealing with that lack of regulation the Government is instead looking at putting the cost on the taxpayer.  This is despite the fact the defective block issue has not gone away.  It is still happening.  We still have quarries producing defective blocks.  Developers have walked away or, as some Deputies have mentioned, are still building homes.

In the midst of a housing crisis that has merged with an inflationary crisis the Government is proposing a measure that will make houses more expensive.  It has essentially proposed a defective funding mechanism to pay for an under-funded defects remediation scheme that, by the Minister of State's own admission, is going to cost ordinary workers, families and small businesses.<\/p>  <p>  This measure will mean houses will cost more.  Every expert in the field has reaffirmed that as a matter of absolute fact.  In fact, the Government is not disputing that but just claims the increase will be less than what those experts claim.  This measure will mean fewer houses will be built and that is especially the case in rural areas where many one-off building plans have already been shelved due to soaring costs.  For many more this will be the straw that breaks the camel's back.<\/p>  <p>  This measure will result in job losses and company closures.  The bitter irony is that it is likely to be the concrete companies that have maintained high standards and did not and do not manufacture defective blocks that will be put into jeopardy as they compete with others who do not apply the same standards.<\/p>  <p>  As always, this Government has ignored the blight on this country that is the Border.  Naturally, many of those building, especially in counties like my own, will travel North to purchase material that is not subject to this levy.  The Government has provided no insight as to how they will deal with imports from outside the island altogether, both in relation to standards and this levy.<\/p>  <p>  As a final point, I fear this measure will make farms unsafe and perhaps even unviable.  Farmers are already under severe pressure due to increased costs and reduced Common Agricultural Policy supports and will simply forego plans to build slurry holding tanks, sheds or animal housing.<\/p>  <p>  I have listened over the past number of days to Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael backbenchers whispering that they accept that this levy is a harebrained notion.

He said the Government has a duty to homeowners living with defective homes.  That will come as a great surprise to those homeowners because they have been living with defective homes for over 11 years.  They have been campaigning for action from Government.  How many homeowners in Donegal have received their full grant amount in those 11 years?  It is 14.  In Mayo it is zero.  In Clare it is zero.  How many apartment owners with fire safety or structural defects, or duplex owners, or homeowners, have received any remediation compensation from the State?  The answer is zero.  That is not a sign of a duty to homeowners.  The Minister for Finance also said there was a duty to taxpayers.  Maybe I am wrong but if we had tackled this back when the problem first arose, back when the construction industry had an excess of labour, materials were cheaper and we desperately needed to stimulate the economy in 2011, 2012 and 2013, it would not have cost us a fraction of what it is going to cost us now.  By delaying action, the last Government and the present one have increased both the emotional impact on the families and the financial impact on the State.<\/p>  <p>  The Minster for Finance is right that Sinn F&eacute;in is committing more.  In fact, the &euro;200 million figure I quoted is what we would have in Exchequer funding year on year to tackle that.  The reason for that is we must compensate for the fact that after ten years of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments in one form or another, these homes have yet to be remediated.  On the cost variations, the Minister is right there are different variations.  He is quoting departmental figures and we are quoting the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, which has a real-time tracking index.  If the Department has an independent analysis with independent data then the Minister should publish it and I would be more than happy to compare it to the information we get from the SCSI to see which is more accurate.  With the greatest respect to the Minister of State, the Finance Bill is not going to give us that detail and it would require the Department that has undertaken that study to publish it.<\/p>  <p>  What was most interesting to me about the Minister for Finance's comments is that he did not respond to the three central criticisms of his scheme.  He is right that industry must pay.  The Minister is also right to say we disagree with him on the details, because he has the details wrong.  The first thing is the Government levy is too high, as designed, at 10%.  It is too narrowly-focused on one section of industry, which means it will have a disproportionate impact on its costs.  Lastly, it is a levy on products.  Those three fundamental design flaws in what the Government is proposing are why the entire Opposition is saying the Government has got this wrong.  The other thing the Minister for Finance or the Minister of State failed to acknowledge is what they might have to say to the homeowner in Mayo or Donegal who will already have to pay &euro;30,000, &euro;40,000, &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 of their own money to fill the gap between an inadequate remediation scheme and the full cost.  Now the Government is saying those homeowners must pay an extra 10% for the blocks for the home.  That is a fact and the Government has yet to address it.  The Government has not mentioned the impact on buyers either.  Whether it is &euro;1,000, &euro;2,000, &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000, that is money buyers cannot pay.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State knows what is happening with small- and medium-sized building contractors in his constituency.  I talk to contractors throughout the counties of Ireland.  They cannot currently develop small- and medium-sized building projects because they cannot match viability requirements.  An extra 10% on their core building product will push them even further over the edge and the Minister of State knows that as well as I do, even if he will not admit it here.  Our proposal is more sensible.  I never said it was risk-free or easy but by broadening the scope of who it applies the levy to, our proposal would be sharing the burden across a greater stretch of industry.  By ensuring to focus on profits, and especially those of large corporations, our proposal would ensure those that are most able to pay absorb that cost.  I will name two such companies.  One of the interesting things in Cairn Homes' annual report published earlier this year is that it says construction sector inflation for the company increased by 6% last year but that because it was so profitable, with a 44% increase in profits to &euro;57 million last year, it did not have to pass that on to the purchasers.  Similarly, Cement Roadstone Holdings, CRH, has a level of profitability that is enormous and it too can shoulder the burden.  Why name those two companies?  CRH is directly linked to defects in Mayo and Cairn Homes is indirectly linked to defects in Belmayne, where families are still struggling with huge bills.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe this Government is going to pursue those directly responsible for defects, be they quarries, block manufacturers, developers, or others, through the courts.  If it does I will welcome it but I will not hold my breath.  The Government has got the design of this wrong.  Its own backbenchers are telling it so.  All we are asking is that it accept this.  The Government should work with Opposition in the finance committee to put in place a mechanism to supplement the very significant State expenditure we must see in the coming years to remediate all these properties with a levy that makes sense, does not punish owners of defective homes, buyers and first-time buyers and does not push small- and medium-sized building contractors further over the edge.  The Minister of State knows it is the right thing to do.<\/p> <p>Even if his line Minister does not, the Minister of State knows and his colleagues do.  Please, listen to what we have to say.  Abandon this badly designed levy and work with us to put something in place that will ensure industry pays its fair share in the right way without further hurting homeowners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400055#CCC00300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1664918400,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1664918400,"counter":375,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Wednesday, 5 October 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400056#DDD00300","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions - Ceisteanna ar Sonra&iacute;odh Uain D&oacute;ibh - Priority Questions","time":1664918400,"counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400056#DDD00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Development Plan","time":1664918400,"counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400056#DDD00600"},{"type":"question","time":1664918400,"counter":379,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[48646\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400056#DDD00700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide an update on the national development plan; the impact of cost inflation; if he will provide a list of any projects which may now need to go back out for tender; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1664918400,"counter":380,"content":"<p>The question is fairly self-explanatory.

Interim amendments to the public works contracts and the associated procurement templates were introduced on 7 January 2022 in response to the inflationary pressures on construction materials evident throughout 2021.

If a contract is heavily dependent on the price of wood and concrete, for example, an agreement is made beforehand that if the price goes above a certain level, a certain degree of risk-sharing will take place between the Government and the contractor.  The idea of that is to prevent a situation arising where it is not worthwhile for the contractor to complete the project.  Situations arose where there would be a large housing project and the builders could legitimately come back, open their books and say they would lose money on it if they completed it, or go bust.  To avoid that, there has to be a degree of risk-sharing.  They have to take that on, they understand that, with their financing.

It is one thing to use excess corporate tax receipts to make once-off payments but it is a different thing altogether to use excess corporate tax receipts to sign up to permanent expenditure commitments that recur year in, year out.  That is a different thing.  However, we will review this as the year goes on next year, depending on the prevailing economic circumstance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400057#EEE00500","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pay","time":1664919000,"counter":395,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400057#EEE00550"},{"type":"question","time":1664919000,"counter":396,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[48647\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400057#EEE00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his views relating to public pay.","asker":"1579","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1664919000,"counter":397,"content":"<p>In relation to the conversation the Minister just had with Deputy Nash, we are all aware of the impact of the cost-of-living crisis on many people.

These collective agreements have helped to ensure that public pay is managed in a sustainable, affordable and orderly manner.  These agreements have also enabled significant reform of public services and changes to work practices.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the current public service agreement, namely, Building Momentum, was due to expire at the end of 2022.  Discussions recently concluded between the parties to the agreement following the triggering of the review clause of the agreement by public service unions and associations due to the increases in the cost of living.  These were challenging discussions given the impact high levels of inflation are having on living standards of workers, but also because of the uncertainty in the global economic outlook.  The Government&rsquo;s aim in these talks was to strike the right balance and seek to achieve a deal that is fair and affordable to both taxpayers generally and public service employees.  <\/p>  <p>  The outcome of these discussions was a set of proposals put forward by the Workplace Relations Commission to extend Building Momentum for a period of 12 months, to the end of 2023.  Three additional pay adjustments totalling 6.5% are provided for under these proposals over this and next year.  The Deputy will be familiar with the detail of that.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of these proposed pay adjustments under the extension to Building Momentum is estimated to be &euro;1.6 billion spread over three calendar years - 2022 to 2024, inclusive.  This extension would make Building Momentum a three-year pay deal.  The extension acknowledges the higher than anticipated rates of inflation that have emerged since 2021 and, in particular, the impact of cost of living pressures.  The existing agreement provided headline benefits of 3%.  In total, including the existing agreement and the extension, headline benefits over the lifetime of Building Momentum amount to 9.5%, or just over 3% per year.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of public servants at lower pay levels, the extended Building Momentum, as proposed, provides for increases of 12.5% over its lifetime, which is an average of just over 4% per annum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400057#EEE00800","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1664919000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I want to raise the issue of section 39 workers.

The other two regions in Ireland are classified as more developed as their GDP is above 100% of the EU average.

We are talking about counties Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Leitrim and Monaghan.  Has the region been downgraded to a lagging region?  The Minister referred in his answer to a transition.  Could he clarify the terminology?

This is because of the band it now falls into in terms of economic output relative to the EU average.<\/p>  <p>  Let me add a few points.  I have designated the Northern and Western Regional Assembly as the managing authority for the development of the ERDF programme for the northern and western region for the period to 2027.

The Office of Public Works, OPW, has a significant and diverse office accommodation portfolio distributed throughout the country, comprising 890,488 sq. m at the end of 2021 and including a range of differing types of office provision, from heritage buildings to brand new grade A office accommodation.<\/p><p>The issue, which Deputy Connolly has raised with me before, of whether to buy, build or lease properties is a complex one and is subject to various factors, including the availability of capital funding, the availability of suitable buildings or sites, the prevailing market conditions at the time, the urgency and scale attached to the accommodation request, and the duration of the requirement.  Due to the range of accommodation requirements across Government, there are a variety of solutions depending on the circumstances, and it is important to keep a dynamic portfolio available to the Government.  The OPW&rsquo;s preference is that functions of infrastructural importance or those viewed as a long-term commitment should, where possible, be accommodated in State-owned properties.  This would include headquarters for central Government Departments, State security services etc.<\/p><p>The overall conclusion that can be drawn from the recently published spending review paper is that when the State is acquiring significant property for office accommodation, the new build or purchase options should be considered on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the parameters of the public spending code, particularly if there is a long-term requirement, subject always to the prevailing market conditions and available funding.<\/p><p>To meet its strategic objectives of modernising the estate and making it more efficient, the Office of Public Works constantly looks to appraise the potential of the existing owned accommodation portfolio for future redevelopment of sites, refurbishment opportunities and potential asset recycling prospects.  This is done in parallel and in conjunction with ongoing appraisal, monitoring and managing of opportunities which arise from within the leasehold estate.  The extensive research undertaken for the review provides the Office of Public Works with an important evidence base on which to ground decisions on the overall development of the portfolio into the future.<\/p><p>Under the National Development Plan 2021-2030, the OPW has been successful in securing funding for a broad range of projects, which include a number of office developments that will further enhance the balance of leased and owned accommodation.  One of the major capital projects that is being funded within the project through Ireland&rsquo;s national recovery and resilience plan is a deep retrofit of Tom Johnson House in Dublin 4, which will reduce the buildings primary energy use by 75%.<\/p><p><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/font><\/i><\/p><p>This will become the new headquarters of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The OPW will continue to appraise development and redevelopment opportunities on existing State-owned sites with a view to seeking additional funding for investments that will meet the operational needs of client Departments and agencies in modern energy-efficient buildings.<\/p><p>In addition to this, the OPW has an ongoing programme of fabric upgrades and energy efficiency retrofit projects in central government buildings to enhance the overall condition and performance of our buildings.  This will ensure the enhanced performance of existing buildings and avoid the need to replace these buildings through the commercial office market.<\/p><p>The blended working policy framework for Civil Service organisations was published in March 2022, and Departments and agencies are currently in the process of finalising their departmental blended working policies.  Inevitably, the decisions currently being formulated across each Department and agency on patterns of attendance in the office will have a direct impact on how the physical office space will be utilised into the future.  The chairman of the OPW has recently written to all Secretaries General across government asking them to consider the use of their existing accommodation in the context of long-term blended working.  Departments are being asked to account for the full optimisation of existing accommodation in the context of their blended working policies.<\/p><p>The spending review paper published by the OPW provides an evidence base for long-term decision-making on the future direction of the office accommodation portfolio.  Every requirement will continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis in the context of the urgency and scale attached to the accommodation request, the overarching OPW estate strategy, the duration of the requirement, and the availability of capital funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400060#HHH00200","speaker":"1494"},{"type":"speech","time":1664920800,"counter":430,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has acknowledged my earlier interest in this matter as I have followed up on this before because my experience in Galway has been dreadful.  The health executive of the time leased a property for almost &euro;1 million per year on a 35-year lease, and in the end it was cheaper to break the lease with a &euro;1 million penalty.  I have a particular interest and it would seem to me to make more sense to have State owned properties.<\/p>  <p>  There is an acknowledgement of that on page 9 of this review in respect of the important structures and facilities for the Government, but this is a fascinating subject.  The Office Public Works has 2,500 properties valued at &euro;3.3 billion.  Some 61% of the office space is owned and 39% is leased.  The review looked at five properties and case studies.  In every single case, the review found it was significantly cheaper to build.  That was over a 40-year period and the cost of building accommodation in the five locations reviewed was between 29% and 38% lower than leasing.  That is the context of my question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400060#HHH00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1664920800,"counter":431,"content":"<p>As I said to the Deputy, on the previous occasion when we discussed this matter, I did not, nor does the Office of Public Works, disagree with her.  We agree, in fact, but there are circumstances where we will have urgent needs.  For example, if a tribunal is to be established and there is a requirement in the here and now for office accommodation, the OPW will not have the benefit of going through a rigorous planning process, dealing with all objections, judicial reviews, public procurement, the public spending code etc. because the tribunal will need to get up and running.  There are occasions when we actually need to move.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct in that the Office of Public Works accommodation portfolio is 60% to 40%, owned versus leased, which is quite different from the position in 1998.  At the end of 1998, for instance, the OPW&rsquo;s office accommodation portfolio comprised 960,000 sq. m, 56% of which was owned and 44% of which was leased.  While this estate is 7.5% smaller now than it was in 1998, the number of people we are accommodating is 40,000 greater, which is an increase of 27%.

I have no problem with that but not when it is lost, like it was in Galway, where, as I mentioned, the property was rented for &euro;1 million a year.  I can think of many other buildings that are rented across the board.  Perhaps the Office Public Works is doing better.  I do not know, because I do not have the profile of all of the other buildings.  For instance, in Galway, the city library is rented for as long as I can remember.  That is completely daft.

We will need to have very difficult conversations across our whole estate on whether everybody who works for the Civil Service, for instance, can continue to have the same sort of desk and office accommodation space they previously had while they are working 20% to 30% of the time in a remote location or at home and where in the meantime the State is keeping the lights on.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that this is an opportune time to have a discussion on this, but she is also correct in the context of what the Office of Public Works does.

It is also progressed through a range of important budgetary reform initiatives, including but not limited to: the public spending code; the national development plan; performance budgeting; equality budgeting; green budgeting; well-being budgeting; and the spending review process.<\/p>  <p>  These reforms place an emphasis on broadening the approach to how public expenditure is appraised, implemented and reviewed, and also the impact of public expenditure across different cohorts of society and different categories of expenditure.  They work in tandem with broader initiatives, such as the establishment of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, to develop capacity and enhance the role of economics and value for money analysis in public policy making.  While each reform may be considered in isolation, it is important to recognise that each represents one part of the overall reform process.  Together, these budgetary reforms aim to provide a more comprehensive and thorough insight into how public services are supporting the Irish population.  It is with this more complete understanding that policymakers can work towards the achievement of value for money objectives in the context of the entire budgetary process, and enhance the impact of policies and programmes on the lives of people in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, and in accordance with the Department's statement of strategy, officials are currently preparing the next phase of public service reform, to succeed Our Public Service 2020, which will incorporate priorities that were articulated in the recently published public service innovation strategy, Making Innovation Real, and sets its focus on the wider public service.  My Department has also published an ambitious programme of renewal for the Civil Service.

Despite some expected softening in the labour market over the next year or so, tight conditions and skills shortages for some sectors are likely to persist in the labour market.  This creates challenges for all employers, including the Civil Service and wider public service.  However, it is important to point out that, notwithstanding these challenges, the public service has continued to grow its staff numbers very significantly.<\/p> <p>Between 2015 and 2021, for example, overall serving numbers in full-time equivalent terms increased from approximately 302,000 to 366,000, an increase of 64,000 or more than 20%.  Over 2022 alone, the numbers employed are estimated to increase by almost 15,000, or 4%.<\/p> <p> Pay in the public service has been governed by a system of collective agreements since the Croke Park agreement was negotiated in 2010.  The Deputy is familiar with the background to this.  In previous replies, I have put on record where we stand on extending the Building Momentum pay deal, which, if approved, will result in further significant pay increases of 6.5% between now and the end of next year, with 3% of that backdated to 2 February 2022.  I understand that the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, will convene later this week to aggregate the ballots of the different results by the unions.  We have already had two results, with teaching unions confirming that they have ratified the deal.  The extension will help recruitment in the public service but there is an issue, and not just in the public service.  Across a range of sectors, including the private sector, attracting labour is a challenge.  However, I would point to the overall numbers.  According to a report that I saw in the Department recently, the number of staff at the end of quarter 2 had reached 370,000.  In budget 2023, we have provided funding across the public service to increase that to more than 390,000 by the end of next year.  This is coming from a base of 302,000 in 2015, so we have had a very significant expansion of the public service, but I acknowledge that we have challenges across a range of areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400061#JJJ01700","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664922000,"counter":459,"content":"<p>They are a hell of a lot more than challenges.

For the reasons the Deputy raised, the Government introduced a cost-of-living budget.  We are reducing childcare costs by a quarter next year, continuing for another year with the 20% reduction in public transport fares and the 50% reduction for young people, eliminating inpatient hospital charges across the healthcare system, reducing education costs at primary level, and increasing Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants at third level.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is right about much of this coming back to housing.

All public works projects that are delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the Government's capital plan must be procured in accordance with the provisions laid down in the capital works management framework, CWMF.  The suite of public works contracts, which is a key component of the CWMF, contains a detailed set of provisions on rates of pay and conditions of employment for all those engaged in the construction phase regardless of whether they are employed by the contractor or its subcontractors.  Where these detailed provisions are not met, the contracting authority may withhold payment, make deductions from payments due and, ultimately, terminate the contract where evidence of a serious breach exists that cannot be remedied by the other means provided.<\/p>  <p>  A sectoral employment order, SEO, fixes the statutory minimum rates of pay and other conditions, for example, sick pay and pension entitlements, for persons employed in a given economic sector.  An employer in that sector has a legal duty to comply, at a minimum, with those terms.  The 2021 SEO for the construction sector came into effect on 1 February of this year.  It sets the statutory minimum rates of pay and other conditions, for example, sick pay and pension entitlements, for people employed in the construction sector.  The lowest hourly rate of pay in the SEO stands at &euro;14.93 per hour for new entrant general operatives.  Apprentices' rates of pay are expressed as percentages of the craftsperson's rate, commencing at &euro;6.84 per hour in their first year and rising to &euro;18.47 per hour in their fourth year.<\/p>  <p>  While the public works contract provides immediate remedies to evidenced breaches of employment law, the enforcement of employment law is ultimately a matter for the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.<\/p> <p>Regarding the inclusion of a living wage on public contracts, there is no current legal basis in Irish law or national agreements to make this a requirement on suppliers wishing to engage in public tendering.  Wage rates which have a legal underpinning of course apply to all contracts, public and private.

There are, of course, ongoing attempts to undermine the security ERO, and there may be implications for State contracts in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the living wage, it is now a voluntary matter, while the statutory minimum wage is the statutory minimum wage.  We would all prefer, certainly those of us on this side of the House, for there to be greater movement towards the living wage and a central focus from the Government in respect of improving people's pay and terms and conditions through the public procurement process.

In addition, a Christmas bonus will also be paid to eligible social protection recipients in December.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2023 also includes new core permanent spending measures, focusing on the cost of living, with an estimated value of &euro;1.3 billion, including a &euro;12 weekly social protection rates increase for working age and pension payments and an increase in the universal subsidy on the national childcare scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the unprecedented rise in energy bills, the Government is also making available &euro;340 million this year to provide further support to public and community services.  In addition, to support businesses, Government is introducing a &euro;200 million Ukraine emergency response scheme to be administered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p>  <p>  While the supports provided are substantial, the Government cannot protect all households and businesses against the full effects of inflation as to do so would lead to further inflationary pressures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400064#MMM00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1664923200,"counter":493,"content":"<p>It can be simply said that families were the biggest winners in this year's budget, but also that there were a considerable number of measures for young people.

The centre was first officially opened to the public in April 1994.  The centre plays a critical role in the cultural life of D&uacute;n Chaoin and is an important facility for the local community.  It is also an important heritage visitor experience, operated by the OPW, which celebrates and interprets the extraordinary literary legacy of the Great Blasket.<\/p><p>In 2020, as Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I opened a new viewing platform at the Ionad site in D&uacute;n Chaoin, on the cliff top overlooking the Blasket Sound.  This project was funded by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the OPW.  As part of the strategic programme of investment with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Ionad an Bhlascaoid itself was upgraded and I was delighted to open the new world-class visitor experience in June 2022.<\/p><p>The OPW will shortly invite tenders for consultants to devise a new conservation management plan, to which the Deputy referred, to continue to guide the development and care of the island into the future.  The plan will consider the elements of conservation, heritage protection, archaeology, transport planning, marine biology and environmental ecology.<\/p><p>With reference to the provision of public conveniences on the island, this is an ongoing challenge given the unique nature of the island.  The OPW is currently investigating options for the provision of public toilets and has discussed this matter with the landowners.  The OPW is preparing to seek quotes from suitably qualified professionals to assess the suitability of potential locations on the island for such facilities.  Toilets were successfully provided on Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l for the first time earlier this year.<\/p><p>I note the Deputy's continued interest in improved landing facilities where boats could embark and disembark passengers directly to the island.  The issue of improved landing facilities is under serious consideration.  These facilities are an essential element in the sustainable management of the island from a heritage, tourism, safety in particular, and environmental perspective.

It is a voluntary organisation offering an alternative learning environment to marginalised young people.  The centre and its staff often offer one-to-one tuition in junior certificate and leaving certificate subjects but, for the staff of Cork Life Centre, value is placed on social education just as much as the academic.  The centre focuses on fostering positive relationships between students and staff.  Supports are continuously offered to students with regard to any challenges they might face inside the school environment or at home and in the students' community.  The centre is not officially recognised as an alternative educational facility and funding until recently has been minimal.  I note the extra supports the Minister has provided, primarily through one-off funding from the social inclusion section of her Department and through much-improved provision of co-operation hours in conjunction with Cork Education and Training Board, Cork ETB.  I also commend the Minister on her visit to the centre during the summer.  I understand she was greatly impressed by all she experienced during her visit.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the point of my Topical Issue matter, the Minister and I are both qualified teachers, are both registered with the Teaching Council and received payment commensurate with our qualifications.  That is fair and right.  The same is not being afforded to many of the staff in Cork Life Centre.  Many of the staff there are not paid a rate commensurate with their qualifications or their experience.  Some of these people have master's degrees.  Others have spent a lifetime working with children with exceptional needs and students who come from very challenging backgrounds.  It is time those suitably qualified staff working within this organisation had their qualifications reflected in their terms and conditions and in their pay packets.  It is not appropriate for the current situation to continue.<\/p>  <p>  Since the Minister's elevation to office, she has been a very progressive Minister for Education.  She has initiated the school transport review, which was ignored by successive Ministers before her.  There has been record spending on special education, now amounting to &euro;2.7 billion.  Most recently, in the budget she committed to &euro;5 million to be diverted to counselling services in schools.  The regularisation of qualified teaching staff and pay and conditions at Cork Life Centre could be another progressive footnote in that series of achievements.  I beg the Minister to consider this in the interest of fairness and equality in the workplace.<\/p>  <p>  Back in 2013, when I was lucky enough to buy my first house, I found it incredibly difficult to get a mortgage.  I was still a temporary teacher; I had no permanency.  I can understand the difficulties many in Cork Life Centre face at the moment.  To get a mortgage, let alone a car loan, would be quite difficult in the current environment.

I concur with the Deputy that I was truly impressed and grateful to have the opportunity to engage, particularly to engage directly with the centre's young people, to listen to them and to hear from them about their experience of Cork Life Centre.  It really was a positive engagement from their point of view.<\/p>  <p>  During that meeting, the centre raised the issues of security of employment for their staff and terms and conditions, including payment rates for the centre's teaching staff.  Staff employed in Cork Life Centre, under the co-operation hours arrangements by Cork Education and Training Board, are employed under terms and conditions, including pay scales, in line with arrangements which apply to settings outside the recognised school system.  It is generally not unusual that tutors may hold qualifications that entitle them to recognised teacher status or registration with the Teaching Council, but payment rates and terms and conditions are generally dependent on the setting or sector in which a person is employed.<\/p>  <p>  A commitment was given to examine the circumstances around the payment of teachers at Cork Life Centre.  I am committed to honouring that agreement through the Review of Out-of-School Education Provision.  That review was carried out by a working group comprising representatives of stakeholders, including the Department of Education, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Tusla, SOLAS, Education and Training Boards Ireland and the National Educational Psychological Service.<\/p>  <p>  The report on the review was published in May 2022.  The review finds that out-of-school education settings are providing an important role in maintaining contact with education and supporting well-being for a key cohort of learners who have encountered challenges in mainstream settings through adopting a holistic approach based around the individual.  However, approaches to the education curriculum, certification and education pathways for students are highly dependent on what can be provided for in each setting.<\/p>  <p>  Cork Life Centre is seeking sustainability for the future, which is what the Review of Out-of-School Education Provision aims to provide for the entire sector as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  It is intended that implementation of the report's recommendations will include developing criteria for structures, governance and level of education provision, including scoping out costs associated with such settings providing education for students who have encountered difficulties completing mainstream education.<\/p>  <p>  The work on the implementation is ongoing at present and is up and running.

He went on to say that staff at UCC had seen first-hand the work that Mr. O'Leary had put in to ensuring that no child is left behind.  Don O'Leary and his team at the Cork Life Centre can only continue in that vein with the appropriate staffing.

Philip has recently entered recovery and is currently staying in step-down accommodation where he has been for the past six months.  However, he must be out of there by next Friday and will then become homeless.  When he went into Cork city to present as a person at risk of homelessness, he was told nothing could be done for him because he had been removed from the housing list when he went into recovery and entered residential rehabilitation.  Entering into rehabilitation and starting a journey of recovery is one of the bravest things a person can do but for many, housing presents as the number one barrier.  If Philip had not gone into rehabilitation, if he had not tried to get out of active addiction, he would still be on the council's housing list, with an opportunity of getting a house.<\/p>  <p>  As the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on addiction, recovery and well-being, last year I set about drafting a document on a recovery charter, a charter of rights for those in recovery.  It is a comprehensive document that lists what Sinn F&eacute;in believes are the rights of those in recovery.  I brought a draft of this document to people in recovery and asked them for their opinions.  The first thing said by every single person who reviewed the document was that housing needed to be the number one right because it was the number one issue they faced.  People are leaving residential rehabilitation and going straight into homelessness.  Those who are lucky enough to get shared recovery housing, normally for a period of six months, are often stuck there because they have nowhere else to go.  One participant told me that he had been in shared recovery accommodation for over three years.  He was stable, had a job and was involved in his community.  He had done everything right.  His children were in the care of Tusla, which was ready to release them to him but he could not find anywhere to live so he could not get his children back.  Both he and his children have been stuck in limbo for the past two years.  That story stuck with me because it involves someone who has done everything right and yet he is faced with an insurmountable barrier.<\/p>  <p>  The current Government sometimes says that Sinn F&eacute;in does not come up with solutions but we have solutions for this.  I ask the Minister of State to instruct all local authorities not to remove people from the housing list who enter residential rehabilitation for the period during which they are in treatment.  I also ask the Government to consider a wraparound, own door recovery housing pilot project modelled on the Housing First programme.  I ask the Government to treat those in recovery with compassion and to ensure that local authorities and the Department of Housing, Local Government do the same.  These are brave people who are doing their best to create a community and to rebuild their lives.  We should be standing beside them and supporting them, not putting barriers in front of them.  This is another reason we need a referendum on a right to housing.

The main focus of the provision of housing to those in need is social housing support, the overarching aim of which is to ensure that households who do not have sufficient resources to meet their accommodation needs are provided with adequate housing.  In order to qualify for social housing support, the household must be deemed to be eligible for and in need of support and being placed on a housing waiting list.  If a household meets the eligibility and need criteria, it qualifies for a suite of social housing supports, including the housing assistance payment, HAP, and is placed on the housing list to be considered for allocation of suitable tenancies in accordance with the authority's allocation scheme. The local authority assesses housing applicants, taking into account factors such as the condition and affordability of existing accommodation, medical and compassionate grounds and so on.  The authority then prioritises the needs of approved applicants in accordance with its allocation scheme.  The allocation of social housing support to qualified households is a matter for the local authority concerned, in accordance with its allocation scheme as per section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 2009 and associated social housing allocation regulations of 2011.  This legislation requires all local authorities, as a reserve function, to make an allocation scheme which specifies among other things, the manner of an order of priority for the allocation of dwellings to households on the housing and transfer lists.  <\/p>  <p>  Recognising that a stable home provides the basis for recovery in other areas, the Government has reaffirmed its support for the Housing First programme, with the launch of a new five-year implementation plan at the end of 2021.  The priority for Housing First is to support a person who has experienced homelessness into permanent housing as quickly as possible, without any preconditions around addiction or mental health treatment.  Then intensive work continues on the issues once the person is housed.  These individuals often have complex, high support needs such as mental health or physical health problems, addiction issues or dual diagnoses, that is, the presence of mental ill health and a substance addiction.  The implementation of the plan is a joint initiative of the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Health, the HSE, the criminal justice system and local authorities, supported by NGOs.  <\/p>  <p>  I was not aware that those entering residential recovery programmes were removed from the housing list on entering such services.  I will discuss that with the Department but I was not aware of it.  I am also keen to look at the charter the Deputy spoke about.  It is important that any positive proposals that come from the Opposition are given serious consideration.  I will certainly take those issues on board.  The Deputy mentioned wraparound services which is exactly what we are talking about with Housing First.  We will shortly be launching a youth homelessness strategy as well.<\/p> <p>I wholeheartedly agree that it is paramount that we treat those in recovery with compassion and offer them a full suite of services to help them through that difficult transition phase out of recovery and into sustainable employment and a better quality of life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400066#OOO00500","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664925000,"counter":520,"content":"<p>The response is not available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400067#PPP00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1664925000,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I did not receive copies of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400067#PPP00300","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1664925000,"counter":522,"content":"<p>It is normal practice for it to be available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400067#PPP00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1664925000,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I do apologise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400067#PPP00500","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1664925000,"counter":524,"content":"<p>That is no problem.  I thank the Minister of State for his response, in particular the second half.  The first half was Government jargon, but at least in the second half of the response he was genuine in the comments he made which was good to hear.  When we are talking about people starting a recovery journey, it is not a political football.  These are people who are vulnerable and need support.  People in recovery is not a hot topic in politics.  It is sometimes an area many people are not interested in or do not want to go near.  When we are dealing with people who are in recovery, they need supports.  <\/p>  <p>  In the last part of his response, the Minister of State touched on the Government's new homeless strategy and Housing First.  The target for 2023 Housing First is 240 tenancies.  Our alternative budget brought forward by Deputy &Oacute; Broin and I proposed a figure of 750.  That is still not enough, but a target of 240 is unambitious.  I ask the Minister of State to speak to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and when they are examining housing first they consider having step down and transition facilities.  When people come out of places like Bruree and go into somewhere for six months, they need somewhere to go afterwards as well as wraparound services.  <\/p>  <p>  Six out of ten people on the island of Ireland experience addiction in their family, friends or themselves.  This is not just about the individual; it is about the wider family and community and us as a State.  I implore the Minister of State to examine this issue.

I would love to work with him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400067#PPP00600","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1664925000,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I would be delighted if the Deputy could send that document on.

Under housing first, the target is an average of 264 tenancies per annum, with targets for each region.  Homeless services in my constituency are very good at working with local authorities and homeless action teams in ensuring that secure housing is provided, as well as wraparound services.  We will shortly deal with a matter from Deputy Cairns  around family resource centres.  All of these services are absolutely vital to those in recovery and who are trying to stay out of addiction.  It is vitally important that we tackle this.  <\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for local authorities, as well as our Department, in terms of financing funding and policy supports.  It is critically important that we have a full range of services.  The term used by the Deputy, \"compassion\", is critical in supporting individuals and families who are in recovery. We will have a look at the removal of people from the housing list when in residential recovery and come back to the Deputy.

They are a place that people can go to for assistance, support and information on everything from State services and training opportunities to counselling.  They are a one-stop-shop for many vulnerable individuals and groups, including lone parent families, older people, people experiencing poverty and addiction and many others.  <\/p>  <p>  Given that we know one of the primary indicators of poverty in Ireland is lone parent families, the type of practical supports and intervention this centres offer makes an enormous difference to many families.  All of these people can be guaranteed to be treated with respect and dignity.  Each centre is staffed by professional social and support workers and led by local volunteers who devote considerable time to improving and ensuring the success.  They are also interconnected with other services and groups, helping to link different people.  For example, in Dunmanway, meals on wheels and the community garden are based in the centre.  In Cork South-West, we are lucky to be served by family resource centres in Castletownbere, Adrigole, Dunmanway, Skibbereen and Bandon.  They are an essential support facility embedded into those communities.  <\/p>  <p>  However, a major issue they face is security of funding.  They receive funding from Tusla, the HSE and other State bodies.  However, it is often insufficient, dispersed and is not multiannual.  This does not allow them to work to their full potential.  I have worked with a few different centres to try to help them navigate the process, but it is byznatine.  These issues particularly affect centres in Skibbereen and Bandon which are in search of permanent locations.  The Skibbereen centre has had to move several times in the space of a year, from one rented space to another, which is highly disruptive to the service and confusing for people using it.  In addition, it is now operating on a year-to-year lease, adding even more uncertainty.  It has stated very clearly that the next time it moves needs to be the last time.  It desperately needs a permanent location to operate out of.  This would enable it to solidify its position, develop its services and free up time currently spent worrying about and seeking space.  <\/p>  <p>  The Bandon Family Resource Centre is similarly in need of a new location.  The nature of its work demands that the building has spaces for confidential meetings and can allow easy access.  I have worked with it on the possibility of finding a HSE or council-owned building to use.  However, these centres require proper capital funding to assist them.  It should not be up to local volunteers to find spaces or local Deputies to act as some kind of intermediary with State bodies.  The centres, like all others, provide absolutely essential services and need to be recognised.  <\/p>  <p>  Like many of these organisations, they end up saving the State money through early interventions and on the ground supports.  These vital links prevent issues escalating.  They need to be recognised in funding terms.  First, this means funding levels that reflect their work and allow them to operate to their full capacity.  The Department and Tusla need to work together with the Minister for Health and the HSE to establish a system of funding that will give each centre greater assurance and confidence.  Every euro invested in them will pay back manifold, as well as the invaluable service they provide in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  Second, and urgently, the Bandon and Skibbereen centres need capital funding for permanent locations.  It is currently unclear how they will operate in the long term.  There are no natural funding streams for them to apply for.  Some resource centres are based in HSE buildings, while others are not.  How does a centre go about securing permanent accommodation if there is no clear process to follow?  Can the Minister of State please provide some guidance to help address the issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400067#PPP00900","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1664925000,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I have worked with family resource centres in a voluntary capacity for many years.  I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy that they provide an invaluable service.  They provide family support for children.  Many have community childcare centres attached to them.  We have previously spoken about addiction and recovery services.  They are the backbone of many rural and urban communities.<\/p>  <p>  The Government greatly appreciates the valuable work of our family resource centres and the work of community and voluntary bodies funded by Tusla Child and Family Agency.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has met a number of family resource centres in recent months to discuss their concerns, and this area of work is a significant priority for him and the Government.  Over a period of two years, 2018 and 2019, the Department of Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth provided Tusla with an additional &euro;4.5 million to invest in family resource centre programme.  This funding facilitated the expansion of the programme to 121 family resource centres and provided additional supports in core funding for existing family resource centres.  In 2020 and 2021, Tusla provided additional supports, as needed, to family resource centres and other funded community and voluntary partners to assist with the pressures arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2021, Tusla had a core budget of &euro;18 million for the family resource centre programme.  <\/p> <p>This is a portion of more than &euro;130 million in Tusla funding to community and voluntary bodies associated with the statutory remit for family support.  <\/p> <p> In budget 2022, additional funding of &euro;6 million is allocated to enable Tusla to increase supports for the wider community and voluntary sector and for family resource centres, FRCs.  An additional &euro;650,000 was allocated to family resource centres in 2021 from the dormant accounts programme.  A further &euro;1 million in dormant accounts funding is being provided to FRCs during 2022.  <\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is aware that the family resource centres are providing significant levels of assistance on the ground to communities that are welcoming Ukrainian people and he has asked Tusla to continue to support FRCs in those efforts.  The Minister will seek funding for family resource centres, specifically for this purpose, during discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/p> <p> While Tusla is a significant funder of FRCs, other Government bodies also provide substantial funding to FRCs to deliver services on their behalf.  A short study of family resource centre funding in 2020 highlighted that, overall, more than half of their funding came from non-Tusla sources such as local authorities, education and training boards, ETBs, the HSE, Pobal and the Department of Social Protection.  <\/p> <p> Tusla provides a range of family support services, both directly and through its commission partners, which include FRCs.  Tusla family support services are delivered on the basis of low, medium and high prevention.  Tusla is working to embed and develop a consistent national approach to practice in all its response pathways and this aim is to ensure families receive consistent service levels in all Tusla areas and levels of needs.<\/p> <p> With regard to Bandon and Skibbereen, it is incredibly tricky to find premises that are suitable for starters.  There is probably no shortage of vacated or empty buildings such as bank buildings etc. but they have to be fitted out.  Capital moneys, either through the LEADER programme or the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, could be a mechanism of supporting them to find a permanent home.  I absolutely sympathise with both FRCs in trying to secure that.  Securing long-term leases on premises is incredibly tricky and making them fit for purpose for the specific needs of families is a considerable challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400067#PPP01000","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664925600,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his commitment to family resource centres.

The funding allocations the Minister of State mentioned are welcome and great but they do not address the issues in Skibbereen and Bandon where the centres need capital funding more immediately.<\/p>  <p>  There has to be a way for the Minister of State's Department to work with the Department of Health to acquire a building or appropriate facilities to ensure the future of the services because, to be honest, when we are going about this and we meet, we do not even really know whether we should look for a greenfield site or HSE-owned buildings.

In many ways, FRCs are left chasing funding programmes and designing projects around specific funding programmes which can be a considerable task in itself.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, has through his work rolled out an additional seven pilot community development projects, CDPs, which are most welcome because many of them went the road under the 2009 cohesion programme.  We want to specifically focus on and support those community development principles that FRCs do so well.<\/p>  <p>  I will pass on the request to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, about visiting both Bandon and Skibbereen, if he is on a scheduled visit to the area.

There are quite a number of sources of funding, not just Tusla, from which FRCs can draw down, but they need to be in a strong position and have a strong voluntary board to be able to support managers and staff to be able to pursue those streams of funding.

I very much hope that tonight we can finally get confirmation of the promise the Minister made when he visited Drumkeeran last November.  He met farmers, stakeholders, landowners and local politicians etc.  The promise was that the Minister would deliver some type of compensation package.  I hope that tonight, we will be told that compensation package is in place and that it will be delivered immediately.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and I know this has gone on far too long.  The landslide at Shass Mountain happened almost 27 months ago, in June 2020.

I recognise the work she has done on this issue over the past while.  I am working to address it and wish to bring peace of mind as quickly as possible to the landowners in the area.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy referenced, I visited those affected by the landslide last November together with the Deputy, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and Deputies MacSharry and Kenny.  I know councillors Paddy O'Rourke and Mary Bohan have taken a strong interest in it as well.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and I visited together that day because we recognised the stress that has been there in families and the importance of bringing a resolution to it.<\/p> <p>I had hoped to have it concluded by now.  The Deputy is right to say it has gone on too long and I hope to conclude it and bring it to a resolution very soon.<br\/><br\/>As the Deputy knows, the landslide occurred on Shass Mountain, which is close to the village of Drumkeeran, on 28 June 2020 following heavy rain.  An area of blanket bog and adjacent forestry moved downhill with liquified peat, vegetation and trees.  Some of the landslide material was held at the Dawn of Hope bridge close to the origin of the landslide.  However, a quantity of material overflowed the bridge and made its way approximately 7 km downstream.  It eventually spread out and settled on areas of farm and forestry land in several townlands.  There were subsequent sporadic deposits of peat and other debris and the heaviest deposits occurred in the townlands of Corcormick, Derrindangan and Corchuill Lower.<br\/><br\/>The agricultural area affected by the landslide has been mapped by my Department using a combination of satellite imagery data for the period in question together with detailed global positioning system, GPS, data collected from surveys conducted on the ground in July and August 2020.  The total agricultural area affected by the overspill has been calculated to be just over 24 ha.  The total area of forestry within the damaged area is estimated to be 12 ha.  This comprises land held in seven privately owned forestry contracts.  The affected area is associated with 20 landowners or basic payment scheme claimants, and 19 of them have an affected area that exceeds 50 sq. m.  Six of the seven forestry contracts have an affected area that exceeds 50 sq. m as well.  A report prepared by RPS Group consultants for the then Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht estimated a total deposit amount of 160,000 cu. m or 160,000 tonnes, which is present at varying depths of up to two metres in the overspill areas.  The costs associated with the removal of the overspill material would run to more than &euro;20 million.  In addition, the removal of the peat from the affected area could create significant environmental issues, especially in relation to water quality and aquatic life in the Diffagher River and Lough Allen.<br\/><br\/>As far as scheme eligibility of the overspill areas as agricultural land is concerned, these areas have remained eligible for payment under the basic payment scheme, as the Deputy mentioned, and other schemes administered by my Department because the applicants have been able to avail of the provisions of <i>force majeure<\/i>for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 scheme years.  This means I have been able to protect these farmers' crucial payments in these years.  The matter is under review for the year ahead.<br\/><br\/>Following extensive consultation with various stakeholders, a proposal for compensation was drafted.  This proposal contains several measures to deal with the impact of the landslide and has been submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for sanction, which is required for funding in respect of the agreed package of measures.  We are engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the proposal and an announcement will be made, I hope shortly, on the package of measures.  As I said, this is a process I want to bring to a prompt conclusion to bring peace of mind to the landowners who are in this situation through no fault of their own and indeed to follow through on the commitments I and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, provided when we visited there last November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100400068#QQQ00600","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664926200,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I will be honest with the Minister.
