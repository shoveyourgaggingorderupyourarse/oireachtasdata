It is all about Limerick being the driver of the region.  To do that, a proper transport system and connectivity between our airport and the city is needed.

The NTA is working in partnership with both local authorities in developing the strategy.  This model has worked well in Galway and Cork.  The Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy will provide the strategic framework within which public transport will be improved in the area in the years ahead.

At a regional level, it will be supported through the development of regional spatial and economic strategies by each of the three regional assemblies and through metropolitan area transport strategies for the cities.<\/p><p>Investment plans under Project Ireland 2040 will be guided by these transport strategies including the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy.  They will also be guided by wider Government policies to promote balanced regional development and social inclusion objectives.  The Limerick-Shannon transport strategy will consider all transport modes and will consider what investment in infrastructure and services is required over the short, medium and long term to promote and encourage sustainable transport use.  It will be aligned with existing investment plans under Project Ireland 2040 which already contains funding for projects in Limerick over the period to 2027.<\/p><p>Project Ireland 2040 commits to improving public transport across the country.  In line with this commitment, the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy will evaluate the potential for a BusConnects-type investment programme for Limerick.  Limerick will also benefit from other investments such as traffic management, bus priority and other smarter travel projects which will complement improved bus services as they are rolled out.<\/p><p>Project Ireland 2040 recognises that development of a strategic cycling network in Limerick is a key growth enabler for the city and the increasing levels of funding now available will support improved active travel infrastructure in the city.  This investment will complement and support infrastructure developments already delivered in Limerick over the years 2012 to 2016 through the smarter travel areas programme.<\/p><p>The interurban rail network plays an important role in enhancing regional connectivity between our cities.  Increased funding has already been secured for the heavy rail network over the period 2019 to 2023 which will see just over &euro;1 billion invested in the maintenance and renewal of the network.  That means we have reached the annual steady state level of funding which represents considerable progress on years gone by.  This level of funding allows for expanded track relaying and ballast cleaning programmes which in turn lead to better journey times.  Limerick will benefit from this investment.  Next year we will also commence an evaluation of the economic benefits and value for money of high-speed rail on a number of interurban rail lines, including Dublin to Limerick Junction, against improvements to existing and planned line speeds along the line.<\/p><p>Turning back to the development of the strategy itself, I understand, as I believe the Senator does, that a public consultation will take place later this year and it is hoped that the strategy will be completed by the end of the year.  As I have outlined, the strategy will form the strategic backdrop to future investment in Limerick&rsquo;s transport over the next two decades and will be an important input into the mid-term review of the funding element of Project Ireland 2040.  It is important to have that strategic backdrop as we consider future public investment.  Infrastructure requires long-term planning and this is what the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy will seek to do.

The obstetricians in St. Luke's have argued that the hospital is not an appropriate location for medical or surgical abortion.  I welcome the decision made by the Minister for Health to appoint an additional obstetrician to St. Luke's last week.  However, hospital-based termination of pregnancy cannot be delivered by one staff member alone.<\/p> <p>The issues in Kilkenny are symptomatic of wider access issues.  Only ten of the 19 maternity services currently provide the full range of abortion services under the 2018 Act.  In addition to situations of fatal foetal anomaly and serious risk to the woman's health or life, women may need access to hospital-based abortion care for many reasons, for example, individuals for whom medical abortion is contra-indicated, and women and girls, such as those living in homelessness or violent relationships whose personal circumstances may not be amenable to home self-management of medical abortion.<\/p> <p>The absence of an abortion service in nine maternity units also impacts on community provision.  The ability of GPs to serve the needs of women requires a referral pathway for women to their nearest maternity unit in those situations, for example, where the pregnancy exceeds nine weeks or in the rare event of a failed medical abortion.  As the Minister of State will know, women have a legal entitlement to the termination of pregnancy, and the HSE must organise services where this right is vindicated in practice through local accessible abortion services.<\/p> <p>If St. Luke's has declined to participate on the basis of resources, has it also refused to provide care to women undergoing a miscarriage?  If not, how can this discrimination against women who need abortions be justified?  The recently circulated letter assures local GPs that women who are morbid or septic will be dealt with.  What does this mean?  Is the Minister for Health satisfied that the hospital's position is in compliance with the law?  Would a woman presenting at St. Luke's whose life is at risk be referred to another hospital or be required to wait until her health has deteriorated to the point where the medical team is satisfied that a termination is justified?  Under the legislation there is no right to conscientious objection in emergency circumstances where a woman's life is at imminent risk or her health is at risk of imminent serious harm.  Is St. Luke's providing for those women and how?<\/p> <p>Beyond St. Luke's, on what basis are other hospitals refusing to provide abortions?  What referral pathways are in place and to where?  Have women requiring abortions who presented at these hospitals been referred elsewhere or been required to travel?  How many women are we speaking about?  Does the Minister foresee any risk of legal action due to medical negligence, for example, if a number of hospitals decline to participate in the abortion service?<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State outline what actions have been taken to roll out services in the remaining nine units, including Kilkenny?  Is there a national implementation plan by the HSE?  Has the &euro;12 million allocated for abortion services in the 2019 service plan been released in full?  Will abortion care in early pregnancy be available in all 19 units by the end of 2019?  Do smaller units have the facilities and expertise to provide abortion care in cases of fatal foetal anomaly and risk of serious harm to a woman's health?  If not, how is a woman's care managed in those situations?  Are there clear and robust referral pathways to larger hospitals?<\/p> <p>Perhaps the main issue here is an issue of fear and fear of the unknown.  Dr. N&oacute;ir&iacute;n Russell, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH, has made the useful suggestion to partner the non-providing hospitals with a providing hospital to help.<\/p> <p>Dr. Mike Thompson, a general practitioner and spokesperson for Start, the Southern Taskgroup on Abortion and Reproductive Topics, a group of doctors who support reproductive rights, expressed a worry that the attitude of the doctors in St. Luke's would \"embolden other hospitals\" to issue a similar diktat.  He said that it was \"effectively institutional obstruction\", and that while they were trying to \"conflate it with resources\", St. Luke's was no less resourced than any other hospital.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">  Senator Colette Kelleher :<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Given that we gave a resounding vote for such law to be put in place, I would like the Minister of State to outline how he will ensure that every woman in Ireland has access to safe abortion care and what the position is in respect of those hospitals that are refusing care so that all 19 maternity units can offer all the care that they need to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070200002#D00500","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562074200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address this House on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris.  He sends his apologies and has asked me to take this debate on his behalf.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  Last year the people of Ireland voted to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  They did so, I believe, out of compassion for the women of this country, and out of respect and recognition of the need for safe, dignified and accessible reproductive health care for all.  As a result the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018 was passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas on 13 December 2018 and signed into law by the President on 20 December 2018.  In January of this year, we successfully introduced services for termination of pregnancy in our hospitals and community services, and this achievement is testament to the dedication of the clinicians and staff across the service who worked so hard to ensure that this service was available to women in Ireland as soon as possible following the enactment of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018.  The Government allocated a total &euro;12 million in the budget for the provision of termination of pregnancy services in 2019.  Terminations up to 12 weeks of pregnancy are currently being provided in ten maternity hospital units.  In addition, all hospitals are providing terminations in emergencies, where a woman&rsquo;s life or health is at risk.  Terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormality are available, generally, in the larger tertiary hospitals, as in such cases, particular expertise, only available in those hospitals may be required to perform the procedure.<\/p> <p>Additionally, to date, 325 GPs nationally have signed up to provide the service in the community setting, where women can avail of terminations in cases of pregnancy up to nine weeks of pregnancy.  The Minister&rsquo;s policy is that all 19 maternity hospitals should be in a position to provide termination of pregnancy services under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.  In that context I assure this House that there is regular and ongoing engagement between the Department of Health and the HSE on the operation of the service to resolve any issues that may arise.<\/p> <p>Regarding maternity hospital units providing the termination services up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, which is the specific issue of concern, the HSE has advised that additional maternity units are expected to begin providing termination of pregnancy services up to 12 weeks in the coming months.  The remaining units will then be considered for service expansion.  Of course, the Senator raised a very important point on St. Luke's hospital, Kilkenny, the referrals, the legal aspect and the fear of the unknown.  These are all important issues that I will raise as well with the Minister for Health  However, the most important issue is that women accessing this service can do so with certainty of the quality and safety of the care they will receive.  In that regard, my Department will continue to work with the HSE to ensure all women, regardless of location, can access this service quickly and easily, without bias or judgment, and that we fulfil our promise of a compassionate and dignified termination of pregnancy service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070200002#E00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1562074200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I hope that the allocation of &euro;12 million to the HSE has been, or will be, released in full.

At present, ten out of 19 hospital maternity units are providing the full service.  The HSE has advised that additional units are expected to begin providing termination of pregnancy services in the coming months with the remaining hospital units being considered for service provision.  It should be noted that terminations up to nine weeks of pregnancy are also provided by general practitioners and that 325 GPs nationally have signed up to provide this service in the community setting.

A commitment was made to bring an Educate Together school to the Ballinteer-Stepaside area.  Exactly ten years later, we now have two national schools and a secondary school, only one of which is in a full-time permanent building.

I sympathise with the Senator's point because of my experience with the cystic fibrosis unit at Beaumont Hospital.

There are horses for courses, there are different parts of the country and there are different sets of circumstances to be taken into account.  Many interventions and many opportunities have to be looked at and seized.<\/p><p>I am a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and through Rebuilding Ireland we identified, along with the Government, that there are a number of ways we will address the delivery of housing, namely, through new builds, addressing voids, acquisition, leasing, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, the housing assistance payment, HAP, and a number of other interventions.  I am particularly focusing on voids today because I am not convinced that certain targets have been delivered in addressing voids and the Minister of State will know that is the case.  The issue of voids is a bit complex and it addresses issues with the ongoing inspections of social housing stock, which is an important asset for any local authority and an important State asset.  We have learned a lot of lessons from how we have managed our housing stock in the past.<\/p><p>I am asking the Minister of State to address the issue of the 31 local authorities and the inclusion in the programme for 2019.

He is right to say that no single scheme will solve this issue.  It will be a number of schemes and we have to keep pushing them and adding to them.  We must look at the different opportunities presented in different local authorities in different ways.<\/p> <p>When it comes to tackling vacancies, we need to do more.  From a social housing point of view, I am happy that we are making great improvements with local authority housing vacancies.  However, there are still many private dwellings being left vacant.  The local authorities need to take the lead on this to bring them back into use, using all the different schemes such as the repair and leasing scheme and the buy and renew scheme.  They can also use a combination of schemes to address voids and they can use funding from Project Ireland 2040 to so do.  Local authorities have to lead and drive this effort but I ask Senators, local authority members and everybody else to support that work, to drive it on and to communicate to the people who own these empty buildings that there are a number of schemes funded by the taxpayer that provide solutions to people who own private homes.  There is a fear factor that it could be complicated or there could be red tape but there is not.  We are trying to reduce all that as well, so there is an opportunity for people who own private properties to bring them back into use.  That might also be flagged out of today's conversation.<\/p> <p>On the social housing voids programme, which is the local authority housing we own, my Department provides Exchequer funding to support local authorities in the refurbishment of social housing homes that, for a range of reasons, require a significant level of investment before they can be re-let.  Ordinarily, responsibility for the management and maintenance of local authority housing stock lies with local authorities themselves, in line with the Housing Acts.<\/p> <p>We know that vacancies arise on a daily basis in the approximately 130,000 social homes owned by the local authorities.  It is critical to the Government and to Members of this House that such homes are quickly refurbished and re-let to a family or individual on the waiting list.  Properties that require little or no cost to re-let need to be returned to use immediately and that is what local authorities are doing on a daily basis.  Many of them do that and carry out a quick turnaround.  Some are slower and I encourage all local authorities to immediately re-let a property if it is possible to do so and not to let it sit idle for a number of months.  Properties that require greater funding should also be attended to swiftly, even if there are a greater level of works, which take longer to complete, with higher costs involved.<\/p> <p>This is where the voids programme assists and in addition to the supporting the upgrade costs, the programme also covers costs relating to the insulation and retrofitting of the property.  Not only do social homes get remediated through this programme and made available to new tenants in very good condition, the energy efficiency of the homes is upgraded and, consequently, the new tenants will face lower fuel bills.  During 2018, Department funding of &euro;26.2 million was provided to bring 1,765 homes back to productive use.  In fact, it was far more than we had targeted that year.  A total of 1,765 homes were brought back into use and as our Rebuilding Ireland target was about 560, we went far beyond that target, and rightly so, because all of these homes should be back in use.  I am on record, as is the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, as saying we want all of the void houses back in use with none left idle, because they have been left idle for too long.<\/p> <p>Looking back over the years 2014 to 2018, which were mainly under the scope of Rebuilding Ireland but also stretching back before it, more than &euro;145 million has been provided to support the refurbishment and return to use of almost 11,000 homes, which had been lying vacant for many years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That probably does not include last year's money.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, local authorities submitted details of their 2019 funding requests for voids to my Department and, as in previous years, work to return these properties is continuing.  Under the insulation retrofitting part of the voids work, we claim back 50% EU co-funding, and an important part of this process involves the provision of building energy rating, BER, certificates showing the pre-works rating for each property.  To finalise the distribution of the funding for this year across the 31 local authorities, my Department is awaiting the BER certificates for several of the properties, approximately 40%.  I can indicate, however, that the funding provision for 2019 will be around the same level as the &euro;26 million provided for 2018.  We have asked local authorities to move that work on, and some are carrying it on and will submit the claims afterwards.<\/p><p>It is critical that we incentivise the local authorities to carry out the proper BER assessments to allow the Exchequer obtain the 50% EU co-funding.  I ask my colleagues in this House to raise with the councillors in their areas the need for the councils themselves to provide a strong level of local funding for housing maintenance from the significant rental income that each receives.  Councils need to support work on repairing their own housing stock, alongside the Exchequer funding that is being provided through my Department.  It has been disappointing in a couple of cases to hear of councils actually reducing the allocations they make to maintain their housing stock.  We have always said the voids programme will not be there forever.  It was intended to tackle a backlog of more than 11,000 properties that needed a great deal of work.  We have caught up on a lot of that and I stress to local authorities that, as time moves on, maintenance works have to be done regularly out of the rent they receive, if at all possible.  Naturally the State will step in for deep retrofitting that needs to be done.<\/p><p>The voids programme has moved quite well.  I am happy that most local authorities are doing a good job bringing them back into use.  Some are lagging behind but the message is clear that we do not want long-term voids.  Every local authority will be written to next October and told to bring forward extra voids if they have them and bolster their allocation for last year.  No doubt the same will happen this year because a void is the quickest way to solve a housing problem for somebody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070200002#H00200","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562074200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that very comprehensive response.  He is obviously on top of his brief.  However, this is July 2019.  Several local authorities are saying they are waiting to hear their allocations for this year.  Will it be a matter of weeks?  I presume so.  We are coming into the summer holiday period and a slowdown in the construction sector, and some local authorities are saying they may not be able to get people to do work this side of September.  This is all in 2019 but the allocation is intended for 2019 and these works need to start.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State makes a very valid point about the proactive councillors in local authorities who help to push the thing along.  I would like the Department's oversight of local authorities to continue because the Minister of State has said it is disappointing that some local authorities are now budgeting to spend less on their maintenance.  There is the ongoing problem that some social houses are never inspected.  I spoke to a woman who has been living in a local authority house for 20 years and it has never once been inspected, but that is an issue for another day.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State indicate an approximate timeline for when councils can expect some notification?

I stress they are minimum targets.  Every local authority has been encouraged by me, the Minister and the officials at various meetings to go beyond those targets.

This year we are on track to deliver more than 10,000 extra social housing homes.  As that figure does not include all voids, there will be even more available.  The number of new homes in the system will be 10,000 and it is important that we meet that milestone.  All of the groups with which we have engaged in the past three or four years have asked us to get to the stage where, as a state, we deliver 10,000 homes a year.  We are at that target this year and next year the number will be even higher.  Under the ten-year capital plan under Project Ireland 2040, we have set aside money to provide 12,000 houses a year.  That is far beyond for what anybody has asked, but that is where we should be and should stay in the coming years.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and I are committed to doing so, with the Department and my party.  I ask others to readjust their plans for any future Government to the same level because we have to continue to deliver social housing every year and must not have a repeat of what happened under previous Governments when we stopped building social houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070200002#J00300","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1562074200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.15 p.m. and resumed at 3.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1562074200,"counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070200002#N00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1562074200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Before I ask the Leader to outline the Order of Business, I welcome some of his friends, Mary McDevitt Afflerback, her husband, Jerry Afflerback, their son, Reilly, and Cathy Goodwin, to the Gallery.

However, urban Ireland is not disinterested in the issue.  The agreement seems to be unfair on Irish beef producers.

It is a concern that rainforests are being cut down for beef production and, anecdotally, we hear of hormones being given to the animals.  It seems that Irish beef suppliers are being thrown under a bus in order that German car manufacturers can sell their Mercedes and BMWs to the South American market without having to pay any tariffs.  The Taoiseach needs to come out and say he will not ratify the agreement.  We should have a debate on this agreement in the House next week.

We all know the possible negative implications if this deal is passed.  It has the potential to absolutely decimate the Irish beef market.  The current draft of the deal includes a quota of 99,000 tonnes of beef from South America into the EU market.  As we know, the EU market is already oversupplied with beef and, with the possible outcomes of Brexit, this position may only get worse.  We need to ensure the EU beef markets are protected not just in Ireland but in other EU countries.  Our beef exports are worth &euro;2 billion annually and that is top quality beef with full traceability.  The issue with this possible increased competition is that we are not comparing like with like.  These South American beef products do not conform to the same strict EU standards.<\/p> <p>It is also very unfair to be, on the one hand, developing proposals to reduce the carbon footprint of our beef herd while, on the other hand, doing deals to allow extra beef into the EU from countries such as Brazil.  Ireland's predominantly grass-fed beef is one of the most carbon efficient in the world while Brazil removes vast amounts of rainforest each year to allow for extra beef production.  This must be recognised and our farmers must be supported accordingly.  <\/p> <p>I agree with others that we need an urgent debate on this matter.  It is absolutely crucial that this deal is amended in order to secure outcomes for European farmers and to protect the integrity of the EU food market that has very strict regulation at the moment, along with ensuring we reduce our carbon footprint.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070200002#Q00200","speaker":"1415"},{"type":"speech","time":1562074200,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I am going to talk about rent pressure zones.

Graiguecullen-Portarlington in County Laois has now been designated a rent pressure zone even though the majority of Graiguecullen is in the Carlow electoral area.  As much as that electoral area is rural, in one estate straddling the border of Laois and Carlow, the private rents are actually higher on the Carlow side.<\/p> <p>Kilkenny has been added which is great because that is good for Kilkenny.

Those figures are totally wrong and that is why Carlow is not qualifying.  There is a population of 16,425 in Carlow town.

We are told that the focus is on 99,000 tonnes of meat that will be allowed in under this deal but what will happen to the 270,000 tonnes that are already coming in?  Surely this meat will also be subject to the reduced tariff.  This deal will floor our beef and suckler cow farmers.  The farmers have been set up.

We have seen Trump running away from the USA's responsibility on climate change with a breach of the Paris accord.<\/p> <p>Tying Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay into the Paris accord is a very important element of the trade agreement.

I agree that it  is a headline political agreement, but there is nothing agreed as such and nothing has been signed off yet.

I thank her for that.<\/p> <p>Senator Feighan referred to the continuing fun and frolics of the Brexiteers at the European Parliament.  Their opposition to the playing of Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" epitomises what they stand for.  If one watches the video of what happened this morning, one will see that it was very unedifying.  As Senator Feighan said, the EU is about bringing people together in peace rather than dividing them.  The work of the European Parliament is about advancing mutual interests while having a real debate at the same time.  I congratulate the Senator on the work he is doing to build bridges between North and South.  He raised some issues in that regard.<\/p> <p>Senator Reilly spoke about the Dublin Airport Authority in the context of proposed reductions in landing charges and fees.  He referred to the importance of the airport as a gateway.  Some people have expressed concern that it could become a choke point for our country as well.  There is a need for the public consultation to be extended and kept open to facilitate a wider consultation on the matter and to ensure the knock-on effects on places like Cork Airport are outlined, debated and consulted.  As the Senator quite rightly said, the number of people employed in the airport means it is a success story.  While our tourism figures are healthy, there are concerns as we head towards Brexit.  I think the points made by the Senator are valid.<\/p> <p>I thank Members again for their contributions to the Order of Business.

Nothing else refers to changes which strikes me as odd, given that it seems that, by their nature, the recommendations might suggest there be changes to some of the other procedures.  Perhaps I have missed something in it, but language of change is used in Senator McDowell's proposed amendment.  It may be that it would limit unduly the effect of section 53(6)(d), but certainly the word \"changes\" is only used in section 56(4)(c), not 56(4)(a), 56(4)(b), 56(4)(d) and 56(4)(e).

If one looks at section 56, one will see that it requires the procedures committee to monitor and review implementation of the Bill.  It states the review under subsection (1) shall be conducted two years after commencement of the section and thereafter from time to time as the commission so requests.  One of the things on which the procedures committee will be required to report - I think section 56(4) should contain the word \"may\" rather than \"shall\" - is its findings, including any recommendation related to implementation of the Bill, including but not limited to recommendations regarding the published statement, procedures and processes for developing and strengthening diversity among candidates for judicial appointment and changes to the qualification requirements for appointment to judicial office and the requirements for the selection and recommendation of persons for such appointment, ensuring the effectiveness of the administrative support provided by the office for the commission and the functions assigned to the commission.  Paragraph (c) refers to changes to the qualification requirements for appointment to judicial office.  What could happen is that the procedures committee might make a recommendation that instead of ten years' practice, it should be eight or 12 years.  Let us suppose it makes such a recommendation.  One would then go back to section 53(6)(d), which requires the procedures committee in the second or subsequent statements to have regard to recommendations it has made related, for example, to the eligibility of persons to be appointed to judicial office.  That simply does not make sense because the Oireachtas either will or will not have made such changes.  To require the procedures committee under section 53(6)(d) to have regard to its own recommendations in a process that, when one looks at the section, does not require those recommendations to be accepted or even implemented by statute seems wrong.  That is what I am driving at.  It seems to be a little premature and is unfortunately drafted.  I know that the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has a difficult job to do and I am not being niggly in my criticism, but if one puts section 53(6)(d) with section 56(4)(a), one will find oneself requiring the commission to have regard to things that may not even be law at the time it will come to make its second or subsequent statements.

Those functions are effectively those mentioned in section 7(1)(<i>b<\/i>).  We are dealing with lines 39 and 40.<\/p><p>These amendments are designed to make it clear that lay members of the procedures committee should not be the people who determine issues regarding knowledge of the law, skills and competence in the interpretation and application of the law and the ability to exercise functions as holders of judicial office.  I only came to appreciate one of the problems with the Bill on a close reading as I came to the end of it.  The commission itself will comprise 16 or 17 people but there will then be a procedures committee that will comprise a smaller group and seems to be intended by the draftsman to be the engine house of the commission.  When it comes to doing reviews, the procedures committee will carry them out and do the drafting.  When it comes to statements of aptitudes or procedures, the procedures committee will do them.  In a sense, there is a kind of executive committee and the procedures committee will be an executive committee of the commission.  I am conscious that, if that is the case, the members of the professional bodies, the Law Society and Bar Council, should be guaranteed a position on the procedures committee.  There is another amendment tabled in our names to achieve that.  It would be strange if the two professions in law should be excluded from the engine house of the commission itself.  That is another amendment at which we will arrive later.<\/p><p>The Bill is crafted so that lay members must be in a majority even on the procedures committee.  These amendments are designed to ensure that the lay members of the committee should not be in the majority for drafting criteria that relate to the knowledge of the law and ability to conduct proceedings in a manner that ensures the skills and competence in the interpretation and application of the law or the ability to exercise functions as holders of judicial office.  In essence, these are areas in which the sole criterion for appointment under this legislation, which I regret, is that they are people who, almost by definition, are less knowledgeable about the law than anybody else on the commission.  It is a strange construct of the commission that the executive committee, when it carries out drafting of criteria relating to knowledge of the law and the like, should be composed as to its majority by people who are inexpert in that area.  As I mentioned, there is not even a guarantee.  Say there are nine people on the procedures committee and a majority has to be lay, that is five committee members.  That means a total of four people on this committee who are lawyers, and there is no guarantee that members of either the solicitors' profession or the Bar Council will be among those four lawyers.  The composition of the procedures committee is a matter for the commission itself and it is a matter for determination by a majority of the commission.<\/p><p>I am not happy with the architecture of the procedures committee but that was dealt with earlier in the debate.  We are now stuck with the position that a committee within the commission, the procedures committee, will effectively do most of the heavy lifting and the other members will, in many respects, just be in a &quot;Yea&quot; or &quot;Nay&quot; role to them as regards the policy decisions of the commission.  We are stuck with the proposition that, because there are nine members on the procedures committee, only four can be lawyers.  It is wrong and a mistake that only four people out of nine should be people who are conversant with, and know something about, the law when they are dealing with criteria for appointments that deal with the law.

I oppose this amendment because it seriously weakens the participation in the process of anybody other than in-house lawyers.  I have a difficulty with that because what Senator McDowell is seeking to do is designed specifically to silence a non-lawyer voice and mute the lay members before the process is even under way.  He referred to the architecture and he is correct because what he is now doing is, at design stage, constructing a process that will, in effect, silence any voice that is not that of an in-house lawyer.

One of the functions of the procedures committee is a drafting function, the output of which will be sent to the commission in its entirety.  It is not a question of anybody being excluded from making a decision on the matter in question.  I am concerned with the question of who will draft matters to do with experience of the law and the like.  Under section 10 of the Bill, as amended, the commission will consist of 16 members, if I recall correctly.  I am not sure what number we eventually arrived at, but it is certainly more than 13, as originally set out in the section.  Section 16(2) provides that the procedures committee \"shall consist of 9 members of the Commission, the majority of whom shall be lay members and the chairperson of that Committee shall be such one of those lay members as the Commission determines\".  This means that the procedures committee will have nine members, of whom a maximum number of four are lawyers.<\/p> <p>Unless the Minister accepts the amendment we have put down, which we have not arrived at yet, to the effect that representatives of the solicitor profession and the barrister profession shall be among those four appointees, then a minority of this committee of nine people will have legal experience when drafting certain criteria for appointment.  The criteria for appointment in question are set out in the amendment we are discussing.  It is useful to imagine, for example, a process for determining who should be appointed as a brain surgeon in St. Vincent's hospital which involved an appointments commission establishing a procedures committee to draft criteria for appointment, which included as a majority of its membership people who do not know much about brain surgery.  Surgeons and other doctors with the relevant expertise would not necessarily be on that committee but, rather, existing people of a different persuasion.  That does not make sense.  In this instance, we have a strange situation where the criteria for appointment of members of the Judiciary which relate to legal matters are to be determined by a small subset of a body which is required, as to the majority thereof, not to be expert on the subject.  Why would we possibly bring about such a scenario?  It is not necessary to give effect even to the wildest ambitions of the Minister, Deputy Ross, that the criteria for appointment should be determined, in so far as they relate to legal matters, by people who do not know much about law.

It is about more than just knowledge of the law, albeit that is a most important skill and attribute.  We are not confining ourselves to that criterion but are looking beyond it.

This amendment is entirely in keeping with that, it is something I have a resolute opposition towards and that is why I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019070200002#OO00400","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1562074200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>That is certainly not what is at play here.

The religious zealotry the Bill exhibits in ensuring that, for instance, the chairman of the committee that does the drafting of the technical legal criteria may not be a lawyer is the exclusionary rule.  If the Minister wants to look for apartheid in this Bill, it is remarkable that the procedures committee itself, which is a sub-committee of a majority lay body, must be a committee where one is debarred from having any function in chairing it, even in the absence of the chairperson, if one knows anything about law.
