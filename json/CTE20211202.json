Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.  Unfortunately, this week we had a bit of a step backwards but hopefully this will not be for too much longer.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  This morning we engage with officials from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to examine the 2020 appropriation account, Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners; account of the receipts of revenue of the State collected by the Revenue Commissioners 2020; and, from the 2020 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts of the public services, chapter 12 - controls over the temporary wage subsidy scheme, and chapter 13 - Revenue's management of suspicious transactions reports.  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by officials from the Revenue Commissioners.  In attendance are Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman, Mr. Gerry Harrahill, commissioner, and Mr. Brian Boyle, assistant secretary, all of whom are very welcome.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so that we do not pick up background noise or feedback.  I remind all those attending to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards references speakers may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precinct is protected pursuant to the constitutional statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside of the Leinster House precincts and as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to seek legal advice on this matter.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  To assist our broadcast and debates services, I ask members to direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not being directed to a specific witness, I ask that each witness state his or her name the first time he or she contributes.<\/p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#A00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638437400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>As members are aware, the Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the collection of taxes, duties and other levies and charges, and for their prompt transfer either to the Central Fund of the Exchequer or to other fund accounts or public bodies as provided for in law.  Revenue accounts for these receipts and transfers in what is generally referred to as the Revenue account.  The 2020 account was certified by me on 20 April 2021 and received a clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  Tax receipts payable to the Exchequer in 2020 amounted to a net &euro;56.2 billion, a decrease of &euro;2.1 billion or 3.6% when compared to 2019.  The most significant change related to net VAT receipts, which decreased by &euro;2.7 billion or 18% year on year.  This decrease was offset by an increase of &euro;946 million in corporation tax net receipts.  Non-exchequer net receipts collected by Revenue on behalf of other agencies decreased from &euro;15.8 billion to &euro;15.3 billion, a reduction of nearly 4%.  Pay related social insurance, PRSI, contributions account for nearly 75% of such receipts.  PRSI net receipts decreased by 7.5% in 2020 as compared to 2019.<\/p> <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s administration and operational expenses are charged to Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners rather than to the Revenue account.  Revenue&rsquo;s total gross expenditure in 2020 was &euro;467 million.  Salary costs of &euro;329 million account for 70% of Revenue&rsquo;s spend.  Taking account of appropriations-in-aid of &euro;60 million, net expenditure under the Vote amounted to &euro;407 million.<\/p> <p>  In my report on the appropriation account for 2020, I draw attention to non-compliance with procurement rules.  This is disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial controls.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, was introduced to enable employers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions to receive support from the State in relation to their wage costs.  The scheme was operated by the Revenue Commissioners and funded by the Department of Social Protection.  The scheme operated in two phases over a 22-week period from 26 March to 31 August 2020.  It was succeeded by the employee wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, which is also operated by Revenue and funded by the Department.  The scheme provided very substantial assistance to employers.  In 2020, subsidies totalling &euro;2.8 billion were paid to 66,370 employers in respect of approximately 678,000 employees.  This represented support to an estimated 36% of all employers registered with Revenue pre the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  Similar to the administration of the tax system, the scheme operated on a self-assessed basis.  This meant employers self-declared that they met the eligibility criteria and calculated how much they were due and received subsidy payments on that basis.  In June 2020, Revenue commenced eligibility checks on all employers who received subsidies.  By the end of July 2021, subsidies totalling &euro;311 million had been identified by Revenue as repayable.  The bulk of this, approximately &euro;252 million, related to subsidies paid during the initial phase of the scheme when a flat rate of &euro;410 per week was paid.  Of the &euro;311 million repayable, &euro;212 million had been repaid and a further &euro;81 million was warehoused for future collection.  The balance of &euro;18 million was outstanding for recovery.  These figures are as at the end of July 2021.  Overall, we found that while there was a material level of excess funding of employers under the scheme, Revenue had signalled to employers from the outset that they would be required to repay any excess.  Revenue implemented a comprehensive compliance regime that has identified overpayments and has substantially recovered them.<\/p> <p>  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 introduced the requirement for certain designated persons to submit reports to Revenue where they have suspicions of terrorist financing or money laundering, including the laundering of the proceeds of tax evasion.  These are referred to by Revenue as suspicious transaction reports, STRs, and potentially provide useful intelligence to Revenue in tackling shadow economy activity.  Over the five-year period 2016 to 2020, Revenue received approximately 125,000 STRs or an average of approximately 25,000 STRs per year.  The STRs received are matched to taxpayers, where possible, and are risk rated.  Revenue was able to match nearly 90% of the STRs it received in the years 2016 to 2020 to identified taxpayers.  Some 40% of the matched cases were considered high risk.  Of these, nearly half were subsequently closed without a Revenue intervention and 20% progressed to some form of compliance activity.  Ultimately, very few STRs directly yielded additional tax revenue.  Only approximately 500 of the reports received between 2016 and 2020 had yielded additional revenues by end February 2021, amounting to just over &euro;23 million.  STRs are also used to feed into Revenue&rsquo;s risk assessment of taxpayers, however, and so may indirectly contribute to a later targeted audit or other intervention.<\/p> <p>  The examination reviewed a sample of 50 closed cases to assess whether the appropriate course of action had been taken and in nearly 85% of cases reviewed, no issues were identified.  In a number of cases, Revenue officials considered the STRs to be relevant to other Revenue branches for possible further investigation but there was no evidence of activity following referral to the other branch.  Revenue carried out a review of aged cases and concluded that a new protocol was needed to manage the transfer of STRs between divisions.<\/p><p>Overall, we found that Revenue complies generally with international good practice in the management of STRs.  The examination made five recommendations in relation to the management of STRs, all of which were agreed by Revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638437400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I understand that today&rsquo;s meeting is to focus on: the 2020 appropriation account; the 2020 account of the receipt of revenue of the State; chapter 12, controls over the TWSS; and chapter 13, Revenue&rsquo;s management of suspicious transactions.  I am accompanied by Gerry Harrahill, commissioner and director general of Customs and Excise and Brian Boyle, accountant general.<\/p> <p>  In the context of today&rsquo;s discussions, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.  In 2020 Revenue collected total gross Exchequer receipts of &euro;82.3 billion, including &euro;15.4 billion in non-Exchequer receipts collected on behalf of other Government Departments and agencies.  The net Revenue receipts were &euro;56.2 billion, which was a decrease of &euro;2.1 billion or 3.6.% on the 2019 figures.  Up to the end of October this year the net Exchequer receipts collected by Revenue were over &euro;50.2 billion, some &euro;8.4 billion or 20% more than the same period last year.  Revenue&rsquo;s gross expenditure in 2020 was &euro;467 million compared with &euro;449 million in 2019, an increase of &euro;18 million or 4%.  The increase primarily relates to increased staffing levels, ICT expenditure and Brexit infrastructure costs.  Revenue had 6,680 staff serving at the end of 2020, with &euro;329 million of Revenue&rsquo;s &euro;467 million expenditure related to salaries.  The other main item of expenditure was ICT, which accounted for &euro;64 million in 2020.<\/p> <p>  In chapter 12 the Comptroller and Auditor General reviews the controls over the TWSS.  The scheme was introduced at an unprecedented pace, such was the immediate and serious impact of Covid-19 on the cashflow and trading abilities of businesses, with Revenue making the first TWSS payments just four days after the scheme was announced.  The technical infrastructure developed for real-time payroll reporting provided the platform that allowed us to deliver these vital financial supports quickly and efficiently to impacted employers and employees.  The visibility of payroll data that PAYE modernisation gave us enabled us to design TWSS in an extremely limited timeframe and in a way that significantly reduced the opportunities for abuse of the scheme.  Under the scheme, subsidies totalling &euro;2.8 billion gross were paid to 67,222 employers in respect of 689,422 employees.<\/p> <p>  Beginning in June 2020 Revenue engaged in a phased programme of compliance checks on all participating employers.  Compliance checks as at November 2021 are now 99.5% complete with 359 checks ongoing.  Completed checks have confirmed 97.5% compliance by employers with the conditions of the scheme with Revenue accepting that the employers concerned had a reasonable expectation on entry into the scheme that turnover would decrease significantly.  Revenue has recouped just over &euro;29 million in TWSS related overpayments from 1,658 or 2.5% of employers.  We also undertook a reconciliation exercise which identified an aggregate liability of &euro;308 million, the majority of which related to the transitional period up to 5 May when we paid &euro;410 per week per eligible employee to employers.  Bringing the compliance and reconciliation exercises together, the aggregate amount of TWSS identified for recovery amounts to &euro;324 million.  Some &euro;251 million of this has been repaid to Revenue, &euro;60 million is included in the tax debt warehouse, &euro;3 million is at appeal and a further &euro;10 million is now available for collection.<\/p> <p>  In Chapter 13, the Comptroller and Auditor General reviews Revenue&rsquo;s management of STRs.  Revenue has been in receipt of STRs since 2003.  STRs provide vital intelligence in the investigation of money laundering and terrorist financing as well as in the detection of tax evasion.  Based on global developments and the expansion of designated reporting entities, it is expected that the number of STRs received will continue to rise as increased measures are introduced to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.  In September 2020, Revenue introduced a new online system to require all designated bodies to submit STRs online through the Revenue online service, ROS.  Enhancements were also introduced to improve how STRs are processed within Revenue, including automatic uploading to linked profiles in Revenue&rsquo;s case management system.  The five recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General have been agreed by Revenue.<\/p> <p>  As was the case for many other organisations, 2020 was an unprecedented year for Revenue.  Our investment in real-time payroll reporting meant that working with the payroll software sector we were able to quickly provide financial support directly to businesses, while also continuing with our core business as a tax and customs administration.  Brexit resulted in a fundamentally changed trading environment between Ireland and Great Britain since 1 January 2021.  Brexit infrastructure and accommodation costs were over &euro;9.6 million at Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort, with further expenditure of over &euro;14 million expected in 2021.  Further changes to the UK Government&rsquo;s import requirements from January next will mean more adjustments.  We will continue to work collaboratively with trade and business, both collectively and individually, to ensure trade flows remain as efficient as possible while meeting our Single Market and customs union obligations.<\/p> <p>  The TWSS was replaced by the EWSS from 1 September 2020.  EWSS subsidy payments to date have amounted to &euro;5.65 billion while PRSI credits have amounted to over &euro;877 million.  The total amount claimed under the Covid restrictions support scheme to date is &euro;704 million in respect of 25,500 premises.  The total amount paid out under the business resumption support scheme has been &euro;6.2 million in respect of 1,680 businesses.  In addition, there was over &euro;2.8 billion of debt warehoused at the end of October 2021.  I have responded to the committee in recent times on matters related to the misclassification of workers as self-employed and arrangements in place for couriers since the late 1990s; contracts that were non-compliant with procurement guidelines; and a tax settlement in a specific case that was of interest to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Remote working, facilitated by our secure and sophisticated ICT framework, has been the norm for the majority of Revenue staff throughout the pandemic.  On a daily basis Revenue staff engage with taxpayers, take and make telephone calls about a wide variety of issues such as Brexit; tax repayments; local property tax; complex international tax issues; and the Covid support schemes.  In 2020 and 2021 there have been significant seizures of drugs and cigarettes and we continue to work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our international partners in tackling illegal activity.  Revenue staff have responded excellently to the changed environment arising from Covid-19.  I take this opportunity to thank them for their resilience, commitment and professionalism.  I again draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.  Subject to this constraint, I am happy to answer members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1638437400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Good morning everyone.

At the time, the Department of Finance was engaging with us about the challenges businesses were facing.  We had suspended our normal enforcement activity from 10 March.  We had suspended the imposition of interest and the referral of cases to the Revenue sheriffs.  We were looking at how we would manage this process in the midst of a pandemic.  We proposed to the Department that the best way to do this, to give a legal framework to build a successful system, was to bring forward legislation.  We came up with the concept of the debt warehouse.  In the July stimulus, there was an anticipation that we were going to come out of Covid and that there was a process in which businesses would recover.  Unfortunately, that has not happened.  Subsequently, the debt warehousing period was extended again in the Finance Bill.<\/p> <p>  In terms of how it works, the first period is up to the end of this year.  That covers VAT liabilities up and including November-December 2021 and PAYE and PRSI liabilities up to and including December 2021.  They are the loss periods for the first periods of the debt warehousing.  For all of 2022, for any debt in the warehouse repaid in that period there will be no interest.  No interest accrues on any of the debt that is in the warehouse from March 2020 to 31 December 2021.  As of 31 October, 98,000 individual customers are availing of the debt warehouse facility.  At the end of October, there was &euro;2.8 billion in total in the debt warehouse.  We publish figures every month on debt warehousing.  We will be publishing figures for the end of November next week.  <\/p> <p>  For 2022, the debt is warehoused.  Businesses have to engage with us at the end of 2022 to come up with appropriate arrangements.  It is not yet set out what the maximum period will be.  We will take an appropriate arrangement from each individual business having regard to its individual circumstances.  The key condition - it is really important that businesses are ware of this - is that they must keep current returns to up date even if they cannot pay.  We have written to the 98,000 customers in the past three weeks to remind them to file their returns.  It is really important that have their returns in and up-to-date as otherwise they might fall out of the warehousing and, thus, be subject to the normal interest rates.

Some businesses will be in a position to start repaying on an instalment arrangement quicker than others.

Section 851A of that Act is a provision that makes it a criminal offence to speak about the affairs of taxpayers.  Every time I appear before this committee or other committees, I always highlight the fact that section 851A limits what I can speak about in the context of individual cases.  We have provided a comprehensive reply to the request for information by the committee on the case.  I have no problem going through the reply with the committee, but I will bow to the direction of the Chairman on when he wishes to take that.  I am sure many of the committee members are interested in a discussion on the case.<\/p> <p>  As an introductory piece, I refer to the self-assessment system.  The original assessment in this case was determined by the taxpayer and the original assessment was a nil liability.  That must be borne in mind as well.  We then wrote under self-assessment and we would carry out our audit and inquiries.  We raise assessments when we believe it is appropriate based on the information we have and having regard to timelines.  We are bound by timelines in the context of when we can raise assessments.  In the normal course, once the assessment is raised, the taxpayer is entitled to appeal that assessment and provide additional information following the raising of the assessment.  In many cases, that gives rise to a settlement before the matter goes to appeal.  The background, to the extent I can discuss the case, is set out in the letter.  It is important to note that the explanation of how the self-assessment, appeal and assessment systems work is also set out in that letter.  I am willing to go through it.  I believe there was a bit of a misunderstanding.  Originally, the Chairman thought the committee had written to us but we had not responded.  I was watching the proceedings.  The Chairman was surprised that the committee had not received a reply, but we had not received the request.  We replied in line with the request, as we always do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1638437400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cody.

On the whole process of self-employment and employment, the grey areas that overlap in classification and misclassification are a challenge in which we are only one of the parties.  From a tax purpose, the tax liability is actually the same whether persons are taxed under \"self-employment\" or under \"employment\", except in the treatment of expenses that are allowable.  We were dealing with this against a backdrop of non-compliance across a sector.  The person in our office dealing with this was working on it for a considerable period in the 1990s.

One company told me it was closing up shop because it can no longer deal with this because it does not know what is coming down the road.  This is the problem the importers have.  They understood when they paid the tax that everything was above board and they were finished with Revenue.  They then went on to the next stage in the market.<\/p> <p>  The second issue I raise concerns the importation of tobacco.  During the lockdown in 2020, my understanding is that the value of sales of tobacco products increased by &euro;150 million.  I presume that is related to fewer people travelling abroad and being able to bring in tobacco products legally.  I am not talking about bringing in cigarettes and other tobacco products illegally.  What is Revenue's view regarding dealing with this issue?  On one hand, we have a health issue relating to trying to reduce the level of tobacco consumption while, on the other, we are facilitating in real terms the importation of these products with no tax paid and at a much cheaper price?  Where are we in terms of reviewing that?  Finland will not allow any product in unless the health warning is in Finnish and Swedish whereas here, the health warning can be in Spanish and there is still no restriction in real terms as regards people physically bringing in these products.  Is this being looked at?

The Deputy is right.  It is a balance between health requirements and lowering the level of cigarettes where prices go up budget on budget.  There were significant seizures in 2020 and 2021.  In 2020, we seized 48.2 million cigarettes with a value of &euro;32.8 million. while up to the end of October 2021, we had seized 55.9 million cigarettes with a value of &euro;40 million.  Regarding the level of tobacco seizures involving roll-your-own and, increasingly over the past number of years, loose-leaf tobacco, there is evidence that illicit cigarette manufacturing is taking place on the island.  We have detected cigarette manufacturing facilities and I spoke to this committee a couple of years ago about the large seizure at a factory in County Louth.  There were tobacco seizures to the end of October 2021 to the value of &euro;23.1 million, which is by far the highest figure for roll-your-own tobacco we have ever had.<\/p> <p>  We take cigarette smuggling very seriously.  It involves organised criminal gangs.  The lockdown has had an impact on the legal market obviously because people can buy duty-free cigarettes depending on where they are coming from and if they go to Spain, cigarettes are cheaper there and they can bring them back legally.  Every year, in conjunction with the tobacco regulator, we carry out a survey of illegal cigarette smuggling.  The market for illegal cigarettes runs at around 15%.

We found that components within that sector regularly used agency staff to employee companies.  These companies often consist of just one single person.  The company is often incorporated in a country that person has never been to.  Serious concerns were raised about the potential for exploitation.

One of the trends that has evolved over the past ten or 15 years is the use of corporate structures.  Two formats are used.  There are personal service companies, which generally involve one individual and he incorporates his business.  Therefore, it would be Niall Cody Limited that provides services to a principal contractor.  Then there are what are called managed service companies, MSCs, which generally involve five directors, sometimes not linked to each other, sometimes providing a kind of service to different principal contractors, generally facilitated through a professional services firm that specialises in these types of structures.<\/p> <p>  We know that in certain sectors there are international dimensions to some of those because there are employment agencies that are used by some of the sectors.  That happens throughout the contracting process.  The personal service companies, PSCs, and MSCs are fairly common in the area of ICT.  There is some of it in the construction sector and some of it in the meat sector.  It is in pharma and throughout the media.  It has probably replaced a lot of the self-employment.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General will remember that he did a review of our national contractors project in the report for 2014 where we carried out a fairly extensive inquiry into the practices of PSCs and MSCs in relation to expenses.  We had significant publications and settlements of cases where the structures were used and in the use of the structures the whole ratio of expenses were manipulated.  Some of them involved the use of family members as employees of their own company.  We recovered significant moneys on the tax risks in relation to PSCs and MSCs.  Irish legislation does not have a provision to look through the corporate structure which has been a trend in some other companies.

The challenge then for us was that this was under our care and management rules and our care and management facility, but there is a limit to our care and management; we cannot just ignore the law as provided for.  That is why we were anxious that the warehousing system would be legislated for.  The warehousing system provides the legislation and the rules about who can avail of the warehousing system.  So, businesses - these are smaller businesses generally dealt with by our business division and our personal division - are eligible to warehouse debt.  For any other case - those are cases in our large cases division or medium enterprise division with a turnover probably in excess of, at the time, &euro;5 million - they have to show that they were adversely affected by Covid in not carrying out their trade to be eligible to get into the warehouse.

An interesting feature about the warehousing is that the first debts went into warehousing in January or February 2020 before Covid restricted anything.  Those businesses would have had a normal January or February.  That forms the seed capital of the warehousing system.<\/p><p> One of the most interesting features of the system is the number of businesses that warehoused debt and that have subsequently paid it.  They have not put all of their liabilities into the warehouse.  This reflects how some of them are probably doing a little better than others.  Having debt on the balance sheet is not what businesses want if they can pay it off.<\/p><p> The advantage of the Revenue warehousing system is that there is zero interest.  Throughout 2020 and 2021, I read a great deal of commentary from business representative groups that there was a low uptake of some of the loan schemes and asking why any business would take up one of the loan schemes when it could warehouse its tax liability and use that as funding capital at a 0% interest rate during the period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#G01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638437400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I will allow Deputy Carthy back in later but we have gone over time.

A third significant aspect is the investment that has been made by all agencies nationally and internationally in technology and equipment, including scanners and other detection equipment.  The increase in seizures is down to a combination of all of these factors.<\/p> <p>  It is useful to draw attention to another matter.  One of the large seizures this year that the Deputy will be aware of involved the seizure of cocaine that had been ingested in coke.  It shows the ingenuity and purposefulness of the organised crime gangs.  It is important to remember that these are multimillion or, in some instances, multibillion euro industries.

Intelligence has a long gestation.  Work that may start on a case or programme today may not come to fruition for two years.

We had two objectives in mind in doing so.  Notwithstanding all the work involved in getting ready for Brexit, once it happened we clearly needed to support businesses in that transition and we have done so.  Increasingly, our focus is on those changes that will kick in, as the Deputy said, on 1 January 2022.  The main change to come is that the authorities on the UK side will be seeking compliance with their import formalities.  The other element then is that over the course of 2022 the UK authorities will be ratcheting up controls on the sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, side of things.<\/p> <p>  We have therefore continued our engagement with trade and representative bodies, which has been very positive.  It has emphasised the importance of us being aware of what the issues are for businesses.

I have probably said this before at other meetings, but the one thing that businesses hate is uncertainty.

I am going to pass the Brexit ball to Mr. Harrahill again, but before I do I will give some idea of the scale.  Mr. Harrahill and I appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in the run-up to Brexit and we were talking then about the fact that we used to handle 1.8 million customs entries before Brexit.  We had anticipated that we would have to scale up to handle something like 20 million customs entries in the first year post-Brexit, which would have been a ten-fold increase, by and large.  The reality is that this year we are probably looking at a 30-fold increase in customs entries.<\/p> <p>  We examine aspects such as the local property tax and pay and file tax returns and scale.  Our chief information officer, CIO, rang me the other day in that context, just after the pay and file tax returns deadline. We spend our time in the context of that pay and file process looking at our systems and ensuring that they are robust and working.  Our CIO told me when he rang on that occasion that we had handled 350,000 customs entries, and that that was the highest level of entries we had on one day.  Mr. Harrahill and I were chatting about this subject yesterday, and since then we have handled something like 700,000 customs entries in one day.  This increase has been driven by several factors.  The impact of Covid-19 has been massive on e-commerce.  In addition, the EU rules concerning postal, VAT and customs' rates changed on 1 July, and that has presented significant challenges around low-value items.  Therefore, the scale of customs operations is massive.  I will pass over to Mr. Harrahill to add a bit of colour to this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#J01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1638437400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Mr. Harrahill may be able to answer a more specific question for me.  A 60-fold increase is an astonishing expansion in any walk of life, for the public sector or for private enterprise.  How is Revenue managing that as an organisation?

To expand on what Mr. Cody touched on, several things that came together have contributed to this explosion in customs entries.  A consequence of the Covid-19 restrictions is that more and more people have gone from shopping in retailers on the main streets of our cities and towns to doing much of that online.  That is undoubtedly one element of this increase, and we could see that facet of the change starting to kick in from last year.<br\/><br\/>The second significant element is that the rules concerning liability for VAT for small packages and parcels changed from 1 July 2021.  Formerly, there was an exemption from VAT when people were importing goods valued at less than &euro;22.  As part of the move at EU level on rules to try to ensure there was no distortion of competition and to tackle some issues with the valuation of goods, that <i>de minimis<\/i>rule was removed.  If people are now importing something worth &euro;5, that package will be subject to VAT charges but not to customs duties.  Those two things together have contributed enormously to causing this situation.  A huge number of these customs entries are parcels and packages, as distinct from big consignments.  I say that because in the early days of big consignments, and again as a consequence of the transition from the pre-Brexit situation to the post-Brexit changed reality, combined with the impact of Covid-19 and associated restrictions, trade flows slowed down.  They are now returning to something closer to normal.  <br\/><br\/>The explosion of activity in this area is not just an Irish phenomenon, however, but one that has been seen in all member states.  I attend a meeting every couple of weeks of people involved in this area from the member states.  We examine where things stand in this regard in the post-Brexit environment and everybody is sharing that experience.  People who never previously had engagement with customs, and never understood what we did, are now suddenly part of this new regime.  It is a new reality.  <br\/><br\/>This is also part of why we have done much work last year and this year, leading up to Black Friday, and all those times, for example, to try to focus people's attention on the issue that now arises when importing goods from outside the EU in respect of liability for customs charges and VAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Harrahill"},{"type":"speech","time":1638437400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Undoubtedly.

That scheme was brought in and it was going to be made available for any employee who was let go.  When it was introduced, we ourselves looked at whether we could use our PAYE system to provide a mechanism to allow employers to support employees.  We contacted the Department of Finance to say we thought we could do something to enable employers to do that.  The Government then looked at it - it was the quickest response we have ever got to any proposal we have made - and said that if we could do that, that would be great.  It was then a policy decision around having a broad-based scheme to support employment and this was across the full sector of the economy.<\/p> <p>  As it turned out subsequently, most of the money has been funded by the EU as part of the support of the EU system in response to the Covid pandemic impact.  It was a broad-based scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme, which replaced it, is similarly broadly based across the economy.  That makes sure it does not fall foul of any state aid rules, as would be the case if we picked particular sectors.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, it is a Government decision.  The wage subsidy schemes have been a phenomenal success in meeting the policy requirements of keeping people in employment.  Today's newspapers show unemployment is down to something like 6.9%, according to Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures published today.  We never had the wage subsidy schemes before and I do not know what will happen in future, but the payroll system and the PAYE modernisation have provided that platform to support businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1638437400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I reiterate there is a broad recognition within the Oireachtas that the work done in Revenue by its employees has, in general, been very good.

The scheme provided that the TWSS payment had to be shown on the payslips of anyone receiving it.  Through the course of the year, certain financial institutions had concerns and brought in blanket rules which called into question mortgage applications if a person's employer was in receipt of the subsidy.  Representations were made to us about some of those cases.  We identified that we have no role in what the mortgage company does.  We passed on concerns in submissions made to us regarding banking oversight to the Department of Finance.  Transparency about being in receipt of the scheme was key because we wanted to ensure that employees knew exactly how much the employer was getting.

Customs requested certain documents to facilitate the clearing without duty on those vehicles.  The paperwork was produced.  However, months later, these vehicles had been sold on, with the VRT paid, they were re-registered, and then Revenue decided that it was looking for other documentation to support the vehicles that were already cleared.  It moved the goalposts in the middle of the whole operation.  Even though the vehicles were cleared, with one set of documents having been produced, Revenue was not happy with that and asked for more documents, which cannot be produced for specific reasons.

What concerns me about regulatory agencies such as Revenue making mistakes is that there is now an outstanding amount of money that Revenue states is due, when the reality is that Revenue has certain amounts of money belonging to these people, which it is probably going to hang on to to put against this bill.  The only recourse open to the businesses is probably judicial review.  Ultimately, what generally seems to happen in this country is that the judicial review goes against the regulatory agency when it gets to the court and the taxpayer picks up the bill for a legal fee which should never have arisen in the first place.  We can carry on the conversation another time, but I am making the witnesses aware that I am hot on the case of State agencies that are spending taxpayers' money entering into legal cases when they should know better.

On foot of a proposal by Deputy Sean Sherlock, this is one of 11 responses to our requests for information in relation to the use of public funds by An Taisce.  We have now received eight of the 11 responses.  The eight responses account for &euro;1.2 million, or 36% of the funding An Taisce received in 2019.  Responses from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are outstanding.  They account for &euro;2.18 million, or 64% of the funding.  This item has been flagged by Deputy Matt Carthy.

No.  It is proposed that we note and publish the item and consider the responses.  The next item is No. 901B from Mr. Niall Cody, chairman of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 18 November 2021, providing information requested by the committee regarding the disclosure of details of a settlement between Revenue and Perrigo.  At our meeting of 18 November, we considered a related response, R0873, from the Tax Appeals Commission.  We discussed this matter with Revenue during today's engagement and that debate is on the public record.  It is proposed that we note and publish this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The item has was flagged by me and Deputy Catherine Murphy.  I do not think Deputy Murphy is with us.  We dealt with No. 901B earlier and we are no clearer on it because of the issue regarding Revenue and confidentiality.  That is understandable.  Time did not allow us to go any further into the issue earlier.  The tax demand was for &euro;1.636 billion.  That was subsequently reduced following a number of interventions.  The case came before a court.  The final figure was that Perrigo is due to pay Revenue is &euro;266 million.  I propose to the committee that we write to Revenue Commissioners following today's meeting.  We must recognise the fact that there has to be client confidentiality, but in the general scheme of things, the issue at stake here would appear to be whether it was treated as a capital transfer incurring a rate of tax of 33%, or one of 12.5%, as part of its normal trading profits.  I suggest we write to Revenue and seek an answer to that question.  Surely, it is a matter of how a company, and particularly, a very large one, is treated for tax, and specifically, whether it is paying the 33% or the 12.5%.  If it is 12.5%, we should seek an explanation, because even at 12.5% the figure would be more than double what it came in, namely, &euro;266 million.  A tax rate of 12.5% would have given rise to a demand of possibly between &euro;600 million and &euro;700 million.  If it is agreed by the committee, I will ask the clerk to follow up with that information from Revenue.  While recognising the fact that it is bound by confidentiality around these matters, perhaps more light can be shed on that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>The next item is No. 903B from Mr. Derek Tierney, head of health infrastructure, Department of Health, dated 18 November 2021, and is a response to our request for information in relation to the analysis undertaken by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on the progress on the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  The progress report has been with the Department of Health for some time, and we have made a number of requests for sight of the report and information on the projected costs and completion date for the hospital.  The Department's position remains that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tthe Department and the Development Board have a responsibility to ensure the successful completion of this critical project and that any discussion of costs, however hypothetical or otherwise, at this time, would prejudice enforcement of the existing contract, and very likely negatively impact or jeopardise the Development Board in its ongoing engagement with the main contractor, and the Board's responsibilities for the timely completion of this critical project. <\/blockquote> <p>Our invitation to the Department of Health to our meeting on 16 December, which is two weeks from today, includes this matter as an agenda item.  Also on the agenda for that meeting is the value for money review of the nursing homes support scheme, or fair deal scheme.  As detailed in our January report on our examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the scheme, the review was initiated by the Department of Health in March 2018 and was due for publication in March 2019.  More than two and a half years later this item of correspondence states that a response on that matter will follow without specifying when.  I do not think committee members will be happy with that.  We recommended that the Department provide the committee with updates, but these have not been forthcoming.  That is most disappointing.  It is proposed that we note and publish the item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The item has been flagged by me and Deputy Catherine Murphy.

There are reports of the spiralling costs of the national children's hospital.

Optimistically, this hospital will not open until at least 2024.<\/p><p>Come that time, I fully expect the Department will tell us that it cannot comment because a legal case or negotiations are ongoing.  This is a complete lack of engagement in a new development.

In the end, it will likely be measured in billions of taxpayers' money.

There is concern in relation to that issue.  This time last year, members will recall, we were trying to arrange for the Department and the hospital board to come in to discuss this.  We delayed it and put it back to 9 February to facilitate this report on the children's hospital.  I was actually at that site the other day.  I am at a loss at this point as to how we are in a situation whereby the project is this far advanced without being able to ascertain the final costs.  I do not expect them to pin that down to the nearest dollar because obviously there are tweaks taking place and different elements built in for construction inflation.  How come the taxpayers, the Oireachtas, this committee and indeed the health committee, which has pursued this vigorously as well, cannot be given a figure for the estimated cost of this project when it is completed?  We are left guessing.  The media are left speculating, as are we.  We are trying to pick up hints from what we are being told.  As Chairperson, I find it totally disrespectful to be honest.  I do not see why this figure is not available at this point.  There is something seriously wrong if the Department cannot state the final cost of this project or when it will be completed.

It is incredible that a Department is in the situation whereby it does not have that report completed two and a half years later.

We should ask, if the committee is agreeable, that the Department should complete that report and give us an update on it when it comes before the committee.  At this point, Oireachtas Members, who are elected on behalf of the citizenry who pay the taxes that facilitate these schemes and everything else, need to know the answer to this.  We will ask the secretariat to include in the correspondence that we are disappointed and that we feel it has dragged on unnecessarily for a long period of time.

On behalf of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, I thank the members of the committee for the opportunity to appear in front of it today.  Our umbrella organisation represents more than 30 not-for-profit organisations providing specialists supports to people with neurological conditions and their families.<\/p> <p>  I commend the committee on recognising the specific needs of people with neurodisability in extending an invitation to our group.  According to the World Health Organisation, neurological conditions affecting the brain and spinal cord now represent the leading cause of acquired disability worldwide, with an estimated one in three people worldwide affected by a neurological disorder at some point in their lifetime.  More than 800,000 Irish people are living with a neurological condition, with an additional 50,000 diagnosed each year. <\/p> <p>  The UNCRPD has wide ranging relevance and implications for people living with a neurological disability.  We want to focus today on one of the most critical articles of the convention when it comes to people in Ireland living with a neurodisability.  Just to note, we identified many of the issues that will be raised today in our submission on lived experience to the committee back in November of last year.  Article 26 of the convention calls on State parties to provide comprehensive rehabilitation services and programmes for people with a disability.  The capacity review of disability services published by the Department of Health in July of this year specifically recognises the major shortfall in timely access to rehabilitation for people with a neurodisability and the critical need for investment in neurorehabilitation services. <\/p> <p>  My co-presenter today, Dr. Niall Pender, brings a front-line perspective on the importance of neurorehabilitation services from his role as principal clinical neuropsychologist in the national neuroscience centre, where he is confronted on a daily basis with the life-changing impact of conditions such as stroke, acquired brain injury and spinal injury as well as progressive neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. <\/p> <p>The national neurorehabilitation strategy was published a decade ago in 2011 and the current programme for Government includes a commitment to its implementation.  A three-year implementation plan was finally published in 2019 and it comes to an end this December. <\/p> <p>  I want to highlight to the committee today that Ireland will not meet its obligations under the UNCRPD unless and until the neurorehabilitation strategy is fully implemented.  In our response to the draft State report in March this year, we outlined the serious lack of progress on the 2019 to 2021 implementation framework.  First, the implementation framework committed to the establishment of community neurorehabilitation teams in each community healthcare organisation, CHO.  Over the three years of the framework and in the decade since the neurorehabilitation strategy was published, only two additional teams have been funded, and only partially.  Both of these teams are in the east, in CHOs 6 and 7, despite the lack of any proper neurorehabilitation service provision across the rest of the country. <\/p> <p>  Second, Ireland needs a minimum of 288 specialist rehabilitation beds for its population.  Fewer than 30 additional beds have been introduced in the ten years since the neurorehabilitation strategy was published.  The redevelopment of the National Rehabilitation Hospital, while warmly welcome and much needed, did not introduce any additional rehabilitation beds.  The HSE steering group responsible for the implementation of the strategy from 2019 to 2021 met only twice in 2020 and has not met at all in 2021.  We are seeking the oversight and support of the committee to address the serious delays in the implementation of the strategy to ensure that Ireland is in a position to meet its obligations to people with a neurodisability in this country under the UNCRPD. <\/p> <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic has given added urgency to the implementation of the neurorehabilitation strategy.  The national clinical programme for rehabilitation medicine has highlighted that a significant proportion of patients admitted to ICU with Covid-19 are anticipated to have significant complex impairments requiring specialist rehabilitation consultant and multidisciplinary team input and may require transfer to specialist rehabilitation units, while many with milder symptoms will need access to rehabilitation in the community. <\/p> <p>  We are requesting that the committee write to the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, urging him to implement the neurorehabilitation strategy and consider a joint motion calling for full implementation of the strategy within the lifetime of this Government, as committed to within the current programme for Government. <\/p> <p>  I thank the committee and invite any questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Magdalen Rogers"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Rogers for her opening remarks.

The National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers: Supporting People with Intellectual Disability is a national umbrella body of not-for-profit organisations providing direct supports and services to people with intellectual disability.  Across 57 organisations, our members support approximately 26,000 children and adults with intellectual disabilities and their families, providing<\/p> <p>services and supports throughout the lifespan.<\/p> <p>  Our member organisations have community presence and connections across cities, towns and villages throughout the country.  As two thirds of disability services are provided on behalf of the State by<\/p> <p>the voluntary sector, we welcome the joint committee&rsquo;s invitation to us, as not-for-profit service providers, in the context of this debate.  We welcome the focus of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters on the key area of reimagining the future for disability services to provide a more rights-based approach.  The opportunity to listen to the lived experience of people with a disability and their families that has taken place at recent meetings of the committee has been vitally important, and their testimonies have been powerful and compelling.<\/p><p>A key pillar of our work in 2021 has been to examine the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, in great detail.  We have brought together online our members from around the country to look at the status of the implementation of the UNCRPD, working through the Articles one by one, reflecting on the State report and thinking about how to implement a more rights-focused approach to service provision.  Our board will continue this focus in 2022.  <\/p><p> Following these workshops with our members, we have made a number of key submissions that reflect our views on the UNCRPD.  These include our response to the draft initial State report, our participation in the development of the new housing strategy and our recent submission to the disability action plan 2022 - 2025.  <\/p><p> As time is short for this opening statement, there are a couple of interlinked themes we wish to highlight.  These include the need for sustained investment with multi-annual planning to address waiting lists in children&rsquo;s and adult&rsquo;s services, the requirement for new models of service delivery and improved cross-departmental working with a whole-of-government approach to the UNCRPD.<\/p><p> The disability capacity review has set out a very significant level of unmet need for disability services.  These figures confirm the deficits described in successive pre-budget submissions by a range of organisations, ourselves included.  Behind the substantial figures in the capacity review are individuals and families who are struggling to access the kinds of supports envisaged in the UNCRPD.  It will take a number of years of sustained investment to address this level of unmet need.  We are acutely aware of the unmet need in children&rsquo;s services and how this impacts on children and families.  We believe that the urgent completion of the reconfiguration of children&rsquo;s services and a sustained multi-annual programme of investment are required to address this unmet need.<\/p><p> The provision of a lifelong diagnosis of disability provides for the potential to plan early and provide the resourcing to support people well.  However, current budget and planning cycles are annual in nature.  These result in crisis-driven and emergency responses that do not result in the best outcomes for individuals, cause enormous uncertainty for families and are not best value for State funding.  A multi-annual planning and investment framework is required to improve this.<\/p><p> Supports should be planned and implemented at the levels required by individuals to support their independence in line with Article 19.  This requires a range of service delivery models that respect the individual&rsquo;s independence.  These include personal assistance, home support, supported independent living and, for some with higher support needs, full-time residential care.  These supports need to be put in place earlier, rather than in a crisis when a family carer becomes ill or passes away.  <\/p><p> Article 19 of the UNCRPD focuses on the right to live independently with appropriate supports and in order for this to be achieved it will be necessary to provide the integration of housing together with supports.  This will require substantial collaboration across the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Health, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and other relevant Departments, including the Department Social Protection and the Department of Transport.  There is an opportunity to put this in place through the new housing strategy and we are engaged with the process of consultation that is involved in developing that strategy. <\/p><p> Articles 29 and 30 address the right of a person with a disability to participate in public and cultural life.  Supporting these rights is a whole-of-government challenge.  The UNCRPD needs to be addressed across a range of Government Departments.  Where there is a lack of clarity in terms of responsibility of Departments, it is the person - the citizen - who often falls between the stools and is left without support.  We have highlighted in our submissions a range of areas including supported employment, housing and supports and transition planning for young people, where there is a need for improved collaborative working and a clear delineation of departmental responsibility.<\/p><p> At the individual organisation level, members of the federation have been working to transform services and supports with a number of initiatives.  These include the development of individualised supports in day services under the new directions programme; collaborative work with local authorities to deliver housing and supports; supporting people to move from congregated settings to the community &ndash; there has been considerable progress but the work continues; and the establishment of successful programmes that demonstrate the value of transition planning and tailored employment supports.<\/p><p> At the national level, the federation has had a focus for many years on developing initiatives that support innovation.  We are happy to share details of these with the committee.  Some of them include our next steps community of practice and the immersion programme; the Informing Families evidence-based best practice guidance; the person-led research of the Inclusive Research Network; and our recent work with the older persons working group.  The learning from these organisational and national initiatives can provide impetus for further development of strongly individualised, person-centred and person driven approaches.<\/p><p> The collaborative approach undertaken by services together with the HSE during the Covid-19 pandemic provides fertile ground for continued partnership in developing services into the future.  We attach considerable importance to the work being undertaken to address challenges highlighted in the Catherine Day report and through the work of the health dialogue forum chaired by Mr. Peter Cassells.  Our services are ready to work with the key stakeholders to develop and reimagine services and supports for the future, to ensure the people we support can access their rights under the UNCRPD and live life to their full potential as valued members of their communities.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet with it on this topic.  We are happy to take questions from members. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#B01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Hennessy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for presenting here today at our committee.

Ms Rogers stated that the neurorehabilitation strategy has not been implemented and, in fact, only two of the teams have been partially established in the past three years.  She also mentioned that 288 specialist beds are required.  How many beds are available at the moment?  According to Ms Rogers's written statement, 50 beds have been added; however, in her opening remarks, she said 30 additional beds.  Is it 30 or 50 additional beds and how many beds are available in total?  Why has this strategy not been implemented?

I will answer first on the existing number of beds.  It is difficult to get a handle on the number of existing beds, to be honest, because the steering group on the implementation of the strategy has met so infrequently in terms of mapping what is in place.  There are 120 beds in the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  The redevelopment of the National Rehabilitation Hospital into effectively a new hospital - while very welcome and a fantastic facility - did not introduce any additional beds.  There are beds in a Roscommon unit and beds recently brought on stream this year in Peamount Healthcare.  Again, these are very welcome developments.  To answer the Deputy's question directly, we find it difficult to get a handle on exactly how many of those 288 beds are in the system.  The last estimate from the rehabilitation medicine programme stated that we have fewer than half of the specialist rehabilitation beds we need.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question as to why the strategy has not been implemented, we see it as a matter of funding.  Repeated submissions are made to the Estimates process each year for the funding of the strategy and of the rehabilitation teams.  Unfortunately, that funding has not been forthcoming.  In relation to the teams in community healthcare organisations, CHOs, 6 and 7 that demonstrate our project on the implementation framework, that is outlined in the disability capacity review this year as costing &euro;5.2 million.  There was only &euro;2.6 million provided for the establishment of a managed clinical network in community healthcare organisations 6 and 7.  That is only half of what is required to put in place that service.  As I said in our submission, that is the one development in the neurorehabilitation strategy, the addition of some inpatient beds in Peamount hospital and the development of two implementation teams in CHOs 6 and 7, none of which is on the ground yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Magdalen Rogers"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>This is something this committee definitely needs to support and to push for its implementation, something we all would be happy to do.  I will move on to the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers.<\/p><p>How do you envisage service provision changing to align with the UNCRPD?  To move towards ratification and full implementation of the UNCRPD we must promote and support independent living.  There is probably a need for personalised budgets so that people have a choice on how to live all aspects of their lives.  We had witnesses before us who talked about service provision and the difficulty they had in identifying a suitable placement, for example, for a school-leaver because many of the facilities were located in industrial estates and did not look like educational facilities.  Indeed, some services are quite poor in that regard.  I heard of a person who has Down syndrome and completed the leaving certificate but in the service was put to colour in pictures.  That caused regression rather than progression.  Many will say the service provided is of a one size fits all type, with a take it or leave it attitude.  We know one size does not fit all.  It has to accommodate all levels of need.  I note the witnesses state that their members have been in consultation on the new housing strategy.  Can they clarify please, is that the service users?   If we are properly to implement the UNCRPD, people with disabilities and DPOs need to be involved in the consultation, in line with the \"nothing about us without us\" concept.  To whom are the witnesses referring?<\/p><p> The witness also mentioned a collaborative approach undertaken by services together with the HSE during Covid-19.  Many people felt totally abandoned by service providers and the HSE during Covid-19, especially in the first six months.  Many people have said they had no support whatsoever and indeed they queried where the budget for their service user had gone in that time because they certainly did not receive any of it and they had additional costs during that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#C00400","speaker":"1513","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638403200,"counter":351,"content":"<p>On the question of imagining what services should look like in the future, in our opening statement we acknowledged the important lived experience that has been expressed.  We agree with Deputy Tully on the idea of \"nothing about us without us\" and the primacy of the lived experience and that voice.  From the service provider's perspective, which is the umbrella body we represent, there is a need for multiannual funding to enable planning.  I will address the first question on residential matters and then move on to the day supports.  The only options that have been funded in the past number of years have been the emergency crisis places.  Typically services are delivered too late in a traumatic situation when a primary carer, who is often an elderly parent, has passed away or has become ill.  If we imagine a series of steps on a ladder, people are receiving full-time residential support at the most traumatic time of the journey that it could happen.  If we could begin investing in multiannual planning, as witnesses in previous debates have talked about, the predictability of the service user's diagnosis allowing that planning, then we could have continual investment in more rights-based approaches such as personal assistants, personal budgets, the home support and moving up those steps of the ladder as appropriate, as required, and in line with the preference of the person.  That investment has not been available in the past number of years.  All that has been available was purely crisis and emergency response.  That is not delivered in a way that allows the person transition into it and develop his or her independent skills as a young adult or as an adult in his or her 20s or 30s who expresses the view that he or she wishes to live outside the family home of origin.  We are calling for the multilannual approach to planning, budgeting and delivery of service provision that responds to the UNCRPD and the ADM, and allows people to express and develop their independence in how they live.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the one size fits all day services, our ambition is to move far beyond that and to have a multilayered approach.  There have been many good initiates that need to be further developed.  There has been, for example, a wonderful series of transition planning developments where young people are approached two years before they leave school.  If we look at the WALK PEER programme, the Cumiskey Ross ability programme, the outcomes from supporting young people at that early stage have been fantastic.  That is what needs to be developed and improved.  It needs a cross-departmental approach to planning.  We call for the inclusion of career guidance for young people in special schools because without that we have very low ambitions which suggests that the only option would be a full-time day service placement when actually, what we should be looking at are employment and education opportunities for young people who attend special schools.  We do not have career guidance counselling in those locations at the moment.  There is a listening and an acknowledgement of the lived experience that has been expressed here.  There is openness on the part of service providers to develop in all the ways described.  There are initiatives under the New Directions programme and others that include such things as the transition planning.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the other two questions, on the consultation on the housing strategy, we would like to compliment the running of the consultation process for the new housing strategy.  It has been the most inclusive process I have been involved in during my time with the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers.  It has involved surveys of people with lived experience on both the steering committee developing the programme and in the consultation rounds, which have taken place with DPOs.  As a service provider umbrella body, we were involved in that steering committee alongside those organisations that represent people directly.  There is very much a holistic, collaborative approach to the development of the strategy.  It is probably a model that we would like to see replicated in future strategies.  It is inclusive of people with lived experience, service providers and the key stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the collaborative approach with the HSE during Covid-19, an immediate response was required to support people who lived in residential services, many of whom did not normally reside in their residential place until day services closed for public health reasons, and needed to be supported 24 hours a day in the residential space because they were not attending their day services.  This required the application of resources from the day service sector into residential supports to allow that support be provided.  When we examine the mortality and infection rates for persons with a disability who had significant risk factors at the beginning of the outbreak of Covid-19, in comparison with other jurisdictions, the outcomes have been relatively far fewer.  There has been a very low level of infection and a low level of mortality.  That has come with an enormous price for families who experienced reduced support in the day service locations during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We fully acknowledge the experiences Deputy Tully described.  We were in compassionate response to those families but the resources required to ensure a safe service was provided in residential services had an impact on families and we acknowledge that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alison Harnett"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I thank the witness.

I will address this to Ms Rogers.  I fully support the implementation of the strategy.  On the steering strategy, it seems that from 2019 to 2021 the group has met only twice and there has been no meeting this year.  That is a concern.  I ask that as a committee we write to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, requesting that this neurorehabilitation strategy and the steering group get back up and running.  Time is of the essence.  I ask that from today we fully support that.  Given that there are more than 26,000 members, both children and adults, are we really aware of the different strands of disability?<\/p><p>Have we actually got the correct data on this?  We have many different types of disability and everybody is trying to work together, but are there proper data?  How can we ensure disability awareness raising on the level that is needed by the UNCRPD across all sectors?  We need to develop a disability awareness raising strategy in line with the human rights and social model of disability and include a roll-out of all disability awareness raising for all staff of government and the departments of public bodies.  That is important because it is all about awareness and training.  I know people who are wheelchair users and they cannot even access some buildings.  Everybody needs training, including ourselves, so that we are more aware.  A lady contacted me three weeks ago whose daughter was in a horrific car accident with the mother, which left her in a wheelchair for life.  That mother cannot take her daughter on some footpaths, or bring her into some buildings.  Obtaining information is another issue.  These are the issues we need to address.  Another person with a bad disability contacted me.  He is in hospital and we cannot get him home because there are no homecare packages for him.  Funding is a huge issue.  We cannot allow this to happen to the most vulnerable people in our society, people with disabilities.  We must ensure there is funding.  We have a duty of care to children and adults with disabilities.  Is there a lack of communication within different Departments?  The witness spoke about housing and it is great to see they are working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  As councillors and Deputies we constantly fight for ramps, adaptation grants, bedrooms and heating.  People with some disabilities feel the cold and need extra heating.  We need to build more houses that are adapted to cater for specific disabilities.  We must give people the choice between going into care, staying at home, going to daycare services or maybe into a service where they can have both.  We have many criteria to meet, and part of this has to be in the strategy going forward.  We need to make sure the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage steps in here to do that.  Hopefully Ms Rogers and Mr. Hennessy can answer those questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#D00400","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638403200,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I might defer to one of my colleagues on the housing strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Hennessy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638403200,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I will speak about that.  There is a campaign currently underway to look for revision of Part M of the building regulations.  Currently Part M requires a certain proportion of wheelchair visitable accessibility, but without the accessibility becoming wheelchair liveable we will not be able to house people who have a need for wheelchair liveable housing.  It is important that universal design becomes part of the design features of many of the houses in the future.  As people's accessibility needs change, they can be met.  We are calling, along with all the other umbrella bodies and advocacy groups, for a review of Part M of the building regulations so that there is a minimum amount of the supply pipeline with wheelchair liveable rather than wheelchair visitable housing.  Those targets need to be part of the regulations.  Our experience is that there has not been wheelchair livable accommodation delivered to date.  The revision of Part M is potentially the area of concern, and the delivery of a pipeline of supply, because currently the supply is not meeting the demand for accessible housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alison Harnett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638403200,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I am happy to address some of those questions.  I thank the Deputy for giving us the opportunity to talk about these issues today.  Neurological disability is in a very chaotic, unclear and unstructured position at the moment.  We do not have data on the number of people with any of these conditions.  We have some minimal epidemiological data to give us the number of new cases that might be diagnosed but most of our data come from international studies extrapolated to Ireland.  We do not have a very clear picture of the number of people currently living with neurological disabilities and the impact of those disabilities on their conditions.  One of the challenges we have is that, because there is no clear strategy for what happens once a person is discharged from hospital, people fragment.  Many people disappear into the community and struggle on their own.  This is why many people describe themselves as being hidden.  They disappear into the community and try to manage their disability with the help of their families.  These are people who were living full lives and suddenly had everything change with a diagnosis, an injury or an illness. <\/p> <p>  In other cases family members have to use Google to find out the symptoms and where they can get treatment.  For any other illness a person would not have to find out what were their symptoms and what treatments were available.  If a person had a cancer diagnosis he or she would not need to find a radiation oncologist or find a chemotherapy service.  Many of our patients with brain injury have to do this.  They have to find a neurophysio, a neuropsychologist or neurologist.  In the case of epilepsy, mobility difficulties or balance problems, they have to find treatments themselves.  There is no coherent, consistent programme where somebody slots in and follows the person through discharge into the community, transitional living units - we have one or two possibly in the community - community neurorehabilitation and into long-term care.  The system is haphazard.<\/p> <p>  It is also haphazard based on where the person lives.  There are some spots in the east, in Dublin, and in Limerick and possibly in the south-west and Cork.  If a person with a disability lives along a line from the south-east up to the north-west there are very few services for them.  Access to services depends on where the person lives.  A person might be discharged to a community team and have some resources, or he or she might not, in which case it is up the person and his or her family to find the services.  Not only are family members trying to cope with the impact of the illness and disability but they are also trying to find services and treatments.  Some people return to work after a couple of weeks after a major brain injury and everything falls apart and they lose their jobs.  Some people never get back to work or education again.  We know the rehabilitation systems work.  They can help people and give them a structure.  The information and interventions these people get make a difference if they get them in a timely way.  We know from many international studies that even up to 40 years post-injury a person can still benefit from rehabilitation, if he or she gets it.  Some of the international data would suggest that 40% of people who are rough-sleepers have had a brain injury at some point and their lives have fallen apart for lack of services.  Prison populations have high rates of people with brain injuries.  We know there is a cost to this in regard to people's capacity to live independently, to participate in society.  We need to put in place the rehabilitation structures we know exist in many parts of the world.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Pender"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638403200,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I want to address part of Deputy Murnane O'Connor's question on housing.

Their experience and insight as service providers are essential to understanding how we improve disability supports, especially in the case where the majority of disability services are provided on behalf of the State by the voluntary sector.  My first question is for the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers.  If I have time afterwards, I have more questions.  I welcome the acknowledgement of the unmet needs of children's services and the urgent need for multiannual investment.  I raised these issues last week with the HSE and with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman.  The disability services programme is currently failing due to a lack of staff and resources.  Using my constituency as an example, although I am sure it is the case in many constituencies, we have worryingly long waiting lists for assessments, not to mention incredibly poor access to therapies.  After assessment it may be that a year and a half later a person has only received an hour or two of those essential therapies.  The federation is at the front line of a situation where it is caught between inadequate Government funding and the needs of children and young people with whom it works.  The federation referenced the Department's capacity review, which says it all.  The Department in its own review said we need &euro;350 million to meet the unmet needs of people with disabilities, and then there was an additional &euro;65 million allocated.  Of course, it has not come close.  Will the witness outline what needs to be done to address the issues in that area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#F00300","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638403200,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I will address that.  In regard to the children's services, there are two things we would say.  First, the progressing disability services, PDS, model is being implemented throughout the country.  In part of the country it was implemented several years ago, in other parts the transition is taking place just this year.  It represents a huge upheaval of services.  Teams are being merged, people are moving from one team to another, and during or immediately after that transition teams are probably not at maximum productivity.  We advocate that completing the transition as quickly as possible and getting those teams functioning and firing on all cylinders is important.  We notice that parts of the country that reconfigured as far back as 2013 are running better than parts that are in the midst of the reconfiguration.  Getting that reconfiguration completed and running as quickly as possible is important.<\/p> <p>  The other aspect, which is unavoidable, is resourcing.  There were waiting lists before the new children's model PDS came into place, and they remain afterwards.  There are more than 90 child development network teams, CDNTs, throughout the country.  There is significant disparity of resourcing among teams.  There are teams with good ratios of staff to children being supported, but there are other networks where resourcing is a long way short.  We advocate for multiannual programme funding particularly to bring the resourcing of the CDNTs up to levels adequate to meet the needs to get timely issuing of initial assessments, family support plans, and timely interventions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Hennessy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638403200,"counter":363,"content":"<p>Speaking on the progressing disability services, many networks reconfigured only in October, moving from the unidisciplinary to the multidisciplinary model and that family centred practice.  There has been good progress on working with the HSE and other lead agencies, and I acknowledge that.  It is about equity of access for children also.  What that has resulted in though, from the mapping exercise, there are some networks that have increased from maybe 900 children up to what they thought might be 1,300 children and now might be 1,800 children.  That exercise is ongoing to see what resources are needed.  Significant funding was received and recently another 100 therapists were recruited and governmental funding came down for that.  Much of that is at basic therapy level.  One of the things we need to look at going forward is the conversion from basic to therapy grades.  Because many networks reconfigured at the same time, there are large recruitment gaps.  When going out to the market, networks are looking for the same individuals.  It was useful to see that collaboration approach in one of the Government's action plans with third level education because in the coming years we will need further training courses for therapists.  Between now and 2032 there is &euro;54 million identified for children's services.  Much of that is with front-line services.  Much work has been done but we are looking at that intervention so that we can get people off the waiting lists.  Early intervention involves building up the skills of therapists and specialists across the areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Natalya Jackson"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I appreciate the responses and I understand the reconfiguration is important.  As Mr. Hennessy said, sometimes allocation of staff for that reconfiguration falls short.  In one very populous area there is 0.5 of a nurse or 0.5 of a physiotherapist allocated.  The concern is that even when those reconfigurations happen, without the funding the Department decided was required, the people will be still on those waiting lists.  When they finally are assessed they sometimes do not get the services they need.  As a committee we will keep pushing for adequate funding to be allocated.  We understand the pressure that puts on those network teams that try to provide a service and lack the resources.  Another thing that was noted was poor supports that respect and enable individual's independence such as personal assistants and supported independent living, and somebody referenced the geographical lottery with respect to this.  Whether a person can access independent supported living depends on the part of the country in which a person lives.  This is a tricky question that was highlighted both in recent weeks and throughout the past year by several witnesses who came before the committee.  Will the witness elaborate on how we can put in place a system that can guarantee independence in line with article 19 of the UNCPRD.  That is a question for the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers.<\/p> <p>  The Neurological Alliance of Ireland highlighted the current shortage of services for neurological conditions and the increasing numbers of people affected by those conditions.

As an umbrella group of service providers, the national federation has been looking at this question of independent supported living for quite a number of years.  It developed a community practice which was a shared earning space for more than 26 organisations collaborating to look at how to develop individualised supports into the future and where it was possible to do so.  There have been many different areas of support and little initiatives such as the Genio grants, and there has been the service reform fund.<\/p><p>These initiatives have allowed us to put in place options for a range of people and to share learning, with the person with the lived experience sharing his or her experience of what it is like to change.  People have described what it was like to live in congregated settings and then move to independent living and having their lives transformed.  We learn the most from the people who shared their experiences, as well as their families, the people who support them at the front line and all the way to the management.  It is a question of how you develop that.  We have learned that the outcomes from the Next Steps shared learning are that it is possible to provide independent supported living for people of all ranges of needs, and support requirements.  What is required, and it is probably going to be the theme of today, is the multiannual investment programme.  If we continue to respond only to the crisis and emergency situations, that is typically going to be very expensive, without the kinds of outcomes we are talking about, where people get to choose the kind of support and life they need.  The choice to live alone or to live with other people, in student accommodation as a third level student or to live near one's employment is not possible when responding in a crisis.  We have proven that in Ireland it is possible to provide the supports for people to have wonderful outcomes in their lives, to experience independence in a way they have not up to now. That is the case with people with all ranges of ability and needs.  We know it can work, and with the correct investment it will work.  It is about developing at the different stages and levels that people need.  Some people have complex medical requirements that will require nursing support.  Other people require a couple of hours support, with somebody to look in and ensure they get a little help with cooking or buying groceries.  We should not provide the top level of support unless that is required because it impacts on people's independence.  To be able to do that, we need multiannual funding to allow us develop those options at the right time in a person's life, to respond to the person's will and preference. <\/p><p> On the other side of the coin, as adults without disabilities, people have the choice to move out of their family home of origin at a particular time in life when it is right for them and their families have the opportunity to plan for a future.  Many family carers are living into their 70s and 80s and have not had the opportunity to plan nor the visibility into the future for their loved one.  That is not right for the person who is supported and may wish to live independently and it is not good for the health and well-being of the elderly carers.  The acknowledgement in the disability capacity review of those cohorts of people has been very welcome.  What we need to do now - apologies for giving the same answer to many of the questions - is to get the multiannual investment programme to allow us to implement those things. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alison Harnett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I call the witnesses from the Neurological Alliance of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#G00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638403200,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I will let Dr. Pender reply to Deputy Cairns's question on the impact because that is something he sees every day.

It is not just about hospital beds, but the full range of supports to live well with these conditions.

The impact goes across a range of functions because the complexity of the brain is so difficult and so high.  A person can have significant physical disabilities which limit his or her capacity to interact with the world physically, and that may be paralysis, substantial hemiparesis, limb difficulties, visual or auditory sensory problems, headaches, balance difficulties, but also the hidden pieces which are more challenging.  This is the piece we see from the relatives when people come back, such as the psychological, cognitive or behavioural piece.  People present with difficulties around memory, language, controlling the world, planning, problem solving, sometimes volatile emotion or depression and anxiety.  About 40% to 50% of relationships do not survive a severe brain injury.  They break down because there are no supports.  The person is different, the role has changed.  Many patients with severe brain injury do not get back to work.  Younger people do not get back to college and they are stuck at home.  They need substantial support.  Organisations such as Headway, Acquired Brain Injury Ireland and Quest Brain Injury Services in Galway are voluntary bodies which do a great deal of work to try to get people back, but it is a drop in the ocean.  The people they see should have gone through a year or two of complex neurodisability before they even get to these organisations; this should be only at the last stage.  At the moment the voluntary bodies are scrabbling around for funding to provide these services for people living in the community who are trying to get back into the world again.  It could be anything, such as trying to get to the shops to get food, which is an enormous task for somebody after a brain injury, who may be forgetful, have a memory deficit or may be irritable.  During the early stages of Covid-19 we saw how patients could not learn the new things so they were getting into difficult situations about masks and social distancing because they just did not understand the new rules.  That caused all kinds of conflict.<\/p> <p>  There was a question earlier about information.  Most people do not understand a brain injury, because in many cases the people look the same.  This is similar to the autism issue where people look normal yet struggle with an enormous degree of difficulty on a daily basis.  Add in the care-giver piece where a relative, sometimes a child, is trying to care for the relative, trying to get his or her life back and get him or her back into the community again.  It is such a struggle.  I see people coming back into the clinic maybe a year after being discharged.  An acquired brain injury such as a car accident or coming off a bicycle - I see two or three bicycle injuries every week involving concussion - can knock people out for a year after the accident because they do not have services and cannot get back to work or college; they struggle and their moods deteriorate.  We see it after sports concussions.  They are at the tip of the icebergs in terms of the mildness.  At the extreme end of severe brain injury where people need residential care, we have young people maybe in their 20s in nursing homes for the elderly and they are sitting in the corner of a room without resources of any kind.  The impact on a daily basis on somebody with a neurodisability is enormous and it takes its toll on the family.  There is a famous quote that a brain injury is a family affair.  It takes its tolls across the family.  Relationships unfortunately often break down.  Young children are really affected by an adult with a brain injury in the family.  Their lives change overnight and there are no resources to facilitate that.  They should get family therapy and counselling as well.  That is the importance of the neurorehabilitation strategy.  It outlines the continuum of care that people should get from the point of their initial diagnosis and early treatment when everybody is optimistic.  They go from a point that, with a devastating diagnosis of a brain injury, they survive, they get out of the acute hospital and everything is great and positive, and suddenly they are lost.  They have no idea where to go or to whom to turn.  That is why the neurodisability strategy and neurorehabilitation strategy are so important, because they provide that framework and scaffolding that allows them to benefit from neurorehabilitation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Pender"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":370,"content":"<p>If members could bear with me.

Then you are back into day-to-day life, with all of its very different tasks that are different from what you were just focusing on.

Will Dr. Pender comment on what community based rehabilitation services exist and how they can be resourced?  Are they uneven?  <\/p><p> The witness from the federation mentioned engagement and I have a question arising from that conversation.  What does the national federation's engagement on the housing strategy look like?  Is that central?  For example, every local authority area, as I understand it, is doing a housing needs assessment at the moment.  That is a ground up piece of how the housing needs of persons with disabilities are being addressed.  Is it being recognised in the housing needs at that level, and not just in hard numbers, that there will be a large cohort of people with disabilities, many of whom will be in households?<\/p><p> On the more top down piece, this committee has raised concerns about the inadequacy of things like Part M of the building regulations.  Certainly, others in the committee and I have raised issues in regard to the national development plan and the importance, not just in health facilities, but in all of our buildings, that we have conversations around disability.  Is the federation using its engagement to push forward universal design as a general standard? <\/p><p> There are a couple of projects that the federation had prior to the UNCRPD, including the next steps programme, the informing families programme and a number of programmes within that.  Have the programmes all been reviewed now in terms of the new empowerment frame of the UNCRPD, that is, the rights-based approach?  How has the federation examined its own programmes?  This committee has been looking at reframing things; it is not just about getting services to people but it is about the empowerment frame as well.  The three programmes I am interested in are the next steps, the informing families and the older persons working group.  I used to work with Older &amp;amp; Bolder and there is much overlap there.  Is there a common engagement or common cause that has been found in terms of pushing the agenda?  Universal design is one example.  <\/p><p>  Retrofitting and adaptation tend to be separate tracks at the moment and I have been pushing for them.  However, for example, people with disabilities and older people often spend more time at home and are more vulnerable in terms of fuel poverty.  Should there be an all-in-one grant for people that combines retrofitting and adaptation?<\/p><p> Mr. Hennessy mentioned multi-annual funding and we all heard him; it is clearly important.  Within multi-annual funding, is it important to build in flexibility to allow for response?  Instead of getting three years to do the same thing, would it be better to have a guarantee of three-year funding that comes with flexibility so that those who are using the service can give feedback about what does and does not work or what needs adaptation, so that feedback can be met with flexibility, responsiveness and empowerment?  What is the importance of non-directed funding, that is, funding that allows for a response to a demand or request?   <\/p><p> There were comments made on the personal needs assistant.  The statutory requirement to home care that was due in the programme for Government is now being supplanted and there is beginning to be something of a statutory entitlement - or should be a statutory entitlement - to personal needs assistants.  Both are, of course, important.  What progress has been made in terms of that statutory entitlement to home care or to, also importantly, personal needs assistants?  Until there is a statutory entitlement, people will still have a dependence on a patchwork on public and private provision.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#G00600","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Who would like to lead off on Senator Higgins's points?

The housing agency is co-ordinating the strategy consultation so it may be in a position to provide others, but we can certainly provide our housing submission if that is useful to the committee.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Part M of the building regulations and the need for the pipeline, in both our response to the draft State initial report and the UNCRPD and in our housing submission we have been advocating for welcoming communities.  It is not only about having housing that is specifically for people with disabilities; it is about having universally designed housing that is adaptable as people's needs change.  It is about having housing that is usable for young parents with buggies, for an elderly person who might have walking and mobility requirements and that is adaptable for people with disabilities.  As Mr. Hennessy outlined earlier, there can be many different reasons a person might need an accessible approach.  This can include additional space, for instance, to ensure that somebody can stay overnight with the person who needs support, or it can be for the storage of equipment.  Therefore, flexibility in responsiveness in the allocation of social housing is required so that it can be understood that there may be additional space needed in response to particular needs and that a universal design may be required.  That is something we would strongly support.  <\/p> <p>  As we have earlier outlined, there are specific requirements that need to be upgraded in relation to the wheelchair liveable rather than wheelchair visitable.  Welcoming communities would be the track that we have taken.  It is for everybody and it needs to be welcoming.  It would benefit everybody if we have welcoming communities and housing supply.  This should be included in the built environment in our communities and not just in our homes, because there is no point in having accessible homes that one cannot get to.  That means looking at transport and the paving outside the home as well what happens inside the home.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our projects and whether we have reviewed them in light of the UNCRPD, we were as thrilled as everybody else in 2018 when the State ratified the UNCRPD.  However, of course the UNCRPD had been available to us before the State ratified it.<\/p><p>Rather than reviewing, and we need to constantly review our work, we set up those projects in line with the UNCRPD.  The Informing Families project is a set of evidence based best practice guidance that was developed in collaboration with families, service providers and healthcare professionals throughout hospital community and disability services to look at the way in which we provide the diagnosis to families.  We were told by families that many of them were not being given a hopeful outlook when being given the news of their child's disability.  This is what we are talking about when we speak about the options that are there later in life and the ambition that we have for young people in their schools, employment and education.  We need to help professionals to see disability as only one factor in a person's identity.  We need to support families to celebrate the birth of a new person who has a disability as one aspect of his or her identity and that he or she is a brother, daughter, son, a welcome member of the family who will have additional challenges and support needs.  Informing Families is hoping to develop that understanding from the very first moment a child is born, that we all need to have welcoming communities, as a society.  Within Next Steps it is utterly possible for people to be supported at the best level of their potential.  It is about beginning that from the first transition, which is the moment a family is informed a child has a disability.  We developed those post the 2006 development of the UNCRPD so we were very much enabled and facilitated in our work through the thinking in regard to the UNCRPD.  We certainly did that in Next Steps as well.  We thought about what the UNCRPD asks us to do.  It is around developing people's independence and supporting them in the choices they would like to make.  <\/p><p> The older person's working group is a very exciting piece of work because it collaborates with the Trinity Centre for Ageing and Intellectual Disability, which through The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, the IDS-TILDA project, identified key health inequalities that exist for people with intellectual disabilities, specifically older people.  Through that, as service providers we listen to that research and to what are those health inequalities.  It is important to link that back in with mainstream policies.  Looking at the Healthy Ireland framework, a very healthy development in the past two years has been the development of the national memory clinic for people with intellectual disabilities.  People who have a potential diagnosis of dementia have access to this pathway to have their diagnosis assessed.  That had been unavailable in many communities.  Some parts of the country had access to memory clinic services and others did not.  The National Federation is part of the steering committee of the national memory clinic.  There are many opportunities for us and we need to continue to develop all the time.  We must continue reviewing and challenging ourselves in our practice.  Through those initiatives we look specifically at what the UNCRPD asks us to do as service providers.  Those initiatives aim to do that.  <\/p><p> In regard to retrofitting, adaptation, cost, and fuel poverty, as a group of six umbrella bodies we strongly call for the Cost of Disability Research report to be published so that those additional challenges that might exist for people with disabilities in their homes, with heating and many other areas of their lives, could be responded to through a cost of disability payment.  I agree with Senator Higgins that there needs to be a co-ordinated approach to retrofitting and any other initiatives.  <\/p><p> I will defer to my colleague on the question around flexibility and how we support our budgets. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alison Harnett","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638403200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>On the the question of flexibility within multiannual funding, we would certainly advocate that within that funding there would be ring-fenced funding for a series of progressive models to support people at differing levels.  In terms of home support, supported living, semi-independent living and support packages, the Disability Capacity review identified that 64% of the funding went on full-time residential support.  That will be still important in the future.  It is important today, but we would like to think that in the future the funding will be directed at a range of models rather than such a high proportion going to one model.  In regard to the statutory entitlement schemes on homecare, I would like to raise the point that as they exist and are envisaged, those seem to refer to people over the age of 65.  For a person with a disability, age-related needs typically kick in much earlier, possibly as early as the late 40s or early 50s, and that needs to be recognised in any such scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Hennessy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638403200,"counter":379,"content":"<p>To come back to Senator Higgins's point about the gaps in community services, and where they exist, we in Neurological Alliance of Ireland, along with the Disability Federation of Ireland, are embarking on a project in 2022 to map where community neurorehabilitation services exist and where they do not.  While that is an important piece of work, there has to be a context for it.  I stress to the committee that we are in limbo.  People with neurodisabilities in Ireland are in limbo at the moment because of the lack of progress on implementing the neurorehabilitation strategy.  Unless that is active and up and running, we do not have a space to which to bring the outcomes of that mapping in order to identify the gaps.

We are highlighting the shortage of neurology nurses.  Sometimes there is confusion about what is neurology and what is neurorehabilitation.

We find that neurology is under pressure because there are no neurorehabilitation services.<\/p><p>The same problems and issues that arise with long-term disability are coming back to knock on the door of neurology because the services do not exist in the community.

At the end of the day, these patients do not have the services they need.  <\/p><p> In response to the Deputy's question on why the strategy has not been implemented, from our side in the neurological alliance, sitting on that steering group and not having it meet is a reason.  As I said, it has met only twice since the framework was launched in 2019; it did not meet at all in 2021.  For us, that has to be seen as a lack of will and a lack of commitment.  I understand there have been issues with staffing changes in the HSE and that has been outlined to us.  We have been told by the HSE that there is a commitment to the strategy group meeting in 2022.  It is critical that meeting happens because there has been effectively no progress on this implementation plan, and we cannot put that down to Covid.  It was happening before Covid.  We have had a decade to implement the strategy.  It is not just the three-year implementation plan; the strategy was published ten years ago this year and we have seen a lack of implementation and a lack of support for it.

There seems to be a mishmash of services and breakdowns of services and no joined up thinking.  For example, when a young couple is told their child has autism or is diagnosed with something, they find it very hard to access the services.  They do not understand where they need to go.  There does not seem to be a communication network where one step leads to another step and there is a clear pathway.  They go to see somebody and get an assessment and think that is it.  Then they realise they have to go some place else but are not told that.  They have to do all of this with the trauma of coming to terms with everything that might be happening to their child.  What should be implemented so that the services, especially for children, are co-ordinated in a way that can be brought into adulthood for people who have special needs?  I presume this is the whole area of co-ordination and leadership.  Even accessing the information seems to be a problem.

First, we mentioned that the progressing disability services need to be fully completed, because they are still a work in progress in many parts of the country.  That is an issue because a person must go from unit disciplinary teams where they might have gone to one service for autism, another service for physical disability and another service for intellectual disability.  Having a single point of contact is important.  That is in place in parts of the country.  It is not in place in others, but it is getting there.  The urgent completion of that is very important.  Identifying teams with significant caseloads where the resourcing needs to come up to the levels as they are around country is hugely important.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the pathways, co-ordination between education and disability service, particularly on pathways through life, is an area that could be improved, for example, through education into employment and into services.

It can be difficult sometimes to identify whether it is the support need or the housing need that drives the adaptation.  This can lead to a situation where responsibility is not clear and that leads to a lack of meeting that adaptation cost.  Much of the advocacy work that has gone into the new strategy - which obviously has not been published yet - has been taking place to support a very clear delineation of where the budget lines should be for the different types of adaptation and what the ceilings should be.  Ultimately, if a person's adaptation need is a little higher than what is at the ceiling, but it means that person can remain in the home and not access a residential place then, obviously, it is good value for the State.  What we need to see in the new housing strategy is the State acting in one strategy.  For example, if we in the support side and somebody on the housing side are taking different approaches, the person can fall between two stools.  Departmental responsibility is crucial.

That is having an impact on accessing grant supplement which, again, is in breach of their rights and we get back to the UNCRPD.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Harnett's point about accessibility goes back to the whole area of decongregation.  There are a lot of residents with intellectual disabilities who could and should live in the community, but to avail of community houses there are significant adaptations needed.  Sometimes the funding, through the various county councils, from the capital assistance scheme, CAS, does not meet the considerable financial requirements that go into those housing models.  Again, this should form part of the housing strategy.

Unfortunately, she cannot be here.  First of all, I wish to express my thanks to all of our guests this morning.  It is interesting to hear their comments and presentations.  I am well aware, from people and groups I know, of the great work that Dr. Pender is doing. <\/p> <p>  I strongly support the comments of my colleague from the west, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, in relation to the neurology department at University Hospital Galway, UHG.  I was told there are four specialist nurses there and they probably need about 12 or 13.  I was reading some documentation only last week about this from the Neurological Alliance of Ireland.  It made a very good point that if we had the extra nurses there, it could be a cost efficient way of reducing waiting lists and dealing with hospital resources.  Obviously, a consultation process may show that some of the people suffering with neurological issues do not need to be hospitalised.  Therefore, if there were extra nurses to make contact with and to advise people in a certain way, it would be very helpful.<\/p><p> Dr. Pender might be the person best able to answer my next question, but I would welcome a comment from any of the witnesses.  I know a number of people who are suffering from neurological conditions, particularly back pain, and they cannot get identified as a person with a disability.  I am speaking not about people who have back pain for six weeks, but people who have intermittent back pain over many years.  I know people who, owing to accidents, have artificial hips or knees.  While for the rest of their lives they can live near normally, many of them suffer extraordinary pain.  When it comes to a person being identified as a person with a disability, is there anything we can do to change the goalposts in that regard?  I am sure all of our witnesses would agree that there are a number of people in Irish society who suffer continuous pain, much of it back pain, but they cannot access any of our disability services.<\/p><p> On the issue of ensuring that all people with disabilities can access public health services, as a public representative I meet many people who have a family member with a disability for whom they cannot access disability services.  Some of them are entitled to those services.  In fairness to the HSE and others, when one brings forward a case it is looked after.  Why are some people falling through the cracks when they should be eligible as of right?  I am sure my political colleagues have come across this issue as well.  I would welcome comments from all of the witnesses on how we can ensure that people with disabilities across all groups can access public health services without having to seek the assistance of a politician?  We do not mind helping people, but access should be there of right.  People should not have to going looking for it.  I again thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I look forward to hearing their responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#K00900","speaker":"1674","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638403200,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising those issues.  He is correct on both counts.  Chronic and long-term pain or neurodisability is extremely common and it can be treated with a multidisciplinary pain management programme, but not everybody has access to those programmes and not everybody can get access to them in the region in which they live, as highlighted by the Senator in regard to Galway.  The same issues arise across the country in local areas and local hospitals, where people have to fight extremely hard to get access to the services they need.  Pain management and long-term, chronic pain in the context of neurodisability is horrendous.  It is incredibly disabling.  It disrupts people's lives and it means they cannot work.  They struggle.  As stated by the Senator, sometimes the pain is intermittent.  Most of it is back pain, but it can involve headache and any other limb and joint pain arising from the injury and disability.  I fully agree that these people need access quickly.  That is part of the joined up thinking piece we want to bring together in the new rehabilitation strategy, no matter what the issue.  There are a range of a complexities.  It could be cognitive, pain or motor but usually we end up seeing a constellation of pain, physical disability, cognitive impairment and psychological distress or mental health problems.  Those four issues are the pillars that people experience after a neurological injury or with a neurological disability.  They need someone to guide them into the services and access to them.<\/p> <p>  The access piece for neurodisability is really challenging because these people do not know where to go or what services exist.  To be honest, most people are thrown into these neurological disabilities without any knowledge.  I have relatives and friends who have a family member with a disability asking me where they can get help for their relative.  I cannot tell them, because I do not know; the information does not exist.  It is heartbreaking to see people almost begging for help, desperate to get access to the help and resources they need, which is sometimes dependent on where they live or what their difficulties are.  We need a process where people do not have to fight for access to services.  When you have a family member with a neurological disability or any of the other disabilities we are hearing about today, the person dealing with it, the carer, may not have the energy to fight for the services.  Many of these people suffer their own mental health problems.  We know that the subjective and objective burden from care-giving is enormous, particularly in neurodisability.  The subjective burden of dealing with somebody who has perhaps light chronic pain or a psychological difficulty is enormous.  It cannot be seen, but it is hugely demanding.  The caregivers also do not have time or the energy to go looking for services and to fight for them.  Nevertheless, the first thing I hear from many of the people I see at my clinic is that they are exhausted trying to fight for services and that they have gone to everybody possible for help.  Nobody should have to fight for services and their right to get treatment for their neurological condition or their disability when we know those treatments exist and that they are very effective.  <\/p> <p>  I support 100% the Senator's remarks.  For us in neurological disability, implementation of that document will help us start the ball rolling.  We are still light years behind what I am hearing discussed today in terms of housing and the other issues.  We are far behind that even now.  The trauma plan has been instigated such that we will have excellent state-of-the-art trauma services for people following injury.  More people are surviving and so more people will be left with long-term disability and difficulties from these injuries.  We need to have somewhere for them to go and we need to have a clearly mapped out plan such that they do not have to fight and battle for services.  We do not need to add to their disability.  At this moment in time, the system around the infrastructure is increasing and adding to their disability when it does not need to.  That makes the pain worse.  It makes the emotional pain and the mental health worse as well.  I wish I had a clearer answer.  We have a pathway already laid out in the neurorehabilitation strategy, which will get us on the ladder and get scaffolding around people, but we still have a long way to go in terms of having the state-of-the-art services.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Pender"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Pender.

There is a real need for everybody to be cognisant of safeguarding that access and that connection as disability moves into a different Department.

With regard to the question on people with a disability not accessing services they should be accessing, we would advocate that the UNCRPD and the rights enshrined within it need to be seen as a whole-of-government response.  There has been a tendency in the past to look at a person with a disability at all times through the prism of that disability.  We need to accept that while a person may have a disability, that is just one aspect of his or her life.  That person is a citizen, a member of a community, a son, a brother, a neighbour, a friend.  We need to take the view that persons with disabilities should not access everything through disability services.  We need to see access through all parts of the public services be that health, mental health, transport, housing, elder care and so on.  All of those must be brought into line with the UNCRPD and all must be disability-proofed so that a person with a disability can access them directly without having to go through disability services or, indeed, a public representative.

There is an issue in regard to the strategy and the group not having met yet, which we will take up and follow through on because that is totally and absolutely unacceptable.<\/p><p>Some witnesses and members spoke of the challenges all families face in accessing diagnoses and therapies and the change in the reconfiguration of services that has caused a major upheaval.

Some of the service providers with which I have been dealing have raised the issue of getting independent insurance.  A great deal of their fund-raising goes towards paying their insurance costs alone, not towards covering the cost of the services required for people with disabilities.  The voluntary organisations have provided a massive service during the past 50 years since they started off in the late 1960s and they have stepped in where the State abandoned the provision of such services.  There is now an attempt by the HSE to abandon the voluntary organisations and to streamline the services into the HSE.  That would result in the loss of the community based agenda of those services and the ethos underpinning them which is to try to help everybody and to provide for them in their own communities.  I have a number of issues with respect to all of that.  We will discuss the unmet needs for disability services.  We will also discuss the strategy group not having met, which is unacceptable.  Meetings can be arranged electronically at present.  There is no issue about that.  We will follow up on that.

The sustainability of the voluntary sector is something we have called for in our response to the disability action plan 2022-2025.  With respect to the relationship based supports, people who have a disability are often people who are supported throughout their lifetime by the voluntary service providers.  That continuity and relationship based support is very challenged when there is a large turnover in the volume of staff and there are particular challenges for our entire sector.  Currently, there are staffing recruitment and retention challenges throughout various sectors but we are experiencing it very acutely in the disability services.  That is challenging our ability to move forward with some of the issues about which we spoke this morning.  There are particular challenges for different sectors within our membership.<\/p> <p>  Given the current challenging recruitment environment, and the Chairman referred to staff increments and pay, recruitment is an even more acute challenge for section 39 organisations.  While we very much welcome the pay restoration process that has been in place, the gap between section 38 organisations and HSE funded services and those provided by section 39 organisations continues to grow.  The ultimate problem with that, with respect to a person supported by an organisation, is that the level to which an organisation can expect its staff to remain and be sustained should not depend on the funding arrangement in place with the State.  We consider there is a need for a workforce planning stream within the disability capacity review action plan that would take account of the entirety of the sector, regardless of which funding arrangement is in place with the State.  All our members are very challenged with respect to staff recruitment and retention.  There is also a need to specifically examine those issues that are particular to section 39 organisations.<\/p> <p>  In terms of insurance, access to the clinical indemnity scheme would be the ideal solution for those service providers which cannot access it currently.  That would alleviate some of those difficulties to which the Chairman rightly referred.   <\/p> <p>  In terms of the community focus our organisations bring, we have voluntary service provider boards and community connection throughout every village and town in Ireland.  We need to be able to maintain those staffing levels to be able to continue to make connections and provide that relationship-based support.  We believe there is significant importance attached to the independent review group dialogue forum with respect to teasing out some of the issues, to which the Chairman referred, and ensuring the value of the voluntary sector, as identified by the Catherine Day report, is reflected in the working through of the relationship between the State and the voluntary sector.  We are committed to the implementation of the recommendations in the Catherine Day report and are very much engaged in the dialogue forum.  We are hopeful of very significant outcomes from that process to deal with those issues about which the Chairman spoke, which are around understanding and valuing what the voluntary sector brings to the State with respect to disability services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alison Harnett"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Harnett for her response.

Maintaining services, which are very much human services and people dependent services, is a real issue.  Our sense is that it is probably a medium-term issue.  I do not think this issue will disappear with the pandemic unemployment payment or the Covid-19 crisis.  It is more complex.  There is a significant job of work to be done for our sector and member organisations on how we attract and retain staff into the future.  We will have to work harder domestically on that and we will probably have to consider overseas recruitment.  This will be a medium-term issue, particularly if we can persuade the State to resource the unmet need identified in the capacity review.  That will require a significant uplift from a base where we are struggling to maintain what we have.   There is a considerable job of work to be done in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Insurance is an ongoing issue for many people who are providing services.  The nature of disability services is that they have a risk profile.  Many of the organisations which supply those services are relatively small.  Therefore, their negotiating power in getting insurance is limited.  I will mention two issues in that respect.  As well as the clinical indemnity scheme, the general indemnity scheme operated by the State Claims Agency has been extended to some disability service providers.  It has proved enormously helpful when it has happened.  If that could be widened, it would make an enormous contribution.  There is the wider issue of competition for some categories of insurance.  If one is lucky, one will have one underwriter.  They can dictate terms to organisations.  There may be a case to be made for setting up a collective purchasing scheme.  Regardless of whether that would be organised on a statutory basis of privately, it would contribute.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the sustainability of the voluntary bodies, the relationship between the HSE and the voluntary service providers during the past ten years probably has not been as good as it is now.  There has been a very heavy focus on governance which is necessary.  Public funding is being provided and there must be accountability for it.  There has not been enough of an emphasis on partnership working.  That improved significantly during the course of the Covid-19 crisis.  However, we  should not rely on a crisis to fix these things.  We cannot assume that just because it has improved during the Covid-19 crisis, it would stay that way.  There is a body of work to be done by the HSE and by the voluntary sector to improve that relationship and particularly to get partnership working on solutions.  We attach considerable importance to the dialogue with the voluntary bodies being chaired by Peter Cassells.  That needs to produce outcomes that sustain the recent improvement in that relationship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021120200002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Hennessy"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for attending and for giving of their time and expertise.

I would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to speak to members and for its consideration of my Department&rsquo;s Supplementary Estimate for 2021.  Following approval by the Government, my Department is seeking a net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;267 million for 2021.  This is a significant supplementary requirement from my Department and represents a variation on the Department&rsquo;s overall net allocation for 2021 of some 3%.  One of the main drivers of this requirement is my Department&rsquo;s ongoing response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on our schools, for example, increased substitution, personal protective equipment, PPE, and additional staff.  We have continued our broader programme of investment in our schools, such as our significant investment in schools&rsquo; information and communications technology, ICT.  We have also continued to progress much-needed school building projects in light of the significant pressure on the schools building programme.<\/p> <p>  My Department has provided detailed briefing on this Supplementary Estimate for members but I will briefly outline the key elements for the information of the committee.  There is an additional pay requirement in the school sector of &euro;60 million under a number of subheads.  For context, the pay allocation for the schools sector is more than &euro;5.6 billion in 2021 and, therefore, this represents a variation of some 1%.  Payroll for school teaching and non-teaching staff spans four subheads in Vote 26, three of which require additional allocations with one showing a saving.  The overall excess is mainly due to the need to allocate funding for staffing resources in schools, in particular, for the new Covid learning and support scheme, CLASS.  This scheme is designed to mitigate learning loss and support pupil and student mental health and well-being in light of the impact of school closures in 2020 and 2021.  The scheme commenced in October of this year.<\/p> <p>  An allocation is also required to meet the 1% pay increases for staff in the sector from 1 October 2021, which were not provided for in the original Revised Estimates Volume, REV, and a range of other payroll subhead pressures that are being partly offset by a reduction in substitution costs arising from school closures in January to March 2021.  An additional &euro;8 million, which equates to a 0.6% increase, is required to meet the projected cost of superannuation for retiring school staff.  The latest projected number of teacher retirements and the individual cost of pension lump sum payments arising in 2021 are greater than originally forecast.  An additional allocation of &euro;58 million is required to cover the cost of a further round of Covid-related capitation grants paid to schools in September.  Members will recall that the REV included an allocation for such grants for terms 2 and 3 of the 2020-21 year.<\/p><p>Given the uncertainty surrounding Covid-19, it was previously flagged to the committee that an allocation in respect of term 1 would be made at a later point.  I am pleased that schools have now received funding to enable them to replenish stocks of PPE and hand sanitiser and to meet enhanced cleaning and supervision costs for the current term.  I can also confirm that it is my intention that a further such payment will be made to schools in early 2022 for the next term of the school year.<\/p><p> A significant additional capital allocation is also provided for in this Supplementary Estimate.  A sum of &euro;102 million of this allocation is by way of investment in ICT in our schools.  A sum of &euro;52 million is being provided under the national recovery and resilience programme for two projects in the education sector.  One is to support learners in schools who are most at risk of educational disadvantage because of lack of access to appropriate digital infrastructure.  The other strand, which has now commenced, aims to provide high-speed broadband to those primary schools where the national broadband plan, NBP, and commercial provision will not be in place to provide the required level of connectivity.  The funding for these projects is being front-loaded by the Exchequer but will be reimbursed from the EU's recovery and resilience fund.  Further ICT funding is included for schools.  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;98 million in capital funding is being sought for my Department's schools building programme.  The reason for the Supplementary Estimate requirement is significant budgetary pressure driven primarily by a strong spend and delivery in 2021 across the entire programme.  This strong delivery has been facilitated by the continued progression of schools building projects during the Covid period to support the operation of the school system.  This includes provision for an early payment of the minor works grants to all primary schools.  This is particularly important in supporting schools to manage any ventilation issues at school level.  A saving of &euro;20 million on school transport is also being taken into account in this Supplementary Estimate.  This projected saving is mainly due to the reduced costs arising during the school closures at the start of 2021.<\/p><p> An estimated additional &euro;53 million in appropriations-in-aid in excess of the amount provided for in the original REV allocations is included in this Supplementary Estimate and will partly offset the expenditure pressures I have outlined.  The bulk of this additional income is represented by increased pension contributions, with some additional funding having been received due to refunds by schools of unspent Covid grants.<\/p><p> I am happy to discuss these issues in more detail.  I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021120200002#A00500","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her opening statement.

It has been a very enlightening conversation for everybody involved, especially the members of the education committee.

When does the Minister envisage being able to publish that?  It will allow the committee to continue its work on reform of the leaving certificate.  We would like to publish our report by December but we will be unable to do that now because it looks as if neither the NCCA nor the SEC will be before use prior to Christmas.

I wish to deal with the issue of the guidance for mask wearing for children in third class and above.  It is fair to say that the guidance was released at the eleventh hour.  There was only 12 hours' notice.  Kids were expected to be in school the next morning.  I think there has been a difficulty with the language.  It can be seen as being framed almost in the context of confrontation and an assumption of non-co-operation from parents.  It puts schools in an invidious position.  Schools will step up to the mark, I have no doubt, and probably a great many people at school level, parents and even kids will show calm heads and sense.

The education sector consistently and without fault has always followed the public health advice.  I have said regularly that I hope that it has come as an assurance to parents and guardians and our students and our staff in the entire school sector that when public health advice becomes available, we have always followed it.  The nature of Covid has meant that the public health advice changes at times.  When it does and when it asks us to pivot in a particular direction, we do that.  When we are asked to bring in additional measures, we do that.  We have done that throughout the management of Covid.  We received the strong recommendation and advice of public health that a short-term measure should be introduced.  It is important that we acknowledge that this is viewed as a short-term measure.  As a consequence of that, the Cabinet decided on Tuesday to accept the recommendations and advices of the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, and NPHET in this regard.  The Department had to wait for the advice and expertise from the health protection surveillance unit, as we have always done, in respect of implementation.  We received that late on Tuesday evening and, on receipt of that, the guidelines issued to schools.  The guidelines always issue following the recommendations of public health.<\/p> <p>  I wish to be clear on the guidelines.  This is not a position any one of us want to be in at this point.  None of us wants to have to deal with Covid on an ongoing basis.  We have an ever-changing situation that is in a constant state of flux.

We all hope that this is short term.  There is an issue faced by hearing-impaired children who rely partly on lip reading.  If the pandemic is to go on for a considerable period, we will need to look into mitigations for that and extra supports into the future.<\/p><p>Schools will be relied on to supply masks.  There will be children from disadvantaged backgrounds, children from households without a great deal of money, and children from quite chaotic backgrounds where this will just not be on anybody's agenda.  We will, therefore, need to rely on the schools.  I have no doubt that they will step up, but they will need whatever supports are necessary.<\/p><p> With regard to required mitigation, we have had many conversations on ventilation and high-efficiency particulate air, HEPA, filters.  At this stage, people are asking why the work in this regard has not been done and when we will get to where we need to be.

If there is a specific issue regarding which wearing a mask would disadvantage a child in the way the Deputy has outlined, such as an issue concerning speech or hearing, a mask will not be required.  Principals have significant flexibility in determining what best suits the student.<\/p> <p>  Significant funding has been provided to schools.

I recognise that there are specific difficulties in different schools.  No two schools are the same but we have taken a very proactive approach .

That we are blind to the content of the NCCA report has made it more difficult to do the work in the comprehensive way that I think the Chairman wants it done.  It would be of great benefit and assistance to the committee if it could see the report as early as possible.  Similarly, in terms of the <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n<\/font>poibl&iacute; &oacute; thaobh an Ghaeilge and the work that has been ongoing in that regard, we have heard, at meetings of the education committee and Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta, agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge, the Irish language community speaking with one voice on the specifications for T1 and T2 schools.  I would like the Minister to be cognisant of the worries of the Irish language community in that regard.<\/p><p>To turn specifically to the Estimates, could the Minister quantify the level of disruption in special educational needs, SEN, provision?  A lot of it is due to the substitute shortage.  In many schools. SEN teachers are being asked to substitute in mainstream classroom environments to cover for teachers with Covid.  I am concerned about the scarring effect on children who require special educational intervention.  Related to that is the budget line around for CLASS.  It is listed as having commenced in October.  Have we really been able to make headway in introducing it given the level of disruption in respect of substitution?<\/p><p>I wish to follow on from Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s question on the air filtration systems.  I realise we should be thinking about ventilation rather than filtration necessarily, but has the Department costed in a meaningful way the introduction of filtration systems, with HEPA filters or otherwise?  Has it figures on that?<\/p><p>I have a question about the pensions jump.  It has come back as higher than anticipated.  Given the composition of our teaching workforce is known, what is taking the Department unaware?  Are teachers stepping out of the profession earlier than expected?  Is that why there is a jump in the pensions provision?  In a situation where we need all hands to the pump, is the Minister making sure she is doing all she can to guard against teacher burnout and teachers leaving?<\/p><p>My final question is on school transport.  I noticed that &euro;20 million in savings was realised.  I understand the reason for that under-expenditure but hate to see sustainable transport moneys handed back.

It can be assured that the work will be expedited as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  On T1 and T2, the consultation concluded only two days ago, on 30 November.  That will be part of the consideration.  It is important that there was an opportunity to have the widest possible consultation in advance of a decision.<\/p> <p>  On the CLASS support, it is too early at this point.  We will have a greater indication regarding the drawdown later because it kicked off only in the past few weeks.  We will see a greater drawdown as the year progresses.  The scheme is excellent because it provides additional support to schools for the teaching of students who have been disadvantaged due to school closures.  It provides for academic teaching and learning, but also for the creativity, socialisation and well-being aspects.  It is wide in what it encompasses.<\/p> <p>  On pensions, it is difficult to forecast on a year-to-year basis because there is an opportunity for people to make a decision at various times.<\/p> <p>  On transport, the issue was a consequence of school closures.  The figure in question refers specifically to the savings on Covid-related costs of cleaning, PPE and all that.  Moneys not spent in that regard must be returned.  Significant work is ongoing.  The Deputy will be aware of the review.  It relates to how we manage school transport, particularly in our environment.  There is an incredible body of work being done in that respect.  The first interim report was received by me, and the work continues.  I am very conscious of this.  We are certainly working on it.<\/p><p> On ventilation, I reiterate that we work on a case-by-case basis while recognising that different schools have different difficulties that need to be addressed.  We are following the guidance offered by the expert group, which has told us there may well be a place for these filter devices but that in the long term we need to look at making more adequate and more long-term provision within our schools.  We are doing that, whether it is vents or windows or whatever the case may be.  We are working individually with the schools.  That work has taken place already.

I am conscious a significant portion of these Supplementary Estimates is for the purposes of meeting the challenges faced by the Department of Education with the ongoing incidence of Covid-19 in our community.  I commend the Minister, the Minister of State, and the Department on keeping the schools open.  It is essential we continue to keep the schools open for our children.  I am aware public health advice is given very frequently to the Minister in the Department of Education, and I understand fully when the Minister, Deputy Foley, says that she is following public health advice.  I would, however, like to see more coming from the public health advisers with information and advice on the importance of keeping schools open for children and the importance of attending school for a child's educational development, social development and personal development.  I believe this type of development is an essential ingredient in public health and that children must attend school.<\/p> <p>  I was very pleased to hear the Minister's response to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; about children in schools who have special needs.  I received an email recently from a nine-year-old girl in my constituency who was very upset about the fact that masks were going to have to be worn in the classroom.  Her concern was not about wearing the mask herself, but because she is deaf she is concerned.  Because she cannot hear, she cannot understand others unless she can see their lips.  I am very pleased with the Minister's response to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; with regard to issues like that.<\/p> <p>  My only question to the Minister is about antigen testing in schools.  I am conscious it only started last Monday, and I welcome that.  How is that going to be assessed?  Will the Department of Education provide updates as to how the scheme is operating or will the information come from the Department of Health?  Although it is not a panacea to all of the issues that arise, like most other members of the committee, I believe antigen testing is a helpful tool for the Department of Education and the Minister to ensure schools continue to provide education to our children.

The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I are adamant that keeping our schools open is an absolute priority for us.  It is a priority for the Government, and the Deputy is correct that it is a priority also for wider society.  If we have learned anything through Covid, we have learned of the need to keep the schools open, and that children and young people are best served when they are actually in school and in the school setting.  Notwithstanding the situations where there had to be remote teaching and learning, and acknowledging the enormous body of work done by the school community to facilitate that, the entire school community is of the strong view that children are best served while in the school setting.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I are ensuring every possible support and every possible resource that is required is put in place in all aspects of education.<\/p> <p>  Specifically on the antigen testing, the Deputy will be aware it is a public health recommendation.  It was advised by the Chief Medical Officer to be implemented by the HSE.  It is a health implementation.  Obviously, my Department co-operates fully with the Department of Health in that regard, but the evaluation of it is very much for the Department of Health.  It began on Monday, and there has been extraordinary buy-in by parents and everyone concerned.  We have seen the applications for antigen tests.  There were significant applications on Monday, fewer on Tuesday and possibly fewer again as we go on.  The co-operation from families has been extraordinary.  Public Health has been very clear in saying antigen testing is just one tool along with all of the other infection prevention and control measures that exist within our schools such as hand cleaning, hand sanitising, personal protective equipment, additional supervision, reconfiguration of buildings and so on.  It is a necessary tool.  To answer the Deputy's question, it is a Department of Health and HSE initiative, and it is being managed by them, but obviously we will support that in any way we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021120200002#D00500","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I will start where Deputy O'Callaghan left off.

Over recent weeks there has been a lot of talk about substitution, and once again I thank the Minister for the steps that she has taken, most recently with the block release of student teachers and with allowing people to work over their 22-hour contracts at second level.

Reference was made earlier to retired teachers and they can now work unrestricted to the end of this school year.  There has been great generosity there.

They require additional support in school to make up for lost time.  However, due to the substitution crisis many schools have had to deploy their special education teachers away from their teaching to cover mainstream absences.  This is far from ideal but it is the reality.  Last year schools could bank those special education hours to use in other times so that children with additional needs did not lose out.  I do not understand why this banking option is not being reintroduced.  While the substitution announcement last week is positive, special education hours have been and will continue to be lost without the banking system being brought in.  Will the Department safeguard the educational hours while committing to bringing back the banked hours system?<\/p> <p>  I also have serious concerns with the levels of support that school leaders are receiving from the HSE.  It was said that school leaders can still contact the HSE for help but that is not the same as bringing back testing and tracing to their previous levels.  School leaders should not have to contact parents of close contacts and organise for antigen tests.  They have enough on their plates and many of them are teaching principals.  We need to bring back school-specific contact tracing teams but this has not happened.  Will this happen?  Leaving certificate students and their parents have been in contact with me and they are concerned about the loss of teaching hours due to teacher absences, which cannot be helped.  I welcome the initiatives to try to find substitutes but students are missing out for weeks at a time.  It varies from school to school and within schools from class to class.

There is no withdrawal of provisions; it just means that SETs will be used for the purpose they should be used.  SETs should not be used for substitution purposes.  As a last resort schools were allowed to use them where there were substitution issues and where there were teacher absences but hopefully with the success of the vaccine roll-out and the measures the Minister has put in place, that need should not be there in the same way it was in the past.  Schools have been asked not to bank those hours because children with additional needs require the support there and then.  Otherwise they are getting intensive teaching in a short space and time, when it should be done over a period of time.

In relation to the HSE and contact tracing in Dublin, he will have seen that is a public health decision.  The public health authorities have made various decisions at various times on operational matters.  They made decisions in late September on the operation of full contact tracing within our schools.  At that point we had thousands of children who were excluded from school as close contacts because they did not have Covid symptoms and they did not develop Covid while they were stood down from school for ten days or more.  There was a view at that time that it was not sustainable going forward that we would have such a large cohort of students out of school.  Notwithstanding that, as I said that was a public health decision.<\/p> <p>  Another public health decision has been enacted as of Monday, which is on the roll-out of antigen testing.  I want to acknowledge, as I said earlier, that there has been extraordinary buy-in from parents and guardians in that.  We have seen that in the early days.  I want to acknowledge that principals and school leaders have been hugely co-operative and positive in relation to its development for the schools.  Many of them have been looking for antigen testing and the HSE has ensured that is in place.<\/p> <p>  Principals are being asked that when there is a positive case in a pod, that parent will inform the principal and the principal then informs the other five sets of parents within that pod.  After that it is entirely a matter for parents.  Parents apply to the call centre for the antigen tests, and as I said there has been an extraordinary buy-in to that in the last number of days.  Equally, that is a measure for primary schools within the specialist schools setting as the Minister of State will detail.  The contact tracing system remains in place.  These are public health decisions that are implemented by the public health bodies.

I know this is not the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility but a recent report stated that the Covid numbers in primary schools have rocketed in recent weeks.  However, the numbers are not as high in secondary schools.  That is the case even though secondary school pupils would probably be mixing more outside of the school than primary school children would.  Has the Minister spoken to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, or the people within the Department of Health about this?  Has the Minister&rsquo;s had any conversation on vaccinating under-12s?  They are rolling out the vaccine for under-12s in other countries and I am surprised and disappointed with the delay in Ireland.  It should be more of a priority because we have all been saying that the vaccine is working and the proof speaks for itself.

There are great learnings from Covid and one of the things we have learned is that a whole suite of measures are required at a variety of different times.

In the first instance, they were clear to say they await the confirmation from NIAC.  That is the first priority.  Equally, in my communication I was very clear we await the information and the roll-out.  I am conscious it is very much a public health matter.  Public health officials are proactively organising in anticipation of the announcement of NIAC in this regard.

There are anomalies at the minute.  I have spoken to the Minister about particular cases recently.  We have heard the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, speak about the need for the system to be able to deliver on climate change, as opposed to putting kids into cars when buses go on the same route.

A great deal has been achieved in education throughout Covid because of the co-operation of everybody in the education sector.  I want to acknowledge that spirit of accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Specifically, in relation to school transport, as I advised earlier, a review of the entire school transport system is under way.  The interim report, which I received in June, facilitated a new departure in school transport.  For example, heretofore, students were entitled to transport to their nearest school, but now, as a consequence of the decision I made in June, the second nearest school is also included in it.  That was a considerable and necessary step forward.  As I articulated earlier, we are very conscious of the climate in which we live and the green agenda we need to have in protecting and nurturing the climate.  That is very much part of the ongoing review we have.  We are very proactively addressing issues in terms of school transport.

I am accompanied today by officials from my Department and am conscious that I have only five minutes to deliver my opening statement.  I will therefore just give a very brief overview of the 2021 Supplementary Estimate for my Department.<\/p> <p>  The allocation for this Department&rsquo;s 2021 Supplementary Estimate was drawn up in recent weeks as part of the normal budgetary process.  At a Cabinet meeting dated 15 November 2021, the Government agreed to a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research Innovation and Science of &euro;230 million.  This increases the net voted allocation for this Department from &euro;2,681,500,000 to &euro;2,911,500,000, allowing for the funding of two items.<\/p> <p>  First, is a &euro;147 million once-off injection of funding for university superannuation costs.  There is a State obligation to fund university pension costs, arising from a legal undertaking by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Education when taking over university pension funds in 2009 under the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act.  In recent years, the pension cost has increased in line with demographic demands.  To address a shortfall on university pension schemes, my Department successfully negotiated in the 2022 Estimates process a once-off injection of &euro;147 million in 2021 to decrease the pension funding shortfall.<\/p> <p>  Additionally, we successfully negotiated a &euro;20 million rise to the base funding of university pensions from 2022.  This will help to build a sustainable baseline for future pension costs, as well as helping to strengthen university balance sheets.<\/p> <p>  The second measure funded through this Department&rsquo;s Supplementary Estimate is a &euro;105 million package of support to prepare for a safe reopening of the third level sector in the 2021-2022 academic year.  We are all well aware of the profound impact that Covid-19 has had globally.  Due to the deteriorating public health situation in the 2020-2021 academic year, education provision in the third level sector remained online with very restricted on-site access to facilities and person-to-person contact.<\/p> <p>  This emergency online provision throughout the 2021 -2021 academic year has been recognised by Government and the sector as deeply disruptive for students and learners, staff and institutions in further and higher education and research.  This has been particularly the case for vulnerable learners.  Curtailment of pro-social outlets and developmental opportunities for young people is of potentially wider significance for communities and society at large with implications for wellbeing, social cohesion and solidarity.<\/p> <p>  Recognising that this situation cannot continue for another academic year, in July 2021, the Government approved a &euro;105 million package of financial supports for the safe reopening of the third level sector in the 2021-2022 academic year, in compliance with public health advice and with appropriate protective measures.  This funding will allow higher education institutions and education and training boards to safely and carefully maximise on-site provision of teaching, learning, research and other on-site activities.  With thanks to efforts in the sector so far, we have seen approximately 400,000 learners return to on-site activity.  There are currently no changes to arrangements for school attendance and on-site activities for further and higher education institutions.  We continue to monitor the situation and the latest public health advice.<\/p> <p>  It is fair to say that in respect of Covid-19, the next few weeks, and indeed months, are uncertain and will be challenging.  I wish to place on record my gratitude to all involved in ensuring the continued health and safety of our students, lecturers and researchers, and to those working on a plan to safely keep our institutions and establishments open.<\/p> <p>  As part of this Supplementary Estimate, this Department has also declared that appropriations-in-aid are forecast to be &euro;22 million higher at the end of 2021 than originally anticipated.  This income is largely in respect of rebates from the European Social Fund and from unitary cost contributions related to capital public-private partnership projects.  This increased income reduces the Department&rsquo;s overall requirement in the Supplementary Estimate, bringing the total Supplementary Estimate to &euro;230 million.<\/p> <p>  I trust that this overview is of assistance to the committee and I am happy to discuss these issues in more detail.  I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021120200002#G00600","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, for his statement and I call now the first committee member, Deputy Pauline Tully, who has five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021120200002#G00700","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":462,"content":"<p>When discussing further and higher education, I welcome the fact that the vast majority of students are back on campus.  Hopefully, that is being done in a safe manner and I know that both the colleges and institutions will do as much as they can to ensure that.  One of the issues that has been highlighted by Covid-19 is the shortage in certain professions.  I was talking to the Minister about the shortage in teachers.  This is an issue that predates Covid-19 because I was a teacher before I was elected in February 2020 and there was a shortage of substitute teachers in certain subjects, especially Irish and French, and after that maths and science, and so on.  What is being done to identify and increase the number of students participating in different courses?<\/p> <p>  I am also spokesperson for disability.  The children's disability network teams have been established.  There is a shortage of occupational and speech and language therapists and psychologists.  What is being done to encourage more people to take up and to qualify in these professions at third level and to go into the public sector given many speech and language therapists and psychologists go into the private sector?<\/p> <p>  Is there any plan to review apprenticeships?  Due to Covid-19, much of the learning was done online.  There is capacity to shorten the length of apprenticeships from four years to three, which might encourage more people to take them up.  There is a shortage in workers in many construction trades and we need more people to take up apprenticeships as quickly as possible.

I will make a couple of comments on apprenticeships.  The committee will be well aware that we launched the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021 to 2025 earlier in the year and it has a number of high-level targets in it to increase the number of new apprenticeship registrations up to 10,000 per annum by the year 2025.  Within that also is a reorganisation of the apprenticeship space.  We are establishing, as the Deputy will be aware, the national apprenticeship office.  An interim director has been appointed in that position and that person will take up that role in the next number of weeks before Christmas.  That office will then be supported by what is called the national apprenticeship alliance, which will be a stakeholder forum to support the office in its work.  The national apprenticeship office will oversee the entire national apprenticeship landscape.  We have approximately 62 formalised apprenticeships on the books.  These are the traditional craft apprenticeships of approximately 25 in number.  In addition, the remaining apprenticeships are described or categorised as a consortium of post-2016 apprenticeships, many of which are in new areas such as financial services, insurance, accounting technicians, and other areas of industry and society.  There are approximately 20 more apprenticeships in development at the moment.  Further to all of that, there are approximately 18 or 19 expressions of interest of bubble groups, which are also seeking to advance apprenticeships.  These are not in development but are expressions of interest.<\/p> <p>  The national apprenticeship office will co-ordinate and oversee all aspects of apprenticeships, once it is established.  There is also money in next year&rsquo;s budget to support employers who take apprentices on.  Equally, at the moment, the funding goes primarily to the craft apprenticeships to support employers for the period that their apprentices are off the job and in training.  There is a great deal going on in that space.  <\/p> <p>  We also have Springboard courses right across the area of skills, with many courses going on in our further and higher education institutions through the provision of Springboard funding.  This is an advanced skill system to provide for lifelong learning and human capital developments. <\/p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned people with disabilities.  Within our action plan for apprenticeships, there are some key targets to promote more gender balance and diversification.  We also have equality measures through a bursary for disadvantaged people in the apprenticeship area.  There is much going on in that regard and we can certainly send some of that information on to her after the meeting.

That being said, one-off suggests that there was an issue.  If there was an issue, was it a one-off?

There is a focus on green skills and the nearly zero energy building, NZEB, centres.  I do not have the exact details here but we will let him know how many NZEB centres are being developed.

At the end of October, 10,333 craft apprentices were waiting for access to phases 2, 4 and 6 of their off-the-job training.  Almost 6,500 of these were waiting six months or more.  Actions taken by SOLAS, the HEA, and education and training providers, along with measures announced in the budget recently, will mean that 40% of those waiting will have access to off-the-job training in 2021 and the plan is to completely clear the backlog by the end of 2022.<\/p> <p>  We are very conscious of the backlog and it was outside our control due to the public health climate in which we had to operate.

I accept what he said about equality and dealing with those who do not necessarily come from a place where they have a history of education and the supports that are required.  There is probably a wider element of societal work that is beyond the remit of his Department, involving family and community supports to put more people into the space where they can avail of opportunities.  I have dealt with the Minister, Deputy Harris, lately regarding the Redeemer centre in Dundalk, which is operating a project in this area at the moment and is concerned about continued funding.  It offers certain modules in a community setting, where people may be more comfortable, before they move on to a PLC and wherever else that brings them.

As I am sure he is aware, the committee did a field trip to the extended campuses of the institutes of technology in Limerick and Cork last week.  An issue that came up in both cases was the lack of resources and spaces in respect of apprenticeships.  Both colleges could take on significantly more students but do not have the space, teaching capacity or equipment to do so.  I very much welcome the announcements by the Minister of State and the Minister on apprenticeships.  I expect that many more people will be willing to take up apprenticeships into the future because they are now seen as something worthwhile.  I am not saying they were not worthwhile in the past but there is now more of an appetite for them and a clearer view of what can be achieved at the end of them.  That should have been done years ago.  Can the lack of capacity be rectified in the short term and funding made available to fast-track the process and enable institutions to double the number of places available?  The Minister of State knows there is a shortage of apprenticeships for electricians, plumbers, carpenters and blocklayers.  Across the board, there is a huge shortage of labour and apprenticeships and there is an appetite within the colleges to double their numbers.  Will the Minister of State outline the work that is being done by him and within the Department to ensure there are enough spaces available for whomever wants to take up an apprenticeship?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2021120200002#K00900","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I spoke earlier about the apprenticeship action plan, of which members are well aware, and the targets contained therein.  Our primary role is to support SOLAS, aided by the HEA and the ETBs in the role they play in the area of apprenticeships.  In the case of almost every apprenticeship programme, there is a basic requirement that there cannot be an apprentice without an employer, who is the sponsor.  That is integral to the whole process.  We have been supporting employers, particularly during the pandemic, by way of the apprentice incentivisation scheme, which has been extended to the end of the year.  The number of apprenticeship registrations has surpassed our expectations this year as we emerged from the pandemic.  That is good news.<\/p> <p>  In terms of creating the infrastructure and capacity at our TUs and ETBs, we have an extensive capital budget, which is voted through at budget time.

I thank the committee for making time available today to consider my request for a Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.<\/p> <p>  As members are no doubt aware, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is a constituent part of the Office of the Attorney General.  It provides solicitor services within the Office of the Attorney General and to Departments and offices.<\/p> <p>  While the Taoiseach has certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas for administrative matters in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the office operates independently of the Department.  The office has a wide remit, including the area of civil litigation in all courts, including attending at the Court of Justice of the European Union, ECJ, in Luxembourg, and the provision of conveyancing, property law, commercial contract and other solicitor services for the line Departments and other Civil Service clients.  Many matters are high profile, sensitive, capable of attracting publicity, and sometimes involve emergency applications to court, strict time limits and complex issues of law.<\/p> <p>  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;3 million is sought to cover the extra expenditure of three subheads within the Vote in 2021.  These subheads are: A1(i) salaries, wages and allowances; A2(v) office equipment and external IT services; and A4 - fees to counsel.   While the office has managed to achieve savings of more than &euro;500,000 elsewhere in the Vote it finds itself with a shortfall of &euro;3 million.<\/p> <p>  I might start with the fees to counsel subhead.  The management of expenditure on counsels&rsquo; fees is a key activity for the office.  These are primarily fees payable to counsel representing Departments and offices in litigation before the courts and other tribunals, and the ECJ  They also include fees payable for the provision by external counsel of legal advice for the State, whether sought for the Office of the Attorney General or for Departments and offices.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure on counsel fees is, to a large extent, dependent on the level of activity in the courts at any time.  It is often difficult for the office to specifically forecast this.  In addition, recent years have seen a marked increase in the complexity of work being handled by the office in areas such as commercial litigation and transactional work, procurement work, and advisory and litigation work that results from our membership of the EU, and the implementation of directives in areas such as environmental law, planning, employment law and social welfare law.  The past two years have brought new challenges with Brexit and the emergency legislation enacted to deal with the pandemic.  The office has observed that the issues raised in cases taken against the State are becoming increasingly complex, which leads to greater use of counsel.<\/p> <p>  An allocation of &euro;15 million was made for expenditure on fees for counsel in 2021, which was the same as 2020.  However, the current position shows that after the fees requested by counsel undergo a value-for-money assessment, this will leave a shortfall of &euro;2.6 million over the allocated amount.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the office equipment and external IT services subhead, the office has incurred increased costs in the provision and support of secure remote access facilities.  It has also had to upgrade video conference facilities to satisfy the requirements of the ECJ for remote hearings.  The shortfall for this subhead is &euro;213,000.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I will refer to subhead A1(i).  Due to a combination of circumstances relating to the need to provide cover for staff on maternity leave, and the impact of changes to pay arrangements, the office sees a shortfall in the allocation of &euro;772,000.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee and welcome the opportunity to discuss it with the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021120200002#A00400","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it as teacht os comhair an choiste.

I introduced my Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill today.  Does the Minister of State have figures for the total costs the Chief State Solicitor's office has incurred from defending the State in cases arising from protected disclosures?  I will put three questions to the Minister of State now.  They are quite specific and he may not have the information to hand to answer them but he can come back to me on them.<\/p><p> I am also interested in the total expenditure on external legal fees.  We had a conversation on that on the previous occasion the Minister of State appeared before this committee.  I am quite shocked at how much it costs.  From the perspective of fiscal prudence, would it not be more cost-effective for this work to be done in-house through the Chief State Solicitor's office?  That could be a better approach.  I would be interested in his thoughts on that.  When other jurisdictions contract for external legal fees, a discount often appears to be offered for services.  I guess that is because it is often repeat business and states are reliable suppliers, they pay on time and do not go bust.  When the Irish State contracts for external legal fees, a premium appears to be charged, rather than a discount applied, for the services.  I would also be interested in the Minister of State's view on that matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021120200002#A00500","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":514,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first question regarding the cost of protected disclosures, I do not have that specific figure in front of me.  I can ask the office whether it is even possible to obtain that figure and the specifics around it.  If it is, we can send it on to the committee but I will have to engage with the officials to find out if there is a breakdown of that.  Different agencies of the State are responsible for protected disclosures and, therefore, they might not all be necessarily channelled through the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's point on securing value for money with respect to fees and doing that work in-house, there is significant legal expertise in the office and those staff do a great deal of case management and progress many cases.  That is distinct from how it works around counsel.  To give some information on that, the majority of cases the office handles are taken against the State and it is necessary for the State to defend itself against any of these cases.  That can require specialist advocacy services offered by specific counsel.  In some instances, they are specific counsel who are very much specialists in their area in Ireland and if Ireland is representing itself in a European context, it is important we have such specialist expertise.  It can also vary.  There is uncertainty with respect to demand, therefore, it can be difficult to predict the work and cases can often take years to conclude.  Another aspect is the increasingly challenging and complex nature of case management and the nature of discovery, and the cost involved in that.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about fees.  In terms of fee note processing, there is an evaluation process that involves a minimum of two and a maximum of seven legal officers, including legal officers in the Office of the Attorney General.  They are processed through use of guidelines and oversight.  There is a professional fees control group within the Chief State Solicitor's office that ensures value for money and fairness in the service provided, ensuring there is consistency across all work and managing the spend in the context of the budget.  There is a marked-down rate, which is approximately 33%.  Obviously, that is an estimate but there is a marked-down rate when it comes to counsel.  If the Deputy were to compare what we are allocating under the subhead covering fees to counsel this year versus, say, 2019, it is less.  It is subject to fluctuation.  It can depend on the nature of the case that is taken.  There is a Supplementary Estimate and this is one of the subheads involved.  If the Deputy notes the trend over a period of years, a greater amount was allocated under that in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021120200002#B00200","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

With regard to the staffing of the office generally, we can get a specific note on staffing as it relates to Brexit.  One of the predominant issues, as I referenced in reply to Deputy Farrell, when it comes to cost implications for the Chief State Solicitor's office is the multi-annual nature of the work, the interface with the European legal system and how case management can take many years.  From a commercial case management perspective, it can involve complex work over a number of years.  There is ongoing engagement between the office and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and a substantial increase was secured for 2022.  Two elements occurred this year that were a positive for capturing staff recruitment and retention.  One relates to maternity leave cover where staff going on maternity leave can be replaced immediately or within a reasonable timeframe.  There has been budgetary allocation for that and all of that has allowed for good continuity of work.  There has also been an incremental credit and that has also had an important impact on the continuity of work.<\/p> <p>  On managing Brexit more generally, the feedback we have received is that it is part of the regular work.  The Chief State Solicitor's office's work cuts across Departments and all issues.  The office has in excess of 300 staff.  As I said, there is a significant increase there for next year.

I thank members for the engagement at that stage and also for facilitating this meeting at relatively short notice.  I will keep my remarks brief.  Obviously, I will be happy to take any questions members may have.<\/p> <p>  The subject matter we are discussing here is specifically the &euro;198.9 million additional funding to be added to the overall provision for my Department.  The Estimate, which I set before the committee in October, detailed my Department&rsquo;s budget for 2020.  This totalled &euro;5.118 billion gross for the year with a further &euro;214 million of deferred surrender.  The Supplementary Estimate before the committee today includes the following changes: the Local Government Fund - an additional &euro;197.3 million in current spend; on heritage - an additional &euro;1.615 million, comprised of &euro;1.473 million current spend and &euro;142,000 capital spend.  The total provision of &euro;198.9 million will bring the gross expenditure ceiling for my Department to &euro;5.531 billion and will be comprised of &euro;2.555 billion in current spending and &euro;2.976 billion on the capital side, excluding a further &euro;91.5 million self-funding by local authorities under local property tax for housing.<\/p> <p>  I will start with the heritage element of this Supplementary Estimate.  These are not additional costs to the Exchequer.  They are the final elements of the transfer of functions and bring these existing provisions into Vote 34.  They mainly relate to pay - &euro;880,275 which deals with salaries and PSRI; and for administration - &euro;735,000 for office equipment.  This effectively follows the restructuring of the Department following the Taoiseach&rsquo;s decision in 2020.  It is a technical issue and arose from the transfer of certain heritage functions into my Department.<\/p> <p>  The local government element of this Supplementary Estimate is exclusively focused on issues relating to Covid-19.  The amount to be provided under this Supplementary Estimate is &euro;197.3 million and, when taken in conjunction with other measures taken by the Department, will bring the total Exchequer support to the local government sector for pandemic-related expenditure to an unprecedented &euro;558.9 million.  I have consistently said at committee meetings and in the D&aacute;il and Seanad that we are firm believers in and supporters of local government.  I take the opportunity to thank all workers in the local government sector for the incredible work they have done throughout the pandemic.  They have led from the front and have been the tip of the spear in the Government's response in every community throughout the country.  It was incumbent on me and my Department to support them through this Supplementary Estimate to ensure that with the additional works they had and the loss of income they have experienced through rates abatement, which I will turn to shortly, they were fully supported by way of 100% provision.  That is being done in an unprecedented way.<\/p> <p>  This includes a provision for the commercial rates waiver scheme that applied from January to September.  We now have a more targeted waiver scheme, focused on the hospitality sector and those still affected by certain Covid-related restrictions.<\/p> <p>  It also includes provision for the allocation of additional funds to local authorities to help limit the financial impact of the pandemic.  I will take the example of Deputy Gould's city of Cork which he understandably loves so much.  That city has undergone a very successful pedestrianisation programme and many those streets continue to be for pedestrians only.  There has been a loss of parking charges as has happened in many local authorities.  We have plugged that gap.  I met the chief executive in Cork who was able to define exactly what the local authority lost due to this.  Should the committee pass this Supplementary Estimate today, it will leave me in a position to allocate additional funds to those local authorities to support them in the changes they have made and in the work they have done.<\/p> <p>  In total, &euro;497 million will be provided to fund the 2021 waiver scheme.  There are two parts to this waiver.  The main part covered the first nine months of the year.  While originally expected to cost &euro;480 million between quarter 1 and quarter 3, it is now &euro;435 million.  The scheme applied automatically to various types of businesses.  As members know which businesses are covered, I will not go into that detail.  The second part of the 2021 waiver is more targeted and we estimate it will cost &euro;62.3 million.  It is for those businesses in the hospitality sector along with gyms etc. which have been affected by the remaining restrictions.<\/p> <p>  I used the example of Cork city where local authorities lost income as well as the loss of funding from commercial rates.  The total package of this funding is &euro;61.6 million across those local authorities.  Some of the changes are for the better.  I encourage local authorities to retain as best as possible those areas they have given back to the public through pedestrianisation, allowing people to use streets that had been choked with cars for decades.  What they have done has been very progressive.  We will continue to support local government in those moves, giving back the public realms and streets to people.<\/p> <p>  Funding will be allocated in an equitable way.  The proposed approach is to cover income losses of about &euro;51 million as quantified by the local government sector and to allocate the remaining &euro;10 million to help with the costs of Covid-related expenses that arose.  The nature of these costs varies across the sector.  They include the loss of parking charges along with the cost of personal protective equipment, PPE, signage, crowd management, haulier testing and additional staffing.  There was also significant expenditure on ICT etc. to cover remote working.  I am confident that this funding will provide sufficient support to local authorities.  The support has been very well received by local authorities throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  I will now run through some of the measures my Department has taken.  The substantive Supplementary Estimate I have outlined will result in an increase of &euro;198.915 million.  This will be complemented by the application of &euro;38.4 million from savings arising from the local government rates waiver; an allocation of &euro;13.2 from the Local Government Fund Reserve and &euro;310 million from savings and underspend across the Vote primarily due to the significant impact of Covid-19 on construction during 2021.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware construction and, consequently, expenditure have been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  On 6 January 2021, the Government announced that additional public health restrictions would apply under level 5 of the plan for living with Covid-19.  That shut down the sector and restrictions continued until 12 April 2021.  Obviously, the lag-time in building capacity back up and supply chain issues have had an impact.<\/p> <p>  My Department continues to work intensively with all stakeholders to maximise delivery for 2021.  However, expenditure will be lower than anticipated, particularly on programmes which are construction focused - in housing and water infrastructure.<\/p><p>I have applied for the maximum permissible carryover of funds into 2021 for capital programmes.  I am conscious of likely additional underspends, but I have also signalled to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that I will be reducing the net income of the additional costs of the local government rates waiver and other Covid-19-related costs by transferring funds from those underspends into the local government fund.  Instead of seeking additional funds from the Exchequer, we are using funds that were voted for other measures within our Department.  That is the prudent, appropriate and responsible thing to do.<\/p><p> It is too early to quantify the exact out-turn for affected programmes.  My Department continues to work closely with the Minister, Deputy McGrath, and his team in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Programmes A on housing and D on planning are most affected.  That will not come as a surprise to anyone.  My Department will continue to work hard with all key stakeholders and delivery partners to ensure accelerated activity on areas that have been affected.<\/p><p> I have kept my remarks as brief as possible.  I wanted to give members an overview.  I have focused on the purpose of today's meeting, which is the Supplementary Estimate for local government and that small technical piece relating to heritage on the transfer of functions.  I am more than happy to take any questions.  I have certainly seen 2020 and 2021 as the two years of Covid.  We expect, based on projections for next year and the evidence we have, that 2022 will be a year of delivery in these streams.  The projections are positive, which I am sure the members will be glad to know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120200002#B00200","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I concur with the Minister's comments on local government and the tremendous work it has done over the past 18 months during the pandemic, including the staff and members of the local authorities, for their community supports during the worst of the pandemic in 2020 and the work they have done in the allocation of road space and outdoor dining.

There has been a significant carryover of more than &euro;200 million into the local authority social housing investment programme.  Can the Minister give an indication of how the underspend this year has impacted on the projected targets for social housing output?  That would be helpful for us to understand.<\/p> <p>  It is important we support local government.  There are approximately 48 outstanding staff requests from housing departments throughout the State.  The Minister replied to a parliamentary question from me on this recently.  Is there provision within the existing Estimates to get those staff up and working in the relevant sections of the housing departments this year?  They are key for housing delivery in many local authority areas.<\/p> <p>  There is an increase in the Estimates for the housing assistance payment, HAP, of approximately &euro;26 million, which is approximately half the increase on the previous year.  However, a target is set out in the Budget Statement of 14,800 new HAP tenancies.  Obviously, the Minister will not cover 14,800 new HAP tenancies from &euro;26 million additional spending.  Does the Minister expect there will be a reduction of current HAP tenancies and that is where he will make up the shortfall?  He has roughly the same number of new HAP tenancies in the targets as previous Governments, but half the increase.<\/p> <p>  Given the announcement this week on the changes to the defective block scheme affecting western seaboard counties, are there any proposals to increase the budget allocation for that scheme?  Will the Minister come back with a further Supplementary Estimate in parallel with the legislation next year?  Notwithstanding the controversy around the sliding scale, more money will be needed next year.  Can the Minister give us an update on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120200002#C00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>With regard to the defective block scheme, we have, as the Deputy knows, published significant changes that will increase the commitment by Government from &euro;1.4 billion, by adding &euro;800 million to that scheme, on which we have worked hard with residents to put together.  I do not expect to and will not be coming back to the committee for any Supplementary Estimate in that regard in 2022.  We have made provision for 2022.  Provision is also made in the national development plan, NDP.  Additional funds will be required as the scheme ratchets up.  We need legislation on this.  Obviously, I will be seeking the co-operation of the committee to make sure we get the legislation to underpin the defective block scheme set up on a sound legislative footing, but we need to get it through quickly.  I need to publish that legislation, on which we are already working, in February.  The scheme needs to be set up for Exchequer intervention such as this, which is unprecedented.  We cannot keep running it on regulations, as the existing scheme was set up, under the 1979 Act.<\/p> <p>  I have flagged we were also bringing in an industry levy.  That will be from the finance Bill 2022, which will take effect from 2023.  It will also be paying into this fund, which I do not see dealing with just mica and defective blocks.  Work is also being done on the working group on fire defects I have set up and on which the committee has been involved.  This country needs to grasp the nettle of this issue and help those homeowners, too.  However, I am sure we will have another session and I will not delay.  We have to be forward looking to ensure these things do not happen again.<\/p> <p>  Significant exits are projected for HAP.  The Deputy will know in the past two budgets, I have reduced the level of increase in HAP by 1,000 each year.  I want us to reduce our dependency on HAP and I know all members do, as we increase our new housing builds.  For a number of years, this tipping point has been talked about, when housing construction would overtake HAP increases.  Next year, we are targeting 9,000 brand new builds in social housing.  That does not include other measures that will deliver more than 12,000 homes.<\/p> <p>  We are seeing the increase in HAP reducing any significant exits, but not significant increases in the overall tenancies.  They do not cancel each other out.  HAP is necessary.  I am acutely aware HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and other measures such as this are of significant cost to the Exchequer.  In many instances, they are done out of absolute necessity, because there is no other option.  This has not be called for today, but there have been calls saying this is a supplementary to the private rental sector.  This is actually about supporting families in homes.  We cannot just turn the tap off on it overnight and the committee, in fairness, understands that, but I want to continue to reduce our dependency on it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy received a reply to a parliamentary question on staffing from me recently.  Some 49 staffing requests are being dealt with at present.  Well over 1,000 housing posts have been approved in the past number of years.  The 49 staffing requests have details outstanding on which we are following up.  A review is happening between my Department and local government.  We would approve posts and sometimes one would go to a local authority which would say it was waiting for the Department to sanction it.  When one looked behind it, that may not have been the case.  That process needs to improve.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned in committee last night the legislation we were passing on moving the planning function for large residential developments back to local authorities, which we all supported.  I will also be making a significant announcement in the coming days on further additional resources under housing for all for all local authorities.  We are finalising that, but that will be in a matter of days.  Certainly, I will be sharing the detail of that with the committee, because we need to continue to resource local government.<\/p><p>The carryover of &euro;58 million was brought into the social housing capital investment, SHIP, in 2021 and this is being drawn down in the first call of expenditure in 2022.<\/p><p> There was an underspend because of the construction shutdown and the lag time in getting back to the capacity we needed on-site.  That will lead to a significant reduction in what the projected output at the start of the year was before that wave of Covid hit.  We are making up for some lost ground.  I do not have the final figures for quarter three yet but when I do we will share them.  We are pushing to deliver more new homes this year than we did last year.  The projection into next year is positive and we have over 8,000 social houses on-site and under construction as we speak.  There is a good pipeline on the social housing and cost rental sides and we are pushing forward in the affordable housing as well.  As soon as I have quarter three figures and we have checked them and gone through them we will share that with the committee.  I thank the Deputy for his questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120200002#C00400","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I have four follow-up questions.  First, the Minister commented on mica, the industry levy and the measures there.  It is important that the Minister has announced that a national building control regulator will be brought in.  It is long overdue, it is important and it is needed to supplement the work of local authorities in enforcement.  I ask the Minister to give us a timeline on that.  Is it intended to bring forward legislation?<\/p> <p>  Second, I refer to the Estimates and the maximum permissible carryover of funds into 2021 for capital programmes that the Minister has sought.  Does that mean there is a level of carryover that is not permissible and that is not coming into next year?  If so, how much is that?<\/p> <p>  Third, the Minister said it is too early to quantify the outturn for the effective capital programme.  When does he think he will be able to quantify the effect it has had this year?  When can we expect figures on that?<\/p> <p>  Fourth, I refer to Supplementary Estimates and Housing First tenancies, which I have raised with the Minister before.  Did the Minister consider that area for additional spending?  As he knows, there is an estimation that about 2,000 Housing First tenancies are needed for people who are homeless and who have additional support needs.  The plan is to provide those tenancies by 2026.  Has the Minister considered accelerating that delivery?  That would have a substantial impact, not just on those individuals but also on the overall homelessness situation.  Could a tender be done on that to get more delivery?  Can the Minister consider an additional spend on that or what are his thoughts on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120200002#D00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":543,"content":"<p>This is important and I am glad the Deputy has raised the serious issue of homelessness and what we can do to support those people who need our help.  At an acute level, particularly in Housing First, wraparound supports are needed.  This month we will be announcing details of over 1,200 new tenancies, which is more than we have promised in Housing for All for long-term homeless individuals.  It does this by providing a permanent home as well as providing supports for physical health, mental health and addiction issues, or all three.  I will be launching that this month and we are expanding that across the country.  We have new posts in place for the regional delivery of Housing First.  Homelessness is an area we will continue to focus on, particularly in the provision of one-bedroom properties and conversions.  While we have done a lot of work on voids this year, a lot of them are complex as the properties have been empty for significant lengths of time.  They are not just what some would call re-lets but we have done deep work on voids.  We will bring back more than 3,000 such units into use this year and I have asked the local authorities to focus them on the homeless sector.  We are seeing an increase in homelessness in recent months and I have flagged that with the committee and with Cabinet.  That will continue in the coming months and we will have to watch that.  We are putting in place our national homelessness oversight committee that I will chair.  It will bring the Departments together as well as the NGOs that are part of my task force.  We need a real focus on delivery in this area.  It will help to provide an increase in housing and social housing output next year.  We must use our vacant stock in a much better way and reduce the number of vacancies we have.  I will be focusing on that area and we have had support across the committee on this.<\/p> <p>  Any additional expenditure we had this year went towards continuing the winter plan for homelessness the whole way through and towards the real progress that has been made on rough sleepers.  We have had a significant reduction of over 35% of rough sleepers year on year.  Interestingly in the recent rough sleepers count we can see that there are still too many but only 11 people in Dublin were on the street sleeping rough compared with how it was this time last year.  We are seeing a lot of people moving out of that rough sleeper category.  There is more than enough emergency accommodation for everyone who needs it.  I know there are other reasons people will suffer but people need to know that safe and secure emergency accommodation is available for them.  If we look at October 2021 we had 94 people sleeping rough, which was down 31 from the spring and down 45 from last winter.  That is a significant reduction.  We had 316 new beds in place and 198 of them are permanent so that is an area I will focus on.<\/p> <p>  The national building control regulator and national standards got approval at Cabinet as part of our response to mica, defective block and other issues.  We need to have this in place and it will require a separate memo to Cabinet by way of the draft general scheme.  It will also require prelegislative scrutiny and I will have the committee involved in that.  It is important and we have to show people where the State is making an extraordinary intervention to help homeowners, and rightly so.  We have to ensure these things do not happen again.  There will be a review of what has happened, undertaken by a senior counsel, and that is also in measures I brought forward on defective block and mica.  I will be seeking the co-operation and input of the committee into moving forward with that legislation.  It is in preparation and at an early stage.  To be honest a Bill will not be published during this side of the year but it is a priority Bill and I will be seeking the Deputy&rsquo;s assistance on it.<\/p> <p>  The maximum permissible carryover capital was 10%.  There will be no surrender and we are reallocating our moneys into areas I have mentioned, such as supporting local government.  We are working on some other things that we have not gotten full approval for yet.  We are focusing a lot of that on local government and on housing areas such as voids, buy-to-lets and the likes of regenerated properties that have been stuck for a long time.  I am taking them out of that category and Deputy McAuliffe has been strong on the issue of properties in Dublin that have been empty for a long time and getting them back and re-tenanted.  Detailed work is needed on those properties.  We are looking at a capital spend of about &euro;3.7 billion next year.  We will have more than enough.  I should not say that in case the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is listening.  We will have sufficient funds to deliver an extensive housing programme and to deliver more homes at a social housing level than has ever been seen before in any given year.  We will get permission for that carryover into next year but it will be used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120200002#D00300","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I want to quickly clarify one point.

I know we have made significant progress.  There has been a more than 30% reduction in homelessness, but as we head into winter we are starting to see the number rising again.  We need to ensure we keep on top of it.  The Minister is doing that, but it would be interesting to hear a little more about how we will deal with things as we go forward.  Housing First is key to that.<\/p> <p>  I would like to expand on an area that has been touched on, which is the provision of social and affordable housing and the ability of local authorities to supply it.  I thank the Minister for intervening in the matter of the Oscar Traynor Road site, which involved a tender process that had its roots in a previous Government's policy.  We are subsidising the purchase price of more than 170 homes on that site to the tune of &euro;100,000 per unit.  This site comprises 340 local authority homes, which will clearly take people off the housing assistance payment, HAP, list, and 340 homes for those who do not qualify for social housing but are in the private market.  I predict the absolute hypocrisy of people who will be first in the queue to try to get places for people in a housing development they voted against.<\/p> <p>  That being said, the delivery of those 950 units is key.  The council vote was just one step.  The support in Housing for All, all the housing models and the legislation all represent great work that has enabled the council to finally build mixed communities, but housing has to be delivered by the local authorities.  The Department needs to put maximum pressure on local authorities to deliver but, equally, it has to provide the resources for them to do so.  I do not expect the Minister to give me the details of the announcement he wishes to make on it, but we cannot throw enough resources at our local authorities to try to deliver on this.<\/p> <p>  This morning, local councillors in Ballymun are receiving an update on how housing that will be delivered on the nearly 20 sites there.  A site manager has been appointed by Dublin City Council for the Finglas sites of Kildonan and Finglas West.  There are also other sites in the constituency.  We will need resources to deliver those homes.  The Minister has provided the funding and the legislative base.  The last step is making sure the local authorities deliver by putting pressure on them but, equally, by supporting them.  I ask that staffing resources be provided for in the Estimates for this year and next year in order that local authorities will have no excuse.  There can be no excuse for not delivering local housing.  We have now done everything we need to do.  It is all about delivery, as far as I am concerned.  I would very much appreciate whatever the Minister can do in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120200002#E00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  I will also use the opportunity to commend those councillors who supported the Oscar Traynor Road development.  That site has lain idle for 41 years.  Many excuses were used by people as to why they would not, could not or should not support the provision of just short of 1,000 homes, when it is looked at overall.  It is one of the biggest housing developments in Dublin.  It has 40% social housing, 40% cost rental and 20% affordable purchase.  I am also glad those councillors took the decision not to take what was seen as a short-term populist view to go back to the drawing board to find other mechanisms and other ways of doing it.  We need to deliver homes.  We are in the middle of a housing crisis.  People want to see that delivery.  I commend the councillors, Deputy McAuliffe, his colleagues and those across parties on their support for the Oscar Traynor Road development.  Those who did not support it will have to answer for that.  I want to see progress.  We are moving things on now.<\/p> <p>  To be fair, the majority, though not all, of the committee supported the Affordable Housing Act.  It is important Members know that, very significantly, the Act gives us the ability to be able to vary the affordable subvention, especially in areas where affordability is acute, such as Dublin, Cork and other regional cities.  Without going into the financial details of the Oscar Traynor Road site, one thing that was asked of me by Deputy McAuliffe when he was Lord Mayor, before his election to the D&aacute;il, by the previous Lord Mayor Hazel Chu and by the current Lord Mayor Alison Gilliland was to ensure we would have flexibility to be able to help on affordability.  I am using that development as an example.  I do not want to dwell on one particular site, but we have been able to do that now.  That flexibility has been allowed because of the legislation we have passed and because we have cost rental in place.<\/p> <p>  In thinking about what this Government has done, with very significant input from Deputy Duffy and the Chairman around the whole cost rental piece, we already have people in cost rental tenancies and a pipeline for hundreds more next year.  That is actual delivery and getting stuff done.  It is not just talking about it, debating it or going back around to see what is perfect for people.  We need homes for people.  It has been good and positive so let us be positive about that.<\/p> <p>  Everything next year has got to be about delivery.  We have now provided the tools for local authorities to deliver on affordable and social housing.  We will get their housing delivery action plans, which are on their way to me.  They are being concluded.  I am working with my team in the Department with the intention of publishing those plans on or about 17 December when we have collated the details.  We will certainly publish them by December or early January in order that it will be very clear what each local authority is responsible for delivering.  To be fair, the local authorities have worked very well with us as partners.  We spent a lot of time working with them on the new affordable measures.  This is new.  Let us remember most local authorities have not delivered an affordable house in 15 years.  We have new schemes in place now.  Our shared equity scheme is in place, which will deliver next year, separate to local authorities, and will help those who are renting right now or living with their folks, who feel they will never be able to own a home, to be able to get homes.<\/p> <p>  Next year will be a good year for delivery, but we need all our councillors to understand they are also responsible for delivering homes.  That is why I continue to encourage councillors not to oppose Part 8 planning applications or to find reasons to oppose provision of social, affordable and cost rental housing.  I ask them to find reasons to support it, not to delay things and to recognise the fact that people want and need homes.  It is not just a want but a right.  If we are going to do that, we all have to work together.  We now have Housing for All, which has more than &euro;20 billion in funding, our affordable housing fund in place and set up, and a social housing programme that is bigger than has ever been previously delivered multi-annually.  That is what will make a big difference to our local authorities.  They now have line of sight on their capital provision multi-annually.  That is important because we can plan and work with them.  I am very confident about how we will move on into the future.  We will be working with the committee and the local government sector to ensure we deliver on our targets next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120200002#E00300","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions.

In Cork City Council, which the Minister referenced earlier, the loss of income and expenditure due to Covid-19 came in at approximately &euro;4 million.  This resulted in a shortfall of &euro;1.5 million in that council's budget, which meant it had to cut services to deliver a balanced budget.  Is the Minister saying the funding he has in place in the Supplementary Estimates means Cork City Council will recover the &euro;4 million?

I look forward to Sinn F&eacute;in's support for that because the party has never proposed any other measures.  It has not brought forward any zoned land tax or activation measures in the 12-page alternative budget, which had no costings, it brought forward.  We are doing things.  This is being put together by the Department of Finance.  It will help to activate land and impose penalties when sites are not used, and rightly so.<\/p> <p>  Vacant property is an issue.  I am sure Deputy Gould has studied Housing for All.  One of the pathways involves tackling vacancies because it is a real issue.  To be fair to the Deputy, he highlights the issue on a regular basis.  We need to make sure that vacant properties in our town and cities are made viable and used.  That is why in Housing for All we published our plans for the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities fund which will help with viability and tackling vacancies in new development in our cities.  <\/p> <p>  We will come forward with new regulations and applications for above the shop living.  We will have to make some very tough decisions about what we are going to do.  Any measures taken heretofore with regard to above the shop living have, in my view, not worked as effectively as they should have.  I will seek, and look forward to, the support of all members who really want to tackle this.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the LDA and using State-owned land for developing social and affordable housing.

They have had a good long time.<\/p> <p>  The local government funding is extremely positive.  I am intrigued.  Like Deputy McAuliffe, I will not push the Minister on the additional resources for local authorities shortly to be announced under Housing for All, but it is extremely important.  Deputy Gould raised the issues of dereliction and vacancy.  We can do a lot more throughout our towns and villages.  Housing for All puts some very positive policy measures in place to help us to do that in terms of Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe and the local authority CPO functions we will introduce.  <\/p> <p>  Staff will be required to do that.  I know the Minister is aware of that, and has travelled extensively to meet chief executives.  He knows about the staff pressures in local authorities, especially in areas involving CPOs for vacant and derelict properties and the extra planning functions that will be required.  He understands the importance of the planning function and the interaction with the public realm that we need to offer.  As we regenerate and improve town centres, villages and city centres, and bring vacant commercial properties, including those with units over shops, into residential use, mixed use or whatever, there will have to be investment in the public realm.<\/p><p>We often look to a European model that involves a lot of urban and town centre living but, in many of those places, they have good, open public spaces and parks.  It is important that we have the staff in place to design, create and maintain those spaces, right down to the staffing levels in local authorities for outdoor and parks maintenance.  It requires a complex combination of staff working hard at local authority level to create those nice public spaces near which people want to live.  I attended the Irish Planning Institute conference recently, where I heard a presentation by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The point was made that if we plan towns and villages in which people want to live, tourists will want to visit them.  We all see the evidence of that and I know the Minister is aware of it and will take the measures required to deliver on the Housing for All objectives.  That plan includes the largest-ever budget of &euro;20 billion over the next five years for the provision of social and affordable housing.<\/p><p> I recently raised with the Minister in the D&aacute;il the issue of the provision of biodiversity officers at local authority level, which is crucial.  We had representatives of the Heritage Council before the committee some time ago for what was a very positive session.  All members are supportive of the work the council is trying to do across the country, as well as the incredibly important work of the heritage officers at local authority level.  The heritage officer in my local authority in Wicklow has a tremendous work output, which is appreciated by all council members and residents who interact with the work being done.  Just like we have heritage officers across our local authorities, I would really like to see the day when we have biodiversity officers throughout the State to support the good work of the planners.<\/p><p> My ultimate wish in terms of local authority staffing is to see county architects, who have a critical role in the planning process, in place throughout the State.  Planners look at individual planning applications and we have local area plans, county development plans and action areas.  A county architect can look at everything with a different set of eyes and bring all the elements together in a cohesive development approach across counties and towns.  I welcome the Supplementary Estimate and invite the Minister to respond if he so wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120200002#F01800","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his remarks.  As he said, he and I had a discussion in the D&aacute;il on the role of biodiversity officers.  Four or five local authorities currently have biodiversity officers, which is not nearly enough.  Due to the Chairman's intervention and the work of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who has been exceptional in this area, we have provided sanction for the appointment of at least one biodiversity officer in each local authority area.  We have seen throughout the pandemic that people have become far more in tune with where they live and their natural and built environment.  That is why we have seen such an incredibly positive interest in our natural biodiversity and our heritage.  On the heritage side, we are putting in place another 125 posts or so for heritage officers.  Again, I commend the Minister of State on his enthusiastic work in this area.  We work very closely together on it.  Both of these areas of work are very good initiatives.<\/p> <p>  In my opening statement, I thanked local authority staff for the work they do, on which they lead from the front.  I have had the pleasure of travelling to all counties in the Republic.  I  met with the Chairman a number of times in his home county of Wicklow and we saw the work being done there and the new initiatives taken.  In Wicklow town, for example, I was blown away by the work done by the archivists in the county council on local government archives and archives of local history that would otherwise have been lost.  The local authority is now the curator of that history, thanks to the work of the two exceptional archivists the Chairman and I met.<\/p> <p>  That leads to my next point, which relates to the public realm and the moneys that have been provided for the pedestrianisation and improvement of the high street area in Wicklow town.  All of that funding was provided by the Government through the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, and the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF.  The work being done on Wicklow Gaol is another instance of that and we could choose similar examples in every county across the country.  The URDF funding, in particular, which is just short of &euro;2 billion, is important and much of it remains to be spent.  I was in Tralee during the summer, where incredible work is being done.  In Balbriggan, in my own area, the RRDF work is starting, which involves converting derelict buildings, opening up spaces and giving opportunities for businesses to come in.  It is a really exciting time and all of it is being driven by local government, supported by the Government, which is working with local authorities on a regular basis.<\/p> <p>  As I said, action is happening on the appointment of biodiversity and heritage officers.  In addition, more posts in planning will be sanctioned, as I referenced last night, as well as additional staff in all local authorities for the delivery of Housing for All.  We will make a significant announcement in this regard in the coming days, the details of which will be shared with the committee.  Following the passing of the Supplementary Estimate, we will be able to provide further additional funding to local authorities.<\/p> <p>  I take this opportunity to refer to CPOs, on which we need to do better.  Some local authorities do well in this regard and others must be supported to improve.  As members will be aware, under Housing for All, we will be getting the Housing Agency involved in another targeted round of CPOs in respect of derelict properties to put them back onto the market.  We will also issue CPOs for other properties to bring them into the social housing supply.  When we launch the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme, we will be able to provide grant assistance for people who want to buy a home that has been vacant for a certain period.  That will help owner-occupiers to make such properties into homes.  There are many good things happening in that delivery space.  I think I have covered most of the points raised by the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120200002#G00200","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I welcome the Supplementary Estimate and congratulate the Minister on all the work he is doing.  He has hit the ground running and everybody on the committee agrees that he is the man with all the solutions.  We are invigorated by his efforts to date, as I am sure everyone here agrees.<\/p> <p>  I want to follow up on the points raised by the Chairman regarding heritage officers and county architects.  In Longford County Council, both of those roles are in place and they are transformative.  The additional appointment of biodiversity officers would be a very welcome step.  I am delighted to hear that more staff are coming.  One of the major challenges we have in following through on the very ambitious plans to reform housing provision is the need for additional staff.<\/p> <p>  I want to flag a number of issues with the Minister, most of which I have already raised with him.  Ballymahon in County Longford needs a fire station.  Center Parcs is doing a major new development there, involving an additional 500 units and several hundred more staff.  The company has flagged the need for a new fire station, which I will follow up on with the Minister.<\/p> <p>  I previously raised with him issues to do with the old shared ownership scheme.  It is punitive for people to try to buy themselves out of that scheme.  I understand his officials are having a look at the issue and doing a scoping exercise to see what can be done to resolve it.  Is there any progress on that to date?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme and the commitment to a fresh start for people in second relationships, I would like to see something definite on that in the next couple of months.  Many people are in limbo as a result of the current uncertainty.<\/p> <p>  Affordable housing provision needs to be rolled out throughout the State, an ambition I know the Minister shares.  We really need to see it being done.<\/p> <p>  As we become more carbon and environmentally aware, an issue I am increasingly finding is that many elderly people in rural areas are living in inadequate houses.  For instance, I know of a lady in a rural location who owns her own home and is in receipt of a payment from the Department of Social Protection.  Her house is only valued at &euro;60,000 and, if she sells it, she will not be able to buy an adequate replacement.  There are schemes operating in Dublin whereby people can hand over properties to the local authorities and swap them for a new one.<\/p><p>I would like to see the Minister's officials look at something similar for rural Ireland to help those, increasingly older people, caught in such inadequate housing.<\/p><p> I hope I have left enough time for my colleague, Deputy Higgins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120200002#G00400","speaker":"1597","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":574,"content":"<p>There is no way we can leave Deputy Higgins out.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Flaherty and the Chairman mentioned county architects.  There is a commitment in that regard in Housing for All.  Not all our counties have county architects.  They have been extremely valuable, particularly in making sure that the character of particular areas is maintained.  In Cork, Clonakilty and such places they have been really successful.  That is an action point and we will do it.  We will continue to roll out additional technical posts.  These are good jobs in which people can see they have really good opportunities to build real and lasting careers in our local government sector.  That is what I want.  I want our graduates coming into local government, I want apprenticeships in local government and I want people back out building, using their trades and so on.  We are working on the county architects element and will work on it further.<\/p> <p>  As for fire stations, Deputy Flaherty has mentioned Ballymahon to me before.  We are looking at it as part of the review.  Just so members know, we have a five-year capital plan worth &euro;61 million for fire services.  It is a very significant plan.  I have kept fire services directly under my remit.  I have immense regard for the women and men of our fire services all across the country.  I have had the pleasure of visiting many of the fire stations across the country.  We have seen great improvements to their facilities and equipment.  That capital plan is really significant and we will drive it on.  There will be a review of it early in the new year, so any Deputies who have matters they wish to raise, as Deputy Flaherty has done with Ballymahon, may do so and we will revert to them on those matters.<\/p> <p>  The Fresh Start principle permeates all the affordable housing mechanisms and schemes we have in place.  It is really important to people who may have gone through a marriage break-up, personal insolvency, etc.  Fresh Start will apply also to the revised Rebuilding Ireland home loan, which is the local authority affordable home loan.  We have already reduced the rating on it.  We are making some further changes to it.  I have issued letters and circulars on affordable housing to all local authorities.  All directors of housing services and chief executives have also had full briefings on affordable housing with my housing team.  We are helping them and working together to do this.<\/p> <p>  I wish to leave time for Deputy Higgins to come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120200002#H00200","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":575,"content":"<p>We have three minutes, and I have to stick strictly to that because the room needs to be vacated and prepared for the next meeting.

I welcome the historic investment in the housing budget, which, of course, is the number one priority for all of us on the committee.  I know that that funding will be used to help people to own their own home or to get into long-term affordable leases.  That is very welcome.  I also welcome the &euro;2 billion URDF funding.  We see the benefits of that funding in Lucan every day.  The Minister was there for the opening of Tandy's Park and saw the huge impact the funding has had.  Airlie Park is under construction.  It is good to hear that the Minister is preparing to make announcements on additional planning and housing staff for local authorities.  They are badly needed.  We need more people not only in housing to make sure that the budget is being exhausted and spent in the right place but also in planning when it comes to everything from enforcement right through to decision-making.<\/p> <p>  As for resourcing, I have two quick suggestions for the Minister.  First, I ask that he look at costing a clerk of works role across local authorities and decide whether that could be incorporated long-term into planning policy and legislation to ensure that planning is appropriately regulated.  Second is the creation of an animal welfare officer in each local authority.  The Minister might think that that might impact only rural councils, but urban ones such as mine in south Dublin have an awful lot of dealings with horses in particular.  My Lovely Horse Rescue has been calling for this measure.<\/p> <p>  I have a further brief question that the Minister might answer if there is time.  It is about the key performance indicators, KPIs, or goals for chief executives.  The Department has a stringent rhythm and cadence in respect of its reporting on housing, social housing in particular.  The Department captures the affordable housing metrics as well.  I would like to know if it measures other things.  When it allocates money for vacant or void units, for example, does the Minister get a reassurance that those resources are ring-fenced by each local authority and spent for that specific use?  When the Minister makes announcements in this regard, he usually says the funding is enough to cover 150 units or whatever per local authority.  Is the Minister made aware when that housing comes back into stock?  Does he get that reported on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021120200002#H00400","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1638403200,"counter":577,"content":"<p>Minister, could you be as brief as possible?

We are considering that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Higgins is right that animal welfare is really important.  It generally falls under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine but I can raise the matter with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, because there is interaction between his Department and local authorities.  The matter is mainly a function of his Department, but the Deputy makes a very good point and I understand completely why she has raised it.  I will raise it with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Higgins's council is South Dublin County Council, and I have been out there with her a number of times.  Tandy's Park is magnificent.  That whole area is seeing new homes built for families with brilliant new facilities being delivered in partnership between the local authority and the private sector.  The local authority is doing it with State money; private builders are doing it as well.  Everyone, public and private, has to work together to deliver the facilities we need.  There is no utopia where the State will do everything for everyone.  It does not work that way.  It is good that we are delivering good, affordable homes and facilities for people.<\/p> <p>  I ask Deputy Higgins to come directly to me on any other matters she wishes to raise.
