Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.  Unfortunately, this week we had a bit of a step backwards but hopefully this will not be for too much longer.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  This morning we engage with officials from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to examine the 2020 appropriation account, Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners; account of the receipts of revenue of the State collected by the Revenue Commissioners 2020; and, from the 2020 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts of the public services, chapter 12 - controls over the temporary wage subsidy scheme, and chapter 13 - Revenue's management of suspicious transactions reports.  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by officials from the Revenue Commissioners.  In attendance are Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman, Mr. Gerry Harrahill, commissioner, and Mr. Brian Boyle, assistant secretary, all of whom are very welcome.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so that we do not pick up background noise or feedback.  I remind all those attending to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards references speakers may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precinct is protected pursuant to the constitutional statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside of the Leinster House precincts and as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to seek legal advice on this matter.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  To assist our broadcast and debates services, I ask members to direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not being directed to a specific witness, I ask that each witness state his or her name the first time he or she contributes.<\/p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#A00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638437400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>As members are aware, the Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the collection of taxes, duties and other levies and charges, and for their prompt transfer either to the Central Fund of the Exchequer or to other fund accounts or public bodies as provided for in law.  Revenue accounts for these receipts and transfers in what is generally referred to as the Revenue account.  The 2020 account was certified by me on 20 April 2021 and received a clear audit opinion.<\/p> <p>  Tax receipts payable to the Exchequer in 2020 amounted to a net &euro;56.2 billion, a decrease of &euro;2.1 billion or 3.6% when compared to 2019.  The most significant change related to net VAT receipts, which decreased by &euro;2.7 billion or 18% year on year.  This decrease was offset by an increase of &euro;946 million in corporation tax net receipts.  Non-exchequer net receipts collected by Revenue on behalf of other agencies decreased from &euro;15.8 billion to &euro;15.3 billion, a reduction of nearly 4%.  Pay related social insurance, PRSI, contributions account for nearly 75% of such receipts.  PRSI net receipts decreased by 7.5% in 2020 as compared to 2019.<\/p> <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s administration and operational expenses are charged to Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners rather than to the Revenue account.  Revenue&rsquo;s total gross expenditure in 2020 was &euro;467 million.  Salary costs of &euro;329 million account for 70% of Revenue&rsquo;s spend.  Taking account of appropriations-in-aid of &euro;60 million, net expenditure under the Vote amounted to &euro;407 million.<\/p> <p>  In my report on the appropriation account for 2020, I draw attention to non-compliance with procurement rules.  This is disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial controls.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, was introduced to enable employers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions to receive support from the State in relation to their wage costs.  The scheme was operated by the Revenue Commissioners and funded by the Department of Social Protection.  The scheme operated in two phases over a 22-week period from 26 March to 31 August 2020.  It was succeeded by the employee wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, which is also operated by Revenue and funded by the Department.  The scheme provided very substantial assistance to employers.  In 2020, subsidies totalling &euro;2.8 billion were paid to 66,370 employers in respect of approximately 678,000 employees.  This represented support to an estimated 36% of all employers registered with Revenue pre the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  Similar to the administration of the tax system, the scheme operated on a self-assessed basis.  This meant employers self-declared that they met the eligibility criteria and calculated how much they were due and received subsidy payments on that basis.  In June 2020, Revenue commenced eligibility checks on all employers who received subsidies.  By the end of July 2021, subsidies totalling &euro;311 million had been identified by Revenue as repayable.  The bulk of this, approximately &euro;252 million, related to subsidies paid during the initial phase of the scheme when a flat rate of &euro;410 per week was paid.  Of the &euro;311 million repayable, &euro;212 million had been repaid and a further &euro;81 million was warehoused for future collection.  The balance of &euro;18 million was outstanding for recovery.  These figures are as at the end of July 2021.  Overall, we found that while there was a material level of excess funding of employers under the scheme, Revenue had signalled to employers from the outset that they would be required to repay any excess.  Revenue implemented a comprehensive compliance regime that has identified overpayments and has substantially recovered them.<\/p> <p>  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 introduced the requirement for certain designated persons to submit reports to Revenue where they have suspicions of terrorist financing or money laundering, including the laundering of the proceeds of tax evasion.  These are referred to by Revenue as suspicious transaction reports, STRs, and potentially provide useful intelligence to Revenue in tackling shadow economy activity.  Over the five-year period 2016 to 2020, Revenue received approximately 125,000 STRs or an average of approximately 25,000 STRs per year.  The STRs received are matched to taxpayers, where possible, and are risk rated.  Revenue was able to match nearly 90% of the STRs it received in the years 2016 to 2020 to identified taxpayers.  Some 40% of the matched cases were considered high risk.  Of these, nearly half were subsequently closed without a Revenue intervention and 20% progressed to some form of compliance activity.  Ultimately, very few STRs directly yielded additional tax revenue.  Only approximately 500 of the reports received between 2016 and 2020 had yielded additional revenues by end February 2021, amounting to just over &euro;23 million.  STRs are also used to feed into Revenue&rsquo;s risk assessment of taxpayers, however, and so may indirectly contribute to a later targeted audit or other intervention.<\/p> <p>  The examination reviewed a sample of 50 closed cases to assess whether the appropriate course of action had been taken and in nearly 85% of cases reviewed, no issues were identified.  In a number of cases, Revenue officials considered the STRs to be relevant to other Revenue branches for possible further investigation but there was no evidence of activity following referral to the other branch.  Revenue carried out a review of aged cases and concluded that a new protocol was needed to manage the transfer of STRs between divisions.<\/p><p>Overall, we found that Revenue complies generally with international good practice in the management of STRs.  The examination made five recommendations in relation to the management of STRs, all of which were agreed by Revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638437400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I understand that today&rsquo;s meeting is to focus on: the 2020 appropriation account; the 2020 account of the receipt of revenue of the State; chapter 12, controls over the TWSS; and chapter 13, Revenue&rsquo;s management of suspicious transactions.  I am accompanied by Gerry Harrahill, commissioner and director general of Customs and Excise and Brian Boyle, accountant general.<\/p> <p>  In the context of today&rsquo;s discussions, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.  In 2020 Revenue collected total gross Exchequer receipts of &euro;82.3 billion, including &euro;15.4 billion in non-Exchequer receipts collected on behalf of other Government Departments and agencies.  The net Revenue receipts were &euro;56.2 billion, which was a decrease of &euro;2.1 billion or 3.6.% on the 2019 figures.  Up to the end of October this year the net Exchequer receipts collected by Revenue were over &euro;50.2 billion, some &euro;8.4 billion or 20% more than the same period last year.  Revenue&rsquo;s gross expenditure in 2020 was &euro;467 million compared with &euro;449 million in 2019, an increase of &euro;18 million or 4%.  The increase primarily relates to increased staffing levels, ICT expenditure and Brexit infrastructure costs.  Revenue had 6,680 staff serving at the end of 2020, with &euro;329 million of Revenue&rsquo;s &euro;467 million expenditure related to salaries.  The other main item of expenditure was ICT, which accounted for &euro;64 million in 2020.<\/p> <p>  In chapter 12 the Comptroller and Auditor General reviews the controls over the TWSS.  The scheme was introduced at an unprecedented pace, such was the immediate and serious impact of Covid-19 on the cashflow and trading abilities of businesses, with Revenue making the first TWSS payments just four days after the scheme was announced.  The technical infrastructure developed for real-time payroll reporting provided the platform that allowed us to deliver these vital financial supports quickly and efficiently to impacted employers and employees.  The visibility of payroll data that PAYE modernisation gave us enabled us to design TWSS in an extremely limited timeframe and in a way that significantly reduced the opportunities for abuse of the scheme.  Under the scheme, subsidies totalling &euro;2.8 billion gross were paid to 67,222 employers in respect of 689,422 employees.<\/p> <p>  Beginning in June 2020 Revenue engaged in a phased programme of compliance checks on all participating employers.  Compliance checks as at November 2021 are now 99.5% complete with 359 checks ongoing.  Completed checks have confirmed 97.5% compliance by employers with the conditions of the scheme with Revenue accepting that the employers concerned had a reasonable expectation on entry into the scheme that turnover would decrease significantly.  Revenue has recouped just over &euro;29 million in TWSS related overpayments from 1,658 or 2.5% of employers.  We also undertook a reconciliation exercise which identified an aggregate liability of &euro;308 million, the majority of which related to the transitional period up to 5 May when we paid &euro;410 per week per eligible employee to employers.  Bringing the compliance and reconciliation exercises together, the aggregate amount of TWSS identified for recovery amounts to &euro;324 million.  Some &euro;251 million of this has been repaid to Revenue, &euro;60 million is included in the tax debt warehouse, &euro;3 million is at appeal and a further &euro;10 million is now available for collection.<\/p> <p>  In Chapter 13, the Comptroller and Auditor General reviews Revenue&rsquo;s management of STRs.  Revenue has been in receipt of STRs since 2003.  STRs provide vital intelligence in the investigation of money laundering and terrorist financing as well as in the detection of tax evasion.  Based on global developments and the expansion of designated reporting entities, it is expected that the number of STRs received will continue to rise as increased measures are introduced to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.  In September 2020, Revenue introduced a new online system to require all designated bodies to submit STRs online through the Revenue online service, ROS.  Enhancements were also introduced to improve how STRs are processed within Revenue, including automatic uploading to linked profiles in Revenue&rsquo;s case management system.  The five recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General have been agreed by Revenue.<\/p> <p>  As was the case for many other organisations, 2020 was an unprecedented year for Revenue.  Our investment in real-time payroll reporting meant that working with the payroll software sector we were able to quickly provide financial support directly to businesses, while also continuing with our core business as a tax and customs administration.  Brexit resulted in a fundamentally changed trading environment between Ireland and Great Britain since 1 January 2021.  Brexit infrastructure and accommodation costs were over &euro;9.6 million at Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort, with further expenditure of over &euro;14 million expected in 2021.  Further changes to the UK Government&rsquo;s import requirements from January next will mean more adjustments.  We will continue to work collaboratively with trade and business, both collectively and individually, to ensure trade flows remain as efficient as possible while meeting our Single Market and customs union obligations.<\/p> <p>  The TWSS was replaced by the EWSS from 1 September 2020.  EWSS subsidy payments to date have amounted to &euro;5.65 billion while PRSI credits have amounted to over &euro;877 million.  The total amount claimed under the Covid restrictions support scheme to date is &euro;704 million in respect of 25,500 premises.  The total amount paid out under the business resumption support scheme has been &euro;6.2 million in respect of 1,680 businesses.  In addition, there was over &euro;2.8 billion of debt warehoused at the end of October 2021.  I have responded to the committee in recent times on matters related to the misclassification of workers as self-employed and arrangements in place for couriers since the late 1990s; contracts that were non-compliant with procurement guidelines; and a tax settlement in a specific case that was of interest to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Remote working, facilitated by our secure and sophisticated ICT framework, has been the norm for the majority of Revenue staff throughout the pandemic.  On a daily basis Revenue staff engage with taxpayers, take and make telephone calls about a wide variety of issues such as Brexit; tax repayments; local property tax; complex international tax issues; and the Covid support schemes.  In 2020 and 2021 there have been significant seizures of drugs and cigarettes and we continue to work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our international partners in tackling illegal activity.  Revenue staff have responded excellently to the changed environment arising from Covid-19.  I take this opportunity to thank them for their resilience, commitment and professionalism.  I again draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality.  Subject to this constraint, I am happy to answer members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1638437400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Good morning everyone.

At the time, the Department of Finance was engaging with us about the challenges businesses were facing.  We had suspended our normal enforcement activity from 10 March.  We had suspended the imposition of interest and the referral of cases to the Revenue sheriffs.  We were looking at how we would manage this process in the midst of a pandemic.  We proposed to the Department that the best way to do this, to give a legal framework to build a successful system, was to bring forward legislation.  We came up with the concept of the debt warehouse.  In the July stimulus, there was an anticipation that we were going to come out of Covid and that there was a process in which businesses would recover.  Unfortunately, that has not happened.  Subsequently, the debt warehousing period was extended again in the Finance Bill.<\/p> <p>  In terms of how it works, the first period is up to the end of this year.  That covers VAT liabilities up and including November-December 2021 and PAYE and PRSI liabilities up to and including December 2021.  They are the loss periods for the first periods of the debt warehousing.  For all of 2022, for any debt in the warehouse repaid in that period there will be no interest.  No interest accrues on any of the debt that is in the warehouse from March 2020 to 31 December 2021.  As of 31 October, 98,000 individual customers are availing of the debt warehouse facility.  At the end of October, there was &euro;2.8 billion in total in the debt warehouse.  We publish figures every month on debt warehousing.  We will be publishing figures for the end of November next week.  <\/p> <p>  For 2022, the debt is warehoused.  Businesses have to engage with us at the end of 2022 to come up with appropriate arrangements.  It is not yet set out what the maximum period will be.  We will take an appropriate arrangement from each individual business having regard to its individual circumstances.  The key condition - it is really important that businesses are ware of this - is that they must keep current returns to up date even if they cannot pay.  We have written to the 98,000 customers in the past three weeks to remind them to file their returns.  It is really important that have their returns in and up-to-date as otherwise they might fall out of the warehousing and, thus, be subject to the normal interest rates.

Some businesses will be in a position to start repaying on an instalment arrangement quicker than others.

Section 851A of that Act is a provision that makes it a criminal offence to speak about the affairs of taxpayers.  Every time I appear before this committee or other committees, I always highlight the fact that section 851A limits what I can speak about in the context of individual cases.  We have provided a comprehensive reply to the request for information by the committee on the case.  I have no problem going through the reply with the committee, but I will bow to the direction of the Chairman on when he wishes to take that.  I am sure many of the committee members are interested in a discussion on the case.<\/p> <p>  As an introductory piece, I refer to the self-assessment system.  The original assessment in this case was determined by the taxpayer and the original assessment was a nil liability.  That must be borne in mind as well.  We then wrote under self-assessment and we would carry out our audit and inquiries.  We raise assessments when we believe it is appropriate based on the information we have and having regard to timelines.  We are bound by timelines in the context of when we can raise assessments.  In the normal course, once the assessment is raised, the taxpayer is entitled to appeal that assessment and provide additional information following the raising of the assessment.  In many cases, that gives rise to a settlement before the matter goes to appeal.  The background, to the extent I can discuss the case, is set out in the letter.  It is important to note that the explanation of how the self-assessment, appeal and assessment systems work is also set out in that letter.  I am willing to go through it.  I believe there was a bit of a misunderstanding.  Originally, the Chairman thought the committee had written to us but we had not responded.  I was watching the proceedings.  The Chairman was surprised that the committee had not received a reply, but we had not received the request.  We replied in line with the request, as we always do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1638437400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cody.

On the whole process of self-employment and employment, the grey areas that overlap in classification and misclassification are a challenge in which we are only one of the parties.  From a tax purpose, the tax liability is actually the same whether persons are taxed under \"self-employment\" or under \"employment\", except in the treatment of expenses that are allowable.  We were dealing with this against a backdrop of non-compliance across a sector.  The person in our office dealing with this was working on it for a considerable period in the 1990s.

One company told me it was closing up shop because it can no longer deal with this because it does not know what is coming down the road.  This is the problem the importers have.  They understood when they paid the tax that everything was above board and they were finished with Revenue.  They then went on to the next stage in the market.<\/p> <p>  The second issue I raise concerns the importation of tobacco.  During the lockdown in 2020, my understanding is that the value of sales of tobacco products increased by &euro;150 million.  I presume that is related to fewer people travelling abroad and being able to bring in tobacco products legally.  I am not talking about bringing in cigarettes and other tobacco products illegally.  What is Revenue's view regarding dealing with this issue?  On one hand, we have a health issue relating to trying to reduce the level of tobacco consumption while, on the other, we are facilitating in real terms the importation of these products with no tax paid and at a much cheaper price?  Where are we in terms of reviewing that?  Finland will not allow any product in unless the health warning is in Finnish and Swedish whereas here, the health warning can be in Spanish and there is still no restriction in real terms as regards people physically bringing in these products.  Is this being looked at?

The Deputy is right.  It is a balance between health requirements and lowering the level of cigarettes where prices go up budget on budget.  There were significant seizures in 2020 and 2021.  In 2020, we seized 48.2 million cigarettes with a value of &euro;32.8 million. while up to the end of October 2021, we had seized 55.9 million cigarettes with a value of &euro;40 million.  Regarding the level of tobacco seizures involving roll-your-own and, increasingly over the past number of years, loose-leaf tobacco, there is evidence that illicit cigarette manufacturing is taking place on the island.  We have detected cigarette manufacturing facilities and I spoke to this committee a couple of years ago about the large seizure at a factory in County Louth.  There were tobacco seizures to the end of October 2021 to the value of &euro;23.1 million, which is by far the highest figure for roll-your-own tobacco we have ever had.<\/p> <p>  We take cigarette smuggling very seriously.  It involves organised criminal gangs.  The lockdown has had an impact on the legal market obviously because people can buy duty-free cigarettes depending on where they are coming from and if they go to Spain, cigarettes are cheaper there and they can bring them back legally.  Every year, in conjunction with the tobacco regulator, we carry out a survey of illegal cigarette smuggling.  The market for illegal cigarettes runs at around 15%.

We found that components within that sector regularly used agency staff to employee companies.  These companies often consist of just one single person.  The company is often incorporated in a country that person has never been to.  Serious concerns were raised about the potential for exploitation.

One of the trends that has evolved over the past ten or 15 years is the use of corporate structures.  Two formats are used.  There are personal service companies, which generally involve one individual and he incorporates his business.  Therefore, it would be Niall Cody Limited that provides services to a principal contractor.  Then there are what are called managed service companies, MSCs, which generally involve five directors, sometimes not linked to each other, sometimes providing a kind of service to different principal contractors, generally facilitated through a professional services firm that specialises in these types of structures.<\/p> <p>  We know that in certain sectors there are international dimensions to some of those because there are employment agencies that are used by some of the sectors.  That happens throughout the contracting process.  The personal service companies, PSCs, and MSCs are fairly common in the area of ICT.  There is some of it in the construction sector and some of it in the meat sector.  It is in pharma and throughout the media.  It has probably replaced a lot of the self-employment.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General will remember that he did a review of our national contractors project in the report for 2014 where we carried out a fairly extensive inquiry into the practices of PSCs and MSCs in relation to expenses.  We had significant publications and settlements of cases where the structures were used and in the use of the structures the whole ratio of expenses were manipulated.  Some of them involved the use of family members as employees of their own company.  We recovered significant moneys on the tax risks in relation to PSCs and MSCs.  Irish legislation does not have a provision to look through the corporate structure which has been a trend in some other companies.

The challenge then for us was that this was under our care and management rules and our care and management facility, but there is a limit to our care and management; we cannot just ignore the law as provided for.  That is why we were anxious that the warehousing system would be legislated for.  The warehousing system provides the legislation and the rules about who can avail of the warehousing system.  So, businesses - these are smaller businesses generally dealt with by our business division and our personal division - are eligible to warehouse debt.  For any other case - those are cases in our large cases division or medium enterprise division with a turnover probably in excess of, at the time, &euro;5 million - they have to show that they were adversely affected by Covid in not carrying out their trade to be eligible to get into the warehouse.

An interesting feature about the warehousing is that the first debts went into warehousing in January or February 2020 before Covid restricted anything.  Those businesses would have had a normal January or February.  That forms the seed capital of the warehousing system.<\/p><p> One of the most interesting features of the system is the number of businesses that warehoused debt and that have subsequently paid it.  They have not put all of their liabilities into the warehouse.  This reflects how some of them are probably doing a little better than others.  Having debt on the balance sheet is not what businesses want if they can pay it off.<\/p><p> The advantage of the Revenue warehousing system is that there is zero interest.  Throughout 2020 and 2021, I read a great deal of commentary from business representative groups that there was a low uptake of some of the loan schemes and asking why any business would take up one of the loan schemes when it could warehouse its tax liability and use that as funding capital at a 0% interest rate during the period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#G01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638437400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I will allow Deputy Carthy back in later but we have gone over time.

A third significant aspect is the investment that has been made by all agencies nationally and internationally in technology and equipment, including scanners and other detection equipment.  The increase in seizures is down to a combination of all of these factors.<\/p> <p>  It is useful to draw attention to another matter.  One of the large seizures this year that the Deputy will be aware of involved the seizure of cocaine that had been ingested in coke.  It shows the ingenuity and purposefulness of the organised crime gangs.  It is important to remember that these are multimillion or, in some instances, multibillion euro industries.

Intelligence has a long gestation.  Work that may start on a case or programme today may not come to fruition for two years.

We had two objectives in mind in doing so.  Notwithstanding all the work involved in getting ready for Brexit, once it happened we clearly needed to support businesses in that transition and we have done so.  Increasingly, our focus is on those changes that will kick in, as the Deputy said, on 1 January 2022.  The main change to come is that the authorities on the UK side will be seeking compliance with their import formalities.  The other element then is that over the course of 2022 the UK authorities will be ratcheting up controls on the sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, side of things.<\/p> <p>  We have therefore continued our engagement with trade and representative bodies, which has been very positive.  It has emphasised the importance of us being aware of what the issues are for businesses.

I have probably said this before at other meetings, but the one thing that businesses hate is uncertainty.

I am going to pass the Brexit ball to Mr. Harrahill again, but before I do I will give some idea of the scale.  Mr. Harrahill and I appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in the run-up to Brexit and we were talking then about the fact that we used to handle 1.8 million customs entries before Brexit.  We had anticipated that we would have to scale up to handle something like 20 million customs entries in the first year post-Brexit, which would have been a ten-fold increase, by and large.  The reality is that this year we are probably looking at a 30-fold increase in customs entries.<\/p> <p>  We examine aspects such as the local property tax and pay and file tax returns and scale.  Our chief information officer, CIO, rang me the other day in that context, just after the pay and file tax returns deadline. We spend our time in the context of that pay and file process looking at our systems and ensuring that they are robust and working.  Our CIO told me when he rang on that occasion that we had handled 350,000 customs entries, and that that was the highest level of entries we had on one day.  Mr. Harrahill and I were chatting about this subject yesterday, and since then we have handled something like 700,000 customs entries in one day.  This increase has been driven by several factors.  The impact of Covid-19 has been massive on e-commerce.  In addition, the EU rules concerning postal, VAT and customs' rates changed on 1 July, and that has presented significant challenges around low-value items.  Therefore, the scale of customs operations is massive.  I will pass over to Mr. Harrahill to add a bit of colour to this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#J01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1638437400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Mr. Harrahill may be able to answer a more specific question for me.  A 60-fold increase is an astonishing expansion in any walk of life, for the public sector or for private enterprise.  How is Revenue managing that as an organisation?

To expand on what Mr. Cody touched on, several things that came together have contributed to this explosion in customs entries.  A consequence of the Covid-19 restrictions is that more and more people have gone from shopping in retailers on the main streets of our cities and towns to doing much of that online.  That is undoubtedly one element of this increase, and we could see that facet of the change starting to kick in from last year.<br\/><br\/>The second significant element is that the rules concerning liability for VAT for small packages and parcels changed from 1 July 2021.  Formerly, there was an exemption from VAT when people were importing goods valued at less than &euro;22.  As part of the move at EU level on rules to try to ensure there was no distortion of competition and to tackle some issues with the valuation of goods, that <i>de minimis<\/i>rule was removed.  If people are now importing something worth &euro;5, that package will be subject to VAT charges but not to customs duties.  Those two things together have contributed enormously to causing this situation.  A huge number of these customs entries are parcels and packages, as distinct from big consignments.  I say that because in the early days of big consignments, and again as a consequence of the transition from the pre-Brexit situation to the post-Brexit changed reality, combined with the impact of Covid-19 and associated restrictions, trade flows slowed down.  They are now returning to something closer to normal.  <br\/><br\/>The explosion of activity in this area is not just an Irish phenomenon, however, but one that has been seen in all member states.  I attend a meeting every couple of weeks of people involved in this area from the member states.  We examine where things stand in this regard in the post-Brexit environment and everybody is sharing that experience.  People who never previously had engagement with customs, and never understood what we did, are now suddenly part of this new regime.  It is a new reality.  <br\/><br\/>This is also part of why we have done much work last year and this year, leading up to Black Friday, and all those times, for example, to try to focus people's attention on the issue that now arises when importing goods from outside the EU in respect of liability for customs charges and VAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Harrahill"},{"type":"speech","time":1638437400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Undoubtedly.

That scheme was brought in and it was going to be made available for any employee who was let go.  When it was introduced, we ourselves looked at whether we could use our PAYE system to provide a mechanism to allow employers to support employees.  We contacted the Department of Finance to say we thought we could do something to enable employers to do that.  The Government then looked at it - it was the quickest response we have ever got to any proposal we have made - and said that if we could do that, that would be great.  It was then a policy decision around having a broad-based scheme to support employment and this was across the full sector of the economy.<\/p> <p>  As it turned out subsequently, most of the money has been funded by the EU as part of the support of the EU system in response to the Covid pandemic impact.  It was a broad-based scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme, which replaced it, is similarly broadly based across the economy.  That makes sure it does not fall foul of any state aid rules, as would be the case if we picked particular sectors.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, it is a Government decision.  The wage subsidy schemes have been a phenomenal success in meeting the policy requirements of keeping people in employment.  Today's newspapers show unemployment is down to something like 6.9%, according to Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures published today.  We never had the wage subsidy schemes before and I do not know what will happen in future, but the payroll system and the PAYE modernisation have provided that platform to support businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021120200002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1638437400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I reiterate there is a broad recognition within the Oireachtas that the work done in Revenue by its employees has, in general, been very good.

The scheme provided that the TWSS payment had to be shown on the payslips of anyone receiving it.  Through the course of the year, certain financial institutions had concerns and brought in blanket rules which called into question mortgage applications if a person's employer was in receipt of the subsidy.  Representations were made to us about some of those cases.  We identified that we have no role in what the mortgage company does.  We passed on concerns in submissions made to us regarding banking oversight to the Department of Finance.  Transparency about being in receipt of the scheme was key because we wanted to ensure that employees knew exactly how much the employer was getting.

Customs requested certain documents to facilitate the clearing without duty on those vehicles.  The paperwork was produced.  However, months later, these vehicles had been sold on, with the VRT paid, they were re-registered, and then Revenue decided that it was looking for other documentation to support the vehicles that were already cleared.  It moved the goalposts in the middle of the whole operation.  Even though the vehicles were cleared, with one set of documents having been produced, Revenue was not happy with that and asked for more documents, which cannot be produced for specific reasons.

What concerns me about regulatory agencies such as Revenue making mistakes is that there is now an outstanding amount of money that Revenue states is due, when the reality is that Revenue has certain amounts of money belonging to these people, which it is probably going to hang on to to put against this bill.  The only recourse open to the businesses is probably judicial review.  Ultimately, what generally seems to happen in this country is that the judicial review goes against the regulatory agency when it gets to the court and the taxpayer picks up the bill for a legal fee which should never have arisen in the first place.  We can carry on the conversation another time, but I am making the witnesses aware that I am hot on the case of State agencies that are spending taxpayers' money entering into legal cases when they should know better.

On foot of a proposal by Deputy Sean Sherlock, this is one of 11 responses to our requests for information in relation to the use of public funds by An Taisce.  We have now received eight of the 11 responses.  The eight responses account for &euro;1.2 million, or 36% of the funding An Taisce received in 2019.  Responses from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are outstanding.  They account for &euro;2.18 million, or 64% of the funding.  This item has been flagged by Deputy Matt Carthy.

No.  It is proposed that we note and publish the item and consider the responses.  The next item is No. 901B from Mr. Niall Cody, chairman of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 18 November 2021, providing information requested by the committee regarding the disclosure of details of a settlement between Revenue and Perrigo.  At our meeting of 18 November, we considered a related response, R0873, from the Tax Appeals Commission.  We discussed this matter with Revenue during today's engagement and that debate is on the public record.  It is proposed that we note and publish this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The item has was flagged by me and Deputy Catherine Murphy.  I do not think Deputy Murphy is with us.  We dealt with No. 901B earlier and we are no clearer on it because of the issue regarding Revenue and confidentiality.  That is understandable.  Time did not allow us to go any further into the issue earlier.  The tax demand was for &euro;1.636 billion.  That was subsequently reduced following a number of interventions.  The case came before a court.  The final figure was that Perrigo is due to pay Revenue is &euro;266 million.  I propose to the committee that we write to Revenue Commissioners following today's meeting.  We must recognise the fact that there has to be client confidentiality, but in the general scheme of things, the issue at stake here would appear to be whether it was treated as a capital transfer incurring a rate of tax of 33%, or one of 12.5%, as part of its normal trading profits.  I suggest we write to Revenue and seek an answer to that question.  Surely, it is a matter of how a company, and particularly, a very large one, is treated for tax, and specifically, whether it is paying the 33% or the 12.5%.  If it is 12.5%, we should seek an explanation, because even at 12.5% the figure would be more than double what it came in, namely, &euro;266 million.  A tax rate of 12.5% would have given rise to a demand of possibly between &euro;600 million and &euro;700 million.  If it is agreed by the committee, I will ask the clerk to follow up with that information from Revenue.  While recognising the fact that it is bound by confidentiality around these matters, perhaps more light can be shed on that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>The next item is No. 903B from Mr. Derek Tierney, head of health infrastructure, Department of Health, dated 18 November 2021, and is a response to our request for information in relation to the analysis undertaken by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on the progress on the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  The progress report has been with the Department of Health for some time, and we have made a number of requests for sight of the report and information on the projected costs and completion date for the hospital.  The Department's position remains that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tthe Department and the Development Board have a responsibility to ensure the successful completion of this critical project and that any discussion of costs, however hypothetical or otherwise, at this time, would prejudice enforcement of the existing contract, and very likely negatively impact or jeopardise the Development Board in its ongoing engagement with the main contractor, and the Board's responsibilities for the timely completion of this critical project. <\/blockquote> <p>Our invitation to the Department of Health to our meeting on 16 December, which is two weeks from today, includes this matter as an agenda item.  Also on the agenda for that meeting is the value for money review of the nursing homes support scheme, or fair deal scheme.  As detailed in our January report on our examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the scheme, the review was initiated by the Department of Health in March 2018 and was due for publication in March 2019.  More than two and a half years later this item of correspondence states that a response on that matter will follow without specifying when.  I do not think committee members will be happy with that.  We recommended that the Department provide the committee with updates, but these have not been forthcoming.  That is most disappointing.  It is proposed that we note and publish the item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The item has been flagged by me and Deputy Catherine Murphy.

There are reports of the spiralling costs of the national children's hospital.

Optimistically, this hospital will not open until at least 2024.<\/p><p>Come that time, I fully expect the Department will tell us that it cannot comment because a legal case or negotiations are ongoing.  This is a complete lack of engagement in a new development.

In the end, it will likely be measured in billions of taxpayers' money.

There is concern in relation to that issue.  This time last year, members will recall, we were trying to arrange for the Department and the hospital board to come in to discuss this.  We delayed it and put it back to 9 February to facilitate this report on the children's hospital.  I was actually at that site the other day.  I am at a loss at this point as to how we are in a situation whereby the project is this far advanced without being able to ascertain the final costs.  I do not expect them to pin that down to the nearest dollar because obviously there are tweaks taking place and different elements built in for construction inflation.  How come the taxpayers, the Oireachtas, this committee and indeed the health committee, which has pursued this vigorously as well, cannot be given a figure for the estimated cost of this project when it is completed?  We are left guessing.  The media are left speculating, as are we.  We are trying to pick up hints from what we are being told.  As Chairperson, I find it totally disrespectful to be honest.  I do not see why this figure is not available at this point.  There is something seriously wrong if the Department cannot state the final cost of this project or when it will be completed.

It is incredible that a Department is in the situation whereby it does not have that report completed two and a half years later.

We should ask, if the committee is agreeable, that the Department should complete that report and give us an update on it when it comes before the committee.  At this point, Oireachtas Members, who are elected on behalf of the citizenry who pay the taxes that facilitate these schemes and everything else, need to know the answer to this.  We will ask the secretariat to include in the correspondence that we are disappointed and that we feel it has dragged on unnecessarily for a long period of time.
