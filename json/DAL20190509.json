I call on the Minister to make his statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900003#A00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1557390600,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to provide an update on matters related to CervicalCheck.  It is over a year since issues related to the CervicalCheck audit emerged.  I welcome the opportunity to address a range of issues that have arisen in the past year and outline the work that is well under way in my Department, the HSE and the National Cancer Registry of Ireland to address them and, moreover, drive continued improvement in the screening service.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth reflecting on what the CervicalCheck programme has achieved since it was set up in 2008.  Since its inception, the programme has carried out more than 3 million screening tests.  It has detected over 100,000 cases of abnormal cervical cells, many of which could have developed into cancer if not detected through screening and treated, where necessary.  Cervical cancer rates have reduced, from around 14 cases per 100,000 women in the years 2009 to 2011, inclusive, to 10 cases per 100,000 women in the years 2013 to 2015, inclusive.  The lifetime risk of a woman getting cervical cancer fell from one in 96 women in 2007 to one in 135 women in 2015 which, as Dr. Gabriel Scally noted in his report, represents a substantial improvement.<\/p>  <p>  Dr. Scally also included in his report something to which I want to draw attention again - the substantial contribution CervicalCheck staff have made to women's health since the programme was established.  I know how difficult a year it has been for them also.  <\/p>  <p>  Dr. Scally's report was produced following the in-depth scoping inquiry carried out by him and his team following a Government decision.  This House's contribution in drafting the comprehensive terms of reference for the scoping inquiry helped to ensure his report identified the core issues and provided the framework to fix the flaws he identified in the screening service.  He provided a progress report and a first report in June 2018 and his final report in September.  All told, he made 56 recommendations which addressed a range of issues, including governance, audit, procurement and women's health.<\/p>  <p>  An implementation plan for all recommendations has been developed and was published on the website of my Department on 12 December 2018, following a Government meeting.  There are more than 120 actions in the implementation plan which, together, address all of Dr. Scally's recommendations.  Some of the actions relate to work that had already been under way such as the establishment of a new board for the HSE and the proposed patient safety Bill.  Others have been put in place in response to Dr. Scally&rsquo;s report.  Work has been ongoing since December across the range of actions.  My Department, the HSE and the National Cancer Registry of Ireland all have important and ongoing work to do.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to say Dr. Scally has, at my request, reviewed the implementation plan for his recommendations.  He said publicly that never before had he drawn up a report and then been asked to oversee its implementation.  That is how seriously we are taking this issue.  He provided a very positive preliminary assessment last November and a more detailed report in February which was published on the website of my Department.  He was clear in that report that significant effort and resources were being committed to addressing the problems that had been identified and that the appropriate resourcing and project management structures were in place.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies will be well aware, Dr. Scally has committed to providing a supplementary report on certain further aspects of the laboratories, including procurement, quality and accreditation arrangements and governance structures.  I look forward to receiving and acting on this report in the coming weeks.  The report will, of course, be published once it has been shared first with representatives of the 221+ patient support group.  The full implementation of Dr. Scally's recommendations will ensure women can have absolute confidence in the cervical screening service.  Screening saves lives.  It is essential that women continue to use the programme and all of the indications are that they are continuing to use it.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that there continue to be challenges, one of which is lab capacity.  As Deputies are aware, following the issues which had emerged with the CervicalCheck screening programme, I made the decision to offer free out-of-cycle smears to any woman who was concerned about her health, where her general practitioner, GP, felt she should have a further test as part of providing reassurance.  The reality at the time was that general practitioners, in difficult and pressurised circumstances, were dealing with large numbers of worried patients.  GPs needed to be supported while they awaited supporting information to be developed and disseminated by CervicalCheck.  Approximately 112,000 consultations were provided by GPs, highlighting the sense of worry in the country, while 57,810 early repeat smear tests were provided between 1 May and 31 December.  In other words, about half of the consultations resulted in a smear test, which is very different from how it is portrayed.  Some 112,000 women saw their doctor, about 50% of whom decided, in consultation with their GP, that a repeat smear would be beneficial as part of providing reassurance.  I trust women and doctors in making those decisions.<\/p>  <p>  Laboratory turnaround times have increased as a result.  A backlog of over 80,000 smears had built up to the end of February 2019, a figure that has been well documented.  This reflects the 57,000 or so additional smears but also the fact that, thankfully, more women were using the screening programme, including some who had never before engaged with it.  The HSE has advised that it has sourced additional capacity internationally and that it is working to agree commercial arrangements and complete quality assurance processes in order to enable it to incorporate this capacity into the CervicalCheck programme.  I know that this will be welcome news.  It has been welcomed by the patient advocates, many cancer organisations and many Deputies in government and opposition.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is advising women that the natural history of cervical cancer indicates that the disease normally develops over a period of ten to 15 years.  It has stated that, in this context, a delay in the return of cervical screening results is undesirable but not necessarily dangerous and that it poses a very low clinical risk.  That is not an excuse for the backlog but an important message for the women of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The House will be aware that I have asked the HSE to introduce as soon as possible human papilloma virus, HPV, testing as the primary screening method for the prevention of cervical cancer.  This is in line with developments in cervical screening internationally.  Ireland will be among the first countries in the world to make this transition.  The HSE is engaging with other countries which have already made the switch in order to identify learnings for the project across a range of work streams, including reconfiguration of laboratories, procurement, information and communications technology, ICT, and colposcopy services.<\/p>  <p>  The report on the scoping inquiry led by Dr. Scally outlines the difference between the current testing approach, using the traditional cytology test as the primary test, and the newer HPV test.  It states that for every 1,000 women screened, around 20 will have pre-cancerous changes.  The traditional test will identify 15 of the women, while the HPV test will correctly identify 18.  In other words, it is a more sensitive and accurate test.  Funding to implement the switch to HPV screening and, importantly, extend the HPV vaccination to boys, an issue on which I know Deputy Kelly has advocated, has been allocated in budget 2019.  Vaccination for boys will be introduced in September.<\/p><p>The independent expert panel review, which is being conducted by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, will provide further clarity and assurance to the women who have consented to take part.  I am the first to admit that this has taken longer than expected, particularly due to the necessity of seeking consent from women or their next of kin.  However, I am pleased the review is now progressing well, with the transfer of all slides due to complete shortly.  Of crucial importance is that the results of the review are disclosed to women in a sensitive and quality assured manner, and work is ongoing to ensure the right process is in place for this to happen.<br\/><br\/>On 16 April 2019, the Government approved my proposal for the drafting of a Bill to establish a tribunal to hear and determine claims arising from the retrospective CervicalCheck cytology clinical audit and from the expert panel review of cervical screening, in particular in respect of the reading of smears.  This arises from recommendations made by Mr. Justice Charles Meenan in his report on an alternative system for dealing with claims arising from CervicalCheck.  The proposed tribunal will be chaired by Ms Justice Mary Irvine, a serving judge of the Superior Courts, and will be open to individuals who are part of the 221 group, along with individuals who are identified during the RCOG review, where this review presents findings discordant with those of the original cytology examination.<br\/><br\/>I am pleased that we have this opportunity to put in place a new process to hear and determine claims for these cases.  Mr. Justice Meenan&rsquo;s report provides a roadmap through a complex legal environment and the tribunal that he proposes is substantially different to anything that has been done before.  It has never been done before in our country.  Getting this right involves striking a careful balance between several important priorities, including the well-being of women and their families, the continued viability of life-saving cancer screening programmes, and the need to properly hold the State and private operators to account.  Following consultation with the office of the Attorney General, the general scheme of the legislation is now available on my Department's website.  The Bill has gone for drafting to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.  I have issued a letter to the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, Deputy Harty, who is present, to offer a briefing by my officials to committee members.  This is complex legislation but it is a priority for the Government.  Let me be clear that it is my intention to pass the legislation through both Houses before they rise for the summer recess.<br\/><br\/>On 11 March 2019, the Government agreed to my proposal to establish an <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme for women affected by the non-disclosure of the CervicalCheck audit.  The scheme is designed to provide an alternative, non-adversarial and person-centred option for women affected by the CervicalCheck non-disclosure issue.  The Government also approved the appointment of an independent assessment panel.  I have appointed the other two members of the panel, namely, Ms Brigid Doherty and Dr. Kevin Connolly, along with the judge.  The panel has begun its work and held its first meeting on 1 May 2019.  The role of the panel is to make a determination as to the appropriate amount of the <i>ex gratia<\/i>payment.  Under the terms of scheme, the same amount will be paid to each woman, or her estate, who is assessed by the panel not to have had appropriate and timely disclosure.  All women, or their next of kin, in the 221 cohort identified from the clinical audit as having discordance in their smear test results will be eligible to participate in the scheme and I am pleased that letters of invitations were issued yesterday.  The terms of the scheme will shortly be available on my Department's website.<br\/><br\/>Members can see the considerable focus on the various issues raised over the past year, and the progress that has been made in responding to them.  My overriding priority remains public health.  The country has the opportunity to drive the virtual eradication of cervical cancer through a combination of screening and vaccination against HPV.  Since the inception of the cervical screening programme, the incidence of cervical cancer in Ireland has been falling and we must build on this.  This is very much the focus of the work of my Department, the HSE, and the many brilliant patient advocates in implementing the recommendations of Dr. Gabriel Scally, as well as in the important development of extending the HPV vaccine to boys this year.  My priorities now are the <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme, the Meenan tribunal legislation and ensuring the capacity is in place to reduce the backlog turnaround times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900003#A00400","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557391200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Each Opposition spokesperson will have six minutes.

The circumstances of the free repeat smear test have been well documented but the Deputy and I have a different view despite the fact that many Members across the House called for its introduction at the time.

That is not pie in the sky, it is something that has been done effectively in other jurisdictions.  It will be done in Ireland through screening, HPV testing, the introduction of the HPV vaccination for boys, the promotion of vaccination by all Members of the House and, hopefully, the end of the silly nonsense and scaremongering of some Members against the life-saving vaccine and CervicalCheck.  We are implementing the recommendations of the Dr. Scally report, namely the 120 actions which - I accept Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's bona fides and passion on the issue - will genuinely give us a world-class screening programme which will continue to build on the progress CervicalCheck has made since its introduction in 2008 on foot of a brave decision by Fianna F&aacute;il in government which has helped to save lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900005#C00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1557391800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>My first question is on Dr. Scally.  His first report was in September.  Where is his second report?  I am becoming very concerned about this.  Something does not add up, as I have been saying now for months.  Let us go back to the meeting of the health committee of 13 February 2019.  At that meeting, I asked where the second report was.  We know there are issues around outsourcing and I am very confident that there are further issues in that regard which were not found in the first report.  We know also that there are huge issues in relation to quality assurance.  The second phase of reporting on the part of Dr. Scally relates to contracts and quality assurance and all related issues.  At the meeting of 13 February, I pressed the Secretary General of the Department of Health on when the second report would be forthcoming.  I spoke to him about the issues I have just set out.  He told me he believed the report was due imminently.  I asked how soon and whether it would be that week and he replied that it potentially would be that week.  That was 13 February.  What is after happening?  Is there a misunderstanding between the Department of Health and Dr. Scally regarding the terms of reference for phase 2?  In fairness to the Minister, he published the terms of reference.  I am not trying to catch him out.  I just want to know what has happened.  From September last year or the exact point at which the terms of reference were agreed and sent to him, Dr. Scally has been working on the terms of reference as written by the Department.  I want an assurance this minute that this is the case and that his work did not change as a consequence of what happened at the health committee meeting of 13 February 2019.  I cannot understand how the Secretary General could say the report was imminent and potentially due that week when it is still not done in the second week of May.  What is going on?  That is the first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900005#C00300","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1557391800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kelly for the questions.

I cannot remember the date but I told Deputy Kelly in the House on a previous occasion, when he put the proposition to me, that additional laboratories had been identified which had previously been used in our screening programme but which were not, to the best of my knowledge, still in use.  Dr. Scally provided me with an assurance that nothing he had found should concern me in relation to the safety of the laboratories being used today but he said he would require more time to look into some of the issues he had found regarding some of those laboratories.  Deputy Kelly has always been responsible on this and it is important to say Dr. Scally provided me with an assurance on the safety of the laboratories we are using today, albeit he said it would take him longer to do his work.  I believe it is nearly complete and I expect to receive it in the coming weeks.

I want him to be thorough.  I just want to know why, all of a sudden and in the middle of all this, Dr. Scally had a conversation.  I would have presumed the Department and Dr. Scally were hand in glove.  I cannot understand how a Secretary General would say it was imminent and potentially due that week when we are still waiting for it.  That does not suggest a hand-in-glove relationship.  Rather, it suggests a hands-off relationship and a not-in-control relationship.  I want dissection of what went on historically.  I appreciate what was in the first report and that we have to go through quality assurance and so on in the laboratories and in the contracts.  Something here does not add up because it has changed since 13 February.<\/p>  <p>  My second question relates to the decision of the judge in Ruth Morrissey's case.  I heard what the Minister said earlier about that and I wish her all the best.  She is an amazing woman.  There is an opportunity here.  We all know, albeit the Minister will not admit it for reasons I respect, that what the Taoiseach promised on \"Six One\" was unachievable.  It was scandalous to do so.  He overpromised something the Government could never do which was to say it would chase the laboratories and that the women would not have to go through the courts.  Ruth Morrissey spent over 35 days in court and it is a national scandal that she had to do so.  The judge has made his decision.  While I respect the fact that the Minister needs to get an opinion on it, the Government now has an opportunity to settle with these women and for the laboratories to be pursued separately.  The Taoiseach is so out of touch that last week he did not know what he was talking about a second time.  He said women would not now have to go through the process of giving evidence.  The only difference, which I acknowledge is unique, is the proposal following Mr. Justice Meehan's report that the press will not be involved.  The press has been very important in revealing every issue in relation to this scandal.  Women will still have to give evidence.  The Minister has an opportunity based on last week's decision to create a process to settle with these women.  All of these women and their families have the process of going through the High Court and they will have the process of going through the tribunal following this legislation.  However, there is a third way.  Many of the patient advocates believe there is a third way.  Will the Minister look at this third way to settle with the women and their families?  In his deliberations with the Attorney General, I ask the Minister on behalf of many people, to whom the Minister knows I speak, to seek advice on whether there is a third option, namely to mediate and settle with them to shorten the process for these women, many of whom do not have time on their side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900005#C00700","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1557392400,"counter":44,"content":"<p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>As the Deputy has acknowledged in his comments, I am not going to pre-empt the Attorney General's consideration of what the legal landscape looks like-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900006#D00100","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1557392400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I just want the Minister to add to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900006#D00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1557392400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>-----but I hear the point made by the Deputy.

We welcome the fact that people can have their hearing in public or private.  It is very important for women that their wishes are respected in that manner.  Women who may already have received a court settlement, however, are not to be allowed to give evidence to the tribunal.  While it is totally understandable that a person cannot have a second claim in this regard, it is important that all those who have been affected are allowed the opportunity to give evidence to the tribunal to help it in its deliberations.  Will the Minister confirm that women who have already received an award are barred from giving evidence?  I would welcome if that is not the case but I would appreciate clarity on it.

The Deputy has made a fair point about the Meenan legislation.  The Deputy has quite rightly indicated that people cannot, nor would they wish to, have two claims or go through two processes.  I believe Deputy Funchion is asking me whether it is possible for a woman who had gone through the courts to have her experience documented by the tribunal, if she so wished.  The Bill is at the general scheme point of preparation at present but I understand the legislation is currently silent on that matter.  It is a provision we probably could accommodate.

We have been very clear and are unified as a House in wanting Ms Morrissey to be supported, for her to receive the compensation the court has awarded to her and for her to be able to enjoy time with her own family, as she outlined after the court case last week.  There may be broader issues for the health service on which we will need clarity.  Today we are at the stage where the Attorney General is considering these matters and he will then revert to the Taoiseach and to me.  In due course we will consider how best to get that clarity.  As Deputy Donnelly has rightly said, many medics are now asking what are the implications for screening and for other elements of the health service?  We are duty bound to answer this question.

When one consider the three laboratories involved, the Coombe laboratory has a turnaround time of approximately three weeks, Quest Diagnostics has a turnaround time - from my memory - of approximately seven to nine weeks and MedLab Pathology had a much longer turnaround time.

Cervical screening is not a diagnostic test and this is where a lot of the issues have arisen.  No screening programme can identify 100% of the abnormality that it is looking for.  In this case the screening programme looks for pre-cancerous changes, which have a huge spectrum of change from zero to invasive cancer.  The programme attempts to deliver population health versus individual health.  Up to 2008 it was random screening of cervical smears and then the population health directorate introduced the national screening programme, which has delivered a huge amount of success in identifying women who had pre-cancerous changes.  Unfortunately, because the programme has inherent difficulties - all screening programmes have inherent difficulties - the judgment that was delivered last week on absolute confidence really misunderstands what screening programmes are all about.  It is not attainable or available to any screening programme to achieve 100% success.  Right across the world this is not possible.  Medicine is an uncertain business and one tries to confirm in an area of uncertainty.  Screening tries to improve population health.  Will the Minister tell the House if the judgment will put other screening programmes in doubt, has it put other diagnostic tests in doubt and has it put the future of cervical screening in doubt?  I understand there was a high-level meeting between CervicalCheck and departmental officials some days ago to discuss this very issue.  Has the judgment really damaged the future of all screening?  I believe there will be an appeal of the judgment.  Will the Minister comment on that?<\/p>  <p>  HPV testing has been promised for a year.  It was to come in last October and it is now promised for before the end of this year.  What are the barriers to introducing HPV testing before the end of this year?  Is it dependent on clearing the backlog or is it dependent on finding a laboratory that will provide the new level of testing?<\/p>  <p>  My third question relates to MedLab's coverage.  The smears that are sent to MedLab are usually from the regions outside the Dublin area.  I believe that MedLab is no longer accepting new smears since 1 July.  Those smears are now being stored pending access to new laboratory capacity, which has not been attained yet.  Will the Minister confirm if this is true?<\/p>  <p>  Earlier I made a suggestion for dealing with the substantial backlog, for which the last figure we had was 80,000 smears.  Is there some merit in suspending the screening element of CervicalCheck until that backlog is cleared?<\/p><p>Women are now being asked to attend for smears but they might not get a result for up to 33 weeks, which negates the benefit of getting an early result from screening and undermines confidence in the screening programme.

I very much appreciate the points he made, as a medic and a public representative, in regard to reminding this House that screening is not a diagnostic test and that there will, therefore, always be false positives and false negatives in any screening service in any country.  While the HPV test, when introduced, will lower the numbers of false positives and negatives, some will remain, as I outlined in my opening statement.<\/p>  <p>  I said - I do not wish to go any further - that I am aware of the concern over the judgment among the medical community.  I have heard many of them articulate it publicly in recent days.  My suggestion, which is prudent and sensible, is to consider the implications in a calm and rational manner and then decide what action, if any, is required, either by these Houses or the Government in regard to seeking legal clarity on the impact of the judgment beyond any individual case.<\/p>  <p>  I am not a legal expert by any stretch but I would make the point that the judge states in his judgment that the United Kingdom has some of these tests in place.  The UK has a very robust screening process and, therefore, I call for calm and for us to allow the Attorney General to advise the Government.  On the basis of that advice, I ask that we stand in support of screening and take whatever action is necessary and appropriate, should any be required, in regard to screening or wider implications for the health service.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the introduction of HPV as the primary method of testing - it is already in place in some cases, particularly regarding MedLab and the backlog - it is a good development.  The HSE has been engaging with other countries that have made the switch, including the Netherlands and Australia, and countries that are preparing to do so.  We are learning from their experiences.  We have provided funding to make the switch.  A clinical advisory group has been set up in the HSE and it is currently reviewing quality assurance guidelines.  Colposcopy capacity planning is under way through the national women and infants health programme.  This is required to support the introduction of HPV testing.  This includes reviewing current operational pressures for all colposcopy units, in addition to the impact of the introduction of primary HPV testing and the review of the RCOG.  That is also nearing completion.  The HSE has advised that the majority of planned site visits have now taken place, and the plan is to have the remaining visits in the coming weeks.  We will manage to introduce the system by the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about current capacity within the screening programme and whether I considered a suspension.  I will group the questions in the interest of time.  Had additional capacity not been sourced, the proposition the Deputy highlighted might well have become a reality but the HSE has been undertaking a global search for laboratory capacity.  As he will be aware, it has not been easy to do so.  The HSE has advised that it has sourced additional capacity internationally.  It is working to agree commercial arrangements and to complete the quality assurance process while remaining conscious of Dr. Scally's findings.  The process is at a very sensitive stage.  I expect it to be concluded very shortly.  I expect this will provide us with enough capacity to continue to run the screening programme, to continue to invite women to attend for screening after appropriate regular intervals, and to address the backlog.<\/p>  <p>  I assure women today that the HSE is fully focused on ensuring the necessary screening capacity remains in place and that there will be capacity to process all the slides that have been taken so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900007#E00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1557393000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I seek clarification.

Unfortunately, the Minister and the Government have not been recognising or acting on this.  Despite the grave threat posed by Brexit, the Minister has not used that opportunity and that difficulty to ensure that we are drawing down funds from the EU Commission to support our beef farmers.  The performance of both the Minister and the Government has simply been unacceptable and has been neglectful of the farming community and the massive pressure it is under.  A report from Professor Michael Wallace of UCD in today's edition of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>outlines that if action is not taken, the suckler herd will be reduced by approximately 140,000 cows over the next ten years.  We also will see 14,000 suckler farmers leaving the sector and an impact on the approximately 52,000 jobs in rural Ireland that are underpinned by it.

The beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector and provides beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current RDP period.  Furthermore, there is the beef environmental efficiency pilot, a &euro;20 million pilot project for 2019.<\/p> <p> My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion rural development programme.  In addition to the BDGP, other supports available for suckler farmers under Pillar 2 of the CAP include the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme and knowledge transfer groups.  Suckler farmers also benefit from the basic payment scheme and greening payments under Pillar 1.   According to the national farm survey, suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.  My Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the various agrifood sectors, including the suckler sector, in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP, and through the next agrifood strategy to 2030.  Such measures should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability and the economic and environmental efficiency of their farming system.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900008#G02000","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557394200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>There are a number of matters I wish to raise.  It is my view, and the view of others, in general, that the beef market is the victim of a market system that does not work for beef farmers.  There is a prime product, namely, premium Irish beef, or the champagne of beef, that is sold as an average product, in the same way that bottom shelf wine is sold alongside champagne.  That is the situation of Irish beef and it needs to change, although it will not change overnight, and I do not expect the Minister to flick a switch and change it overnight.  Nevertheless, it is the direction in which we need to go.  We need to sell our beef product around the world as a premium product at a high price and ensure that high price is returned to the primary producer.  In the meantime, to make that happen, there needs to be an aid package in the context of Brexit and the crisis of the beef sector, as the Minister indicated.  A good aid package needs to be put in place to get farmers through this period because the next 12 to 18 months will be vital.  We need to see money on the table from Europe to assist us in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The carcass-grading review has been promised for a long time.  Most farmers who send their cattle to factories say they do not know what kind of price they will receive and they are dubious of how the grading system works, which we all understand.<\/p>  <p>  A cartel controls the movement of offal.

Trying to secure the premium markets, where the price is highest, is a logical step for us to take.  In that sense, we support Bord Bia, as the marketing State agency which works with the industry.  We in the Department also examine what doors to market access we can open for our product.  The more markets that are open to us, the better chance we have of navigating what might be a difficulty in the Asian market or geopolitical issues that might, for example, give us problems providing live exports to Turkey, as happened last year.  Interestingly, a delegation from Turkey is visiting the country and Department this week, which, we hope, will yield progress in that area.<\/p>  <p>  Bord Bia works with the industry and we open doors to allow new market access.  That is a given.  Where the industry decides to sell afterwards is an issue for it.  It may decide to try to navigate a dip in a market if it has a long established foothold, or it might consider new opportunities.  According to figures I have seen, in the first quarter of 2019, we sent nearly 1,000 tonnes of beef to China, compared with 1,400 tonnes in all of 2018.

The point, however, that cannot be made often enough or clearly enough is that Irish beef and meat, in general, is grass fed, from family farms and traceable all the way.  It is a unique product and it needs to be sold as such at a higher price.  I do not cast any aspersions on Bord Bia but it has failed to do that adequately until now and that needs to change.  Before that change occurs, the Minister can immediately examine the issues of an aid package for the beef sector, grading and the movement of offal.  If those three steps can be taken quickly, we can at least see that the Minister is committed to trying to do something to help the beef sector.

There are ongoing discussions with the Commission regarding the difficulties that would face Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit and the assistance that might be required for its agriculture, food and fishery sectors.  Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.<\/p>  <p>  I have held a number of discussions with Commissioner Phil Hogan regarding the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the sector.  I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on agrifood and fisheries, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the Common Agricultural Policy's Single Common Market Organisation, CMO, regulation, as well as increased flexibility under state aid regulations.  However, it is also important to acknowledge that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular following a difficult year in 2018 due to weather conditions.  There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.  In light of the ongoing depressed market prices I have, in discussions with Commissioner Hogan and my European Union counterparts, said that I believe that the deployment of exceptional measures under the CMO regulation to provide targeted aid to farm families who have suffered a sustained reduction in returns from the market is now merited.  I made an intervention to this effect at the April meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, and my officials are pursuing that matter with the Commission.<\/p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths of the Irish agrifood sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025.  It is crucial that we all continue to work together.  I have highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their interdependency and to increase the strength of all links in the supply chain, including the development of beef producer organisations.  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector.

That was only an informal agreement and the result has been that the landing of fish for the year has been front-loaded.  The Minister and I both know the consequences of that.

The Deputy and I have engaged on that issue.  Those difficulties were hard to avoid because, as the Deputy alluded to, more than 60% of mackerel, the most valuable stock in our pelagic sector, is landed from UK waters.  The fear of a crash-out by the end of March drove the industry, understandably, to catch that stock in the first quarter of the year.  That is regrettable but understandable because the industry feared being locked out of UK waters.<\/p>  <p>  Our response on the broader issue is, in the context of the future trading relationship, to ensure that the fishery sector does not get isolated, because the scale of the challenge for the fishing industry is almost existential, given the amount of pelagic, prawns and others that are caught in UK waters and the consequences if boats are displaced into the Irish exclusive economic zone, EEZ.

That is critically important.<\/p>  <p>  We are still engaged with the Commission about the funding that is necessary, and I share the Deputy's view that redirecting funding from the EMFF is not the appropriate response.

Since then, intensive discussions have taken place.  A significant number of working group meetings have been held under both the Austrian and Romanian presidencies.  The proposals have also been discussed extensively at the Special Committee for Agriculture meetings and have been a standing agenda item at every Council meeting of EU agriculture ministers.<\/p><p>The Romanian Presidency has outlined its ambition to achieve a partial general approach on the CAP post-2020 proposals at its final meeting of EU agriculture ministers in June.  To that end, the Presidency is undertaking ongoing discussions in Brussels on all elements of the proposals.  While I am supportive of this ambitious timetable, it is very much dependent on a number of factors progressing in a timely manner.  The European Commission's objective has been to have the proposals adopted by the co-legislators prior to the European Parliament elections in May.  However, the European Parliament has not fully achieved agreement on the proposals and, until the position of the newly elected Parliament is known, it is difficult to have a clear timetable for the CAP reform process.<\/p><p>The draft proposals present a number of new and significant challenges for member states.  The move from a compliance-based system to a performance-based system with a focus on results is perhaps the most significant change for member states to have to contend with in the new proposals.  Member states will be required to prepare a CAP strategic plan, covering Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 expenditure.  This will allow member states greater flexibility to design measures that are best suited to their own strategic needs.  While I welcome this flexibility, preparation of the CAP strategic plan presents a number of challenges and complexities for member states, not least of which is the requirement for member states to submit their draft CAP strategic plans to the Commission for approval before the deadline of 1 January 2020.  My Department is working towards this deadline, albeit amid uncertainty surrounding agreement on the funding for the next CAP as well as the finalisation of the regulations.<\/p><p>While significant progress has been made in the negotiation process to date, decisions on key issues, such as the provisions for direct payments and the new delivery model, have still to be agreed upon at EU level.  The CAP proposals also point to a more significant environmental ambition than the current CAP.  Member states will be required to design a specific climate and environment scheme in Pillar 1.  This is something that I support as it is consistent with my Department&rsquo;s long-term strategy for the agricultural sector, which recognises the critical importance of environmental sustainability.  I believe that farmers play a vital role in the provision of public goods and need to be appropriately recognised and recompensed for this role.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>With this in mind, the retention of a sufficient budget for the CAP post 2020 is an essential requirement for Ireland.  I have been very firm in my views that the proposed 5% cut to the CAP post-2020 budget as outlined in the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, proposals for 2021 to 2027 is completely unacceptable for Ireland.  I have been strongly advocating for the CAP budget to be restored to current levels for the EU 27 post 2020, and I will continue to work towards achieving this objective until agreement on the MFF post-2020 proposals has been reached.  There is also consensus on this point among my EU agriculture ministerial colleagues.  However, EU budget negotiations are led by ministers of finance.<\/p><p>Furthermore, agreement on the overall EU budget must be reached by unanimity and this is a challenging task.  I have also sought to continue this work as part of ongoing bilateral meetings.  Since May 2018, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, and I have met EU agriculture ministers from Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Hungary, <i>inter alia<\/i>, to support a strong CAP budget post 2020.  I have also met ministers from the Netherlands, Estonia, Belgium, Poland, Luxembourg and Austria.  My officials engage regularly with counterparts in other member states on this issue.  Ireland needs to work closely with its EU colleagues to build a consensus around the need to reverse the proposed cuts in the CAP.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to do this and to fight for a strong CAP budget as the negotiations progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900013#M00900","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1557396600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>The Minister mentioned the environmental side and the development of agriculture.

The main thing is to protect agriculture as much as we can and, in tandem, protect the environment.  The two should go hand in hand.  What came out of the report of the Committee on Climate Action was not that there was a conflict between agriculture and climate action but that the two would work together, hand in hand, and that farmers, as custodians of the land, would be enabled to help with climate change and would be rewarded for doing so.<\/p><p>Could we explore that through CAP negotiations and funding?

Much of our endeavour has been about the political manoeuvres required to see that budget restored at least to its current levels.  That is challenging because it is not a decision for the Council of agriculture ministers but for the Council of finance ministers.  Some member states have critiqued the proposals as published, stating that the cuts do not go far enough.  That is a challenge.  I think the Deputy is right in the sense that the environment will be a critically important part of farming in the future and the CAP must support that.  It is abundantly clear that the market is saying that it is not enough any more to have just safe, nutritious or traceable food.  It wants to know what is being done about numerous climate-related issues, including carbon footprint, antimicrobial resistance and animal welfare standards.

Hopefully we will not have a catastrophic situation whereby there will be a hard Brexit, which obviously would be difficult.<\/p><p>It is difficult when we have all our eggs in the one basket.  Traditionally, we have seen that when everything was in the one basket, there was a difficulty because we did not have an alternative.  It is important that we develop these alternatives as quickly as possible.  That will create greater competition in the market.  Competition is the life of trade in any business.  The more markets we have, the better the competition.

The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 specifically prohibits the hunting of animals which have been released in an injured, mutilated or exhausted condition.  Section 25 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 also allows for the establishment of codes of practice and for the adoption of codes published by other persons for the purposes of providing practical guidance relating to any aspect of the Act, including fox hunting.  Voluntary codes of practice have been established by the Hunting Association of Ireland, HAI, which detail the conduct to be adhered to in respect of the hunting of foxes and the treatment of the animal during the hunt.  The code prohibits the hunting of foxes where the animal is injured and advocates the humane disposal of a fox when captured.  The code also takes into account local concerns and the concerns of the landowners on whose land\u00a0hunting takes place.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the concerns raised by residents regarding encroachments into residential areas, officials of my Department met the Hunting Association of Ireland\u00a0to discuss\u00a0several\u00a0such incidents.  My officials underlined the need for those involved in hunting\u00a0to take greater action to avoid such incidents.  The association committed to avoiding any re-occurrence of incidents such as this.  In light of this, it is noteworthy that there do not seem to have been any recent reports of such incidents in the media.  The need to strengthen the existing code of practice to avoid such incidents where hounds entered housing estates was discussed.  The association undertook to review the existing code of practice. <\/p>  <p>  I am fully committed to promoting good practices that respect the welfare of\u00a0animals, and my Department devotes considerable resources to protecting animal welfare and in dealing with breaches of animal welfare legislation.  Under the Act, on summary conviction, a person can receive a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and, on indictment, &euro;250,000 and-or imprisonment up to five years.  There are fixed penalty payments for lesser offences.  The Act provides the framework within which the welfare of animals can be safeguarded, and I am hopeful that the substantial and significantly increased levels of penalties for offences of animal cruelty provided for under the Act will act as a deterrent to animal welfare abuses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900015#O00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1557397800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>The Minister&rsquo;s reply is very much like a previous one he gave me.

The agrifood sector is of critical importance to the economy and its regional spread means it underpins the socio-economic development of rural areas in particular.  Brexit has the potential to have a significant impact on the sector given its unique exposure to the UK market, which accounted for 38% or &euro;5.2 billion worth of agrifood exports last year.<\/p>  <p>  There are ongoing discussions with the European Commission regarding the difficulties Ireland would face in the event of a no-deal Brexit and the assistance that might be required for our agriculture, food and fishery sectors.  Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.  I have held a number of discussions with Commissioner Hogan regarding the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the sector.  I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on agrifood and fisheries, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's CMO regulation - Regulation (EU) No. 1308\/2013- as well increased flexibility under state aid rules.  <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to acknowledge that the past few months have been difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year in 2018 due to weather conditions.  There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.  In light of the ongoing depressed market prices, I have said in discussions with Commissioner Hogan and my EU counterparts that I believe that the deployment of exceptional measures under the CMO regulation to provide targeted aid to farm families who have suffered a sustained reduction in returns from the market is required.  I made an intervention to this effect at the April meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers and my officials have followed up with a detailed submission which is under consideration by Commission officials.  In addition, I have consistently stressed at EU level the need to protect the EU beef sector in trade discussions with Mercosur.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I chaired the 12th meeting of the beef round table last October.

That is because the beef forum has become irrelevant and has not been doing the job it was set up to do.  I understand and accept that the Minister does not have a direct role in setting prices but the price that farmers are getting for their produce is central in the context of Irish agriculture.  The income of farmers is an important matter and should be a matter of concern to the Minister.  Unfortunately the beef forum, which was set up by his predecessor, Deputy Coveney, in 2014 has become little more than a talking shop.  Indeed, the President of the IFA, Mr. Joe Healy, said recently that under the Minister's chairmanship, the forum has become a \"mudguard for inaction\".

The Government announcement on broadband, within two weeks of the local and European elections, does not indicate a rapid roll-out, and the plan does not represent a transparent, value for money proposition for the taxpayer.  It is an attempt by the Taoiseach to portray Fine Gael as the champion of rural dwellers.  If people had any doubts about the motives behind the timing of this announcement, their suspicions will have been confirmed the following morning when each Member of this House was presented with a glossy pack specific to each constituency outlining the relevant positive aspects of the announcement to assist Fine Gael representatives attempting to convince rural voters on the doorsteps over the final days of an election campaign.  It is a rather bizarre move when no contract has been signed and when we are told by Government that it may not be signed for a further six months.  In fact, there are real concerns as to whether it will ever be signed.<\/p><p>I assume that at this stage the T&aacute;naiste has realised this spin just will not wash with those people who have been waiting patiently for the broadband they have been promised on numerous occasions.  The announcement is, in fact, a further betrayal of rural dwellers.  Far from being a breakthrough, this announcement confirms further delay in broadband delivery on top of the many delays already experienced.  The Fine Gael manifesto promised high-speed broadband to 100% of homes, farms, and business premises by 2020 but this week's announcement is a confirmation that this will not happen until 2027.  That is the best case scenario; it is more likely to take much longer.  Could it be 2030 or 2040?<\/p><p>Today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>carries another leak from a Government source that indicates the total cost of the broadband project will be approximately &euro;5 billion.  It is clear that the motivation behind this leak is to imply that Granahan McCourt is investing &euro;2 billion.  However, any analysis of the redacted memo from the Secretary General, Mr. Watt, would conclude that the actual capital to be invested by Granahan McCourt is much less.

This assertion is entirely disingenuous as their comments have concentrated on the value of the physical infrastructure after 25 years.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that the real value at the end of the intervention period is the monopoly access to a customer base which, by the Government's projections, comprises more than 400,000 homes and premises?  These homes and premises will have no alternative but to use this infrastructure, for which they will pay a monthly fee.  Will he also confirm that Granahan McCourt's investment will be paid back after eight years and will continue to earn substantial returns over the remaining 17 years?  Will he further confirm that, in the end, it will own the network and the potential revenue generated by those 400,000 customers while the taxpayer will have no stake and will receive no return on the investment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900017#Q00300","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1557399000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this question and giving me an opportunity to clarify matters relating to some of the concerns he has outlined.

That is why we have released all of the information relating to the debate that took place within Government and within Departments before this decision was made.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has tested this decision very robustly.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has very robustly defended that decision and has made the case for it using independent cost-benefit analysis and so on.  The job of Government, however, is to make decisions and to explain them.  Its job is to make decisions in a transparent manner and in the full knowledge of the cost, which may be up to &euro;3 billion but may well be much less in light of the different scenarios that may unfold.  It should also be taken into account that the &euro;3 billion includes VAT and a very significant contingency of more than &euro;500 million.  This is a significant decision, but it is one which will be transformative for rural Ireland in terms of opportunity.  If we did not make it, we would restrict the availability of what will become essential services through high-speed broadband in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding what is commercially sensitive and what is not, the Government is not in a position at this moment in time to give a figure for what equity the bidder itself is putting in because there is still a negotiation to conclude with regard to finalising the contract.  That figure will be published in time and it will be proportionate to the commercial return available to the bidder in the context of the infrastructure it has an obligation to deliver on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900017#Q00400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1557399000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>If this was not an election stunt, I doubt the Government would have produced this document in advance of the contract being signed.

It is essential that we deliver high-speed broadband in rural Ireland.  People want, need and deserve it.  However, that actually means delivering it and being sure that the capacity exists to do so.  Unfortunately, the national broadband plan as currently constituted could amount to a red herring, costing us up to billions of euro and still leaving homes and businesses without access to adequate broadband.  That is the crux of the problem.  This process began back in 2012 when the then Minister, former Deputy Pat Rabbitte, in the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, promised high-speed broadband would be delivered to every home, farm and business across the State, ending by 2020.  That promise has been broken spectacularly.  Eight years on we do not have a yard of fibre laid under this plan.  Under the new plan, many in rural Ireland will be lucky to have high-speed broadband by the later stage of the next decade.  This simply is not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  The documents published yesterday highlight serious significant flaws in the plan that no one in government has yet addressed.  The documents we have seen from officials and the Secretary General in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform raise questions about the capacity of the bidder to deliver this project.  I share those concerns.  They have called into question the capacity of the Department to oversee the project and I share those concerns.  They recognise that the bidding process has failed to deliver a competitive tender and that the bidder has been able to name its price.  They say the cost-benefit analysis is simply not credible and that it appears there has been cooking of the books in this matter.  The strongest criticism, which worries me and my party the most, is that the bidder does not have adequate skin in the game and could walk away from this project any time after it has recouped its investment.  That is highlighted in numerous documents and it is extremely worrying.  It amounts to abandoning rural Ireland once again.  What we have is a botched process.  There is a big worry that it is not going to be delivered at all.  Rural Ireland needs high-speed broadband: we can all agree on that and no one disputes it.  However, the Government has made a complete and utter mess of this process and it is flawed.  The unfortunate reality and real casualty of all this is the 500,000 houses and businesses that are still without broadband.  Many will be without broadband for years to come.<\/p>  <p>  There is time to put things right.  No contract has been signed.  There are alternative solutions that need to be considered in a serious light, giving the stinging criticism from officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The T&aacute;naiste says they have been robustly tested.  They could not have been.  The criticism only landed on the Minister's desk last week.  He had no chance to test them.  The memo was only sent to the Minister on 3 May.  There are options there, for example a State-wide provider to deal with broadband, as we called for many years ago.  Will the T&aacute;naiste look at the other options?  Will he give us full clarity as to how much skin this private equity firm has in the game?  We might then at least be confident that the Department's comments may not be credible when it tells us time and again there is no incentive for the bidder to complete this project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900018#R00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1557399600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I am glad we agree on one thing, namely that rural Ireland needs broadband.

I am satisfied that those questions have been answered.  This is about laying 147,000 km of fibre.  It is about delivering speeds of 150 Mbps increasing to 500 Mbps from year ten.  It is about ensuring that customers in rural Ireland are charged the same as in urban Ireland, which costs the State significant amounts of money.  That is what we are committing to.  The contract is not just about rolling out fibre and delivering the speeds, however.  It is also about operating it for the next 25 to 35 years.  It also ensures that the risk management linked to this project is by and large carried by the bidder.  If there is down-side risk, in other words, if there is not sufficient uptake of this infrastructure, that risk is carried solely by the bidder.  If there is more uptake than is anticipated, the benefit is shared by the State in terms of claw-back.  Let us not forget that there are conditions in this arrangement, which will become a contract, whereby the State essentially pays in arrears.  The infrastructure is delivered first, we meet certain targets and then we pay out.  The bidder needs to provide the working capital, which is significant, to be able to build out that infrastructure in the meantime until they meet the targets which will trigger staged payments as the infrastructure is rolled out.  As the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has said, they have looked at the risk and management of this up, down and inside out to ensure we have provided as much certainty as possible from the State for one of the most important infrastructure roll-outs that we have seen in a generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900018#R00500","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1557399600,"counter":207,"content":"<p>The final submission from the Department only arrived a couple of days ago.

That is the stark finding from a recent report from the European Court of Auditors.  I want to raise it today because it brings some additional context to the challenges faced by rural Ireland apart from the farcical roll out of the national broadband plan.  I believe we will never see the contract signed.  The issue of generational renewal - getting young people to take up farming - has been described as the single greatest threat to agriculture and the fabric of rural Ireland as we have been privileged to know it.<\/p>  <p>  According to the report from the European Court of Auditors, the first problem is the large reduction in the number of farms.  In 2005, there were 14.7 million farms in the European Union.  The latest available data put the number at approximately 10 million.  Almost 5 million farms have disappeared in the intervening period.  There is no indication that the speed of this trend is slowing down.  This was recently confirmed by the Western Development Commission when it found the number of people working in agriculture in the west of Ireland has decreased by 41% in the past 20 years.  We know that and the Government knows that.  Its candidates are finding out on the doorsteps.  What is equally disturbing is the finding that not only has there been a reduction in the number of young farmers, there is also a serious reduction in the amount of land held by them.  The problem is that 80% of European farmers are over 45.  One third of farmers are older than 65.  The outcome of all this is that the threat to the family farm is growing at an alarming rate.  We are now at a point where the largest farms, which make up just 20% of farms, received 80% of European subsidies for agriculture while the other 80% received only 20% of those subsidies.  This is a disgraceful figure.  According to the European Court of Auditors, this is the political choice we face in deciding the future CAP agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste, therefore, accept that we are facing an unprecedented threat to the fabric of rural life in terms of the inability to make farming financially attractive to young people and young families?  Small farms right across this State and indeed Europe are being gobbled up daily by large conglomerates.  It is happening in my own county, in south Tipperary, with Coolmore's equine industry.  Gobbled up and not in the interest of farming.  There is no commitment to rural Ireland.  They are only interested in bank balances and corporate affairs.  They are corporate investments.  There is no interest in our schools, our future or our clubs.  This was made explicit by members of the European Court of Auditors when they appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  They accepted that there was a long discussion of a proposal of the European Commission to cut the payment for the big farms and to give more to the family farms.  However, the proposal was not accepted because the strength of the big industrial farming lobby.  This is outrageous.  Will the T&aacute;naiste provide assurances as to the measures that we are adopting here to combat this trend of family farms vanishing from the face of the earth?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900019#S00500","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1557400200,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I know a bit about this issue because I was very much involved in the last discussion on the Common Agricultural Policy and how we would structure both Pillar 1 payments, which are direct payments, and Pillar 2 payments in terms of supporting more sustainable agricultural activity and maintaining and protecting the family farm structure, which is core to the make-up of rural Ireland.  If we want to talk about investment in rural Ireland in terms of the volume of money, this round of the CAP will invest &euro;12 billion in Ireland in the form of supports for food producers and farmers in many different ways.  My view is that it represents good value for money for consumers because of the guarantees that it provides in terms of food safety and quality and environmental protections and it protects and sustains the fabric of rural Ireland, of which the Deputy is very much part and as I have been.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the Deputy does not misrepresent what we tried to do in the last round of the CAP and what I certainly will advocate for in this round as well.  The idea that everybody who owns land in Ireland would get the same payment per hectare with no differentiation and taking no account of history or productivity in the past would be a fundamental mistake because one essentially would be paying people for land ownership and not farming.  I suggest that the Deputy talks to the farmers in Tipperary, who lobbied incredibly heavily to ensure that I managed what was called the equalisation of funds in a way that was progressive but gradual and did not see dramatic changes in the income of full-time farmers, which is what would have happened if some people had their way, to ensure that we maintained farming as a productive sector, rather than some kind of social engineering project in rural Ireland.  Farms and farmers can be and are profitable across the country if we can provide the marketplace that allows them to survive, grow and expand.  The CAP needs to be a combination of things from protecting food quality and safety, animal welfare and a broader environment that we all have a responsibility to protect, to keeping productive farming intact and in parts of the country where it is not possible to make money in the marketplace through farming, keeping people on land as stewards of the countryside.  It can do all of those things if we ensure that it is appropriately funded in the next round of CAP, for which this Government will fight.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900019#S00600","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1557400200,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I do not need a lecture about looking after farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900019#S00700","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1557400200,"counter":219,"content":"<p>It seems the Deputy does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900019#S00800","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1557400200,"counter":220,"content":"<p>We need the Government to pay attention to them.

The number of people who are homeless continues to rise and, most shameful of all, there are now almost 4,000 children among this number.  The cost of housing is now the single biggest driver of the high cost of living for people yet the Government continues to drag its heels in responding adequately.  Throughout this crisis Fine Gael continues to pretend that the market can solve the problem.  It has taken the least effective and most expensive approach to increasing housing supply.  Over-reliance on the private sector has gone hand in hand with the stated objective of raising house prices.  That was first made clear by the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, and continued by successive Ministers.  What has mattered most to Fine Gael is the balance sheets of our disgraced banks and bailing out speculators and developers.  This has taken complete precedence over what should be people's right to affordable housing.  How else can the Government explain the failure to build on the substantial public landbanks that we have?  How else can it explain the inordinate delay in finalising an affordable housing scheme?  That scheme has been promised for years and it has yet to take effect.<\/p>  <p>  A number of the larger approved housing bodies have come together to respond to this crisis and are putting it up to the Government to support them.  They have capacity to provide a major social and affordable cost rental building programme commensurate with the scale of need that exists.  To do so, however, they have three asks of Government.  First, tier 3 approved housing bodies need to be reclassified as off-Government balance sheet in order that they can avail of funding, which is available and being offered to them on a constant basis, and which should be utilised.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has promised this but there was no timeline set out for when this will happen.  It seems we are yet into another long period of promises from the Minister without any action.  Failure to act on this will have a negative impact on the potential major output of social and affordable homes from this sector.  Second, new and sustainable, affordable, rental and cost-rental schemes beyond the current small pilot schemes are urgently needed.  Why is Fine Gael delaying the introduction of these schemes?  Action is urgently needed to accelerate the availability of social and affordable homes.

The idea that the Government has an ideological approach of relying on the market to solve the problem is simply not borne out by what we are doing.  We have spent &euro;2.4 billion this year building public housing.  We will add an extra 10,000 housing units this year to the social housing stock.  Next year, the number will be higher than that, probably close to 12,000.  We have committed over a number of years to dramatically increase our social housing stock.  What we must do in the meantime, because of the pressures in regard to social housing, is to try to find accommodation for people in the private rental market where possible.  Last year, approximately 25,000 housing solutions were provided for people in need through social housing, as well as through supported rental accommodation.  Clearly, we want to move away from the current reliance on the private rental market to find homes for people who cannot afford to pay for themselves, but the social housing stock must be built up to do that.  We have also committed to a &euro;300 million affordable housing scheme, which was signed off in the last budget and which will be delivered over the next two years.  We are strategically managing public landbanks in a different way now from what was done in the past.  The rent Bill, which was finalised yesterday evening, provides more protections for tenants, as are needed, and changes to rent pressure zones to make sure that effectively we are putting in place limitations in terms of rental inflation in parts of the country where there are significant pressures.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should not misrepresent what we are trying to do.  There are genuine problems in terms of housing pressures.  We are reminded every week, as we should be, of the challenge in regard to homeless families, homeless individuals and, in particular, homeless children.  An urgency is needed from Government to solve the pressures that many of those families are under but we are not doing it, as the Deputy would suggest, by simply relying on the market to deliver over time in its own time.  Quite the opposite is the case.  We have intervened in the market in multiple ways and we are spending billions of euro over a number of years to deliver a social housing stock that can meet demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900020#T00800","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1557400800,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Eight years into government and the T&aacute;naiste is still talking about what he will do about the housing crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900020#T00900","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1557400800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>No, we are doing it.

I also thank my officials who have worked tirelessly over a long period.  They have done the State a great service, regardless of what one believes about the decision we are taking.  A massive effort has gone into teasing this matter out and putting us in a position to make this decision.<\/p>  <p>  I make no apology for stating that we have made a very important decision.  In every office I have held as a Minister in recent years I have seen the powerful transformation that digital technology is delivering in business, enterprise, education and every walk of life.  The reality for rural Ireland is that 1.1 million people would be left behind if we did not make this commitment to intervention by the State to deliver this technology.  We would be cutting them off.  Worse, rural Ireland would be hollowed out as opportunities go elsewhere.  I cannot countenance that, and that has been the motivation of the Government in making this decision.<\/p><p>Since we decided to sell off Telecom &Eacute;ireann the reality is that we have depended exclusively on the commercial sector to decide the state of our telecommunications network.  That has worked very well for 75% of our population.  That 75% will have access to a largely fibre-based system within the next five years.  The process has worked very efficiently.  However, from the State point of view, it is clear what has happened.  The State has not intervened apart from the &euro;400 million investment in metropolitan area networks, MANs, which was an important decision.  There has been no other investment in telecommunications.  The contrast is there for all to see.  The investment the State has made in telecommunications has been that &euro;400 million, compared to &euro;10 billion in water and &euro;40 billion on roads.  Between 1985 and 1996, some &euro;2 billion was invested by the State in telecommunication infrastructure in just one decade.  The reliance on the private sector has, unfortunately, left almost a quarter of our population behind in terms of access to the sort of broadband service that is now being universally adopted by the European Union as the standard we have to reach.  It is important that we make this decision.   <\/p> <p> There has been considerable questioning as to why we chose a model that involves subsidisation and not ownership.  The reason is that we have been very strongly advised that the best and most cost-effective way of dealing with this is to use the existing infrastructure, including the MANs network, as the base, and the existing Eircom and ESB lines and poles as a platform from which to roll out 146,000 km of fibre.  We are piggybacking on that existing infrastructure, which keeps down the cost.  By leaving it as something that will be owned and managed by the successful bidder, we ensure that continuous investment occurs so that in 25 years or 35 years a system simply consisting of fibre on rented poles that requires substantial reinvestment is not handed back to the State.  This ensures that we will have a stand-alone service, standing on its own two feet and delivering a high-quality service to 1.1 million people in the country. <\/p> <p> There has been much comment on the sceptical scrutiny of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As I have said, that is exactly what that the Department is there to do.  Any healthy system has sceptical scrutiny within government, and, at the end of the day, politicians and governments must make decisions.  I assure the House, and I will be happy to repeat this next week before the committee, that every one of those concerns has been carefully scrutinised.  We looked at all the costs and all of the possible alternatives, which amounted to 12 or 14 alternatives all together.  We looked at how best to manage risk and worked out a way to do it.  We ensured that the cost is spread over a significant period.  We carried out the detailed scrutiny and due diligence necessary when only one bidder was left in the process.  We have ensured that the State is protected by clawbacks, rigorous performance clauses and governance requirements, which will ensure that this company will deliver in the State in a way which protects the taxpayer.<\/p> <p> There has been criticism, too, of the benefit to cost ratio, and that the ratio is relatively low, at 1:3.  The reality is that this is based on a very conservative assessment of what can be included as potential benefits.  It cannot look at the future potential that e-health, e-government services, digital learning, the use of the cloud or an increase in the uptake of remote working.  None of those can be taken into account in this.  Those reasons, not taken into account, have provided much of the impetus for committing to providing high-speed broadband.  I also assure the House that the only cheaper alternative to doing this is to leave some of our people in rural Ireland behind.  That is something that the Government is not willing to countenance.  <\/p> <p> I strongly recommend this proposal to the House as being the best way of delivering equality of opportunity for 1.1 million people in rural Ireland.  I also assure the House that no other capital projects will be postponed, delayed or in any way affected by the decision the Government has taken.  Part of that decision is that this will be funded from future revenues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900025#CC00400","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557404100,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I am proud to talk about the major investment decision we have taken this week.  As chairman of the Atlantic economic corridor task force, I am very proud to be able to go to its next meeting to tell members that in the nine counties, from Donegal to Kerry, we are going to invest a sum of &euro;938 million.  We are going to empower 238,000 premises and homes along the Atlantic economic corridor route.  The Atlantic economic corridor has been set up as a basis for transforming our economy so that there is balanced development across this country.  We have been working over the past number of years on the basis that we need to provide new infrastructure.  One of the main infrastructure items we require is connectivity and telecommunications.  We have been left devoid of this for a long time, starved of opportunity, and now is the time to release people from this.  We will release 1.1 million homes, 56,000 farms, 44,000 businesses and 630 primary schools to ensure they can join the digital age.<\/p>  <p>  I am very proud that we have made this decision.  It has been made because we want to make sure that Ireland can be the leader in the digitalisation of the world.  We are here, and we can do it.  We have the confidence to do it and the population to take on the challenge.  Some &euro;152 million is being invested in Galway, along with &euro;151 million in Mayo.  We are going to empower thousands of people to make ensure that they can join the digital age.  Our students cannot live at home at the moment, having instead to live in Galway, Athlone or Sligo because they cannot do their dissertations and projects due to a lack of access to broadband.  Farmers cannot fulfil their obligations in terms of online payments because they do not have the infrastructure in their homes.  We talk about the smart economy and smart farming, but if one does not have the tools to do it, one is lost.  <\/p>  <p>  I am a rural TD, and I am delighted that we are doing this on the basis that we cannot leave anyone behind.  Everyone will be included.  It has been accepted that fibre to the home is the only technology available that will guarantee a proper service to every house which is compatible with every urban area.  It is important to remember that.  I was canvassing for the local elections, and one of the main issues arising on the doorsteps in my constituency was the lack of broadband in large areas such as Clarinbridge, Headford, Tuam and Ballinakill.  Many of these areas have been spoken about in this House over the past two to three years and the question of what the Government is doing about it has been asked.  The day of reckoning has come.  We are going to deliver it, and I am very proud that we are going to deliver it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900026#DD00200","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1557404100,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I ask the indulgence of the House in sharing my time with Deputy Cowen, our spokesperson on public expenditure.

It is imperative that we do that.  I agree and recognise the impact of the digital divide on those communities.  However, the announcement made in the past number of days is anything but a rapid roll-out.  It is an absolute confirmation that there will be continuing delays.  It is dressed up as a good news story to assist the Government's candidates in the local elections, but the reality is that it is an announcement of delay.  What was expected to be delivered in a three-year period will now be delivered under this particular plan in seven to ten years.  The Minister of State may believe it is good news and may be able to provide the figures to the people of Headford and other places.<\/p><p>When the people there mine into the detail and it becomes apparent to them that they will not have broadband anytime soon, then they will react differently.  A period of seven years to some families will see children go through school and college without access to high-speed broadband at home.  Moreover, it will see an entire life cycle on their farms and in their businesses.  This is not rapid roll-out.<\/p> <p> The Minister has suggested that this is not electioneering, but it is electioneering of the worst kind.  The Government produced a pack for each of us the day after the decision setting out the details for our constituencies, but this has been done before the contract is signed.  My understanding is that the decision taken by the Government should have been taken when a contract was agreed.  Will the Minister tell us whether the Government will again have to decide on the conclusion of negotiations around the contract?  Will the process need another Government decision?  Has the Government ceded some of its negotiating capacity by taking the decision the other day?  Has the Government created a further legitimate expectation on the part of Granahan McCourt that will make it more difficult for the Minister to negotiate on behalf of the State as he reaches a conclusion to contract negotiations?<\/p> <p> The reality is that in recent days the Minister and the Taoiseach as well as several other Ministers have sought to downplay the value of the asset.  The Minister has done it again today.  He has downplayed the value of the asset after 25 years, suggesting that it is only fibre strung across poles that the Government is renting from others.  He has also suggested that the Government would not have invested in it otherwise.  The contractor seems to see the value in it.  The assertion put forward by the Minister is entirely disingenuous.  The comments have centred around the value of the key infrastructure.  Will the Minister confirm that the real value at the end of the intervention period is the monopoly access to a customer base that will be, by the Minister's projections, 400,000 or 80% of the 540,000 figure by the end of the contract period?  These people will have no alternative but to use the infrastructure for which they will pay a monthly fee.  It is the access to that customer base that will be the real value.<\/p> <p> There is nothing to suggest that if the State owned the network, just as the ESB owns its network, it would not upgrade the infrastructure under the normal amortisation process that goes on in all companies.  Of course that is the case, and of course those responsible would do that.  There would be plenty of money to upgrade the infrastructure.<\/p> <p> Let us go through in detail the document or memorandum provided by the Secretary General, Mr. Watt.  He asserts that Granahan McCourt will have all its money back after year eight of the 25-year period.  The company will go on to gain additional resources and revenues for the following 17 or 18 years and it will own the network at the end.  Of course the company will be writing down some of its profits against upgrading the network, as the State would have done had it operated under a commercial semi-State mandate.<\/p> <p> From every particular aspect and every way we look at this project it is not fit for purpose and does not meet the objective we all signed up to and want to see realised, which is rapid roll-out of high-speed broadband.  With the greatest of respect, there is nothing rapid in a period of seven to ten years.  It is bad value for money for the State.  There will be no ownership at the end of the period.  All in all, it is a rather bad deal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900026#DD00500","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557404700,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the issue.  There is no doubt about whether rural broadband is needed.  I represent a rural constituency and I see the urgency of it.  We have been banging this drum for several years since 2012 and especially since I took over this brief three years ago.  We are all in agreement in that sense.  The issue is whether the taxpayer is getting value for money, whether the State will have ownership of the infrastructure, and whether it would have been given full transparency.<\/p>  <p>  Some light was shone on these matters yesterday.  The document released yesterday by the Department outlined how flawed the procurement process has been from the beginning and why the Government must have a plan B, something I have called for many times.  The Government has been told repeatedly by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that this project, under the current model, is doomed.  The Government has completely dismissed the evidence-based advice from high-ranking senior civil servants in that Department.  The Fine Gael Government is acting in a completely reckless way and is leaving the taxpayer open to unprecedented financial risk while major question marks remain over the credibility of the private operator to deliver the project.  This is nothing short of being fiscally irresponsible.<\/p>  <p>  This comes only a short time after the revelations around the national children's hospital and the waste of &euro;500 million on water meters that are not now being used.  Some of those meters are being pulled up out of the ground.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has warned the Government about its major concerns in respect of the credibility of the cost-benefit analysis of the national broadband plan, under which the taxpayer is putting in almost &euro;2 billion or &euro;1.95 billion up to 2026.  In fact, Mr. Robert Watt, the most senior person and the Secretary General of that Department, went so far as to say that the vast majority of the risk of this project would be retained by the State, that is, the taxpayer, while the private operator is insulated from risk since the company is putting up a fraction of the equity and will recoup its full investment by 2028.  In reality, the taxpayer is putting up the bulk of the money but it will not own one metre of cable or one pole at the end of the project, by which time we will have a valuable network in place.  The private operator will get the full benefits of the profit and will pick up a nice network.  It will have landed into the company's hands.<\/p>  <p>  Is it any wonder the Department has called so clearly for this to be stopped?  Mr. Brendan Ellison, a principal officer in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has strongly recommended that this plan does not go ahead on the grounds that it does not reflect value for money.  In fact, both Mr. Ellison and Mr. Watt have called for the cancellation of the procurement process.<\/p>  <p>  As far back as 2012, Sinn F&eacute;in argued that we should proceed with a model of ownership based on the ESB network.  There can be no doubt about what the Department has said.  I have before me a document from 2018 in which the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment sets out clearly that the most likely way of achieving the results needed in terms of the Government objective of providing high-speed broadband would be to mandate an existing or new semi-State or State agency to build high-speed broadband.  The 2019 contingency plan states that the creation of a dedicated broadband agency in State control would most likely result in advancing Government ambitions of providing high-speed broadband.  This year, Mr. Robert Watt went further.  He said that the alternative course of action should be pursued and that the procurement process should be cancelled.  That is what he said.<\/p>  <p>  We have the infrastructure to do it a different way.  I have been constantly highlighting the point in the Chamber and outside during the past three years.  The State-owned metropolitan area networks, MANs, infrastructure covers 94 regional towns and the backhaul system criss-crosses the State.  The Government has completely ignored the possibility of using this.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting to note that the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have proposed that in the event of the procurement process collapsing, we should not retender to the private market but move instead to an alternative State ownership model.  In 2019, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment contingency planning report concluded that the best model to proceed with to deliver high-speed broadband to every home in Ireland would be the State model.  Under that process a mandate would be given to an existing or new semi-State or State agency to build the network and provide the service.  The Department also estimated that the capital and operating costs would be similar to that of the current contract.  Furthermore, both reports argue that a new broadband State agency to deliver the service would comply with state aid rules.  That is something the Minister has turned his face against.  He has told us that it would not, but our research has told us differently.  The Department is agreeing with what I have been saying about this.  Mr. Brendan Ellison in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has gone further and called for the immediate cancellation of the current process in order for an alternative State-owned model to proceed within the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The Minister needs to explain comprehensively to the House why the Government has chosen not to consider this model of ownership as an alternative, given that both the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment have pushed this as a viable and affordable alternative.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in is of the view that it is essential for the State to retain control of this large project and vital infrastructure.  This is no tiddlywinks project.  It is a major project.  The Minister outlined the problems with the privatisation of Telecom &Eacute;ireann in 1999 by Fianna F&aacute;il and the difficulties that caused for us, and we can all see that.  Here we go again with another major telecommunications infrastructure project.<\/p><p>Mr. Ellison suggested that there is a high risk that the private operator may not even have the capacity to deliver the project.  Rural Ireland needs to know whether this plan is even feasible.  These memorandums from the Department suggest that the plan is already doomed.  In the contract, the State has the opportunity in year 4 and year 6 to either halt or take back control of the project in the event of the private operator not being able to deliver.  I have heard the Minister trumpet this but by that stage, the taxpayer, after four years, has put in &euro;1.2 billion.  After six years, the taxpayer has put in &euro;1.95 billion.  That is what it states in the documents.  The taxpayer is taking all the risk.  How much will Granahan McCourt have put in by then?  Is it damn all?  That is what I believe it will have put in by year 6.  One has to ask why the taxpayer is front-loading the project and taking all the risk.<\/p> <p> How much is the private operator putting in?  By 2026, the taxpayer will have contributed &euro;2.2 billion to this project.  We were made aware yesterday that the private company will have all its money back by 2028.  The taxpayer is essentially bankrolling the project to the tune of &euro;3 billion and in eight years' time, when it has made its money back, this company can just flip the project, sell it on for a profit and abandon rural Ireland.  We have been asked to put much in and the documents yesterday clearly indicated that the private operator has been asked to contribute far less than the taxpayer.<\/p> <p> Will rural Ireland be left stranded with no control, and with this House having no control, despite having put in &euro;3 billion and being left at the mercy of one private monopoly?  The whole network could be stripped of assets as we have seen in the past, or parts of it could be obsolete.  What about the standard connection fee?  Much has been of this &euro;100.  I learned in the briefing with departmental officials yesterday that some households in rural areas will have to pay several thousand, or even tens of thousands for hard-to-reach households, as a connection fee.  That issue has been glossed over and needs to be addressed.  The Minister is asking the taxpayer and householders to support this project when we still do not know what the private operator is contributing.  Every key figure relating to this deal was redacted in the documents that we received yesterday.<\/p> <p> The Government is hiding behind commercial sensitivity when there is only one bidder left for a once-off deal.  It does not make sense.  The fact is that the Minister has agreed to go ahead with it.  The figure was agreed with Granahan McCourt months ago.  The Minister should now clear up whether the State or the private operator will invest the bulk of the money.  It jumps out off the pages of yesterday's documents that the taxpayer will invest more.  Could it be the case that the private investor is putting in damn all in the crucial first six years?  There are another six or seven months, according to yesterday's information, until the contract will be signed.  We said back in 2012 and again last October or November, when the pause button was pressed on this, that there was an opportunity to stop and look at this project.  There is no doubt that we all want it.  I have not heard anybody say that we should not go ahead with it.  There is an opportunity during these extra seven months to test this matter.  It should be tested before the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We need another plan.  Is this project fatally flawed?  Are there alternatives such as suggested by officials in the Minister's Department?  We now know from the contingency documents produced by the Departments that there are viable options.  These options include State ownership.  We need to tease these out and come up with the best one for rural Ireland to deliver broadband where it is badly needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900027#EE00200","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557405300,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I am sharing two minutes with Deputy Breathnach.  The question of rural broadband is not about whether or not we should deliver it.  Everyone agrees that we should have comprehensive broadband for everyone in this country.  Everyone wants the benefits for regional employment, e-health services and new opportunities to access education.  Labour wants equality of access to high-speed broadband across the country.  Access to the Internet is now essential for social inclusion as well as for economic opportunities.  Our European manifesto seeks the formal recognition of digital rights.  In our view, everyone should have a legal right to access to the Internet.  As part of digital rights, everyone should also have legal protection of their personal privacy online and protection from online bullying and harassment.<\/p>  <p>  Labour has a very different vision of how access to the Internet should be achieved, in a way that is better and safer for the Irish people.  This week's announcements can only be understood as being political.  They were clearly designed to influence the local and European elections in two weeks' time.  The Government is proposing to spend &euro;3 billion of the people's money on a private monopoly which will own the network forever.  The proposed contract will last for 25 years.  What happens then?  The private monopoly will then be in a strategic position to charge significantly more.  We also understand that the current private venture capital company involved in the Government's plan will be able to sell its shares in nine years' time, which means that the Government has no idea who will ultimately own this network.  The proposed contract will only allow the Minister to block the sale of shares in the first nine years.<\/p>  <p>  We know the sole bidder in the national broadband plan is a venture capital firm, not a telecommunications company.  It seems obvious that it sought, and was given, the option of selling Ireland&rsquo;s rural broadband network at some point in the future.  Our biggest concern comes down to the question of ownership of the national broadband network.  In the current plan, it is possible that vulture funds could buy up the body to be called National Broadband Ireland to squeeze more money out of the quarter of our people who will be reliant on it.  It would be an entirely different matter if the public was to own the network rather than a private monopoly, even if the final cost needs to be &euro;3 billion.  There is no reason why we cannot set up a national broadband company as a commercial semi-State company.  That is how we delivered electrification and the national gas network.  Fianna F&aacute;il should never have privatised the national telecommunications network because the current situation shows that the public keeps on paying more for that grievous mistake.  In this case, Eir has positioned itself as the gatekeeper for broadband outside of the towns.  Fine Gael's National Broadband Ireland will have to pay Eir for the use of its ducts and poles.  If we had kept telecommunications in public ownership, we would not face hundreds of millions of additional costs as part of rolling out rural broadband.<\/p>  <p>  We need to be clearer with people about the scale of this project's costs.  Some &euro;3 billion is an extremely large sum of money.  It was only a few years ago that we were desperately trying to find a few million here or there to protect vital health services and other public services from the 2008 economic collapse.  If we divide the &euro;3 billion over every household in Ireland, it represents a cost of more than &euro;1,750 for each family or individual householder.  We will recoup some of that cost through VAT and other taxation, but we could have reduced the cost and recouped more if we cut out the profit-making part of the project.  A significant portion of the cost of this project is to give the venture capitalists a large profit on their investment.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has described the level of profit to the investors as \"very high\" for the level of risk they are taking with this investment.<\/p>  <p>  What exactly are these venture capitalists bringing to the project that could not be provided by a publicly-owned broadband company?  It is hardly expertise, as they have only 20 or 30 employees engaged on this project at present.  They are yet to employ the bulk of the projected 265 staff for National Broadband Ireland.  We do not need them for access to money.  We rescued the public finances in order that Ireland can borrow once again on the international market and interest rates are at an all-time low.  Is there something the Government has not told us about this project being on or off the State's balance sheet?  If the private investor is paying significantly less than 50% of the cost, as seems to be the case from the figures we have received, and the State is paying more than 50%, I understand that the project will be on the State books regardless of who owns the network at the end.<\/p>  <p>  Why on Earth will the people not own the network after the 25 year contract?  Almost all previous public-private contracts involved the public ownership of the asset at the end of the period.  That is the norm.  Why is this project different?  According to the papers released yesterday, this was a Fine Gael Government decision taken in July 2016.  That date is significant.  Labour left Government on 6 May 2016.  At that point, the Government had made no decision on the future ownership of the broadband network.<\/p><p>A few weeks later, the new Fine Gael Government made the most unusual decision that, rather than the network reverting to the State after 25 years, it should be owned entirely by the minority investor.  Every PPP we contracted ended with the project, be it a road, a school, or a health centre, being owned by the public.  Why was this policy not applied to the broadband network?  That is the nub of the issue.<\/p> <p> Not only has the estimated cost of the project gone up even as the number of homes to be served has gone down but it is incredible for the public to pay so much money and still not own the network.  It is not just the Labour Party saying this represents poor value for money.  Senior officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have said so.  We established that Department to safeguard the public's money and we thought that we had moved into an area of greater political responsibility with the public's money.  Instead, what we have seen in recent weeks is not one but three major cost overruns in capital spending under Fine Gael.  The national children's hospital will be the most expensive in the world.  The Dublin metro may now cost &euro;4-5 billion, according to the Taoiseach and &euro;3 billion is to be given to a profit-making private monopoly for a broadband network that the public will never own.<\/p> <p> The Labour Party wants to see high-speed rural broadband delivered as soon as possible, and we are committed to covering the necessary cost as long as the network remains in public ownership.  We must have public ownership so that we control costs more effectively in future years.  In 25 years, access to broadband will be even more essential than it is now.  People will be routinely accessing healthcare advice and consultations from their homes, and conducting business from their homes and farms using broadband and a private monopoly will own the network.  Potentially, vulture funds will own the network.  Fine Gael has failed to explain what added value a venture capitalist brings to this whole consortium at a time where the State can easily borrow the money.<\/p> <p> When we delivered rural electrification, it was through a public enterprise that has served this country well and faithfully for generations, as a quality employer and as a profitable company that paid &euro;1.5 billion in dividends to the State following the 2008 crash.  Modelled on rural electrification, we should have an ESB-style national broadband company to retain control over prices into perpetuity and to eliminate the possibility of ruthless investors taking over rural broadband.  Twenty-five years might seem like a long time, but learning the lessons from 2008, which is now 11 years ago, it should be clear that there are too many risks involved in letting a private monopoly run our broadband network.  The public was rightly determined, as was the Labour Party, that Irish Water should never be privatised.  Why does Fine Gael think that the public would accept that a utility as important as broadband would be privatised from the outset?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900028#FF00200","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557405900,"counter":321,"content":"<p>The delivery of modern instant communication, be it mobile phone coverage or high-speed broadband, is a necessity in this day and age, not a luxury as some people seem to think, particularly for people in the countryside.

The inability of the State to deliver vital infrastructure goes back further, but the common thread in our failure in this regard is privatisation, going right back to Fianna F&aacute;il's disastrous decision to privatise Bord Telecom, the asset stripping of that company by mostly Irish vulture capitalists, which denuded us and the State of its capacity to deliver vital communications infrastructure.  If the left-wing concern and criticism of this process was not taken seriously, and it rarely is, it seems today that those concerns have been absolutely vindicated by the letter from Robert Watt outlining his concerns about this project where effectively a single consortium in what is supposed to be a competitive process has the State over a barrel.  When the most senior civil servant in the area of public expenditure says we should not go ahead with this, that we cannot trust that the tenderer has the interest in carrying it through, and that there is a massive risk that it will not be delivered, it is quite astonishing that the Government perseveres.  The only explanation for this announcement is that it is a pre-election stunt to make people in rural Ireland, who are rightly desperate to have infrastructure and services, believe that this Government is championing their interests.  It is deeply ironic that the Government would present itself as the champion of rural Ireland given the way it has denuded rural Ireland of post offices and public transport services.  It cannot be trusted to deliver broadband.<\/p>  <p>  There are many other concerns about this, not just those that Robert Watt outlines.  Is there, for example, the potential for legal action to be taken by other bidders in the market against the way this is proceeding?  What about the cases that are pending against Actavo and Denis O'Brien and so on in respect of Siteserv?  There are many serious questions about the capacity of this consortium, one which, by the way, bears absolutely no relationship, apart from the presence of Granahan McCourt, to the original consortium that put forward the bid.  This process is fatally flawed.  We should stop it now.  We have said this several times already.  What we need is for rural broadband to be delivered directly via a State company, either through the ESB or through a State telecommunications company.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has said, if we had relied on this model to deliver rural electrification, we would still be operating by candlelight.  We should not take that risk with something as important as this.<\/p><p>We must break from the privatisation, outsourcing, for-profit model.  The State must deliver this vital infrastructure directly and own it at the end of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900029#GG00300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557406500,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I want to clarify what this debate is about and what it is not about.  It is not about making an argument against providing rural areas with broadband.  Broadband is essential and it is scandalous that people have had to wait so long for what is now vital communications technology.  The question we are debating is why the Government is striking such a rotten deal for the taxpayer and such a good deal for private companies.  Yesterday we asked why it is not possible for the State to invest in and provide this service.  The Minister acted as if these companies were doing the Irish population a really big favour and intimated that the State is not capable of doing this.<\/p><p>These companies will have the potential to price gouge in the future.  The media coverage of this issue makes it clear that the bidder will have recouped by 2028 all of the cash it invested.  The money that it invested will have to be recouped when it is operating the network.  How will it do that?  It will sell off the network to others who will price gouge people in rural areas in the future.<\/p><p>If one looks back at Eircom and Telecom &Eacute;ireann, one sees a common thread.  The Minister acted yesterday as if we got a great deal out of the privatisation of Telecom &Eacute;ireann.  I am very proud to say that in 1999, the only Deputy in this D&aacute;il who stood up and spoke against that deal was Mr. Joe Higgins of the Socialist Party.  I looked back at the transcript of a debate, during which former Deputy Higgins said:<\/p><blockquote>It is a sad reflection that I am the only Deputy who stands in this D&aacute;il in opposition to what will turn out to be a robbery of a vital State asset.  The Minister and the Government are masterminding this robbery.<\/blockquote><p>Now we are seeing a repetition of that.  Another common thread is the involvement of companies connected with Mr. Denis O'Brien, including Actavo, as major investors.  We warned in 1999 that privatisation would lead to a terrible underinvestment in infrastructure, and here we are now.  We cannot provide a broadband service to people in rural areas for another seven years, potentially, because of underinvestment in this infrastructure over the years.<\/p><p>The ICTU report entitled Learning from the Eircom Debacle is so instructive.  It outlines exactly what happened after Telecom &Eacute;ireann was asset stripped in a deal done by Fianna F&aacute;il, which cannot be relied upon today to provide this service either.  In May 2001, the asset stripping commenced.  In September 2001 the Government announced that it would fund 90% of any investment by the private sector in telecoms infrastructure.  In November 2001, Eircom was bought by Valentia and was floated on the Stock Exchange.  More debt was loaded onto its balance sheet and the mast network was sold off.  In 2010, Eircom was sold to a state-owned company, Singapore Technologies.  As the ICTU report points out, Eircom returned to state ownership, but unfortunately it was the state of Singapore.  That is the reality of what happened.  That company could have been owned by the State and could have been very profitable.  It could have generated significant revenue and provided services at a very reasonable cost to ordinary consumers.  Instead, vultures, millionaires and billionaires were allowed to benefit.  The role of the Labour Party in this has not been exemplary, despite what Deputy Jan O'Sullivan said earlier.  Mr. Dick Spring was appointed to the privatised Eircom board.  Deputy Eamon Ryan said it was wonderful as well and some trade union leaders connected with the Labour Party were also big backers of privatisation, which is shameful.<\/p><p>What people in rural Ireland want is a broadband service, but this Government's ideological affinity with full-blown neoliberal capitalism underpins its belief that nothing can be provided directly by the State.  Obviously housing cannot be provided thus and has been handed over, in the main, to private developers and landlords.  Housing assistance payment is being paid to landlords and the State will not build public housing.  Hence we have the suffering and misery that is taking place today.  The same thing is being done with broadband.  A tiny number of people are being enriched at the expense of the State.  This deal has to stop but I have no faith that Fianna F&aacute;il will stop it.  That party needs to outline its position clearly.  Is this an issue over which it will pull out of government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900030#HH00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1557406500,"counter":325,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; ag roinnt mo chuid ama le mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Teachta Broughan.<\/p>  <p>  I have only six minutes so I will get straight to the point.  I ask for sense to prevail here.  I do not think the Minister will listen to me but it is important, for the sake of the people who elected me and for the public record, that I ask for sense to prevail.  The Minister and his Government are being disingenuous on every level in trying to frame this in the context of saving rural communities.  I represent the Galway West constituency which includes three Aran islands, Inishbofin, all of Connemara, rural areas of south Mayo, along with Galway city.  I am more than familiar with rural constituencies.  I have been knocking on doors and can assure the Minister that broadband is not the issue that is coming up, although I acknowledge that I have received many representations relating to difficulties with broadband.  What is coming up is that rural areas have been left behind by successive governments.  That is why I was elected along with several other like-minded Deputies.  We said that we would stand up in the D&aacute;il on behalf of rural communities and argue for regional balance.  Let us stop the cur i gc&eacute;ill and the pretence.  I am here speaking with a strong, loud voice on behalf of my rural constituency.  Yesterday I raised the issue of the absence of physiotherapy services in Connemara and the lack of social workers on the ground.  Only two or three weeks ago there was a protest in Connemara about the lack of roads.  Rural areas have been left behind.  Kilmaine, Shrule and south Mayo, along with the islands are struggling.  Over the past three years we have tried to hold the Government to account and to roll out a policy for rural areas to provide regional balance.<\/p>  <p>  Various telecommunications providers have appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have read a considerable amount of documentation on this issue, apart from the documentation that was published yesterday.  Some of the documentation from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform dates from 1 April, which is April Fool's Day.  That would be funny were it not so serious.  On 1 April, the Department strongly recommended against this plan on grounds of \"cost, affordability, value for money and risk\".  That is repeated throughout all of the other documents.  In May, the Department went into detail on the questions of cost and affordability, the impact on the national development plan and on projects forgone as a result.  In the context of value for money it refers to \"uncertain benefits\" and points to \"unprecedented risk\" for the Exchequer.  It calls into question compatibility with the spatial objectives of Project Ireland 2040.  On the cost-benefit analysis, which comes up repeatedly at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Department argues that it is simply \"not credible\".  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is telling us that the cost-benefit analysis is not credible.  This is against the background of a report by Mr. Peter Smyth which told us that the meetings between the former Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, and Mr. McCourt gave \"cause for concern\".<\/p>  <p>  I ask again for sense to prevail.  There are alternatives.  We need broadband in rural areas in a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost.  There are other ways of doing this.  The Department itself has pointed out other ways.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is in the process of rolling out gteic centres on the ground and is crying out for money.  In stark contrast to Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has had its budget significantly reduced.  I ask the Government to stop the spin.  I thought that we had got rid of the spin unit, but clearly the Government has internalised the spin and actually believes it, which is even more frightening than the &euro;3 billion cost of rolling out broadband to areas where the take-up will be very low.  We know this from our discussions on the report on the metropolitan area networks, MANs, at the Committee of Public Accounts.  The record of the Government in this regard is disgraceful.  A review of MANs was commissioned and a report produced.  Has the Minister or the Minister of State read that report?  Have they read the Analysys Mason report?  Is the Minister aware that the Department did not publish the report until just before the Committee of Public Accounts meeting?  There was a significant drop in prices on the very day that the aforementioned committee extracted this report.  That is the Government's history in relation to these projects.  The Minister spoke about trust and the rural-urban divide, but this Government has stood over and increased the rural-urban divide and intensified it.  The Government produced a national development plan which has sustainability written through it, but it is doing the complete opposite.<\/p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to go back and to look at &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and at the alternatives for delivering this broadband.

As we heard earlier, it is clear that if the Fianna F&aacute;il Government under Bertie Ahern and Mary Harney had not privatised Eircom 20 years ago in 1999, a State-wide roll-out of Internet infrastructure would probably have been complete by now and reasonable speeds, at least, would be available.  We have to remember that the national electricity grid was only completed around 1964, although the ESB was founded in 1929.  Fianna F&aacute;il with the strong support of the then Ministers, Mary Harney and Michael McDowell, and of Fine Gael got us into the current mess.  Some 13 years after the Eircom debacle, the then Minister, Pat Rabbitte, launched a national broadband plan but, by 2017, Eir was able to leave 542,000 Irish homes and businesses without up-to-date telecommunications and broadband.  From listening to earlier discussion, an equally conceivable plan might be to simply renationalise Eir and to take back the national infrastructure which this House should not have allocated to a private company 20 years ago.<\/p><p>We have also seen the further debacle of the resignation of Deputy Denis Naughten as Minister, which we discussed in this House last year.  I strongly believe that on the basis of the circumstances surrounding the forced resignation of the Minister alone, we should not proceed with the Granahan McCourt consortium.  In fact, it is outrageous that the Minister proposes that we should.  <\/p><p>We learned today that the expected cost should we proceed is now &euro;5 billion, with the implication that the State itself is committing at least 60% of this cost, although we do not know that as the Minister has not told us.  We will be paying &euro;400 million per annum all the way through the 2020s.  This cost will rise year after year.  The incredible result is that in 2028, or perhaps 2043, the Irish people whom we represent will not own a single pole or fibre optic line of that network.  <\/p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's observations on the NBP, which we have all read, are truly shocking and unprecedented.  The Minister referred to second level education yesterday but it is not a comparable situation.  We were going to move on to second level at some stage.  We should have moved on to it in the late 1940s, as England and Northern Ireland did, but we did not because of the influence of Fine Gael on government at that particular time.  <\/p><p>Many of us have been very critical of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, its management meetings, and so on with regard to the national children's hospital, but the Secretary General, Mr. Watt, and his officials, whose job it is to critically evaluate all budgetary expenditure proposals, are now discharging their responsibilities and clearly recommending against proceeding with this plan, which they say totally lacks credibility.  We were very critical of officials in the national children&rsquo;s hospital debates and how they missed the flashing warning signs.  The Minister would not tell us about these signs because the Government was going to hold a general election last October and did not want to give us bad news about the children's hospital.  The Department has stated: &quot;We strongly recommend against approval of the appointment of the preferred bidder to the current NBP procurement process&quot;.  It goes on to list all the grounds for this recommendation, including cost and affordability and the cost-benefit analysis.  <\/p><p>Given his academic history, the Minister will know a good bit about cost-benefit analyses, as do many of us on this side.  It is quite clear that the cost-benefit analysis does not add up.  Why is he proceeding when this is the case?  The officials outlined their &quot;major concerns&quot; about the cost-benefit analysis.  They said it &quot;is not credible and it is questionable whether it is consistent with the Public Spending Code&quot;.  Is this decision legal?  Is the Government acting legally in attempting to proceed with this half-baked proposal?<\/p><p>Deputy Sean Fleming, whose past work I respect, outlined in an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>this morning - an article which I support - the reasons he, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, believes we should not proceed.  He gives additional alternatives to the very good alternative which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has proposed.<\/p><p>There is now a heavy responsibility on Deputy Brophy and all the other members of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, including myself and Deputy Boyd Barrett, to ensure value for money in the final roll-out of broadband.  Deputy Brophy must urgently call a meeting of the committee.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know, we are supposed to be responsible for future spending.  The Parliamentary Budget Office should also immediately proceed to examine the details of this proposed contract.  <\/p><p>I am one of those who believes there should be a separate Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  One of the few proposals on which I agreed with the previous Government was having a Minister for Finance and a Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, however, cannot stand over this and nor should he.  He and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment must come before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and explain the situation to us.  This process should immediately be halted and then done again differently in one of the ways which has been suggested from this side of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900031#JJ00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1557407100,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I will share time with Deputy Eamon Ryan.<\/p>  <p>  We have been told on several occasions that Fine Gael is the only party which can be trusted with the economy and fiscal prudence has been preached constantly.  This makes it all the more astonishing that the Government is ignoring the quite robust advice of the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  I have listened very carefully to Fianna F&aacute;il on this issue and I have not found anything to disagree with in what its Deputies have said, but this has to be a make or break moment.  It is one thing for Fianna F&aacute;il to talk about this issue, but what it does about it is quite another.  That will be watched very closely.  I do not play those political kinds of games.  I rarely say that kind of thing about Fianna F&aacute;il, but this is a significant issue.<\/p>  <p>  The timing of this announcement is quite cynical.  We knew there was only one bidder, which is one part of this very flawed process, and so it was not going to be a surprise who the preferred bidder was.  That preferred bidder has now been announced but the reality is that a contract will have to be gone through in some considerable detail.  There are significant issues in that respect.  We will spend up to &euro;3 billion and own nothing at the end of it and we will leave people in rural Ireland to fend for themselves in dealing with this particular entity.  <\/p>  <p>  We have seen an example of this when the same company, Granahan McCourt, was involved in a contract for MANs.  Under this contract we were delivered the most expensive broadband in Europe.  The Analysys Mason report was helpful from that point of view and there have been some changes recently, although we are not sure if they completely translate.  We have seen what this forerunner did.  The lack of transparency with respect to wholesale to retail sales is a serious issue because not only could this cost a State a fortune, but we will own nothing at the end of it and people in rural Ireland could have expensive broadband if the same circumstances that arose in respect of the MANs contracts occur again.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the issue of National Broadband Ireland.  We were told at the briefing yesterday that there would be one nominee to the board, but we do not know to whom that person will be responsible.  That has not been worked out yet.  In the past some such nominees have been responsible to the company rather than to the State, even in cases where they have been public interest directors.  We should also consider the contractors who are going to build this.<\/p><p>We need to know more about KN Network Services and Kelly Comms Limited.  We know something about Actavo Ireland Limited because it is the company formerly known as Siteserv.  We need to know more about 4site and other subcontractors.  We do not really know.  We are told there are 1,500 contractors engaged by the subcontractors, but they would be the primary contractors.<\/p> <p> People in rural Ireland, including in the parts of my constituency that are included in the intervention area, require broadband.  I do not think I heard anybody in this Chamber say otherwise.  The big objection is to spending &euro;3 billion by giving it to a private company and owning nothing in the end.  That could be very precarious in terms of the cost, take-up and delivery of broadband.  The process was flawed throughout.  The Smith report was a facade.  We were astonished when we saw the results of that report, which looked into the issues prior to the resignation of the previous Minister.  Nobody disputes that high-quality broadband is required but the way in which this is happening is just plain wrong.

We are faced with difficult choices.  Everyone recognises the imperative of providing rural broadband.  We need our young people to return to live in rural areas.  They need to be able to work remotely.  We need to create opportunity for new businesses.  We need to make sure that all the benefits of this digital revolution are delivered everywhere in the State.  Delaying, abandoning or not proceeding present massive difficulties in that regard.  However, the process has been highly unsatisfactory to say the least.  The fact that it has taken seven years to get to the end of the design phase is a failing.  I have heard commentators say the European Union forced us to hive off the 300,000 more attractive customers from the original mapped area.  I do not believe that.  I believe it was a political decision at Government level to tell Eir to go ahead with that.  My recollection of the debate is that it was clear that the Minister had effectively signed off on it.  In doing so, he fundamentally undermined the process.<\/p>  <p>  In effect, this process is creating a monopoly and turning it into a private monopoly.  That is not just in terms of the national broadband Ireland company.  It is also giving Eir an ongoing monopoly on the delivery of the service in the last mile provision and the backhaul, which is how the data is taken from these broadband connections and connected back to the Internet.  I have concerns with all of that.  The fact that this is being done two weeks before an election rightly raises questions about whether political timing rather than anything else is triggering this debate at this time.  As I understand from the briefing we had yesterday, at least we have several months before any contract is signed.  It is critical in those few months that we try to address concerns and reduce the downside risks to the State, which are very large.<\/p>  <p>  On the last mile issue, from listening to the officials yesterday I understand they are still open and would still wish to see that the options are considered regarding how we get to the final house, which I believe would be very healthy.  I have been saying for a year or two that I would like to see the use of ESB electricity poles and wrapping fibre around electricity wires as an effective option within this project.  It would not undermine the process because the bidder would have the capability to negotiate with the ESB as well as Eir.  The State needs to act, though.  We need to give a clear and immediate signal to the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities to set up the pricing and other regulatory mechanisms that would have to be in place to be able to sign contracts in respect of the ESB delivering the last mile service rather than the Eir pole network.  One of the mistakes the Government has made is not to look at the option of reducing it to a single network of poles delivering services to every house in the country.  We do not need two.  That is the big missed efficiency that has been the result of this process.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the backhaul network, the officials were saying yesterday that as a percentage of the overall cost of the scheme, it is relatively low.  Success will be achieved here not by creating a private monopoly but by incentivising development of the backhaul network and using a variety of backhaul operators.  Certainly the MANs should be there but it should go beyond that.  I hope and believe there is still flexibility in the contract process to undo some of the damage from a badly handled political system.  It is not easy.  I have been there myself in the past, negotiating a broadband plan.  We did it in two years while this has taken seven.  We still have some months to improve what has been a flawed process.  The Government should use that time well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900032#KK00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1557407700,"counter":331,"content":"<p>After the debacle of the national children&rsquo;s hospital, here we are discussing another capital project that has been mired in controversy from day one.  What happened on Tuesday was yet another in a series of announcements on the rolling out of broadband in Ireland.  The first such iteration was as far back as 2012 and that promised high-speed broadband to 100% of homes and businesses by 2020.  In 2016, Fine Gael made yet another commitment to roll out broadband to every home and business within three to five years.  Last year the national development plan was published and these commitments were yet again reiterated.<\/p><p>Again this week we have seen the latest announcement.  The common thread is that the Minister and Taoiseach have been at the heart of all those announcements.  However, no contract has been signed.  Here we are in 2019 and not one metre of fibre optic cable has been rolled out.  I have serious concerns, as does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with the risk and exposure the Irish taxpayer is being asked to take.  We learned this morning in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that, despite the commitment given by the Taoiseach some months ago when he said the D&aacute;il would be involved in the decision, the full cost of rolling out broadband could be as much as &euro;5 billion.  Is this true?  How much will the Granahan McCourt consortium be coughing up?  Is it the case that it will have recouped the initial expense of the roll-out by 2028 as raised by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  How much private equity is being provided and how much by way of debt is being put on the table?  If the taxpayer is going to have to foot this bill, the Government needs to be upfront with the people on what exactly it is committing to.  The Minister says he that he cannot divulge this information because it confidential and commercially sensitive.  When there is only one bidder remaining, this argument does not stack up.  Simply put, the Minister cannot divulge this information because it is not certain.  It is not certain because there is no contract.  There is no contract because the Government is not ready.  The reason it announced this before it was ready is simple and obvious.  It is as plain as the nose on my face: 24 May, election day.<\/p><p>At the end of it all, the State will own nothing.  Presumably after 25 years the State will have to negotiate a new contract with the private consortium, whoever that may be.  It appears that this infrastructure could be sold to anyone from anywhere and at any time.  After 25 years, if the Government&rsquo;s take-up estimate is correct, the consortium will have a wholesale revenue stream of about 400,000 customers.  We have no idea of the risks that may be ahead and nothing in this week&rsquo;s announcement has allayed my fears.  This week we have seen the same old spin machine in full action.<\/p><p>We are told that Fine Gael is doing this for rural Ireland and that it is the saviour of rural Ireland but this is nothing more than political guff.  If Fine Gael was serious about rural Ireland, it would have provided more than just eight houses in eight years in Offaly and would have established a transition fund to help the region I am from to deal with the debacle that is the loss of Bord na M&oacute;na and the peat briquette and harvesting business.  If Fine Gael had the back of rural Ireland, it would have insisted that the Department of Education and Skills adhere to pupil-teacher ratios in small three-teacher schools and would have reinstated Midoc facilities considering it tells us it has a new GP contract that heralds the saviour for rural Ireland.  This happened on our watch up to last year because of Brexit as but for that, we would be well out of here.  Fine Gael has failed rural Ireland and this week's announcement has in no way convinced me that it can deliver this plan on time.  <\/p> <p> If we speak about the deluge of documents released yesterday at 1.55 p.m., it emerged that over the life of the national development plan, an extra &euro;1.5 billion will be required to pay for this plan.  Yesterday, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform said that no projects will be impacted because of this decision.  His Department has outlined the possible implications of spending an extra &euro;1.5 billion on broadband.  I could go through it but it is on the public record and involves the loss of 2,000 social housing units, the Tralee wastewater network, the Kilkenny regional water supply scheme, the Sligo western distributor road, the KillaIoe bypass, the Dunkettle interchange, the Moycullen bypass, 18 primary schools serving 8,600 pupils, new ambulance bases and deployment points and nine to ten primary care centres.  It also involves significant reductions in allocations from remaining programmes, including flood relief works, prisons etc.  This is unprecedented.  Given this advice from the Minister's own Department, the Minister insists that no capital project will be impacted.  Who is he trying to cod?  Clearly, there will be an impact.  The Minister will pay for this out of the capital envelope outlined in the national development plan or he will raise taxes or he will pay for it out of current expenditure.  Will we see less spending in mental health, education and housing?  Will there be fewer resources for nurses, doctors and consultants?  Will there be sufficient funds to pay for social welfare reforms?<\/p> <p> The bottom line is that we will not get those answers in the limited time here today.  I have asked that the Minister and the Secretary General come before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.

The Minister said an office is being set up but why would the Department not deal with this directly?

We did not accept that this would meet the requirements for rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of technology, we have had detailed evaluations both by ComReg and by our own Analysys Mason analyst, who came in to look at what was the best technology.  Every one of the bidders came in with fibre to the premises as being the preferred and optimal technology.  That is what is happening in urban Ireland; Eir is rolling out fibre to the premises, as are the others in urban Ireland.  Fibre is the most future-proofed and the proof of the pudding is that we provided a minimum 300 Mbps as the delivery speed.  When this is rolled out, by year ten it will have 500 Mbps.  Fibre is the best at building capacity to meet new needs in the years ahead.  By contrast, 5G and wireless depend on line of sight, so if one cannot reach the area, one has to keep building additional masts to get the penetration.  Given that masts are shared, if more people come on, the capacity is shared and the service to each one is diluted.

We are not building from scratch; we are not setting up a new company to build fibre on new poles that we erect.  It is the lowest cost it can be in terms of rolling this out.  More importantly, it minimises the risk to the State of having to come back at the end of 25 years and having to invest again.

In terms of getting to 540,000 premises, or, as it then was, 750,000 premises, it would be for commercial interests to bring it from the village out to all of those individual premises.  That was rejected as an inadequate approach.  The next big escalation in cost was, of course, the decision that had to be taken when Eir said it would commercially deliver 300,000 of these premises, which meant that had to be carved out of the intervention area, which had been 750,000 premises.  Some Deputies expressed scepticism as to why that had to be done.  It had to be done because, under state aid rules, if a commercial entity is offering to deliver it, one cannot offer state aid to someone else to do it.  That is an obligation of state aid rules.  It was communicated to us by the EU but also confirmed by the legal experts at the time that decision was taken.<\/p>  <p>  Those were among the decisions but there is also the risk assessment of the market.  It is only when the competitive dialogue was complete that one would get an understanding of how risk was assessed of lower than expected take-up, of more difficult terrain and all the things that we know are involved in reaching out to 100% of the population.  As the last quarter occupies 96% of the territory, this service has to go through 96% of the land area to reach just a quarter of the population.

We examined whether we could do this more cheaply, unbundle the work, carry it out through State agencies or use the ESB.  All of these alternatives were assessed.  In every case it was objectively found that the alternatives would create greater costs, impose a longer delay or cause the State greater uncertainties and risk.  We have chosen what I believe is the most cost-effective approach.  I do not dispute that it is expensive, but it is a cost that will be incurred over 25 years.

He was attacked at 12.30 a.m. at Rutland Grove in Crumlin.  The passengers took the driver's mobile telephone, a sum of cash and a dashboard camera.  According to reports, as he lay injured, the gang members attempted to steal the taxi but failed to start it.  They fled the scene on foot and four people were arrested following the attack.  This was not a once-off occurrence but part of a spate of attacks on taxi drivers in recent weeks.  More must be done to protect taxi drivers.<\/p>  <p>  The latest attack on a taxi driver in Dublin comes just weeks after a video of a racist and violent attack on a taxi driver was shared online.  That incident happened at 10 p.m. on Easter Sunday on the Malahide Road in Donnycarney in north Dublin and a man has handed himself into a north Dublin Garda station with regard to the attack.  The Immigrant Council of Ireland has interviewed taxi drivers from various ethnic backgrounds and its report on the racist attacks noted that many of them happened while the taxi was in motion, putting the driver and passengers at risk.  The number of physical attacks is also increasing.  A 73 year old Dublin taxi driver was beaten up and pulled out of his car in Tallaght recently.  He was stabbed and his car was later burnt out.  Many other attacks go unreported.<\/p>  <p>  Taxi drivers are increasingly frightened of going out to work.  Many of them say they will not drive into certain estates in Dublin.  I heard that at first hand from taxi drivers.  They are being attacked and held at knifepoint.  Their equipment is being stolen and there are attempts to rob them.  Some taxi drivers have put a camera in the cab.  Perhaps the Minister for Justice and Equality could examine ways of supporting the drivers.  It is their place of work.  I spoke to a taxi driver who told me that on two occasions he has had a syringe put to his throat.  He ended up packing in the job, saying that it was not worth his life.  That has an impact on his family.<\/p>  <p>  No person should have to work in such a dangerous environment.  The recent spate of attacks and violent robberies has led taxi drivers to avoid certain estates, and the ordinary, decent people who are living in these estates will suffer.  There are reports of some gangs targeting taxi drivers through apps and based on their age and physical fitness levels.  There must be a strong response from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Government before there is a fatality.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Minister aware of the problem?  What response will there be to the attacks?  Has the Minister spoken to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about it?  Is there a plan to deal with it?  It is not just taxi drivers who are affected.  There has also been a spate of attacks on drivers of delivery vans.  The attackers target people who are vulnerable.  Has the Minister talked to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport about this?  Has he looked at how other jurisdictions safeguard taxi or cab drivers?  There are different facilities in New York.  There is a sign at the back of the taxi cab facing the passenger that states the fare and also that it is an offence not to pay the fare or to attack the driver and that the courts will follow through on it.  I am seeking suggestions of what new things we can do in this regard.  I realise that the Minister was dealing with another issue under the earlier Topical Issue matter and that it is all about resources.

First, I acknowledge that taxi drivers can work in an environment that puts them at a higher risk of being attacked during the course of their work.  There is no doubt that we should do as much as possible to protect them.  Taxi drivers have highlighted the potential dangers of the job.  They work alone, often at night and in isolated areas.  They carry cash and, for the most part, they do not know their customers.  Obviously, thousands of taxi journeys are taken each day and the vast majority conclude without incident, but occasionally taxi drivers will find themselves in unpleasant or even dangerous situations.<\/p>  <p>  All taxi drivers, as part of their initial training and preparation for examinations, are provided with the Official Manual for Operating within the SPSV Industry.  This manual is produced by the National Transport Authority in consultation with the Garda crime prevention unit and contains a chapter entitled Staying Safe.  The chapter offers a range of information and suggestions on how to deal with difficult customers or dangerous situations that I encourage taxi drivers to be aware of and, where possible, put into action.  This includes suggestions on taking extra care in isolated areas, making eye contact with the customer when the customer gets into the car, and arranging a code word with the dispatch operator or a colleague that can be used in communication with them if danger is perceived.<\/p><p>Information regarding ways to reduce the risk of robbery is also provided.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has recommended that taxi drivers: avoid carrying large sums of cash where possible; do not show or tell customers how much cash they have and be discrete with their cash when giving a customer change; do not display valuables; and lock their vehicles while in isolated areas or waiting for a customer to arrive.<\/p> <p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also advises that taxi drivers who have been the victims of robbery or fare evasion should not chase the perpetrators because this might put their personal safety at further risk.  In addition, it is advised that taxi drivers should not take any action that might be deemed to be illegal or, again, put themselves at risk, such as detaining a passenger by force.  The advice from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to taxi drivers is to make contact immediately on 999 or 112 if they have been the victim of an assault, robbery or fare evasion and, if safe to do so, remain at that location until garda&iacute;.<\/p> <p> I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting full investigations into each recent case involving assaults on and robberies from taxi drivers.  In such circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further while these investigations are ongoing.  I acknowledge what Deputy Crowe stated.  He has put forward a number of important suggestions.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, is beside me - he is here to deal with another issue - and I would be very happy to take on board his observations and submissions on this issue.  It is important that we unite in this House and work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that taxi drivers and those engaged in that business are fully protected by the law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900039#RR00600","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557412200,"counter":416,"content":"<p>The cost of insurance for taxi drivers has trebled in the past year.  As well as the insurance issue, the situation is becoming much more dangerous for taxi drivers.  Many people who do not have access to transport are reliant on the services of taxi drivers.  I include in this those seeking to get to work.  Taxis are not just used for social occasions, they are also used for vital purposes such as, for example, if a child is sick and has to go to hospital.  It is important that we put in place the necessary supports for taxi drivers and that we stop these attacks.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to hear from both of the Ministers that they will talk to each other to see if there are ways in which we can help the drivers.  Will they also meet the drivers and their representatives to discuss the dangers they face and perhaps listen to their suggestions on what can be done?  We have heard of apps which increase the safety of drivers and passengers.  We have to examine those apps and the information they contain because they might also be a reason that people are targeted.  The most important thing is to look at other jurisdictions.  We are not alone; drivers and cab companies in other countries are also experiencing difficulties.  We can learn from their experience.  I am not proposing that we learn from jurisdictions where drivers are blocked off from passengers, but perhaps we could look at that as part of an overall safety review.  Drivers should have the option to block off passengers, but that cannot be done at the moment.  I appeal to both Ministers to sit down with the drivers and talk to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900040#SS00200","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1557412200,"counter":417,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Ross, and I speak on an almost daily basis in respect of this and other issues of importance.  I want to make it quite clear that the type of criminal behaviour to which Deputy Crowe refers has no place in society and will not be tolerated.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is very much alive to this issue, but that does not alter the difficulties it is encountering in trying to effectively tackle this form of crime.  Taxi drivers operate in isolated areas or at night.  They work alone and often carry cash in their vehicles.  In that context, there is a certain amount of personal responsibility on taxi drivers to keep themselves safe.  It has been suggested that drivers should consider the purchase of dash cams or CCTV systems to monitor the interior and exterior of their vehicles.  A number of drivers already use such equipment.  The footage from a CCTV system in the interior of the vehicle can help to identify any attackers.  If the quality of footage is sufficiently high, it may be used as evidence in a court of law.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the National Transport Authority is launching a new taxi driver respect campaign this month.  This is a public awareness drive which advocates respect for taxi drivers.  The campaign illustrates that taxi drivers can be anybody, including a friend or a family member.  As such, they deserve our full respect.  The campaign will include print media and bus shelters, as well as information disseminated via other media outlets.  I hope this campaign, aligned with the Government's commitment to increase Garda numbers and visibility, will lead to a reduction in the number of assaults and robberies involving taxi drivers in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900040#SS00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Legislation","time":1557412200,"counter":418,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900040#SS00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1557412200,"counter":419,"content":"<p>At lunchtime, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and I accepted a petition from 11 carriage drivers who came down from Merrion Road.

She is absolutely correct to state that this is the second time in six months it has been raised.  It is being addressed.  She is also correct to state that it should be addressed as a matter of great urgency.  I note that she has a petition; I am happy to receive it and respond to it in a manner which shows the need for action on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may know, some local authorities develop by-laws to licence commercially operating horse-drawn carriages.  Local authorities set their own rules and stipulations to govern such operations by means of by-laws.  Part 19 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides local authorities with the power to make by-laws.  Part 19 also provides a general power to a local authority to make by-laws in respect of its own properties or services or to regulate matters of local concern.  Section 199(1) of the 2001 Act provides that a local authority \"a local authority may make a bye-law for or in relation to the use, operation, protection, regulation or management of any land, services, or any other matter provided by or under the control or management of the local authority, whether within or without its functional area or in relation to any connected matter.\"<\/p><p>It is under this Act that local authorities can choose to regulate horse-drawn carriages that operate for hire or reward.<\/p> <p> In most counties there seems to have been little demand and by-laws are not in place.  In other areas, the matter is more relevant.  For example, in Kerry, where there is a long tradition of jarvey operation, by-laws have been adopted to regulate the operation of these horse-drawn hackney carriages.<\/p> <p> In February 2011, the city council took over responsibility for the licensing of horse-drawn carriage operators and drivers from the Garda carriage office.  Dublin City Council made by-laws in the same year for the licensing of horse-drawn carriages.  They made these by-laws under the Local Government Act 2001.  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has had sight of a note prepared by the Dublin City Council law agent giving the view that Dublin City Council has no legal basis to make such by-laws.  The note indicates that such powers may instead still rest, under the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853, 1854 and 1855, with the Dublin Metropolitan Police Commissioners, in respect of whom the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is successor.  Since this older Dublin-specific legislation was not repealed, powers for licensing horse-drawn carriages in Dublin still exist in statute.  This means Dublin City Council is unable to make by-laws under the 2001 Act in this respect.  By-laws may not be made under that 2001 Act where powers exist elsewhere in legislation.<\/p> <p> While I am currently of the view that these matters should normally be managed at local government level, I have requested that the matter be given due consideration by my Department.  I have requested, as I promised to Deputy O'Sullivan in reply to her question last time, that my Department engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Dublin City Council and seek separate legal advice if that is deemed necessary.  Depending on the outcome there may be a requirement to amend or repeal legislation to ensure an appropriate, modern regulatory framework is in place.<\/p> <p> Separately, I understand concerns have also been raised relating to animal welfare issues.  The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 provides powers to garda&iacute; and authorised officers to deal with issues of animal welfare.  Furthermore, the Control of Horses Act 1996 provides for local authorities to grant horse licences to those wishing to own a horse, thus entitling them to keep the horse in a control area.  The Act provides that a horse licence shall not be granted to any person under the age of 16 years.  Legislation of this nature comes within the ambit of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p> <p> As with all vehicles used on a public road, the drivers of horse-drawn carriages are responsible for behaving in a safe manner and for paying due care to other users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900040#SS00600","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557412800,"counter":422,"content":"<p>The letter and petition have been drawn up by professional carriage drivers and owners who were operating under license from Dublin City Council.

I live in Newbridge, which is a fine town.  I imagine the Minister of State has been there several times.  It has a population of close to 29,000 and the figure is growing.  There has been significant growth and development in recent years but unfortunately the town has been overlooked in respect of putting in place the necessary infrastructure and services.  While the town has many challenges, this particular challenge of a second bridge is one that I wish to highlight.<\/p>  <p>  At peak times the traffic delays and congestion are significant and impact negatively on the lives of people.  I put it to the Minister of State that a second bridge is vital not only for the future development of our town but also for what is going on currently.  The traffic into and leaving town is ever-increasing.  We have only one main bridge, which was built in 1930, over the River Liffey.  The bridge causes a major build-up throughout the day.<\/p>  <p>  Newbridge is an excellent destination town for retail with local independent shopping and the Whitewater Shopping Centre and Newbridge Silverware.  People come there from all over the country.<\/p>  <p>  The part of Newbridge where this particular bridge is situated is the only way that Newbridge can be accessed.  There are almost 6,000 people living there.  There are five schools with 3,000 pupils and teachers.  There is a church and cr&egrave;ches as well as a doctor's office etc.  One can only begin to imagine what it is like with five schools congested in an area and only one bridge.  The other 22,000 people do not live on the Dublin side of the bridge and they are trying to get through the town and over the bridge to get to the schools.  Equally, we have the 6,000 people trying to come in to the town.  We have people trying to leave Newbridge to get onto the M50 motorway or the Dublin dual-carriageway.  Others want to get to Naas, where our council offices are located and where many people can access employment.<\/p>  <p>  Lidl has its head office in Newbridge and is currently building its main distribution centre on the outskirts of the town.  Pfizer is continuing to grow, with staff numbers growing year after year.  All of this is beneficial and the associated employment is welcome and important.  However, I fear that the lack of a second bridge will catch up on development and obstruct future growth.<\/p>  <p>  Kildare County Council has prioritised this as the main infrastructure project for south Kildare, together with another bridge in Celbridge.  These are the two main focuses for Kildare County Council.<\/p><p>Funding was applied for under the urban regeneration and development scheme to construct a 1 km long road, including a new bridge over the River Liffey that would link the Great Connell Road and Athgarvan Road.  This would be a significant benefit and bonus.  Unfortunately, the application was turned down.  I hope the Minister of State has good news with regard to a new bridge.  It is estimated that building such a bridge would cost approximately &euro;15 million.  I accept that the latter is not an insignificant amount, but a new bridge would be very important and would greatly benefit all of those who need to cross into and out of Newbridge daily, often more than once.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900041#TT00500","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557413400,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Loughlin for raising this issue.

I am conscious that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport just left but the Deputy might want to raise this issue with him too because it is important that it should be dealt with on a cross-departmental basis.  A project such as this is not just for one Department.  We have a fund which is suitable for projects of this nature and Kildare has already availed of the opportunity to make an application to that it.<\/p>  <p>  The URDF is a flagship element of Project Ireland 2040, comprising an allocation of &euro;2 billion in the National Development Plan 2018-2027, with &euro;58 million available in 2019 and an overall Exchequer allocation of &euro;550 million earmarked for the fund up to the end of 2022.  The URDF was established to support more compact and sustainable development, through the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland's five cities and the many other large towns in line with the objectives of the national planning framework and the national development plan.  This is about sustainable development, encouraging sustainable development of town centres and making them more pleasant places to live.  Exactly as the Deputy described, Newbridge is probably similar to the town in which I live, Navan, with congestion at crossings and development over a number of years giving rise to pressure on existing crossings, meaning that infrastructure needs to be upgraded.<\/p>  <p>  The work we are trying to fund through the URDF is to enable a greater proportion of residential and mixed use development to be delivered within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and towns and to ensure that more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people can choose to live, work, invest in and visit.  If somewhere is a nice place to live in, one will be able to create more jobs with investment to service the needs of the people who are already living there.  Many people in Kildare and Meath have to leave their homes and travel long distances to work.  We are trying to encourage more jobs to be created beside them and to make the towns more attractive too.<\/p>  <p>  Bids were invited from public bodies for further funding under the URDF and 189 applications were received by my Department under the first call for proposals.

The applications received contained a wide variety of themes and sectoral areas from urban regeneration and public realm works to enabling strategic infrastructure such as bridges to leverage further development, as well as cultural and amenity development.  Applications received fall into two categories, namely, projects that are ready to go and funding to support the initial development of projects, including master planning and feasibility, to ensure a pipeline of projects for the future that may be funded by our Department or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  As part of this first call, Kildare County Council submitted seven proposals and was awarded initial URDF support for four.  Four of the proposals submitted by Kildare County Council related to a link road from Great Connell Road to Athgarvan Road in Newbridge.  However, this proposal was not awarded URDF support as part of the first call.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned Celbridge.  It was awarded funding.  The proposal is progressing through part B, which is to develop feasibility and bring different stakeholders and players together.  My Department is continuing to engage with successful applicants, in the case of Celbridge and others in Kildare, from the first call on the advancement of their proposals.  Once that process is complete, my Department will complete its review of the first call, after which a second call for proposals will be announced later in the year.  The Deputy asked if I brought good news with me.  I certainly cannot say I brought the chequebook, so I will have to check on the position.  There will be a second chance to apply for funding.  Every applicant that did not succeed had engagement with our Department.  The local authority in Kildare had engagement with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government about its application, where it went wrong and what it needs to do to make a new application.  Kildare County Council can consider further projects and applications.  That will be open for it in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900042#UU00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1557413400,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I guarantee that Kildare County Council will submit another proposal for funding with the full support of all the councillors.  Not having a second bridge is a significant hindrance to the growth and future development of the town.  The Minister of State talks about the plans that are there.  We have to obtain national funding to build this bridge.  Kildare County Council has sought funding for it.  The Minister of State must acknowledge the negative impacts that this will have on future plans for Newbridge.  There is a proposed traffic management plan from the National Transport Authority in respect of which submissions have been received.  I am concerned because I am of the view that far more radical changes than those which have been proposed are needed in order to improve matters regarding the build up of traffic.  What is proposed will not work without a second bridge.  We could have investment in respect of the traffic flow within Newbridge.  The traffic is chaotic at the best of times.  We need a strategic, long-term plan to deal with possible increases in housing and attractions to our town.  That cannot be done without a second bridge.  Another smaller bridge in the area, Sexes Bridge, is a prime example of the need for adjustment.  The area has been developed significantly, yet the only changes to this bridge were to add traffic lights and a footpath.<\/p>  <p>  The regional spatial and economic strategy for the eastern and midland regional plan is close to the Minister of State's heart.  The report on submissions was released earlier this month and it was felt that Newbridge should not be listed as a key town.  Newbridge is the fifth largest town in the mid-eastern strategic planning area and it is the only large town of the ten largest towns in the mid-east area that is excluded as a key town.  We are a dynamic town.  We are on a main rail line with good connectivity to the wider hinterland.  I cannot help but feel that the lack of a second bridge is impacting on decisions such as this.  While Newbridge is thriving now, it needs a lot of extra support.  Future population and economic growth will not continue without a second bridge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900042#UU00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1557413400,"counter":429,"content":"<p>It is open to the Kildare local authority to make another application in the future.  We have had engagement about why it did not succeed in the first instance.  Four out of seven projects did.  The Deputy stated that it got four out of seven priorities, which is quite good compared to other counties.  I am trying to match good quality planning with infrastructure under this fund.  The whole-of-Government approach in the context of Project Ireland 2040 is that we should invest in infrastructure because this will encourage greater investment and quality of life in many areas.  It will also make up for a lack of infrastructure in the past due to bad planning, where we had thousands of houses built in many counties, but no infrastructure provided to service them.  As we roll out the next round of development and recognise that there will probably be an additional 500,000 houses built over the next 20 to 25 years, we want to do that in a planned and co-ordinated way.  We have asked all the regions that use the national development plan to put in place three regional plans and to bring that down to county level too.<\/p>  <p>  There were concerns about the different population growth targets in the regions which I think have been addressed since the draft.  People are very happy in Kildare, Meath and Wicklow that the right population targets in place.  They will encourage more housing construction along with job creation and such.  It will not be as it was in the past, with houses with no jobs.  That will change and that will mean there will have to be investment in infrastructure in towns in a timely manner.  We asked that we would focus on the county town concept in every local authority.  Newbridge is not the county town of Kildare.  My understanding is that is probably why it was not named the county town.  The Deputy makes a good argument that all towns should be considered.  As the regional plans are taken down to a county town level, there will naturally be a plan for each town that will set out its strategy for the years ahead.  We recognise Kildare as a county that will grow.  It will need more houses.  That needs to happen in a planned, co-ordinated way.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy and I have both seen many cases where places have been allowed to grow without the proper infrastructure, whether services, investment in education, hospitals, roads or whatever it takes.  Very often, transport infrastructure is a key part of that too.  We are determined that, if we work with local authorities properly, the right resources will be allocated to the areas that need it to deal with development for the past and also for the future, which we are trying to do with the long-term thinking in Project Ireland 2040.  There will be plenty of opportunity to deal with this in the context of the applications.  If everyone does their homework right, I have no doubt that there is every reason there could be a successful application in the future.  We do not judge them.

I think the whole House has recognised that this is a really important subject.  It has rightly been described as the greatest challenge facing humanity.  I had the benefit of being at the conference in Poland where people from the youngest student to the oldest environmentalist commented on the scale of the challenge we face and the urgency with which we must address it.  This country has seen some extraordinary changes in the past decade.  One of the ways we have succeeded in making change is by using the Citizens' Assembly and the all-party Oireachtas committee approach as a way, not of getting full consensus, but of creating a significant degree of common ground on issues that present real difficulty to our community.  We need to think outside the traditional ways we have thought.  It is absolutely right that in what is probably the greatest challenge we face and the greatest set of changes we have to make as a community we have adopted the same approach.  I acknowledge the work of the Citizens' Assembly that preceded the work of the Oireachtas committee because it exposes the Oireachtas to thinking from outside, which is very healthy, and has provoked our political system to sit down with everyone involved, with people from different backgrounds, to hear views that are challenging at times but yet try to find common ground between them so that we can meet obligations that are very important not only to us but to our global environment.  That is what has been achieved by this report.  I know it does not have full consensus but there is a great deal of common ground there and many very practical proposals.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone who gets close to studying this issue, and I have to admit that it is only since I was appointed to this post that I have given it the level of attention it deserves, will see that we are approaching a tipping point in respect of climate deterioration and things will deteriorate very rapidly unless we move very swiftly.  The window of opportunity to do that is fast closing.  We come to that from the unenviable situation of being way off target.  We will be approaching 2020 with the expectation that far from having reduced our emissions by 20% as was expected we will probably be down by only 1%.  That is a massive disappointment.  As the economy has started to recover the link between economic prosperity and carbon emissions has not been broken.  Substantial increases in emissions, particularly in agriculture and industry, have accompanied the recovery.<\/p>  <p>  A great urgency has entered this debate not only in this House but further afield as we saw in the protests by school students and the increasing urgency of demands for action from us and from other parliaments around the world.  It is justified that a level of urgency be injected into this debate.  When we speak of an emergency people often think of something unexpected that can be resolved through a sustained effort for a relatively short time.  This is not an emergency of that sort.  This is a much more challenging emergency in that we must change our behaviour in profound ways and do so on a sustained basis.  Our targets for 2030 represent a 2% per annum reduction in emissions that we need to make.  From 2030 to 2050 that will accelerate massively to deliver a 7% reduction per annum.  This is going to be a sustained challenge for our communities, homes, ways of travel and working, to change those in such a way that we can meet the obligations.<\/p>  <p>  There is a huge responsibility and Government must put together the whole of government system to respond effectively to this report from the Oireachtas committee and put us on a trajectory to hit our targets and achieve the sort of ambitions we want to set for 2050.  The one asset of my period in government, which I hope will be of advantage to me in taking on this challenge, is that when we faced the employment crisis we had to enlist support across Government and we used the Office of the Taoiseach and the Department of which I was then Minister to get a level of ambition and co-ordination to meet the challenge.  That experience is valuable and I will adopt the same approach of having very rigorous, well-defined targets with clear responsibility, tracking their impact and adapting each year as we go to ensure that we are achieving them.<\/p>  <p>  The committee's work is really valuable in shaping our direction of travel.  It has been very clear in its demand for a new approach to governance and to political accountability which is absolutely appropriate.  It has dealt very effectively with renewable power, retrofitting, carbon pricing and many other individual sectors such as transport and agriculture which we cannot go into in the time available.  Possibly the most important sections are those which recognise this is something very different from designing policy to be implemented.  This involves community engagement and getting the confidence that there will be a just transition as we undertake difficult changes that will affect every home and individual.  That will be an important part of it.  This is not the sort of emergency where some individual or Minister is given emergency powers which set aside normal parliamentary procedures or accountability to do something for a short time.  This is an emergency where we have to orchestrate our whole community to adopt a different way of dealing with issues.  That will be really challenging.  It will be important that we frame that debate, get action and do not divide communities into rural versus urban or farming versus others.  There is a genuine risk of pitting one group against another instead of trying to find a way of bringing everyone together toward a shared goal and a sense of confidence that the burden will be shared fairly.<\/p>  <p>  Our own process is well advanced.  I started with a consultation which was very useful and several Deputies participated.  I have had 11 interdepartmental teams considering very particular areas where there are opportunities to act effectively.  We have designed a marginal abatement cost, MAC, curve, looking from the whole of economy point of view at the interventions we could make that would hit our targets and be cost-effective from the community point of view.<\/p><p>That starts to give one an idea of the areas that can make the biggest impact in the short run and at what point different technologies will start to impact.  We must be prepared to see them take off and make a significant impact as we go along.  <\/p> <p> We have made some significant commitments already.  We have committed, in response to the committee's request, to a target of 70% renewable power.  We have introduced the climate action fund and its first allocation of money is to roll out an electric vehicle charging network so that we begin to see more people having the confidence to purchase electric vehicles.  It is very significant that there has been a real surge this year in the number of people buying electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.  We are also changing the rules on green procurement because Government as a purchaser of nearly &euro;12 billion in goods is hugely powerful in terms of its capacity to influence the choices that are made throughout the supply chain.  <\/p> <p> I thank Deputy Hildegarde Naughton and the members of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, many of whom are here this evening, for the work they put into their report.  I look forward to co-operating closely with them as we bring forward a Government response which will be renewable each year and will be based on the principle of open debate and feedback.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900043#VV00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557414600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his very positive comments and his emphasis on the need for urgency on this issue.  The report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, responding to the Citizen's Assembly report on climate change, was formally launched on 16 April 2019.  This report marks the beginning of a new era for climate policy in Ireland.  The report represents all-party consensus on many of the tough and ambitious actions the Government must take to address its international climate commitments and go beyond that to become a leader in tackling climate change globally.  We as an Oireachtas have shown leadership, bringing all political groupings together to reach strong cross-party support for the practical recommendations outlined in our report.  There have been calls for this type of good practice on climate policy to be replicated across Europe.<\/p>  <p>  We know the science around climate change is becoming increasingly urgent.  The special report by the Intergovernmental Conference on Climate Change, IPCC, on global warming of 1.5&deg; Celsius was the starkest warning yet that we are running out of time to address runaway climate change.  In Ireland we are beginning to see some of the initial effects of climate change through extreme weather events, such as flooding, affecting our homes, farms and businesses.  Our citizens and, in particular, our young people are mobilising to demand stronger climate action to secure their future.  Our Citizen's Assembly was clear in its call for Ireland to do more to address this existential threat.  In establishing the joint committee to look at the recommendations of the Citizen's Assembly and in producing our detailed report for action, the Oireachtas has shown that we are listening to Irish citizens, that we take climate change extremely seriously and that we must take strong and immediate action to address it.  <\/p>  <p>  I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the great work of the Joint Committee on Climate Action over the last seven months.  I commend my committee colleagues, across all political groupings, for their commitment to this process.  I express my thanks to Deputies Butler, Corcoran-Kennedy, Pringle, Eamon Ryan, Sherlock, Br&iacute;d Smith, Stanley, Deering, Dooley, Heydon, Lahart, Munster, Jack Chambers, Neville and Nolan and to Senators Paul Daly, Devine, Lombard, Marshall and Grace O'Sullivan.  Parties should be proud of reaching a strong consensus position on many of the tough actions the Government must take for Ireland to play its part in fairly addressing climate change globally.   <\/p>  <p>  The committee's report provides a clear mandate for actions the Government must take to address Ireland's international climate change obligations.  It is large and particularly detailed for an Oireachtas report, containing more than 40 priority recommendations for Government and State agencies.  It addresses actions across all relevant sectors and proposes a new governance framework for climate policy that will pave the way for more transformational changes in individual sectors.  It also covers cross-cutting themes such as incentivising climate action, just transition, citizen engagement and education and communication.  The report further highlights the opportunities for Ireland, recognising that there will be new green industries, new jobs and new export opportunities as we transition to a low-carbon economy.  <\/p>  <p>  We have tried to make the report accessible to citizens, highlighting the opportunities and co-benefits of low carbon living such as cleaner air, more comfortable homes and healthier lifestyles.  We have tried to work with the different sectors, making recommendations that incentivise participants to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy.  It is now up to the Government to use this bold political mandate in developing its all-of-Government action plan to feed into Ireland's national energy and climate plan.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to focus on a few areas of the report that have received a lot of attention.  Our report recommends new legislation setting ambitious climate and renewable electricity targets, putting Ireland in line with the latest science from the IPCC which calls for net zero emissions globally by 2050.  The proposed legislation would also require five year carbon budgets to be devised by a new climate action council which would supersede the existing Climate Change Advisory Council to set a structured pathway for emissions reductions.  The report further recommends that responsibility for climate action be centrally co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.  In order to ensure adequate oversight and accountability, the committee recommends a new permanent Oireachtas committee that will hold Ministers and public officials directly to account for performance on climate action.  This new governance framework would be truly transformational and would provide a robust structure to ensure that Ireland gets back on track and stays on track in tackling climate change.  I urge the Government and the Oireachtas to fast track these legislative changes.<\/p>  <p>  There was broad, cross-party support for setting a long-term price for carbon of &euro;80 by 2030, giving certainty to individuals and businesses to drive the transition towards low-carbon choices, investment and innovation.  This should be accompanied by supports and incentives for climate action measures including the protection of those vulnerable to fuel poverty.  A public consultation was recommended to help to inform Government's decision on whether to return the revenue to citizens equally as a carbon dividend or to spend it in a targeted manner to address fuel poverty and support climate actions.  Those who oppose any increase in the carbon price but criticise Ireland for not meeting its climate targets are pursuing a populist line that is not linked to the reality we face.  The vast majority of our political parties recognise that increases in the price of carbon are necessary if we are serious about lowering our emissions trajectory.  It would put an increasing cost on greenhouse gas emissions that reflects their social and environmental impact, encouraging business and citizens to pursue lower carbon choices.  Increases must, of course, be balanced by enhanced incentives to support households and small businesses to decarbonise such as grant schemes and low interest loans.  <\/p>  <p>  In addressing agricultural emissions, the committee was mindful of the importance of this sector to the rural economy as well as the large proportion of our emissions generated by the sector.  Members proposed that farmers should be encouraged and supported to engage in climate mitigation measures, some of which should be incentivised through the CAP.  We also recommended the implementation of the Teagasc report in full and on-farm measures to reduce emissions and improve the sustainability of farming in Ireland, including through agricultural diversification.  Measures to reduce soil carbon emissions and better enhance the carbon sequestration potential of land were also proposed through, for example, sustainable forestry practices, maintaining hedgerows and re-wetting peatlands.  The committee also recommended a national strategy for anaerobic digestion.<\/p>  <p>  The report acknowledges the urgent need to retrofit the majority of the housing stock in the State in order to reduce emissions from heating.  It recommends a needs assessment to ascertain what is required to deliver this to the planned 45,000 homes per annum and to explore increasing that number to 75,000.  On energy, the committee was mindful of the huge potential for expanding renewable energy generation in Ireland, especially off shore, to help us to meet our climate targets.  The committee recommended actions to further and better exploit Ireland's plentiful renewable energy resources such as by urgently delivering a regulatory framework for offshore energy generation.  The report also recommends measures to enable the participation of citizens in large commercial projects, to promote community led projects and support microgeneration.  Developing offshore wind generation should become a priority and I urge Government and the Oireachtas to fast track legislation such as the Marine and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill to ensure a regulatory framework can be put in place as soon as possible to enable an offshore industry to develop.  Offshore energy projects can contribute to Ireland's energy mix and help us to meet our 2030 targets.<\/p><p>It has been a privilege to chair the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action, which is supporting Ireland to meet its international climate obligations with a view to ultimately becoming a global leader in climate action.  This report represents significant political consensus that will help to frame climate policy in Ireland for the next 15 years.  It is my earnest hope that the recommendations in this report are implemented as quickly as possible, particularly those recommendations around the establishment of a new and comprehensive framework for climate policy in Ireland.  The existing committee will continue its work over the coming year, working to address areas into which we were not able to delve in sufficient detail.  Let the committee's report be the start of the ambitious and immediate actions Government will take to get Ireland back on track, and to keep us on track, to meet our international climate change obligations.  This is just the beginning.  The hardest job of reducing our emissions is yet to come but with continued cross-party support and much work across Government and all sections of our economy and society we can change the dial and ensure Ireland becomes a climate leader.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900044#WW00200","speaker":"1315","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557415200,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p><blockquote>(a) To delete the words &ldquo;shall take note of&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;declares a climate and biodiversity emergency and accepts and endorses&rdquo;; and<br \/><br \/>(b) To insert the following after &ldquo;29th March, 2019&rdquo;: &ldquo;and calls for the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly to examine how the State can improve its response to the issue of biodiversity loss.&rdquo;<\/blockquote><p>Fianna F&aacute;il recognises that the climate crisis is the defining global challenge of our time.  We are committed to ensuring that Ireland does its fair share in response to the emergency and we therefore strongly support this landmark, cross-party report of the Oireachtas joint committee, in which I was privileged to participate.  I thank the Chair, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, for the way in which she managed the process in addition to all my colleagues on the committee.  I also thank the secretariat for the work it put in during the six months of deliberations.<\/p><p>I will start by briefly discussing why we have this report.  The joint committee was established to respond to the 17 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  It is important to be clear on why the Citizens' Assembly was called on to address this issue and on why the committee took such time to examine its proposals and put forward detailed recommendations.  This House has heard on several occasions that global warming has to be limited to below 2&deg;C.  Unless we cut emissions significantly by 2030, the consequences will be dire.  Like other parties, Fianna F&aacute;il has tabled an amendment, which I have moved, that calls for the declaration of a climate emergency.<\/p><p>We must recognise, however, that declaring an emergency does not paint the full picture.  This report is before us because the Government has knowingly and repeatedly failed to put in place a proper climate strategy and to implement policies that would see Ireland's pollution emissions reduce.  As a result, Ireland will not meet its EU 2020 climate and renewables targets.  We are on track to miss our 2020 target by an abysmal 95% and our 2030 commitments are already at risk.  Compliance costs to try to close the gap are likely to be in the hundreds of millions.  Ireland is now heralded as the worst performing country in Europe for action on climate change.  It is the Irish public who will suffer most from the significant environmental, economic and health impacts arising from a failure to decarbonise.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding that appalling record, I notice that in one of the Taoiseach's many communications on Twitter he is today heralding the fact that there has been some reductions as a result of the lack of use of the plant at Moneypoint as if this is something to be celebrated.  It is anything but.  It is a full recognition of our failures so far.  To be clear, the recommendations in the joint committee's report are absolutely necessary not only because we have a global climate crisis, but because we have a climate action crisis here in Ireland.  The State is very far from being a leader; it is on life support.  This committee has done its duty, however, and come forward with necessary actions which this Government must adopt in full.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il does not believe that the State's response to the climate crisis can ever be treated as purely a technical, academic exercise.  Social justice must be at the core of climate action.  The report has rightly focused on the need for a just transition and for those most exposed and most in need of assistance to be put first.  The social consequences of climate action should be tackled first and not treated as an afterthought.  It is for this reason that Fianna F&aacute;il was particularly strong on the impacts of a carbon tax increase and demanded that the most vulnerable be protected first, with revenues ring-fenced and used to support those not in a position to transition immediately from fossil fuels.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il's priority was that we would not have the sort of vague promises and window dressing that has been a hallmark of this Government's response to climate change.  We have witnessed unprecedented student protest for concentrated and commensurate action.  We need an honest response.  Fianna F&aacute;il has therefore sought to ensure that committee recommendations are SMART - specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound.  The science demands measurable action, not living documents.  It is vital that we are able to track progress across Departments and relevant public bodies.  We must see these deadlines in the Minister's forthcoming plan.  Having previously put forward legislation on both new targets and expanding the responsibilities of our Climate Change Advisory Council, Fianna F&aacute;il has long been clear on the need for a clear course of action, which is a legally binding objective in line with the Paris agreement.  I very much welcome the recommendation that we follow the example of the UK and put a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 in legislation together with the new renewables target and a disciplined budgeting approach.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il also focused on practical measures which would see immediate benefits for citizens and business.  This means much greater investment in retrofitting and solar for more energy efficient homes, making community energy schemes and benefits mandatory for renewable projects, new incentives including CAP measures to help farmers fight climate change at farm level, the establishment of an independent just transition task force to make sure we decarbonise in a way that is fair to the workers and communities most affected and new supports to encourage the roll-out of electric cars and buses and greater participation in cycling.<\/p><p>At international level, the Government must ensure that Ireland supports rather than hinders greater EU ambition but we are hearing the opposite is the case.  It has been widely reported today that Ireland has refused to join with other progressive member states in pushing for greater EU climate ambition at today's summit on the future of Europe in Romania.<\/p><p>I also want to highlight the second part of Fianna F&aacute;il's amendment which calls for both a climate and biodiversity emergency to be declared and for biodiversity loss to be examined by the Citizens' Assembly.  It is unfortunate that we do not have the opportunity to discuss fully the extremely grave warnings published this week in a global assessment report on devastation of species and habitats.  In short, biodiversity loss is an existential threat that is fundamentally linked to the climate crisis and Ireland's response is similarly lacking.  The current national biodiversity action plan goes nowhere near far enough.  When it comes to conserving our biodiversity and responding to the global assessment report, the existential approach of the Government on climate action must not be repeated.  A co-ordinated strategy which integrates biodiversity objectives into policy decisions is needed across all relevant Departments and public bodies.  The Government must ensure that environmental laws are enforced and align policy implementation and planning with necessary progress on the sustainable development goals.  We also need significantly increased investment in habitat restoration and improved public engagement on the climate and biodiversity crises.  The Government should urgently progress measures in the committee report which relate to the protection of our forests, peatlands and soils.  Now that we have completed the examination of the Citizens' Assembly's conclusions on the climate crisis we should call for the State's response to biodiversity loss to be similarly integrated, as noted in the amendment.<\/p><p>All of the recommendations in this report must be reflected in the Minister's forthcoming plan, particularly those relating to biodiversity.  These must feed into the existing national mitigation plan and necessary legislation on governance and accountability must be introduced before the summer break.  The report is a welcome initial step which, if implemented, will allow Ireland to get back on track and bring to an end our laggardly response to climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900045#XX00600","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1557415200,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment No. 4 states:<\/p><blockquote>To insert the following after &ldquo;29th March, 2019&rdquo;:&ldquo;&mdash; however, rejects the endorsement of an increase in the existing carbon tax; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; declares a climate and ecological emergency.&rdquo;<\/blockquote><p>I welcome the opportunity to address this motion.

We should see it as an opportunity to create a stronger, more sustainable economy for everyone.  To do that, however, we have no option but to radically transform our society and economy.  We have a fantastic opportunity to invest in towns and villages in rural areas which have for a very long time been neglected.  We need a genuine transformation to revitalise rural communities.  We can achieve that objective.  What we do not want is to see a transition that places an unfair burden on working families through regressive taxation.  We do not want to see a transition based on private market solutions that push thousands more families into fuel poverty.  We cannot allow climate action to turn into some sort of green austerity where taxes increase and workers lose their jobs.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to climate action and we are willing to work with every group here on a cross-party basis, as we have done.  At the Joint Committee on Climate Action we did achieve consensus on the vast majority of substantive issues behind climate change.  However, we diverged when it came to agreeing to certain solutions to the problem, particularly in the areas of afforestation, power, waste, a just transition and carbon tax.  My party also wants to be more ambitious in producing power from renewables.  For that reason, we felt it was necessary to produce our own minority report.  We believe the majority report fails to deal fully with the principles of a just transition.  In our minority report we call for a just transition in line with the International Labour Organization's framework.  This is essential to ensure ordinary people will not be left behind, which we have as a key recommendation.  Just last week we saw Bord na M&oacute;na announce that a total of 200 workers had been made redundant this year, with 240 more to lose their jobs by the end of the year.  That is having a significant effect on places in the midlands such as counties Laois and Offaly.  While we all agree that we must move away from peat production, it is essential that we transition to an alternative that is environmentally sustainable and that will not drive down the standard of employment for workers.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing that we phase out peat by transitioning towards renewables such as biomass, biogas, solar and wind energy.  While it is positive that some peat plants have already started converting to biomass, we have not established a native biomass industry on a scale that can create the supply chains required to support it and supply the raw material.  Instead, we are up importing fuel from across the globe to power these plants.  That has carbon footprint implications.<\/p> <p> With regard to biogas, Germany has over 8,000 such plants, while England has over 600.  We have a problem here with agricultural waste.  We have a large agriculture sector and need to deal with this to do things more sustainably.  We are repeatedly seeking derogations from the European Commission for slurry spreading instead of using biogas as a sustainable way of utilising this material to create sustainable energy.  Our large agriculture sector means that we have one of the best biogas resources in the European Union, but we are not taking advantage of it.  We are only starting to do so.  We have one plant that is supplying gas to the town of Athy.  Despite this great potential, the midlands are in danger of becoming a rust belt.  We need to do this quickly.  Sinn F&eacute;in is arguing that we should provide Bord na M&oacute;na with the substantial State and EU funding that it is seeking to make the transition from brown to green industries through biomass, biogas and so on.  We also have potential in Ireland for wind, wave, hydro and solar energy.  A recent report by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, estimates that a &euro;1 billion euro investment by the State would lead to the creation of 11,000 net jobs in solar energy, 4,400 jobs in wind energy and over 18,000 jobs in retrofitting homes.  That is a great need.  We have an opportunity to enable Ireland to become secure in its energy supply, instead of importing up to &euro;5 billion worth of fossil fuels each year and continuing to create the amount of pollution we currently create.  There is great potential to move towards a green economy based on good employment and a sustainable environment.  Unfortunately, the report fails in some aspects to deal fully with the ambitious just transition that we need.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in is clear and unambiguous that it is absolutely opposed to an increase in carbon tax. The international evidence does not show that carbon taxes have worked.  Since the introduction of a carbon tax in Ireland in 2010, emissions have actually increased.  Sinn F&eacute;in will not support a policy that would multiply the carbon tax by up to four times its current rate.  Householders are already paying &euro;52.67 extra in carbon taxes on a tonne of coal.  That figure will increase to &euro;208 under what is planned.  There are 400,000 families across the State living in fuel poverty and any increase in carbon tax would force thousands more into fuel poverty.  Heating one's home in winter time is not a luxury.  We are collecting substantial amounts by way of carbon tax.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants the existing carbon tax we currently bring in each year to be ring-fenced for retrofitting homes, which would help people to reduce their energy use and bills in a positive way, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Most of the homes in the greatest need of retrofitting, with the worst energy ratings, are also the lowest income households.  We must get our heads around this key point.  More often than not, those on the lowest incomes live in the homes with the least insulation and that are least energy efficient.  They have very high energy bills.  We cannot expect families and their communities to change their behaviour without giving them a viable alternative to which to transition.  We cannot tell people in rural villages and towns to use their cars less when they do not have any public transport available.  We cannot expect people in the city to use electric cars when we do not have the required networks to charge them.  In its minority report Sinn F&eacute;in has set an ambitious target of achieving a figure of 80% for renewable energy by 2030.  We believe that is achievable.  It is good that the majority report includes a figure of 70%, for which we pushed, but we believe we can go 10% further.  That is completely achievable and contingent on the basis that we work together to develop innovative policies.  We should be ambitious and see if we can set the figure of 70% as the baseline and push it further.<\/p> <p> My office has put forward a Bill on microgeneration, which is mainstream in Germany, Italy and many other European countries.  The Bill would allow families, small businesses and communities to generate their own electricity and sell the excess to the grid.  It is through these simple, straightforward ideas that we can move away from a high carbon economy.  This is an issue of fairness and sustainability.  That is what we must get right.  We must ensure those who are the least to blame for the climate crisis are not the ones who will end up paying the highest financial cost through a new green austerity programme.  The transition to a low carbon economy cannot be left to the whims of the private market; it must be led by a public vision supported by public investment.  It must involve all public bodies, including local authorities, the Government and all other State agencies.  That is the approach we need to take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900045#XX00700","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557415800,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I congratulate the committee on its work, particularly the Chairman, Deputy Naughton.

The economy is based on burning fossil fuels.  We burn oil, gas and peat for electricity generation, industrial processes and home heating and power almost all transport.  Burning fossil fuels releases large quantities of carbon dioxide which is the main greenhouse gas.  Other economic activities such as farming also generate methane, nitrous oxide and F-gases, all of which are greenhouse gases.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that our total greenhouse gas emissions are 60 million tonnes per year.  The EPA conducts studies to determine where the emissions come from.  A third comes from farming, 19% from transport, 19% from electricity generation and 10% from home heating while the remainder come from other sources such as manufacturing, industrial processes and waste.  Our international commitment under the Paris Agreement is to get our greenhouse gas emissions down to 33 million tonnes per year by 2030.  This is not a political target.  It is based on the best science.  Greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for decades.  Our 60 million tonnes of emissions are cumulative so it should be no surprise that with almost 8 billion people on Earth, we have reached and far exceeded the ability of natural processes to absorb these emissions.<\/p> <p> There will only be one economy in the future and that will be an economy that operates on a carbon-neutral basis.  We are facing an environment and climate emergency and Labour believes the Government should elevate its concern with climate to the status of a national emergency until we have taken serious steps towards reducing our carbon emissions.  Carbon emissions and the destruction of natural habitats are the root cause of the loss of plant and animal species, which is as much of a problem in Ireland as it is in other countries.  Declarations are not enough.  We must have concrete proposals to reduce our emissions in each and every sector of the economy.  Fine Gael keeps saying it will reverse the trajectory of Ireland's rising emissions but we have not seen anything like the seriousness of action that is needed.  Ireland's emissions per person are amongst the highest of any country.  We are behind many other European countries in taking action and we urgently need to catch up.<\/p> <p> Labour's core concern throughout the discussion on climate change is that workers and communities could be made worse off.  Labour has joined with ICTU and individual trade unions in calling for a just transition approach.  This means making sure that workers can move to new quality, sustainable jobs if their industries are going to decline due to reduction in our use of fossil fuels.  Bord na M&oacute;na workers are one obvious example.  Labour called for a just transition task force to be set up, along with a fund, to make sure that we create new good jobs in the midlands to ensure that communities there are not destroyed economically by the loss of hundreds of good jobs in Bord na M&oacute;na.  The same just transition approach should be taken across the board.  Will the Government establish a national just transition task force in 2019 with an independent chair and membership drawn from trade unions, employers and the community sector, as the report recommends?  <\/p> <p> Labour believes that we can combine serious action on climate with serious action on poverty and inequality.  There is no doubt that the transition to a carbon-neutral economy will require dramatic changes but we can use that as an opportunity to change our economy for the better.  We can eliminate fuel poverty by putting serious investment into home insulation and retrofitting and by making sure all new housing uses the best possible insulation.  That would reduce carbon emissions and reduce poverty.  If all homes reduced heating emissions to zero and used electricity from sustainable wind power, this would meet 9% of the total emissions reductions required.  This is an example of Labour's approach to real climate action.  We want a \"Green New Deal\" for Ireland with ambitious targets for home energy retrofitting that will create many new jobs.  We believe the Climate Change Advisory Council was right to seek for 100,000 homes to be retrofitted annually and Labour shares that level of ambition.  We should start by retrofitting all council housing and publicly owned buildings.  <\/p> <p> There is a significant amount in the report's recommendations.  Due to time pressure, I will focus my remarks on just a few areas.  The report calls for carbon budgets.  Currently, responsibility for emissions rests with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment but all Departments need to be included.  I acknowledge the Minister's comments in that regard earlier.  Labour has been fighting for science-based carbon budgets that would set out for every year the maximum allowable carbon emissions for each Department and for each sector of the economy.  Deputy Howlin recently proposed a new office of Minister for public expenditure and climate action to integrate carbon budgets into the national budget framework to give this the seriousness that it deserves.  Will Fine Gael adopt carbon budgets?<\/p> <p> Carbon tax is one of the measures needed if we are to collectively deliver the scale of change with the urgency dictated by the science of climate change.  Labour has taken the view that we can support carbon tax if all of the proceeds are ring-fenced to address the climate emergency.  The economy is not going to magically transform overnight.  Investment in home insulation, public transport and better recycling needs major investment.  The private sector will address some areas like electricity generation because it is clearly profitable to generate electricity from wind but the State will need to step in across many other areas of the economy.  Carbon taxes provide a way of funding that investment while also reducing poverty.  Opponents of raising carbon taxes have to specify where else they would raise taxes to come up with the hundreds of millions of euro annually that are needed to transform our economy to a carbon-neutral economy.  <\/p> <p> It will be hard for our current agricultural sector to become sustainable and carbon neutral.  Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture are increasing when we need to reduce emissions urgently.  There is currently no Government policy in place to address the trajectory of agricultural emissions.  We need a just transition in farming as well to lower emissions and protect livelihoods.  A free market approach will not deliver sustainable agriculture and decent farm incomes.  Labour has called for measures to help farmers diversify their incomes as part of the transition.  <\/p> <p> Ireland's industrialised peatlands emit approximately 7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year.  It is astonishing that no one has yet addressed this.  There is nothing in the national peatlands strategy to address it.  Peatlands need to be re-wetted and rehabilitated to stop carbon emissions from leaking out.  Labour proposed ambitious targets for the restoration and rehabilitation of each major type of peatland in Ireland but we could not get agreement from other parties.  Re-wetted peatlands could open up a new chapter for the rural economy with Bord na M&oacute;na positioned as the custodian of our peatlands and new jobs created in peatland restoration, nature tourism and recreational activities.  What does the Government intend to do about peatlands?  <\/p> <p> We need a similar strategy to change our approach to forestry with a move towards continuous cover of native broadleaf species.  That would create more jobs and better jobs in forestry but changes to our model of forestry will require supports in the early years as it will take time for the new model to begin paying dividends to investors.  <\/p> <p> Detailed work is needed to build on all of the recommendations of the climate report.  The committee should meet weekly until the summer recess to make progress on this issue.  The climate emergency needs to be taken much more seriously by all of us but by the Government in particular.  Is Fine Gael committed to climate action?  Will the environmental and climate emergency be made into a legally binding all-of-Government priority?  Is Fine Gael committed to reducing our emissions to 33 million tonnes by 2030?  Is the party committed to a carbon-neutral economy by 2050?  It is essential that this commitment is there and is backed up by the urgent actions that are required to address the emergency that are contained in the report that I welcomed at the outset. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900046#YY00400","speaker":"1301","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557416400,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 2 states:<\/p><blockquote>To insert the following after &quot;29th March, 2019&quot;:<br \/><br \/>&quot;and declares a climate emergency.&quot;<\/blockquote><p>I thank Deputy Hildegarde Naughton for the great job she did as Chairperson of the committee that produced this report.  However, the starting point should be the other reports that are constantly being produced - probably on a daily basis.  They include a report entitled, EU Overshoot Day: Living Beyond Nature's Limits, which will be published on 10 May 2019 and a report from Paul Price, a researcher in DCU, which I received this morning.  Paul Price looks at what we need to do to rapidly make a transition to a fossil fuel-free society in Ireland.  He bases his study on the current national energy and climate plan.  I know it is difficult to see but what he is trying to show us with this graph that for our carbon emissions to be where they need to be, we need to be up here but we are down here.  What this report plans to give us is in between the two.  It falls short of what needs to be done.  That is my starting point - not to be a naysayer but to say that we are not doing enough and are not moving rapidly enough at the scale and speed required to deal with the loss of species and biodiversity on the planet and to deal with our emissions.<\/p><p>These reports are interesting and I hope Members will look at them.  They reference repeatedly what we need to do to reduce our emissions and to be optimistic about the scenarios we can have for the future.  However, this report does not go far enough in that respect. <br\/><br\/>To paraphrase Greta Thunberg, these reports should make us panic.  That is what she has said.  We, as politicians, need to panic, and she is right.  The stark realisation is that we are living through a mass species extinction - we heading towards the loss of 1 million species - and that we may now be committed to trends that place a question mark over the future of ourselves as a species, yet the official policy of the State is to effectively ignore these facts and proceed with plans and polices which, aside from the odd public relations release or spin, ignore these realities.  I advise the Minister that we need to panic.<br\/><br\/> One would think in that context that I would welcome a report entitled, Climate Change: A Cross-Party Consensus for Action.  The first comment I would make on it is that it is not a cross-party consensus.  I have written to the Chairman of the committee and to the Minister today asking for that to be corrected.  Two parties did not consensually adopt this report and that needs to be put on the record.  I have also written asking for the record to be changed regarding an amendment I proposed that was accepted on a just transition for workers.  Importantly, that amendment was altered not by us, and it was not what we voted on - to exclude peat workers from the possibility of the State taking care of the pensions and conditions of those workers.  I wrote about that in the email I sent and I hope the Minister will strongly consider making those adjustments.<br\/><br\/>We contributed to and participated in this committee for months.  We took it very seriously and in every chapter we suggested recommendations and polices that we believed could have an effect.  In fairness, on many occasions, the committee listened to us and tried to adopt some of the positions on those issues, such as fuel poverty, the need to protect workers in industries affected, the kind of role the State should play in delivering renewables and the role of the fossil fuel industry in hampering and hindering the actions we need to take.  Other issues it did not take on board included a proposal to work towards delivering free public transport in the future.  <br\/><br\/>This report is too modest and too meek and it lacks the ambition that is needed in many areas.  If this report has been produced ten or 20 years ago we might have considered it progress.  Given what we now know and what scientists are alerting us to and screaming at us on a daily basis, the report is mild and a little outdated.<br\/><br\/>The key issue I have, aside from the aspirational nature rather than the concrete nature of the report, is the proposal on carbon tax, or as it is called in the report, &quot;incentivising climate action&quot;.  First, what is the tax on, who is it on and how do its supporters believe it will reduce our carbon emissions?  Effectively the carbon tax, or the increase in it, is on the consumption of fossil fuel energy by ordinary people, that is, on their energy, transport and heating bills.  It suggests that if these bills rise, it will incentivise ordinary people to turn away from their high-carbon use and adopt alternative, renewable sources of energy, transport and heating.  It is true there are many good ideas and suggestions in the report but there is only one policy I am confident this Government and its successors will enact and that is the trajectory for raising carbon taxes on ordinary people.<br\/><br\/>We can dress this as we want but the ideology behind this proposal is that ordinary people&rsquo;s personal behaviour and choices are the key to reducing carbon emissions.  If they, we and all the people who may be following these proceedings change our behaviour, that will encourage the market and private entrepreneurs to provide the alternatives we need.  That will not work and it is a dangerous illusion.  The problem is not the personal behaviour of ordinary people; the problem is systemic, it is connected to the economic system under which we live, to the drive for profit and competition and the way the fossil fuel industry and the giant corporations attached to it are the heart of that system, the system of capitalism that has developed over the past 200 years.  <br\/><br\/>We use fossil fuels because that is where the greatest profits, returns and largest investments are to be had.  We have failed to reduce our emissions because of the opposition from the fossil fuel giants who denied the science and the link between fossil fuel use and climate change.  These giant corporations have funded climate scepticism and climate deniers and have sought to delay and undermine those scientists who have been trying to raise awareness and they have bought and influenced governments which pursue policies that have meant society remains addicted to and continues to use fossil fuels and continues the extraction of oil, coal and gas.  <br\/><br\/>Last year, almost 30 years after the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report and decades after &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; and after the scientists had begun screaming at governments, humanity emitted more CO<sub>2<\/sub>than ever before in human history, not less, not the same but the greatest volume of CO<sub>2<\/sub>from human industry, human consumption and other sources.  That failure places a question mark over the future habitability of our planet.  That failure has come after 30 years of failed market mechanisms that were introduced such as carbon trading, carbon offsets and dubious schemes and scams that provided a few windfall profits but failed to reduce or even address the global rate of CO<sub>2 <\/sub>emissions.  Carbon taxes on ordinary people are another market mechanism that will fail to reduce CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions.  <br\/><br\/>The imposition of carbon tax seeks to suggest that the problem is individual choices and that tweaking market signals can achieve the historic and major task that we face.The market will not provide the solution because to a large extent, the free market is the source of the problem.  It is a system based on endless growth, on endless need to accumulate for the sake of profits and to expand and create  new markets to accumulate more.<br\/><br\/>The measures humanity need to take fly in the face of the very reason free market capitalism exists in the first place but it is not true that it means demanding sacrifices from ordinary people or lowering our living standards.  Free and plentiful public transport, energy efficient homes, properly planned towns, villages and cities and a switch to State-run renewable energies, especially in offshore wind, are not a sacrifice for ordinary people but could be a major gain for people and the planet.  The measures needed to bring the mass of people with us in tackling climate change are those I listed.  What do carbon taxes say to those people?  They say they are the problem, not Exxon Mobil, Shell or the giant corporations that continue to extract the fossil fuels.<br\/><br\/>We will increase heating and transport costs by not providing alternatives in public transport or renewable energy.  That is a guaranteed way to alienate ordinary people, lose them in the battle and allow climate sceptics tell them it is all a hoax designed to make them pay more, while the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.<br\/><br\/>I have constituents, as have all Members present, who face fuel poverty and cannot access the fuel allowance.  Their bills will go up and they will be seriously asked to accept that we mean what we say when we talk about reducing our carbon emissions.<br\/><br\/>I want to conclude by appealing to the Green Party Deputies to remove the amendment they have placed before the House because what is says to us is that we must accept the report in full, when we clearly already have voted against it, in order to accept that we need to declare a climate emergency.  Of course, we need to declare a climate emergency.  The Bill I have struggled to get to Committee Stage, and hopefully it get there in June, is called the climate emergency measures Bill.  We accept there is a climate emergency but we will not be bounced into accepting a carbon tax on ordinary people for all the reasons I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900047#ZZ00200","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557417000,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I welcome the report and its 42 priority recommendations and 39 ancillary recommendations.  I thank the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, my constituency colleague in Galway West, and all the members of the committee, including my colleague, Deputy Pringle, who represents the Independents 4 Change group.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to put all that positivity, which is wonderful, in context.  If we go back to 1988 where this started with the first intergovernmental conference, 31 years ago, and following on from that, during all that time our emissions have increased.  The Kyoto Protocol was introduced in 1997 and it came into operation in 2005.  We can jump forward to the Paris Agreement with its binding targets.  Then we come to Ireland where we have had a White Paper, I am not sure if we have had a Green Paper, we have introduced legislation, we had a mitigation plan and a framework plan and we have set up the advisory council. <\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>We have to acknowledge the D&aacute;il has been led screaming by the nose to do something about climate change.  It has not come from the D&aacute;il, although it certainly has come from the Opposition, with new politics since February 2016.  I welcome that the Government has come along with us in that new lead.  We have been forced by the children of the world, the children of Ireland and the Citizens' Assembly to take action.  That is what is happening here.<\/p> <p> This is a good report, although I have some reservations about it, which I will come back to in regard to carbon tax and using it to divide and conquer, thereby losing the point of what we are trying to do in regard to climate change.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith mentioned a number of reports.  It would be remiss of me not to mention the recent biodiversity report, or should I say the \"lack of biodiversity\" report.  The summary, or the advance unedited version, of the global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services for policymakers makes for grim reading.  The UN-commissioned report, the summary of which was approved at the 7th session in Paris last week, is the most comprehensive report on the issue ever completed.  It was compiled by 145 expert authors from 50 countries over the past three years, with inputs from more than 310 contributing authors.  The report finds that approximately 1 million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, many within decades, which is more than ever before in human history.  The average abundance of native species in most major land-based habitats has fallen by at least 20%.  More than 40% of amphibian species, almost 33% of reforming corals and more than one third of all marine mammals are threatened.<\/p> <p> I hasten to add that only a small number of rich developed countries have led us to this disaster, and Ireland, unfortunately, is one of those.  The intergovernmental panel's latest report in October 2018 confirmed what we have only 12 years left for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5&deg;C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risk of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people, most of whom have done nothing wrong.  Rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society are essential to prevent catastrophic climate change.  The latest report from the World Wildlife Fund tells us that the European Union consumes almost 20% of the earth's biocapacity, although it comprises only 7% of the world population.  Our role in that, as I understand it, is that Ireland is currently the third highest carbon emitter in the EU.  The Climate Change Advisory Council produced its first report in November 2016 and pointed out we are failing to meet our targets.  The EPA has spoken out and highlighted that we are failing to meet our targets.<\/p> <p> Earlier today, we debated the national broadband plan and we noted for the first time that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform mentioned climate change in this regard.  If the Government goes ahead with the plan in the manner in which it plans to do, it will have significant effects on many areas, including our ability to take climate change action.<\/p> <p> In regard to the joint committee's report, I welcome the recommendation to set up a committee to monitor the implementation of the priority recommendations and ancillary recommendations, which is essential.  Perhaps I am being a bit unfair to the Minister in regard to the way the motion is put because I realise it is the standard language to \"note\" the report.  The report was laid before the D&aacute;il on 29 March.  Since then, as we know from each report, and as I have quoted the biodiversity report, circumstances have worsened.  I would have thought the Government might have seen sense and moved on from the gentle language of taking \"note\" to taking action.  I welcome the amendments tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party, People Before Profit and Sinn F&eacute;in to declare an emergency, which I support.  We have to take action but before we take action, as with housing, we have to recognise the problem.  That will determine the speed of our action.<\/p> <p> There are ten chapters in the report, which is too many to go through in the short time I have left.  I will focus on chapter 10, which relates to transport.  There are many good suggestions, including that we pick one particular city as a pilot project.  Interestingly, this only appears once but it is a very strong recommendation on page 97, where paragraph 6.d states: \"develop a pilot scheme for a city and its regional hinterland to develop a best practice model\".  I welcome that and I would suggest Galway city.  The report refers to cities over a certain population size and Galway is a good example of a city that could be picked to implement climate change measures very quickly, particularly in respect of public transport.  Our population is 80,000 and destined to increase by another 50%, which is all set out in national development plan and the national planning framework.<\/p> <p> The Government talks about sustainability but it also talks about the provision of another road and more traffic, which goes completely against its own recommendations in this report and completely against the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  As I understand it, the Government has endorsed all of recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly, which asked it to rebalance the money being spent on roads in favour of public transport.<\/p> <p> To take Galway again, park and ride facilities could be implemented immediately.  It has been in the city development plan since 2005 but, 14 years later, there is not a sign of park and ride in a city of 80,000 people, although it is picked out as one of the five cities to grow.  Cycling infrastructure is minimal in Galway and could be immediately improved, with little effort.  We have no biodiversity officer in Galway.  These are practical measures and if the Minister was seriously interested, this could be done in a short time.  The retrofitting of houses has been suggested and this should start immediately with the houses owned by the local authority.<\/p> <p> I will give another example.  On the one hand, there are good ideas coming from the Government, albeit with sustained pressure from the Opposition, but, on the other, it is doing the opposite.  In Galway city, a successful \"cash for cans\" scheme has been operating for a number of years.  People bring back aluminium cans and get a small amount in return.  The scheme has been suspended and one of the reasons is that the council believes the polluter should pay.  Can the Minister believe this inverted logic?  We have people willingly going forward to the council after picking up the aluminium cans but it has suspended the scheme.  While that is small and parochial on one level, it illustrates the doublethink of the Government.<\/p> <p> I will conclude in regard to carbon tax, which is divisive.  The Government is going to divide people, which is unnecessary because the people are united in their demand that we do something about climate change at national level and then work down.  We have to show the way in this D&aacute;il and through the Government.  By zoning in on a carbon tax for those who can least afford to pay, the Government is in danger of repeating the debacle of the water charges.  I ask the Government to learn from that.  We have no time left.  We need to take serious, urgent action on so many aspects together.  Let us agree on what we can agree on and take action, and not divide and conquer. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900048#AAA00200","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557417600,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I would like to move the Green Party amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900049#BBB00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1557417600,"counter":448,"content":"<p>We will deal with that later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900049#BBB00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1557417600,"counter":449,"content":"<p>There are other amendments and we would like to support their provisions.<\/p><p>The idea of identifying a climate crisis is correct, but we should also recognise the biodiversity breakdown.  The two are inextricably connected.  We support the suggestion of using the Citizens' Assembly as a mechanism to address the biodiversity crisis.  We look forward to discussing the amendments with parties in advance of any vote.<\/p> <p> Our own amendment is not intended to divide.  I know there are different views on carbon tax.  We did not bring it into this process; it came from the environmental community, environmental NGOs and the Climate Change Advisory Council, with which we engaged in our committee work.  We know it is a divisive issue.  We have sought to look at ways to introduce it which are socially progressive, demonstrably benefit those on lower incomes and protect people from fuel poverty.  Our work in that regard is not finished.  The report outlines that all parties are engaged in a further process.  Before deciding on anything we are going to look at how it could be done in a way that signals the real cost of carbon while protecting those on lower incomes.  That is not finished.<\/p> <p> There are other aspects of the report which I think should be different.  There is a glaring contrast between what we say about taking climate change seriously and a transport policy that is heading in the other direction.  With our amendment we wanted to reflect what is happening in the UK Parliament, Wicklow County Council and other councils across the world, heed the words of Ms Greta Thunberg and recognise that we are in a climate crisis and an ecological breakdown crisis.  We are not facing climate change but rather climate breakdown.  We want to recognise that and our amendment sets that out.<\/p> <p> In declaring such a crisis, we know that for the Oireachtas merely to \"note\" our report is political speak for not doing anything about it.  We want to go further by accepting and endorsing the report.  The work is not complete.  The key project will be the Government's national energy and climate action plan.  Our report will hopefully be a very useful pointer for that.  Accepting and endorsing the report allows this House to tell the Government to be far more ambitious and to recognise that this is a crisis and everything has to change.  I hope that other parties will see it in that light, not as a divisive mechanism but a reality which we must recognise and which requires a range of actions now.<\/p> <p> This Oireachtas, the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, has done some useful work in this report.  It is important that we acknowledge, accept and endorse it.  The process has been a proper one.  Setting up the Citizens' Assembly to look at the climate issue was a Green Party initiative.  That has served our country well by convening a representative sample of citizens, presenting the evidence and receiving their collective wisdom on what we need to do.  Interestingly, that is one of the first asks of the Extinction Rebellion movement.  That movement calls for a similar citizens' assembly.  We should say to them that they must go further than that, as we have done.  A citizens' assembly should be connected to the political system and the democratic institutions of the State in order to turn its recommendations into reality.  That is what we have done in this report.<\/p> <p> There are various aspects of the report which demonstrate why I think we should accept and endorse it.  The first reason, which is not easy to explain and does not necessarily hold the front page, is that we must get our own institutional systems ready to make the change we need.  We need a change in everything: in our land use system, our transport system, our energy system and our industrial system within two or three decades.  We have learned from previous moments of change in this country that we do that best when there is common agreement on our goals and the scale and speed of the change we want to make.  We do best when all the agencies of the State and other non-State agencies work together towards a common goal.  We do best when the effort is outside the short-term switching on and off of the political cycle.  We need the next three, four or five Governments to be determined that this is central to everything they do.  When we work together on that common aim, we as a country can be really effective at making strategic changes.<\/p> <p> I refer to the governance systems we put in place, such as the Oireachtas committee charged with overseeing what happens.  A rule requiring a five-year budgeting process and real checks in the system to make sure that the Government is playing its part in the transition are really significant and important steps.  The provisions for a just transition will be central.  We are completely agreed that this green new deal has to deliver a just transition.  Our own Just Transition (Worker and Community Environmental Rights) Bill 2018 would set up a specialist mediation service to work with Bord na M&oacute;na, workers at Moneypoint power station, the agricultural industry and local communities in places like Leitrim and Roscommon, where issues like new afforestation are causing real anger.  That mediation service and the just transition system we recommend in this report are critical.  These are institutional measures, but sometimes how the institutions of the State work is important.  This report broadly gets it right.<\/p> <p> The second really significant initiative in this report goes against the advice of Teagasc.  It goes against what the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, and his Department say they want to do.  We must insist on a new national land use plan.  This land use plan is critical to protecting our biodiversity and restoring nature.  We must start by looking at how we can reverse the tide and bring back pristine water conditions to help us develop soil health, which will bring back insect and bird life.  We must completely, fundamentally and radically change our entire agricultural system, which is not serving Irish farmers at the present time.  We must create a whole new model of forestry so that we create forests that store water and carbon and create a local environment that is a joy to walk through.  It will take 50 or 100 years but that is what we must set out in a national land use plan.  We must restore our peatlands, rather than scraping out the last bit of them and exporting it to the UK or burning it in a power station, which is the last thing we should do.<\/p> <p> In a climate emergency we should be adopting the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018, which Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has brought before us.  We cannot declare a climate emergency and then say in the next breath that we are going to allow offshore oil and gas exploration.  We cannot declare a climate emergency and say in the next breath that we are going to bring in liquid natural gas, LNG, or fracked gas from the USA.  We have to make fundamental and radical changes and we can do that as a country.  We can power this country with renewable wind, solar, biomass and other local power sources.  They will strengthen our country and bring wealth and prosperity to it in the future.  This change will not come if we try to hold out against the divestment from fossil fuels that we need to make.<\/p> <p> More than anything else we need change in the transport sector.  We cannot continue with the current national development plan.  It is not fit for purpose.  It only delivers a third of the emission reductions we know we need to make in the next decade alone.  We cannot continue with a situation in which 51 national road and motorway projects are being built or are about to be built while not a single public transport project is ready to go.  We should accept and endorse this report because it puts the move towards active travel first and foremost as a way as improving health and air quality as well as tackling climate change.  We need to tackle the core underlying problems with our current economic model and move to a circular economy.  That should involve immediately adopting the Waste Reduction Bill 2017, which we have been fighting to pass for the last three years, against the intentions of this Government.  That all needs to change.<\/p> <p> We can bring about change in a political environment in which we work together.  This report, the work we have done and the work we are going to do by the end of this year is of critical importance.  In my mind it is the most important thing this Oireachtas is doing.  Ultimately I believe the Irish people are ready to make the leap.  The Irish people are going to be good at showing leadership on this transition.  We will play our part.  We need the Government to help but it must also start from the bottom up.  Local communities must be asked for their help rather than being told what to do.  There must be genuine open dialogue as to what the options are in every local area.  We in the political system all know that the Irish people are ready to do this.  There has been a sea change in the last six months.  Let us give the people a signal and a sense of hope.  Yes, there is a climate emergency, but by accepting and endorsing this report we are ready to make a leap.  This country will be a leader if we start the work together today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900049#BBB00400","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557418800,"counter":451,"content":"<p>As a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, I am very pleased to contribute to the debate.  In particular, I thank my colleague Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, my Fine Gael colleagues and all members of the committee for the fantastic work they did.  We worked incredibly diligently since last July.  Although we did not see eye to eye on many things, in general we did.  For many who came to the committee with a particular viewpoint, its deliberations were an eye-opener.  It was a fantastic exercise in democracy.  I praise the establishment of the committee by the Taoiseach and the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, for asking the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly to examine how Ireland could become a leader in climate action.  That was tremendously important and timely.  I commend them on their actions.  I had advocated for the establishment of the Citizens' Assembly and the work it did, as well as the establishment of the committee and its work.  I was delighted that happened.<\/p>  <p>  It has become clear to us all that political leadership is required for long-term climate action planning.  I look forward to the report on the publication of the climate plan by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, who is working incredibly hard on it.  It is not just a question of leadership from the Minister or Government politicians, leadership is required across the political spectrum.  The work we must do as a D&aacute;il and society means that the actions we must take should not become a political football.  That is most important.  I have always advocated for a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach and that we should be united in our efforts because we are the transition generation.  The next 12 years will be critical, but they will not be easy.  The changes in the way we live our lives will be significant.  There will be social, economic and cultural impacts.  Therefore, we must encourage people in local communities and economies to ensure we can achieve that but also to ensure rural regeneration will be at the heart of everything that we do.  As an island nation, it is in our national interest to demand that higher emitting nations take action.  If sea levels rise, as predicted, around the coast, this single island of ours will be a collection of islands within a couple of generations.  The extensive diaspora should be tapped into to carry the message of mitigation and adaptation in order that they can also adjust their lifestyles and influence their communities.<\/p>  <p>  We talked a lot at the committee about a just transition being a significant part of how decarbonisation would be achieved.  In my county of Offaly Bord na Mona was for many decades a significant employer, with the ESB.  Bord na Mona made significant decisions on restructuring as a result of the lack of demand for the peat it produced as the ESB no longer required it.  In County Offaly, in particular, it is a very difficult time for workers, communities and the company as we are impacted on the most.  We had employment for generations when in other counties people had to leave these shores and emigrate.  Offaly County Council has led the way in the establishment of a transition team.  It has pulled stakeholders together.  Next week a job matching fair will be held in Mount Lucas in Daingean.  It will be a great opportunity for workers and potential employers to connect.  There is potential in other areas to follow the lead of the Offaly County Council.  There is also potential in upskilling the Bord na Mona workers.  It has been made clear to us that it will be very difficult to do what we need to do if people do not have the necessary skills.<\/p>  <p>  Communication is an enormous requirement in getting the message out about the changes we have to make.  Last week I was delighted to attend the Public Participation Network's launch of Green Offaly in Lough Boora Discovery Park.  The plan is to work with communities to help them to take ownerships of the actions they will take.  I am pleased to note that RT&Eacute; and Met &Eacute;ireann appear to have taken the opportunity to provide accurate information and help to communicate the message of climate change to the people.  That is something for which I have long advocated.  Since the establishment of the committee, there seems to be much greater and more detailed coverage, on which I commend them.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to refer to agriculture.  We are an agricultural nation.  I am very pleased that as a result of the committee&rsquo;s report, the demonisation of farmers has been somewhat reduced.  Mrs. Justice Laffoy was very clear at the first meeting that she would have liked to have had more time to look at the impact of agriculture in terms of emissions.  She recommended that we do something in the area, which we did.  In my community farmers are not averse to change.  They are quite willing to change, but fairness must be part of it.  The new CAP will have an impact in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  We must not forget the impact climate change is having on people in the developing world and how they are already feeling the impact in desertification and lands being under water, which have resulted in migration.  Today we had a debate in the Seanad Chamber involving young researchers who are passionate about climate change.  We have all of the evidence.  We know what is happening and cannot deny it.  We have heard enough words; it is the time for action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900051#DDD00100","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1557418800,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I welcome the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action which is before us.  My colleague Deputy Eamon Ryan played a vital role in pressing for the committee to be set up, just as we pushed for climate issues to be included in the work of the Citizens' Assembly.  I commend all those who worked on the report - Deputies, Senators, committee staff, researchers, academics, activists and everyone who contributed and presented to create a very important document.  It is the beginning of a real roadmap towards a greener, safer and secure future for all of us.  The cross-party report is not perfect, but it is an important first step.  It is vital that we in this House go further than just noting its contents, as usually happens with committee reports brought before the House.  As we all know, noting their contents means condemning them to gather dust on a shelf in the ministerial corridor.  That cannot happen with this report.  This D&aacute;il has noted too many committee reports without the Government taking step to put their recommendations into force.  We cannot afford for this report to be treated in the same way.  That is why we have submitted an amendment to have it endorsed by the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  The committee was created as a process for parties and Independents to come together, tease out the issues, have the important discussions and come to a collective conclusion.  Compromises were made, as they have to be, when we all commit to working together.  Not everything the Green Party sought to have included in the report made it into the final draft.  We all have to make compromises because if we did not, nothing would ever be done.  In a cross-party process such a this no one gets everything he or she wants.  It is vital that we do not fixate on individual issues but instead come together, unite on the issue of our time, namely, saving the planet and creating a sustainable future, to which we say \"Yes\".<\/p>  <p>  We have an opportunity to commit to doing something real and tangible because this issue is too important for us to do anything less.  The report is a roadmap for action.  Let us endorse it.  The financial, social and ecological cost of climate inaction presents too great a risk.  We need action now.  The scale of the change we must make cannot happen without the political will to make radical, systemic changes in how we structure our world.  Individual citizens have a crucial role to play, but it must be a Government-led approach, with the biggest polluters being made to change their ways.<\/p>  <p>  Hope is coming from those who will suffer the most from climate change.  Young people have been taking to the streets and calling for climate action.  Every Friday students have gathered outside Leinster House to protest at the Government's climate inaction.  Young people realise they will be the ones most affected by the short-sightedness of the Government today.  However, they do not yet have an electoral voice.<\/p><p>I have three children, aged 12, ten and eight, who are already looking forward to being able to go to the ballot box because their future, like that of all other children, is at risk.  As they watch this debate tonight they, like many other young leaders of this country, will be disappointed that nine of 158 Members saw fit to find time to debate this issue.  Where are the Members who profess to care about climate change?  I hope that the children and others participating in the climate strike on 24 May will loudly and clearly ask where those Members were when this report, one of the most important to come out of the 32nd D&aacute;il, was debated. <\/p> <p> We cannot tackle climate change and continue to explore and drill for oil and gas or continue with a national development plan that prioritises road expenditure over public transport, walking and cycling.  As my Green Party colleague in the UK, Caroline Lucas, stated, \"we cannot tackle climate change with an economy built on the assumption that precious minerals, fresh air, clean water and rare species can magically regenerate themselves in an instant\".<\/p> <p> In the past 18 months there has been a blizzard, a hurricane and a prolonged summer drought in Ireland.  News items in February showed people wearing shorts and queues for 99s.  That is not right.  It is climate chaos and meltdown.  It is a climate emergency.  Temperatures are rising, our global and local ecosystems and habitats are being pushed to the limit and our seasons are being knocked utterly out of kilter.  This has terrifying implications for our natural heritage, insects and future food security.  That is why it is vitally important that this House declares a climate emergency.  We call on all Members to support the Green Party's amendment to the motion which proposes to do just that.<\/p> <p> It is also essential that in declaring a climate emergency we commit to concrete, real and identifiable action rather than just uniting around vague concepts.  There is little value in all declaring a climate emergency without committing to doing anything about it, which is why we must endorse the report of the committee.  There is no room for complacency, populism or green washing in the greatest challenge facing humanity.<\/p> <p> Greta Thunberg, the inspiring young climate activist, stated that \"Our house is on fire.\"  When one's house is on fire, one does not extinguish part of the fire, one extinguishes all of it and ensures that one is safe.  That is why we need to endorse all the recommendations of the report and ensure they are implemented and then go further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900051#DDD00200","speaker":"1242","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557419400,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank all Members who spoke on the motion.  This is a very important debate.  There is a great deal of consensus, notwithstanding very sharp differences on some issues.  I am reminded of the late Brian Lenihan, who memorably stated that the only fair tax was the one that he did not have to pay.  In introducing the concept of carbon pricing, there is a danger that people will want something for which someone else will pay or should be shouldering the burden, rather than the group for which they speak.  The sad reality is that no one can afford to say that these changes should be borne by someone else and not by them.  Everyone must make these changes.  That is a difficulty in dealing with this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Each household will have to change how it manages energy in the home in order to move away from fossil fuels.  For many homes, that process will be neither quick nor easy.  Each of us will have to think about how we manage our resources and our approach to disposables which have become commonplace in terms of plastic, food and many other items.  We must change our approach on such matters and that will not come easily to people.  We must change the way we manage our travel: the amount of travelling we do, the mode of transport we use and the types of fuels we use.  That will be a profound change involving an increase in the cost of travel and for some people it will come very hard.  We will have to change how we run our farms.  Many farmers have been farming in the same way for decades and it will be difficult for them to make the necessary changes.  We will have to change how we run our businesses.  We must accept that there will be more wind farms and more associated interconnectors and infrastructure being built in or close to people's backyards.  None of those things will come easy.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious that as well as declaring that this is crucially important and urgent, we are asking people to make profound and difficult changes to the way they live.  That is not easy and it cannot be solved in Kildare Street.  Rather, it will be solved in every home, village, community, business and farm in the country.  We must find a way to bring those people into that engagement and help them to make the necessary changes.<\/p>  <p>  It will not be possible for the taxpayer to pay for everything.  It is not a question of the Government opening the purse and everything suddenly being possible.  We will have to continue to fund our health and education services and all of the very heavy priorities that fall to the Government and the House to find the resources to fund.  That is why our advisers such as the members of the Climate Change Advisory Council, who know this issue intimately, have put forward carbon pricing as one of the measures we must consider.  As some Members may be aware, I trained as an economist.  One of the first lessons an economist learns is that much of what we do has an adverse impact on people, but for which we do not pay.  Carbon emissions are the worst case of that - we simply have not been paying for the damage we have done.  There are many other examples, as Members have pointed out, such as the headlong rush to flatten our hedgerows and create big open tracts to plough and so on, which has done significant damage about which no one thought at the time and for which no one has paid.<\/p>  <p>  We are asking people to make big changes.  The easy part is for the Members who are present to say we endorse these things and that this is an emergency.  It is correct to do so, but the hard part will be for all sides of the political community to find a way to bring people to make those changes in order to protect the globe for which we all have a shared responsibility.  We will have to find a way to work through our ideological differences.  We do so every day in the House - we reach compromises, vote and debate.  We accept some things and are disappointed that other things are not accepted.  That is what we will have to do on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  This is the start of a very important process.  I hope to be able to inject additional momentum to that generated by Deputy Naughton, the committee, the Citizens' Assembly and all involved, and that, year by year, we will be able to show that we are winning this battle.  The early wins we get will encourage people to come further down the road, take the issue more seriously and get engaged on it.  What very much inspires me is that at the end of this process we will have a better country in which to live and a healthier relationship with one another, our environment and those who share the globe with us.  That is a prize that is well worth the effort we will undertake.  We will continue to have our differences in this Chamber.  There is no doubt that I will be criticised for whatever I do or fail to do, and that is as it should be.<\/p><p>Hopefully, we can conduct the political debate in which we must engage through the common ground that has been created by the committee and our willingness to sit in the same forum, discuss this and try to reach compromise solutions in respect of the difficult challenges ahead, and continue to move in that spirit.<\/p> <p> I thank everybody who has been involved in this.  They come from different backgrounds but they still stuck with it.  Some felt the need to write minority reports, but they persevered and fully engaged.  Deputy Hildegarde Naughton had the challenge of keeping that together and getting something valuable at the end.  I am grateful for the opportunity to conclude the debate and I look forward to returning to the House in the not-too-distant future with solid proposals that will advance the cause set out here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019050900052#EEE00200","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557420000,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557420000,"counter":457,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the motion, as amended, be agreed to.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1557420000,"counter":458,"content":"<p>It is unfortunate that some of the Members who tabled amendments are not present.
