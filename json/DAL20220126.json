The crisis is getting worse.  The most recent estimates state that only 750 dentists remain in the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS.  That is less than half the number in the scheme prior to Covid-19.  Covid-19 is not the reason these dentists have exited the scheme, which covers medical card clients.  Covid-19 has exacerbated this crisis, as has been the case in many areas.  We are now left with a situation whereby those most vulnerable in society, who have the least discretionary funding or zero discretionary funding, are forced into a position where they must pay out of pocket for emergency dental procedures.  Anyone in this Chamber, in this building or in this country who has had a toothache knows how painful it is.  To have that and be unable to get treatment, to have to pay out of pocket, get loans from family to get dental extractions, is untenable and is something we cannot stand over.  <\/p>  <p>  It is more complex than that.  I have an email from Lauren who writes on behalf of her brother, Philip, who has Down's syndrome.  Philip, along with many others who have disabilities in Ireland, has major dental issues.  He has no adult teeth and it is, therefore, crucial to maintain the teeth he has now.  This is made more difficult due to frequent antibiotic use.  The family has been informed by the HSE that dental care has ceased for individuals aged over 18 with intellectual disabilities.  It has pulled funding from dentists who specialise in dentistry for people with additional needs.  Given the ongoing medical card crisis, the family cannot access a dentist or a hygienist.  That is just one example of the pain that a family goes through trying to access basic dental care for someone who needs it.  <\/p>  <p>  I have referred to the lack of access to dentists and the number of dentists who have exited the scheme.  A woman in Swords advises that nobody is taking on medical card holders in the town at the moment.  A woman in Swords contacted me.  She is a wheelchair user.  Her ability to navigate Swords is difficult, never mind having to get out to try to find a new dentist and get the much-needed care she needs.  Today the Labour Party has tabled a motion on the cost of living.  This is one of the many additional emergency much-needed costs that cannot be put off.  Oral health is linked to good physical health.  People cannot put off the care they require and they have to get loans from family for this.  There is a crisis in north County Dublin and all over the country.  The representative body for dentists has been seeking a meeting with the Department to discuss the DTSS, how it can be reformed and how we can get dentists back into it.  This has reached crisis levels.  Will the Minister of State give an update as to how she is going to resolve this and where we are in discussions with the industry?  When will we be in a position where the most vulnerable in society are able to get quick access to dental treatment when they need it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600003#A00400","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1643188320,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  There is nobody in this Chamber who has not been contacted in our constituency offices on this issue.  I am taking this debate on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  The Minister is acutely aware that access to dental services for medical card holders under the DTSS has become an ever-increasing problem during the pandemic.  The problem is that a significant number of dentists who were contracted by the HSE to treat medical card patients have chosen to leave the scheme, which has led to difficulties for medical card patients in accessing dental care.  Some parts of the country have been particularly affected, an issue which is of particular concern to the Minister.  The latest figures we have from the HSE suggest that 1,150 dentists are contracted to the HSE to treat medical card patients, which is approximately 300 down on the figure before the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the reasons given by dentists for leaving the scheme are numerous, including issues around the sustainability of the scheme and the need to align it with best international practice.  The Minister has listened to the concerns raised by the dentists directly, and to the Irish Dental Association, and has heard their frustrations with the scheme.  They are firmly of the view that the range of services available to patients under the scheme and the fees payable to contracted dentists are out of kilter with today's environment.  The Minister is keen that all of these issues are addressed as a matter of urgency.  He fully accepts that there is a need to align the scheme with best international evidence and practice, as outlined in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the current national oral health policy that was published in 2019.  Regrettably the Covid-19 pandemic caused the roll-out of the policy to be delayed and the proposed review of the scheme to be deferred.  However, the Minister has given a commitment that there will be a root-and-branch review of the scheme, and his officials and the HSE expect to be in a position to begin that work by the second quarter of this year.  In the meantime, he his seeking that the contracted dentists, and their representative association, the Irish Dental Association, work with him and his officials to address the immediate issues of concern and to ensure that we have a sufficient number of dentists available to provide services to medical card patients.<\/p> <p>The Minister has also heard what the dentists have had to say about the viability of the scheme and he wants that addressed as well.  The Minister secured an additional &euro;10 million in budget 2022 to address this very problem.  He hopes that agreement can be reached very quickly on how the money can be used to address some of the immediate problems with the scheme, pending the full root-and-branch review.<\/p> <p> Officials from the Department and the HSE last met with the Irish Dental Association on 17 December.  Certain proposals were put to the association and the responses to those proposals are now being actively considered by the Department and the HSE.  The Minister hopes that through dialogue some interim solutions can be found as quickly as possible, for the benefit of patients and the dental community.  As the Deputy quite rightly said, anyone who has ever experienced a toothache knows they cannot hang around.<\/p> <p> In the meantime, officials are engaging with the HSE public dental service, the in-house salaried service, which is seeking to provide cover for any medical card patients who are experiencing problems in accessing a service from their local dentist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600003#A00500","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643188920,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The situation is very complex.  Another area of delay is the assessment of primary school children.  I was very privileged to benefit from being screened in primary school, in fourth or fifth class, and being taken into what was the Eastern Health Board system at the time.  Through my teenage years, right up to the week before my leaving certificate, I had everything from crowns to braces all done through the State.  I was discharged a week before my leaving certificate and I will never forget it, having been captured in the fourth or fifth class.  We need to get back to that quickly.<\/p>  <p>  I am encouraged a meeting took place on 17 December, but my understanding from that meeting is that the Department is looking at quarter 2 of 2022 to move this process forward.  That is too late.  We cannot be discussing this in terms of quarters; we need to be discussing it in terms of weeks.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a breakdown of trust between the dentistry world and the Department.  That has to be repaired.  I would ask, and I would like to put it on record, that there would be an independent chair of the discussions between the Irish Dental Association, the Government and the Department on this.  That is what is happening with the consultants at the moment.  That is what happened previously when the dentists had negotiations with the Government.  That should happen again to rebuild trust and get to where we need to be.  As I said, we must ensure those who are most vulnerable and those who need it the most get dental care.  We must ensure that those children who need screening as early as possible in primary school get it in fourth class instead of hoping to get it in sixth class, if, indeed, they get it at all.  This will be based on successful negotiations done quickly and which will bring about a resolution.

That is not to say that officials have not been engaging with the dental profession.  There has been engagement between HSE officials and the dental community throughout the pandemic on infection control measures and guidelines for safe dental practice, with a view to ensuring that a safe, satisfactory service could be continued for medical card holders.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Minister acknowledges that there is an urgent need to address the fundamental issue of access to dental care.  To achieve this objective, the Minister and officials wish to work in collaboration with the Irish Dental Association to address problems around access to services and to make the scheme more viable for contracting private dentists.  <\/p>  <p>  The &euro;10 million the Minister has secured for this purpose represents an increase of nearly 20% on the existing budget.  The Minister wants that funding invested as soon as possible, to make the scheme more attractive for practising dentists and thereby ensuring that a sufficient number of contractors will be prepared to continue to treat medical card patients.  As I said, talks between the Department and the HSE with the Irish Dental Association are under way and there is hope a satisfactory conclusion can be reached by all concerns.<\/p>  <p>  I will bring what the Deputy said back to the Minister because it is a very pressing issue and I agree with him on quarter 2.

I appreciate her taking the time.  The history here is that before our more modern bus services in our urban centres, including in Waterford city, in towns like Sligo, we had an imp bus service, which comprised small buses that covered all the areas.  We were lucky to have had this in Sligo and it gave quite a full service to the people in urban areas.  Unfortunately, with its abolition and replacement with a more modern service, it left several gaps, in particular, the whole west area of Sligo town.  One particular group, the Merville Maugheraboy active retirement association, spearheaded the search for a replacement service and it was joined by all the councillors on Sligo County Council and the four the Deputies.  An approach was made to the National Transport Authority, NTA, and meetings were held directly with the councillors of Sligo County Council and, indeed, the four Deputies.  I must praise the NTA because it designed an appropriate route, which it proposes to call the S3 and which will provide adequate services for part of the urban area in which many elderly people, people without the benefit of a car, people without the resources to access other forms of public transport, such as taxis, and people who may need access to hospitals, to the Institute of Technology Sligo, soon to be a technological university, and to St. Angela's College, live.  For that reason, it has designed an appropriate service for us, the S3.<\/p>  <p>  It is about a year or so since we pulled this plan together and, again, I praise the NTA.  However, what is missing is the funding to facilitate it.  It is not a huge amount of money; presumably, we are talking about a bus and a number of drivers and whatever support staff are needed to run this service.  This Government and, in particular, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the Green Party, are very much focused on the promotion of sustainable transport methods.  The rising cost of fuel and other items have been highlighted in other debates here and show that we need to prioritise the provision of such schemes.<\/p>  <p>  This is far from a metro north, an extension to the DART or the procurement of 600 new rail carriages.  We are not reinventing the wheel.  What I would love to hear from the Minister of State, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is that the cheque is on its way to Ms Graham in the NTA and that the new bus will commence on particular date.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600004#B00400","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1643188920,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this topic, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  From the outset, I would like to note that the Department of Transport has responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.  However, it is not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services.  It is the NTA, as the Deputy knows, that has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators.<\/p>  <p>  That being said, in budget 2022, the Department of Transport secured &euro;538 million of funding for public service obligation and LocalLink services provided by State operators and under contract by the NTA this year.  This includes more than &euro;200 million of Covid-19 emergency funding in 2022 to counter the continuing impacts of the pandemic on fare revenue across transport operators.<\/p>  <p>  Out of this significant budget for public transport services, the Department of Transport has allocated &euro;5.6 million of funding to the NTA to begin investing in the new Connecting Ireland plan.  This plan is designed to increase travel connectivity across rural Ireland with the aim to provide better connections between villages and towns by linking these with an enhanced public transport network, which also connects to cities and regional centres nationwide.  <\/p>  <p>  Connecting Ireland will significantly increase both the number of routes and the frequency of existing services across the country, including in Sligo.  As a result of Connecting Ireland, hundreds of rural villages and areas will, for the first time, be served by a viable public transport link.  It is proposed that there will be an overall increase of approximately 25% in rural bus service as part of a five-year plan to enhance existing services, adding new bus routes and new services, in addition to expanding the demand responsive local bus network.<\/p> <p>Accordingly, it will build on both the TFI Local Link network and on the rural regular public transport network.<\/p> <p> The Department also secured almost &euro;1 million for the development and implementation of new town bus services in 2022, as well as allocating &euro;25 million to the introduction of a young adult card.  This card will enable any person aged between 19 and 23 years old to avail of an average fare discount of 50% across all public transport services, including city, intercity and rural services.  This will benefit many young people living in the west.<\/p> <p> As the Deputy will be aware, the NTA is actively engaging with Sligo County Council officials on the development of proposals and the assessment of options to build on the success of the existing Sligo town bus service.  This process includes an examination of possibilities to improve the current S1 route to ensure full co-ordination between bus services and between bus and rail services at the Sligo bus and train stations in light of the fact that the existing S1 service does not currently serve these stations.  The NTA has advised that the close proximity of the bus and train stations presents an opportunity to integrate the existing Sligo town bus service with regional and national bus and rail services.  Aligning services is fundamental to the goal of connecting people across Ireland in an accessible and sustainable manner.<\/p> <p> The service planning section of the NTA has been reviewing the efficacy of the town bus service in Sligo.  It has identified demands for transport within the town of Sligo and concluded that there could be unmet public transport demand between Finisklin Business Park, Maugheraboy, Sligo bus and train stations, Sligo town centre and Manorhamilton Road.  The NTA is currently finalising plans and drawing up a detailed service specification for a new S3 route which would serve Finisklin Business Park, Maugheraboy, Sligo bus and train station, Sligo town centre and Manorhamilton Road.  The NTA is currently engaged with stakeholders to identify suitable bus stop locations.

I ask her to urge the Minister to tell the NTA to refocus its efforts in terms of timing and facilitation.  The Minister of State seemed to indicate that money was made available in budget 2022 for the funding of the S3 and routes like it throughout the country.  The people of the areas the Minister of State highlighted, from Finisklin Business Park through Maugheraboy and the other areas of the town currently not served, are well overdue to be catered for.  It was my understanding that the bus stop locations were already determined and secured and that all that was needed at this point was pounds, shillings and pence to engage in the procurement of a bus, the recruitment of additional drivers if necessary and the commencement of the service.

Those who were not working would not have had any income.  Our people in the USA are hard working.  They contribute to society and have made their lives over there.

The key priorities and objectives for this unique relationship are set out in the Government's United States and Canada Strategy 2019-2025.  The actions are categorised around the five pillars that underpin Ireland's overall foreign policy, namely our people, our values, our place in Europe, our prosperity and our influence.<\/p>  <p>  The strengthening of our bilateral political relations with the USA is of critical importance to this State.  We have a broad range of priorities in our relations with the USA, including high level political engagement, in particular in support of the peace process in Northern Ireland; the promotion of trade, investment and job creation; and support for our citizens and the broader Irish-American diaspora.<\/p>  <p>  There is ongoing advocacy and engagement at every level with the US Administration and political leaders across the USA.  Our Embassy in Washington DC takes a leading role in advocating for the most important and critical issues facing our country and our citizens, including the undocumented Irish who are seeking to regularise their status.<\/p>  <p>  The scope for high-level meetings at senior political level has been limited due to the impact of Covid.  The return this year of high-level visits will strengthen our ability to maintain and further develop the strong political relationships, particularly as we mitigate the impact of Brexit on this island.  It will also allow us to continue our work to build new networks across the US, including engaging with a new generation of political leaders in the US at the federal and state level.<\/p> <p>Ireland works closely with the United States to support and defend the mutual benefits of a stable, open and ambitious economic relationship.  This relationship underpins an environment that supports the provision of more than 110,000 direct jobs by Irish companies across all 50 US states, mirrored by more than 800 US companies operating in Ireland, employing 180,000 in this State.  That is up from 100,000 a decade ago.  Working closely with our State agencies, in particular Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, we have supported the developed of this highly mutually beneficial economic environment.<\/p> <p> The strength of the bilateral relationship is largely rooted in the many links between Irish and American people.  Irish America is of enormous importance to Ireland, including those who are Irish-born, those who claim Irish ancestry and those with a strong affinity for Ireland.  Our Government launched a new diaspora strategy in 2020, which includes a focus on engaging with the new generation of Irish diaspora in the US and strengthening our co-operation and support of Irish citizens and Irish-Americans in the US.  Through our embassy in Washington DC, as well as across our seven consulates general across the US, we work closely with Irish community organisations in support of the needs of Irish citizens.  In response to the pandemic, a dedicated Covid-19 response fund for Irish communities abroad was set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable.  In 2021, over &euro;4.22 million was provided to diaspora organisations in the US.<\/p> <p> The influence of Ireland in the US, through our history and culture, is remarkable.  Under our current strategy, we have worked closely with Culture Ireland to streamline the long-standing and deep cultural links between our two countries, as evidenced by the appointment of dedicated cultural officers based in our consulates in New York and Los Angeles.  Under the US-Canada strategy, we have reinforced our network of diplomatic missions across the US, including opening a new consulate general in Los Angeles in 2018 and the opening in summer 2022 of a new consulate general in Miami.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600005#C00600","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643190120,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her answer.  She stated that the influence of Ireland in the United States is remarkable.  However, that influence does not seem to be used as best we can.  That is the way Irish people overseas look at it.  I know Covid has had a serious impact on the last two years but we need to get these talks with the American Administration up and running, especially about the undocumented.  Some have been there for 20 or 30 years and have not been able to come home to their family members.  That is not fair.  Even the former Fine Gael Deputy, John Deasy, says the Government is not doing enough, which is a damning indictment of this Government.<\/p>  <p>  We will never have a better chance to make progress on Irish issues, especially the undocumented, than now, with an Irish-American President and Democrats controlling the Senate and the House of Representatives.  We need to do more to help.  We cannot just talk about it.  President Biden's proposed US Citizenship Act of 2021 shows that immigration issues are a key priority for his Administration.  The Irish Government must keep raising this at every opportunity and explore all available options.<\/p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to thank the people and organisations that help the Irish diaspora.  Organisations like the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust are there to help bereaved families in tragic circumstances, the GAA helps Irish people all over the world, and Irish people abroad themselves are great when fundraisers are being run or if anything is needed when people are in trouble.

I doubt it will be me going with the bowl of shamrock.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has established Ireland houses in New York, Austin and San Francisco to allow for an impressive Team Ireland footprint.  Several Irish State agencies, together with a consulate, can work together to maximise impact in a particular location.  Plans are under way to open more Ireland houses in other US locations.  The Deputy referred to the former Deputy, John Deasy, a colleague of mine from Waterford.  I did not see the article but in fairness the last two years have been very challenging with Covid.  America has had serious issues with Covid, as have we.  Another Waterford man, Dan Mulhall, is the Irish ambassador to America.  He is doing Trojan work and promotes Ireland constantly.  Even just on his Twitter feed, he is constantly advocating for the Irish in America every single day.<\/p>  <p>  Our embassy in Washington DC is actively engaged across the political spectrum in the US, meeting regularly with Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate on a bipartisan basis.  The efforts of the embassy have been instrumental in ensuring consistent priority and support at the highest political level to protect peace on the island.  The embassy also continues to work towards finding innovative solutions and immigration pathways to address the challenges faced by the undocumented Irish in the US.  We have maintained strong relations with the US at every level over the past two challenging years.  We must continue to prioritise our strong transatlantic connections, be they in business, academia, tourism or in maintaining family connections, as we emerge from the impact of the pandemic.  I take the Deputy's point that this is a great opportunity as we move out of Covid and we will be able to continue those visits to America to support the undocumented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600006#D00300","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1643190120,"counter":26,"content":"<p>These issues have been going on much longer than two years and they have not been addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600006#D00400","speaker":"1506"},{"type":"speech","time":1643190120,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600006#D00500","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","time":1643190120,"counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600006#D00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1643190120,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I am passionate about special needs education and the critical role special needs assistants, SNAs, play in the system.  I am grateful for the Minister of State's presence.  I will outline some of the duties special needs assistants fulfil in our schools, although it is not an exhaustive list.  In mainstream schools, they monitor the children in the yard daily to make sure they are included in play with other children.  They also assist children with differentiated work in the classroom.  It is usually on the same topic as the rest of the children but adjusted to suit the needs and abilities of the child.  They help children to take down and correct homework, set up assistive technology equipment such as visualisers, tablets and so on and help them use this equipment if they are unable to do so themselves.  They bring children for movement breaks if they appear to be getting overwhelmed, use calming techniques if a child has emotional or behavioural difficulties, and they may remove them to a sensory room or garden if one is available in the school.<\/p><p>SNAs communicate using L&aacute;mh sign language when necessary.  They help children to develop their life skills, such as shopping, preparing healthy food and practising good hygiene and help them participate in social programmes like Friends for Life.  They are there before school and at dispersal at the end of the day, and in some cases where the child might be a flight risk, they take extra precautions with that child.  SNAs accompany children with additional educational needs on school tours or any time they are out of school grounds.  They also participate in the preparation of religious events with additional needs children if they are required to do so in particular schools.  There is also a range of other responsibilities they are given, some of which could be considered inappropriate to their status and role.  SNAs in some schools are very willing to assist and in some cases can offer to do these things but there is a lack of definition and delineation of the roles they fulfil.<\/p><p>With regard to care needs, the Minister of State will be aware that SNAs administer Buccolam if a child has an epileptic seizure, check insulin levels on diabetic children, administer glucose if a child has low blood sugar, assist with PEG feeding, help children access their lunch and make sure they eat properly.  In some cases, SNAs have had to monitor children who are prone to choking.  They accompany special needs children on school tours, as I mentioned.<\/p><p>The education criteria for SNAs is the heart of this matter.  The Department of Education states that an SNA only needs three Ds in the junior certificate, which baffles many parents.  That is three Ds at FETAC level 3.  On <i>educationposts.ie<\/i>, principals advertising for SNA posts are looking for SNAs with qualifications of FETAC levels 5, 6, 7 or sometimes even 8.  Some of the criteria mentioned in these advertisements include the completion of a relevant childcare or SNA course.  Applicants are sometimes asked to provide copies of certificates, diplomas and degrees.  Sometimes they must have a special needs assistant qualification at QQI or FETAC level 5, or equivalent, and some schools require that applicants must be willing to avail of further training and have knowledge of L&aacute;mh and the picture exchange communication system, PECS.  The SNA course in UCD that came to the fore in the last year remains unaccredited for qualifications, which is a bizarre situation given that the SNAs are essentially working for the Department.<\/p> <p>The programme co-ordinator of the UCD SNA course carried out a survey of approximately 500 SNAs who enrolled in the course.  It showed that only 2.1% of those 500 SNAs had stopped their education at junior certificate level.  It also showed that 66% of SNAs have already attained a FETAC level 6 qualification.  The ask from SNAs is that a FETAC level 6 qualification be a requirement for new entrants only and that SNAs with experience should not be expected to return to study.  In general, parents of children with special needs are quite taken aback when they realise the entry qualification levels necessary.<\/p> <p> I will take up the second thread of the matter following the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600006#D00700","speaker":"1572","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643190720,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this Topical Issue matter today, which is relevant at the moment, particularly for my own Ministry for special education.<\/p><p>The role of the SNA is critical.  The Deputy has very eloquently set out the non-exhaustive list of duties they undertake daily.  In my visits to different schools throughout the country, I have met many SNAs.  I have spoken to them first-hand about the work they do.  I know from the families I meet daily - the Deputy also made this point - that the majority of children with additional needs would not be able to exist in a school environment to any proper capacity without an SNA there to support them.  The SNAs facilitate the support of children with additional needs and they minimise disruption in the class for a child and his or her peers in regard to reaching.  They also help to increase the independent living and life skills we want all children with additional needs to endeavour to attain.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that &euro;2.2 billion, which is almost 25% of the entire education budget, is dedicated to special education.  In 2011, we had approximately 10,575 SNAs.  We now have 19,169 SNAs, which is an 81% increase.  There has been a considerable amount of investment made to ensure we have sufficient SNAs for our children with additional needs.  The Deputy correctly pointed out it is not just about having SNAs in place.  It is also about their qualifications and, in particular, their training.  When I took up my role as the first Minister of State with responsibility for special education, I looked at the review carried out by the National Council for Special Education in 2018.  It was very strong on the need for training.  It was on that basis we set up the very first training course for SNAs which, as mentioned by the Deputy, is in UCD.  The course has been completely oversubscribed.  It is <i>gratis<\/i>in the sense there is no cost to the SNA to do the training.  It is very valuable for them.  There are very good modules within that course.<\/p><p>If we are going to be looking at accreditation, we need to look first at the outcomes of that course and to identify what worked and what did not.  We also need to speak to the SNAs.  I note the contents of the survey mentioned by the Deputy.  It is useful for us to be aware of that.  On the qualification, as correctly pointed out by the Deputy, it is FETAC level 3 on the national framework of qualifications or a minimum of three Ds in the junior certificate.  It is important to stress the existing qualification has not taken away from the calibre of SNA we have now.  A number of them will have an additional qualifications on top of what is required of them.  The SNA deployment is carried out by the schools.  There is no longer a requirement for a diagnosis, especially in a mainstream class, to avail of the skills of an SNA.  That was a very important step, particularly when we are talking about children in mainstream classes.  The SNA is, perhaps, even more critical in a special class or special school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600007#E00200","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1643190720,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the response.  It is 43 years since the minimum standard of education was set for the SNA.  In that time, as we know, SNAs have retrained and engaged in continuing professional development.  It is time for the conversation around special needs assistants to be reset.  My own party has a very proud record in this area, having introduced the SNA.  The initial budget was &euro;9 million.  It is now into the billions.<\/p><p>I refer to the very interesting paper by the <i>European Journal of Special Needs Education<\/i>, published in 2020, which looked at learning and support assistants, LSAs, in inclusive education across six countries, including the UK, Austria, Ireland, Bulgaria and Slovakia.  What is very interesting is that it is only in Slovakia that SNAs have to have completed the upper secondary level or possess a bachelor's degree in pedagogy, making Slovakia unique in this regard.  In addition to a lack of qualification requirements in most countries, there are also limited opportunities for professional development.  That is critical.  It is key.  This is a career.  Ireland has a real opportunity to lead a European standard and to raise the standard.<\/p><p>In Slovakia, SNAs are part of the advisory board of the school, which is interesting.  That is not exclusive to Slovakia.  I do not see any role here for SNAs on the boards of management or in the overall administration of our schools.  We are all aware of the range of responsibilities they are given, some of which I excluded in my initial remarks and are entirely inappropriate.  I will not list them.  The SNAs will have spoken to the Minister of State about them.  In the international experience as well as in Ireland, in some schools SNAs collaborate extensively with the school, teachers, management and the board of management, while in other schools they are excluded from a lot of say or participation.  We now have an opportunity to reset the narrative in regard to SNAs, to enable them to progress and develop in their careers, and to acknowledge that many of them are far more qualified than the three Ds that qualify them for the SNA course.  Will the Minister of State provide a timeline for when the reset of this conversation might take place and engagement with SNAs will begin?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600007#E00300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1643190720,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The role of the SNA is pivotal.  I acknowledge that.  As I said, I meet SNAs regularly.  I know the very good work they do.  However, it is important not to put the cart before the horse.  I want first to see the outcomes of the training programme in UCD and to review them because they will dictate in terms of future training and accreditation and in terms of any other steps we need to take to enhance the role of the SNA.  The training and support of SNAs will, in turn, support children with additional needs, which ultimately is what this conversation is about.  Being an SNA is a vocation.  It is not an easy job.  Most of them go above and beyond their remit and they are very much appreciated by their respective schools and boards of management.  They should always be listened to in the context of what works for them and does not work for them.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied we have in place a training programme that is tailored to their respective roles.

The headline rate is now running at 5.5%.  Such a rate has not been seen since Charlie McCreevy was in his pomp.  According to the price comparison website <i>numbeo.com<\/i>, Ireland is the 16th most expensive country in which to live, and this is even before housing costs are factored in.  None of us in this House will need a website to tell us that working people throughout this country are finding it harder and harder over the week to make ends meet.  Our own lived experience and that of the people we represent tells us that ever-rising heating, electricity, transport and food costs are keeping far too many people from their sleep.  &ldquo;Crisis&rdquo; is an all oft-used and much-abused term, especially in this Chamber, but a cost of living crisis is exactly what we are living through, though you would not think so from the Government's lamentable response to date.  This Government just does not get it.  The sheer timidity and lack of imagination in response to the effective slashing of the living standards of hundreds of thousands of families and individuals has left an awful lot to be desired.<\/p><p>We should reflect for a moment on what the soaring cost of living means in real terms for the people in early 2022.  We should look behind the cold data and statistics.  The price of the basic staples, namely, bread, milk and butter is up by 10 to 30 cent since Christmas.  Pasta, which is the basic foodstuff a struggling parent will always rely on to feed the kids, is up 6.4% in a year.  Rents were up 8.3% on an annual basis in the last quarter of 2021, according to the Residential Tenancies Board.  Motorists are having to spend on average an additional &euro;500 per year to keep their car on the road.  On energy costs, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, says consumers were paying 53% more in December 2021 than they were at the same point in the year before.  Conor Pope, writing in Monday&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, was right that when you add up the real impact rising prices are having on everyday essentials, namely, the things we have no choice about buying, a worker on a modest wage would have to earn an extra &euro;4,000 per year before tax to maintain the same standard of living he or she enjoyed in 2020.  I tell the Minister of State that people are in very real trouble and in very real difficulty.  Without a package of meaningful actions, living standards will fall severely this year; make no mistake about it.<\/p><p>John Hume famously said: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t eat a flag&rdquo;.  You cannot eat good GDP numbers either.  It would of course be churlish not to recognise how well our economy is doing as we put - we hope - the darker days of this phase of the pandemic behind us.  However, before we start congratulating ourselves on the performance of the economy, we should ask ourselves a few very basic questions.  What purpose has a burgeoning economy if the fruits of our productivity and of our labour are not deployed to help people when they need it most?  I refer to real help to stop people from falling into fuel poverty, real help to ensure people can make the rent at the end of the month and real action for those who exist on the breadline to further put sufficient food on the table.  People read that we took in more in income tax last year than ever before.  A party like mine, that is dedicated to the principle of work and to the principle of the dignity of work, is of course made very proud of our country by that.  People also read that big corporations that provide good jobs for skilled workers paid a record amount in corporation tax last year.  That is very good too and that is objectively the case.<\/p><p>People have also read we are raking in VAT.  As the Minister of State is at the Department of Finance, he knows well that this State took in &euro;1 billion more than it bargained for in VAT last year.  This is a phenomenal sum and much of that would have come from a windfall from the VAT levied on energy and fuel.  This itself raises big questions for Government.  VAT represents the second largest source of tax revenue for the State.  VAT, as the Minister of State knows only too well, is a tax on consumption.  We all pay it; we do not have a choice.  There is no option but to pay VAT when we buy goods and services.  The point is the impact of VAT hurts some more than it hurts others and it is the least well-off who bear the brunt of the VAT burden when prices go up.  They need help from the Minister of State and the Government to keep the wolf from the door.<\/p><p>To help working people throughout the country through the crisis and to help them make their hard-earned euro stretch a little further, the Government absolutely must look again at the need to reduce the VAT wedge on energy and fuel bills.  We do it in the knowledge there is a layer of complexity involved, but this is eminently doable and a further EU derogation is achievable if the political will exists to do it.  It is a question of political will.  If the Government can achieve this, as we are calling for, we can ensure too the rates do not then go back up to the standard rate of 23%.  I am appealing to the Minister of State not to rule that out.  Our understanding is other EU member states that are led by some of our colleagues in the social democratic movement are currently interrogating this approach.<\/p><p>This ought to be a temporary six-month measure.  It would be time limited and temporary to take us through this emergency period and would be reviewed in October&rsquo;s budget.  I will give a little bit of context.  A six-month drop in VAT on fuel and energy would cost around &euro;200 million.  This is the same amount the Government will shell out on the electricity bill wheeze but with a bigger and more effective impact for those who need help the most, because as I said earlier, VAT hits the poorest the hardest.  The truth is the now &euro;113.50 electricity bill rebate is a bit of a gimmick.  That is all it is.  It was dreamed up on the back of an envelope and we are still waiting to see the legislation to allow it to be introduced.  Too many will get it who evidently do not need it and too few who really need support will end up getting far too little.  Instead, the Government should focus its attention on how to return some of that &euro;1 billion unexpected VAT windfall to the pockets of those who need it the most.<\/p><p>We saw in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent<\/i>that the big energy firm Energia paid out &euro;30 million in dividends for the previous financial year.  That will not sit well with consumers reading that this morning when energy prices are going up and up.  That in itself makes an argument to impose a windfall levy on energy companies that are experiencing supernormal profits at the expense of working people throughout the country.<\/p><p>It is also important to note energy and electricity price rises are not only impacting on residential consumers.  The phenomenon is impacting on jobs and businesses too.  I know for a fact it is costing jobs and I will tell the Minister of State why.  Workers at the Premier Periclase plant in Drogheda are in the teeth of this storm and this is a case in point.  I am using this example to illustrate a wider point.  They are on temporary lay-off because the firm, which is a very large consumer of energy and fuel, has been tipped into examinership as it struggles with enormous bills from Bord G&aacute;is and without any sign whatsoever of Government support or any understanding as to the experience it is going through.  This is something we are likely to see much more of this year, absent a comprehensive set of actions from the Government.  A whole-of-government approach and response to this very real world crisis is needed.<\/p> <p>However, there is little or no sign of action coming from the Government.  There is no urgency and there are no ideas.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State might dismiss the problem of inflation as transitory, but we do not.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Gabriel Makhlouf admits that the impact of the rising cost of living is uneven.  Of course it is.  In other words, rising prices hit the poorest the hardest.  That is what he meant to say.  I will break it down for the Minister of State.  Even when this current spike dissipates, it is likely that Ireland will still have higher rates of inflation than the EU average.  This requires determined and longer term Government attention.<\/p> <p> This issue is the real-life, on-the-ground, urgent financial, economic and political issue of this year and it ought to be treated with the seriousness it deserves.  We have put forward time and again constructive proposals to protect living standards, but our calls have so far fallen on deaf ears.  If the Government had listened to our warnings in the run-up to budget 2022 last October, there may have been no need whatsoever for this motion today.  It was clear then that a 2% increase in social welfare rates would not cut it, and it has not.  What we now have is a real, effective cut to the living standards of those who depend on the State for their income.  We accept there are international circumstances feeding into the situation, but the most acute price rises in recent months, which are fuel, energy, transport, housing and food, are all subject to one form or another of Government policy or regulatory control.  People are looking for action from the Government.  They demand action and intervention.  We request that the House supports this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600008#F00200","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643191920,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600009#G00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1643191920,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I wish to share the remaining time with Deputy Bacik.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600009#G00300","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1643191920,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

What the Minister of State should be doing now is dealing with this issue because it is going to be the biggest issue by far facing the country.  We accept a percentage of the colossal level of inflation is due to international factors, but when we break it down to the level of ordinary people's lives, between the rates of increase in diesel and petrol, home heating oil, the basic staple diet of bread, butter and milk, and electricity, families are facing an increase of &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000.  They cannot take it.  The sum of &euro;113.50 is laughable.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach put himself in a bind yesterday when he spoke about workers and the fact he does not believe they should be looking for what are pretty modest wage increases, while the T&aacute;naiste was saying the complete opposite and agreed with what I said in the House.  I will say it straight out.  We are the Labour Party.  We work with trade unions all the time.  They are going to make wage demands and we are going to bloody well support them.  The Minister of State is not doing his job.  Real politics is back.  He will have to deal with this.  It will not wash at all to offer &euro;113.50 to somebody who is facing increases of &euro;4,000.<\/p><p>We asked some families to give us their experience.  One elderly lady said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tMy only income is the State pension.  It is impossible to keep going with the increases that I am now facing.  This Government do not understand it up there. <\/blockquote>  <p>Another woman told us the real impact it is having on her family:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe cost of my grocery shop has slowly increased by at least &euro;50 per week.  That is a basic enough shop of staple food, no drink, just veg, meat, fruit, etc.  Since October I have put &euro;1,140 into my oil tank.  My car diesel did cost &euro;70, it now costs &euro;107.  [These people are budgeting, and they are going to fall over.]  I have had to add &euro;100 extra per week to my household budget to buy the same things I did last year. <\/blockquote>  <p>This is the one that really got me, as you can imagine, &quot;My sister works in a supermarket, and she said people are putting items back at the till when they realise the scale and size of their bill.&quot;<\/p><p>There is increasing food poverty due to inflation, higher utility bills and higher fuel bills.  Another person who got on to me said that they have to return to the workplace in Dublin.  They did commute there two times a week, but now that they have to work full time and pay rent, it basically means they must give up their job because they cannot survive.<\/p><p>With all of these inflationary measures, this is not just affecting one size of family or a certain dynamic of family.  It is affecting those who are poor, who are on the poverty line, and it is affecting single people who are having to move because other changes in how we live our lives change how they do things.  It is affecting working families.  It is affecting those who have to pay mortgages.  It is affecting everyone at a certain level.  There is a huge amount of worry and fear out there that the Government does not get.  I told the Taoiseach yesterday that the Government is not living in the real world.  The Minister of State should please bear this in mind; there is a very short window to deal with this.  My colleague, Deputy Nash, has put forward proposals to facilitate and help the Government.  It is simply untrue to say those tools are not available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600009#G00500","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1643191920,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I am pleased to speak on the Labour Party motion on the cost of living.  This is a timely motion, as my colleagues, Deputies Nash and Kelly have pointed out.  This is an issue that affects everyone across Ireland today.  As we are moving into a new phase of the pandemic and all of us are cautiously optimistic, as we have seen the lifting of most restrictions at the end of last week, nonetheless, what is coming into stark focus now is the reality of increased costs for so many families, individuals and households throughout the country.  What we have learnt throughout this pandemic is that the old way of doing politics simply is not good enough any more.  We need to ensure we build on those collective values of solidarity that saw us through the toughest times in the pandemic and that we build on what are social democratic and socialist principles of greater roles for the State in intervening to address growing inequalities.  I was very struck by the Oxfam figures showing the wealth of Ireland's nine billionaires increased by nearly 60% since March 2020 while for most people wages have stagnated while prices have increased.  This is at a time of global insecurity, with Russian troops massing on the border in Ukraine, and consequences that Deputy Nash has spelt out of which we are all very aware in terms of rising prices for energy and serious implications for many in the manufacturing and other sectors throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  I want to focus on two areas in which the Government can make a real difference if it addresses them and takes up the challenge of greater public sector investment in public services and greater and more targeted measures to address them.  There are two issues on which people in my constituency in Dublin Bay South and throughout the country are really being squeezed.  Childcare is a significant issue given the massive costs.  Ireland has the second highest household spend on childcare in the OECD.  In my constituency, I hear daily and weekly from couples and individuals who are scrambling to make ends meet and to meet childcare costs, yet we know that across the sector while parents are facing unaffordable fees, staff are being paid at below poverty level in many cases.  Many childcare and early years professionals are seeking to leave the sector as they are simply unable to afford to continue to work in it.  Cr&egrave;che and childcare providers are leaving the market and are no longer providing the service because they too are not getting the supports.  I have called for a Donogh O'Malley moment where the Government takes up what Labour Women have called for in our equal early years campaign, where we take up the challenge and bring into play a proper, universal, public, community-run childcare system that is affordable for parents and that provides good quality childcare with good supports and recognition for childcare professionals and early years educators.  This must be done.  We have heard promises of reform from the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, but there has been no delivery and parents still face high fees.<\/p> <p> Then there is the cost of housing.  In my constituency, 44% of all households are in the private rental sector.  We are seeing unaffordable hikes in rents and the Government has failed to take action on progressing the Bill that I and Senator Moynihan pioneered and that the D&aacute;il debated in September, which would, among other things, have frozen rents for a three-year period.  Our renters' rights Bill would have brought in significant positive reforms for those renting and would have sought to address this serious cost and increase that so many families and individuals are facing.<\/p> <p> What we want to see with this motion is a better Ireland than we have seen to date.  We want to see an Ireland in which the collective principles of solidarity are built upon in which the State takes up the challenge of investment in public services and in which targeted measures are taken by the Government without delay to address rising costs and rising prices and, in particular, to target childcare and rent costs that are crippling so many families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600009#G00600","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643192520,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &quot;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot;

and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; it is crucial that we do not have an inflation 'chain reaction' that would damage our international cost competitiveness.&quot;  <\/blockquote>  <p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the recent increase in consumer price inflation and I look forward to a constructive discussion on the issue this morning.  In my opening remarks I will outline both the causes of the recent increase and highlight the Government's response.  Let me begin by stressing that the Government is acutely aware of the cost of living pressures being faced by Irish households.  My remarks will focus on the European measure of inflation, the harmonised index of consumer prices.  The rate of inflation is running at 5.7% according to the latest data.  I am conscious this is the highest rate since November 2000 and that this is squeezing household disposable incomes while also weighing on the profits of firms and employers.  Of course, we should not pretend Ireland is unique in this regard.  The rate of inflation has picked up in almost all advanced economies.  The latest figures show rates of 7% in the US, 5.4% in the UK and 5% in the euro area.  In all countries, these sorts of figures are multi-decade highs.  Ireland is no different.<\/p><p>Clearly, the biggest driver of headline inflation at the moment is the sharp increase in energy prices.  Demand for oil and other energy products such as natural gas has increased sharply following the reopening of many economies in the second half of last year.  At present, the wholesale price of oil is around &euro;77 per barrel, broadly in line with the average pre-pandemic. However, this level is much higher than the abnormal levels that prevailed during the first wave of the pandemic, thus boosting the annual comparison.  Around two percentage points of the 5.7% rate recorded in December are due to energy prices.  This is what is known as a base effect and is also a feature, for instance, in the sharp annual increase in the cost of airline tickets we have seen.  These base effects are expected to drop out of the annual comparison over the course of this year.  This is what underpins our assessment that the current very high rate of inflation is temporary and that it will begin to ease from the second quarter of this year.  Additionally, the increase in international gas prices is more complex and relates to increased demand from certain parts of the world.  This is in part as a result of extreme weather events, lower than expected gas supply and low gas reserves.  Unfortunately, Ireland, along with the rest of the EU, is a net importer of gas and, as a result, a price taker on international markets.<\/p><p>More fundamental is the second factor at work, which is the imbalance between global demand and supply that has emerged as economies have reopened.  Most advanced economies have recovered strongly from the pandemic and this has boosted demand.  However, congestion at ports, unavailable shipping capacity, and the closure of factories in Asia mean supply has recovered more slowly.  This mismatch between demand and supply has put upward pressure on prices.  These supply chain problems are the reason for the sharp increase in car prices, for instance.<\/p><p>This brings me to the third factor, which is more of a domestic than external issue.  This is the rebound in demand in our own economy due to the relaxation of restrictions.  Indeed, the rebound seen last year, particularly in the second quarter, was far higher than many expected and is a direct result of successful Government policy to support and protect incomes, jobs and businesses.  In fact, household incomes increased by almost 7% in 2020, among the highest in the EU, and grew strongly last year as well.  With incomes actually increasing during a time when normal consumption was impossible, household savings surged, rising by &euro;23 billion since the pandemic began.<\/p><p>It is therefore inevitable that the easing of restrictions would lead to a rapid unwinding of pent-up demand and, in doing so, put upward pressure on prices if these savings were to flow into areas in which supply is already constrained.  Supply is constrained in many areas, in part due to labour shortages.  While the Omicron variant led to only a temporary slowdown, it no doubt worsened the supply constraints.  Finally, it also worth mentioning that Brexit is also having an impact on Irish inflation, with higher trade costs due to non-tariff measures being passed on to consumers here.<\/p><p>The Government's primary response to mitigating residential price inflation is to increase supply.  New figures from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage show there were more than 30,700 housing units that had commenced construction in 2021.  The pipeline is strong.  Furthermore, the Housing for All strategy outlines the Government's plan to increase affordability and housing supply by targeting the delivery of, on average, 33,000 new homes per annum out to 2030.  Housing for All also aims to provide more than 10,000 social homes and 6,000 affordable homes for purchase or rent per annum, which will help to mitigate affordability challenges for our citizens.  Some &euro;4 billion was allocated towards housing in budget 2022, the highest amount ever.  In that regard, the level of resources being set aside for core spending is significant, almost &euro;93 billion in 2025 compared with just over &euro;70 billion in 2020.  This additional spending will provide for new expenditure measures, including for priorities such as Sl&aacute;intecare.  That goes against the suggestion there is a lack of public sector investment.  The opposite is the case.<\/p><p>I will now turn to the issue of wages.  In the same report, Ireland was reported to have the second highest minimum wage in the EU.  Even when accounting for differences in price levels, the Irish minimum wage was found to be one of the highest across the EU.  We must bear in mind, however, that Ireland is a small, outward-looking economy where wage growth in excess of other economies erodes our competitiveness and puts future job and economic growth at risk.  It is crucial, therefore, that we do not trigger an inflation chain reaction, a wage-price spiral, that would damage our international cost competitiveness as an open economy that relies on exports.<\/p><p>Let me now turn to the Government's response to the recent increase in consumer price inflation.  In formulating budget 2022, the Government was acutely aware of the cost of living pressures that currently confront Irish households.  For this reason, it contained a large range of measures to protect households from the rising cost of living.  In fact, analysis of budget 2022 carried out by the Department of Finance showed that the gains from the net budgetary package are greatest for those on the lowest incomes, highlighting the progressive nature of the budget package.  The budget measures included a personal income tax package worth &euro;520 million for this year alongside a social welfare package of more than &euro;550 million.  In terms of specifics, the fuel allowance was increased by &euro;5 per week to compensate lower income households for the additional energy costs they are likely to incur due to an increase in the carbon tax.  There were also increases in the allocation of early learning care and school-age childcare to ensure childcare prices do not rise.  That is very important for families mentioned by previous speakers.<\/p><p>On foot of the significant increases in energy prices of late, the Government further approved an electricity costs emergency benefit payment of up to &euro;100 to be made this year to an estimated 2.1 million domestic electricity account holders.  The benefit to each electricity account holder, including the VAT effect, will be &euro;113.50.  The Labour Party has done nothing but call that a gimmick and a wheeze.  It is &euro;113.50 and I think people will appreciate that.  I reject any notion that it is a gimmick or a wheeze.  It is a direct subsidy to every household to deal with the rising costs of electricity.<\/p><p>While the Government is keen to do as much as it can to alleviate the cost of living pressures for households, this needs to be considered in the context of broader budgetary policy and our current financial position.<\/p> <p>Overall, in response to the pandemic, the Government has made available &euro;48 billion to shore up household incomes and provide a lifeline for firms while supporting our social, community and cultural life and employment.  This is one of the most significant policy responses of any country.<br\/><br\/>It should be clear that, as well as providing effective policy measures to support the recovery, the Government will do as much as is feasible to alleviate the cost-of-living pressures for households.  This support, however, comes at a cost and has led to a significant increase in general Government debt of about 11% of national income.  As a result, Ireland's public debt amounts to almost one quarter of &euro;1 trillion, among the highest in the developed world on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis.<br\/><br\/>The rapid rise in consumer prices is certainly unwelcome and the Government is conscious of the impact on the people.  We have responded in a proactive manner and in line with policies taken in other jurisdictions.  Some of the drivers are outside of our control but our policy response will help mitigate their impact.  I am confident the rate of inflation will begin to moderate as this year progresses.  I look forward to constructive input from Deputies during the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600010#H00200","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643193120,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State's response was quite telling, not least when he stated, &ldquo;This is what underpins our assessment that the current very high rate of inflation is temporary and that it will begin to ease from the second quarter of this year.&rdquo;  We all read the economic reports from the likes of the Economic and Social Research Institute and we are all well versed on economic affairs at this stage.  I think what the Minister of State is signalling to the House in response to the motion is that, by and large, the Government is hopeful everything will return to some degree of normality, as will the 2.5% of that 5.7% increase attributed to the cost of energy, but the cost of energy runs through everything we do in society.  Whether we are buying a packet of biscuits or pasta, fuelling our cars or heating our houses, it runs through everything we do.  I believe the Minister of State's contribution was signalling to the House that the Government is going to be largely non-interventionist in how it approaches the cost-of-living increase.  It is hopeful, on a wing and a prayer, that costs will decrease in the second half of this year and, therefore, it will not do a whole pile about it.  That is unfortunate.  At a time when people expect a response from, and intervention by, the Government, the response from the Minister of State and the Government is unfortunate.<\/p>  <p>  There was something discomfiting about hearing the traffic reports from AA Roadwatch on \"Morning Ireland\" earlier.  The tailbacks and delays at the usual junctions left one with a sense that the gains in respect of quality of life derived from people being able to work from home were evaporating before our very eyes.  I hope we will not squander those gains on quality of life and I hope the considerable financial savings people have made by working remotely will not be wiped out by rising fuel costs, in particular for those commuters stuck on major orbital routes around cities such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick and many towns I could mention.  The Minister of State made reference to the annual rate of inflation and we all acknowledge the increase, which is at an all-time high.  Even so, it will not be long before the gains workers have made from not having to spend hours in the car will be wiped out by the exorbitant cost of petrol and diesel.<\/p>  <p>  There is an opportunity to address the cost-of-living crisis.  The Taoiseach informed the House yesterday that he believes increasing wages is not the answer because of what he believes is the danger of a wage price spiral leading to higher inflation, and the Minister of State referred to the same dynamic.  I do not know whether that is Government policy, given the T&aacute;naiste was asking the private sector after this week's Cabinet meeting to increase wages.  He stated, &ldquo;Where employers can afford pay increases, they should do so.&rdquo;  That is typical of the mixed messaging of the Government and its inability to deliver one coherent message.  The people are listening closely to messages from the Government.  Incoherence leads only to further anxiety and this needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach did not offer solutions yesterday when responding to Deputy Kelly's raising of the issue of spiralling costs across the range of goods and services.  Through this motion, we have put forward some solutions.  One such measure the Government could consider to address the spiralling costs of energy would be to actively widen access to the fuel allowance for households that are fuel-impoverished.  A low-income household would benefit greatly from a refundable carbon tax credit and this would signal a clear transfer from the richest in society to the poorest working families.  Another solution would be to provide increases in social protection payments that would keep pace with the rate of inflation, something that was not done in the most recent budget, with a long-term commitment to bring up weekly rates to the minimum essential standard of living.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know whether Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers are listening to what businesses are telling them at present.  I spoke with a primary producer in the agri-food sector on Monday, who informed me his monthly gas bill has increased from &euro;10,000 to &euro;36,000 over recent months.  This is really biting in both rural and urban Ireland and it is having a major detrimental effect on businesses' ability to continue to employ people, as was highlighted by Deputy Nash.  It is beginning to squeeze the ability of employers to employ people in the economy, and that has to be taken note of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600011#J00200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193120,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I congratulate my colleague Deputy Nash on putting forward the motion.  We did not just start talking about the cost of living today or yesterday.  In every budget proposal the Labour Party has put forward in recent years, we have chosen direct State intervention instead of tax cuts because we believe in that.  The Minister of State, the Government and the T&aacute;naiste in particular will point to the &euro;500 million worth of tax cuts they have put forward as some kind of cost-of-living intervention but they will not make the difference.  What my party colleagues and I have spoken about consistently in the context of education relates to trying to put to bed this lie about free education.  The Government decided to give back &euro;500 million last year in its budget.  Many of those tax cuts were for people who do not really need them.  If the Government had taken &euro;40 million, it would have been able to make every schoolbook in this country free for good, at both primary and secondary level, just as is the case in Northern Ireland.  Families do not pay for schoolbooks in Northern Ireland because the state intervenes and provides them for free, yet here, parents every September have to scramble around with schoolbook lists to try to purchase books for their children.  Imagine a genuine republic that said to its parents and children that their schoolbooks for their education will be free, just like in Northern Ireland, but the Government did not do that.  It gave tax cuts instead.<\/p>  <p>  As for voluntary contributions in the school sector, effectively fees, I have proposed legislation that would ban them.  The school managers will say that, in order to properly finance the replacement funding, we would need about &euro;46 million.  If that is the case, let us do that.  Let us make the State intervene and ensure no school will ever again have to ask for a voluntary contribution, because it is not voluntary.  Parents feel as though they have to pay it.  That is another positive State intervention that could be made instead of a tax cut.<\/p>  <p>  As my colleague Deputy Sherlock stated in the context of rising energy costs, about one third of the cost of running a school relates to energy costs, and that proportion will increase, not least because of the rising cost of energy but also because the windows are all open and the children are freezing.  Of course, the energy bills will increase and that will be passed on to parents again, whether by a voluntary contribution or a fundraiser.  Is there not something repulsive about a school community having to raise money to keep a school going?  Is there not something pathetic about that in a republic?  Parents have all these conversations with their school about money, and parents who are feeling the squeeze are then less likely to come to the school gate, to hang around or to attend school events or a parent-teacher meeting in case they will be asked for money, whether that is book money, the voluntary contribution or a payment for this or that event.<\/p> <p>Let me explode the Minister of State's brain for a second.  Imagine a genuinely free education system which the Government would prioritise over a tax cut for those who do not really need it.<\/p> <p> What motivates me and our party is the fundamental difference between what the Government is trying to achieve and the rhetoric it comes out with, and the day-to-day lives people are living and the vision we would have as to how a genuine social democratic country with State intervention would make people&rsquo;s lives better rather than telling them they are on their own.  We tell them to buy their schoolbooks and expensive school uniforms.  We put them under compulsion to pay for a voluntary contribution and make them feel under compulsion to go to a school fundraiser to pay for the energy bill.  We are not just saying this today or yesterday or because of this motion.  We have been saying this every year in every budget proposal that is put forward by my colleague Deputy Nash.  That is the difference.  When it comes to the hard choice between tax cuts and direct State intervention, the Labour Party believes in State intervention to genuinely tackle the cost of living and education, which should be free.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600011#J00300","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643193720,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Labour Party for bringing forward this timely and appropriate motion.  We all know that people have had it extremely hard for the last two years with the Covid-19 pandemic.  So many people lost their jobs or were out of work for periods of time and some were on reduced hours as a result of necessary closures to deal with the pandemic.  We also know that many businesses have struggled to keep their doors open.  Now as restrictions are easing, ordinary workers and families are faced with a crisis that they have been facing for some time but that has reached a peak, namely a crisis in the cost of living.  This crisis has grown over the years as the Government continues to fail to tackle the big issues of the day, such as housing and the cost of childcare.<\/p>  <p>  In October, my colleague Deputy Kerrane conducted a survey on this and she has been leading on this issue.  The survey was specifically on the cost of living and we had 14,000 respondents and 6,000 comments about what ordinary workers and families were experiencing in the cost of living.  The Minister of State will know that 14,000 respondents is a massive number, which shows the scale of the crisis.  The level of response is indicative of same.  It was truly shocking to see that 55% of those who responded were working full-time.  They said that the cost of living was pushing them further into poverty and that they were struggling to pay the bills, keep the house warm and keep the lights on.  That is a failure of this Government.<\/p>  <p>  We need action from the Government that is commensurate with the scale of the crisis.  We are all acutely aware of the geopolitical pressures that have led to a rise in the price of energy and we are all aware that inflation is at an all-time high.  However, the Government cannot blame external factors for its lack of action.  I heard the Taoiseach yesterday blame Russia and Vladimir Putin during Leaders&rsquo; Questions for the rise in the cost of living.  Again, we are all aware of the geopolitical nature of some of these price rises but the Taoiseach can hardly blame them for his lack of action or for the fact that childcare costs continue to rise.  Housing rents and prices have risen year-on-year due to Government inaction and the lack of supply of affordable housing so that people can get their feet on the property ladder.<\/p>  <p>  We need something that the Government cannot say it does not know about and for which Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for a long number of years.  We need a three-year ban on rent increases and renters need to see one month&rsquo;s rent going back into their pockets.  We need to see a stop to the carbon tax hikes which are increasing the burden on those suffering from fuel poverty.  We need to see the Government stand up to the insurance companies and ensure that ordinary people stop getting ripped off with rising premiums.  We need to see a full plan of action on childcare costs.  My colleague Deputy Funchion has a clear plan for same, something we have outlined in our budget proposals and she has outlined time and again, which would cut the cost of childcare by two thirds.  The cost of childcare is prohibitive and is locking people out of the workforce, especially women.  The Government must legislate to ensure that all workers earn a decent living wage.  It was slightly laughable that the Minister of State mentioned in his amendment that we need to be concerned that wage growth in excess of other economies erodes our competitiveness.  I did not see that concern when we saw the increase in the wage of the Secretary General of the Department of Health and I did not see that international comparison then.  The Minister of State can correct me if he disagrees but it would appear to me that this attitude is targeted towards people on low wages.<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise the issue of people in Galway city and county who are struggling to get by as a result of the cost of living.  I have been knocking on doors in Galway city every week and it is this issue that comes up most.  We see that people are struggling to keep a car on the road and that car is necessary for them to drive to work as a result of the lack of buses.  They are also struggling to keep their homes adequately heated during the cold winter months and they are finding it increasingly difficult to put food on their tables.  Last week Social Justice Ireland told us that one fifth of people are living in poverty when their housing costs are factored in and that 300,000 people were forced into poverty last year.  We need action from Government and we need it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600012#K00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193720,"counter":49,"content":"<p>We are emerging from a pandemic and walking straight into the teeth of a cost-of-living crisis.  We have among the highest costs for housing, childcare and energy in Europe.  Inflation is at its highest level in 20 years at 5.5% in December and wages are staying the same.  Low earners are extremely vulnerable.  The 3% or 30 cent rise in the minimum wage will not go anywhere near making up for the huge increases facing families in costs for rent, food and energy.  I heard the Taoiseach responding to Deputy McDonald yesterday when she raised this issue on Leaders' Questions and his main defence was that there are global issues.  We accept that there are global issues affecting the cost of living but why is Ireland the most expensive or among the most expensive in Europe when it comes to paying for necessities?<\/p>  <p>  We are among the most expensive in Europe for rent, home energy costs, childcare costs and mortgage rates.  People cannot cope with it anymore.  Food bills are expected to increase by over &euro;700 this year and it will cost more than &euro;500 to run a car this year.  Petrol and diesel have shot up in price by one third in the past year alone.  Rent has increased by 8% and house prices are up 14%.  Lighting and heating increased by 53% and there have been 35 energy price hikes in the last year.  Irish mortgage holders are paying over &euro;2,500 per year more than their fellow Europeans due to mortgage interest rates.  This has been the case for decades and the Government has done damn all about it.  It is unsustainable and unbearable for people.  Families are being pushed into extreme pressure and poverty.  It is frightening that the Government is doing nothing about it.  The payment of &euro;100 from the Government will not even touch the cost increases that families are experiencing.  The benefit of that payment will immediately be cancelled out by increases in energy bills.<\/p>  <p>  We need to see the living wage become a reality and we need a proper rent freeze.  What we have is clearly not working.  We need urgent action on the matter of fuel and household energy costs.  The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, need to step up.  They have to meet the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities and the energy companies to come up with solutions.  People simply cannot tolerate these price increases and we need urgent action from the Government.  At what stage will the Government stop turning a blind eye to this?  The people outside of here can see that the Government is ignoring the problem, putting them further in debt and putting them under further pressure.  I ask the Government to tackle it for goodness' sake.  We are coming out of the pandemic and now is the time to tackle it.  The Government must stop turning a blind eye to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600012#K00300","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1643193720,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The cost of living has gone through the roof.  As Deputy Munster said, we have among the highest prices in the world in a range of areas, including housing, energy and others.<\/p> <p>Workers and families across the whole country are suffering.  The cost of living for many workers and families in Laois-Offaly has reached an unbearable level.  Renters in rural areas have been hit hardest by the increases in the cost of living.  Rents in County Laois have gone up 7.6% in the last year while in County Offaly, they are up a whopping 10.4%.<\/p> <p> The Minister said that increasing the supply would deal with the housing inflation and that alone.  That is what he indicated.  It is not true.  He will recall what happened with house prices and rents when record numbers were being built in 2005, 2006 and 2007.  They went through the roof.  That is the situation with house prices.  That alone will not do it.  I support increasing the supply, which is a factor, but that alone will not do it.  That needs to be gotten into their heads of Government Ministers.<\/p> <p> Renters are also in the least energy-efficient homes as they tend to be poorly insulated.  The carbon tax hikes are hitting those people in rural areas hardest due to the lack of public transport, the need to commute by car and a dependence on solid fuel or oil to heat their homes.  Many households have seen their incomes drop during the Covid-19 pandemic while inflation has caused energy bills to soar.  Food and rent costs also increased massively.  This is putting pressure on people's finances.<\/p> <p> Our party carried out a survey in November, undertaken by Deputy Kerrane.  Replies from 14,500 people, three quarters of whom were working, found that the vast majority were struggling to cover even the basic essentials.  Fuel poverty is on the increase.  People must cope with increases in carbon tax, rents spiralling out of control and childcare costs that are among the highest in the European Union.<\/p> <p> We have seen little urgency from the Government to address the cost of living and provide real household supports.  We have put forward a number of proposals to ease the burden on workers and families, of which these are only some.  The Government has failed to freeze rents.  It has brought in Mickey Mouse rent controls in some areas and in many areas, it has not introduced any controls.  Most areas in my constituency do not have them.  The Government has left loopholes.  We also want to give renters back an 8.5% tax rebate on rent paid.  The Government needs to legislate to end dual pricing and other measures within the car insurance industry.  It needs to introduce a living wage.  The T&aacute;naiste yesterday was again talking about a living wage.  The Government needs to stop talking about it and put a living wage in place.  It needs to halt any further increases in carbon tax.<\/p> <p> To conclude, these kinds of measures are needed.  The Government cannot do everything but there are measures it can take to tackle inflation and the cost of living.  Government Deputies cannot continue to sit on their hands on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600012#K00400","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643194320,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I find it quite ironic, however, given the role of the Labour Party and its austerity agenda, which caused so much hardship for the people of south Kildare and the Portarlington area of County Laois.<\/p>  <p>  While it was in government, the Labour Party presided over a range of savage cuts such as the removal of the bereavement grant, the increase in the pension age, a doubling of the student contribution fee, the cutting of rent allowance and child benefit and the introduction of water charges and local property tax.  I could go on but my time is limited.  In the words of one of my constituents during the previous election, the Labour Party became more blueshirt than the Blueshirts themselves.<\/p>  <p>  This motion means well, however, and comes hot on the heels of a Sinn F&eacute;in motion on the cost of living.  Our motion was critical of the Government's approach but also proposed a range of solutions that, if implemented, would turn the tide in favour of struggling workers and their families.  I support this motion notwithstanding the Labour Party's track record in government.<\/p>  <p>  Many people who attend my clinics are at breaking point.  There are families who make the choice between food and fuel on a weekly basis.  We are living in the 21st century but families are living in circumstances that belong in a Charles Dickens novel from the 19th century.  Charities like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are literally saving lives.  They are taking the place of the State in supporting vulnerable citizens who are being left behind by this Government.  It is wrong; the Minister knows it is wrong and it must change.<\/p>  <p>  Urgent action is needed to address the cost-of-living crisis.  Our older people have been given minimal increases in their pensions.  The reality is that multiples of the increase will be taken back in a stealth of carbon taxes and everything else.  A fiver increase has been swallowed up by the doubling of utility bills.  The Minister and everyone else knows it is not sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I will say a brief word on minimum alcohol prices.  Alcohol is not an essential item but it might as well be for some low-income families with addiction issues.  I understand the intent behind it and we should be doing more to encourage a reduction in alcohol consumption.  The mind boggles at the way in which the Government has introduced minimum pricing instead of increasing excise duty and ring-fencing the money to address addiction and the harm caused by excess alcohol consumption.  This Government has handed a gift to alcohol manufacturers and sellers.  It is out of touch and running out of time.  Things will not change until we have a change of government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600013#L00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1643194320,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Last year, Sinn F&eacute;in launched its online survey about the impact the increase in the cost of living was having on people's lives.  Some 76% of people who responded to our survey said they were very concerned about the impact while 95% said they believed the Government was not doing enough.<\/p>  <p>  We have heard that the Government intends to take &euro;100 off electricity bills in March at some stage.  While anything that takes some pressure off people is welcome, the Government needs to do much more than this to address the plight so many households are facing as energy bills and the general cost of living soar.  In reality, those who are suffering as a result of the huge increase in the cost of living need more than the &euro;100 that will go into the pockets of providers.  These same families face hikes of &euro;1,300 this year on their energy bills.  Because the Government refused Sinn F&eacute;in's attempt to get this legislation through the D&aacute;il before Christmas, people in dire straits will have to wait until March to see the small difference this will make.  Imagine the debts some people will have no choice but to run up between now and then.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of a single parent who wants to improve her job prospects after a spell of illness by signing up to a master's degree.  She has been told she does not qualify for the back to education allowance and that she will have her jobseeker's allowance taken away from her unless she packs in her education immediately.  She has a 15-year-old son who is relying on her and yet she is being blocked from engaging in education to improve their lives.  She now has a decision to make on whether to give up her education, as the State is advising her to do, or face head-on the obstacles this Government is putting in her way.<\/p>  <p>  Another family, again, a single parent and her daughter, are living at home with the mother's ex-husband.  She cannot afford to get a place of her own and has been denied the housing assistance payment, HAP, because she exceeded the limit by a couple of hundred euro.  They are stuck in a situation they do not want to be in but are confined because of the cost of living and the unavailability of affordable and adequate housing.  These are some of the people who are not being given a chance.<\/p>  <p>  In a major research project last year, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul found that nearly 20% of working people had cut back on fuel and electricity due to costs.  This Government is out of touch and has abandoned people on this issue.  The costs of childcare, putting food on the table, meeting rent, finding a place to live and getting to and from work are rising.<\/p>  <p>  In government, Sinn F&eacute;in will expand the eligibility for the fuel allowance.  We will establish a discretionary fund which will assist households with heating and electricity costs, especially those who find themselves struggling with debt this winter season.  We will set up State-run childcare, reducing fees for the parents by two thirds while delivering social and affordable homes.  We will ban rent increases for three years and cut rents by putting one month's rent back in people's pockets.  This Government has no vision that puts people's quality of life first.  It has failed on every count and believes that &euro;100 will resolve all ills.  This Government is wrong and it does not care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600013#L00300","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1643194320,"counter":54,"content":"<p>This year, the cost of food is expected to rise by almost &euro;800 with the running cost of the average car to increase by &euro;500.

I refer, for example, to people's ability to pay for childcare, their mortgage, or college and school fees.  We must look at the poorest in society, who will be most affected by this.  The cost of heating and food, and petrol and diesel for trying to get to work and school, affects ordinary people.  The Government's solution is an increase of &euro;100.  It is unbelievable.  The Government should be offering solutions.<\/p>  <p>  We have just come out of a pandemic, which many people struggled to get through.  They are on a knife-edge.  Here we are now at the start of 2022 and many people will not be able to afford to keep a roof over their heads or the heating on.  Chefs in hospitals, dental assistants and people who kept the country afloat during the pandemic are getting paid less than the living wage.<\/p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste is calling on private employers to increase wages.  They should do so, and we support that.  However, what happens to public sector workers who are being paid a pittance to work in understaffed hospitals?

The Taoiseach yesterday called for wage restraint but the T&aacute;naiste was in the newspapers this morning calling for companies to increase people's wages.  There is an ideological clash between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  We know how Fine Gael has operated and its attitude of letting the market decide things.

Some of us have a living memory of significant inflationary pressures.  I remember the impact on the country and quality of life during the 1970s and 1980s.  It started with the oil crisis in 1973, when prices quadrupled.  There was an immediate reduction in the living standards of people.  By 1975, inflation had risen to 21%.  It reduced over the following years but there was a rise again thereafter and, by 1981, it was back to 20.3%.  By 1985, it had reduced to 5.5%.  What could be bought for &euro;100 in 1976 would cost &euro;683 today.  That is what inflation does.<\/p>  <p>  It does not stop at energy prices.  The cost to deliver items to shops rises and increases in the cost of food are partly a consequence of that.  The staples are increasing in price, including bread, pasta and milk.  That will have a significant impact, particularly on families with a number of children.  We must all be concerned about what is happening on the Russia-Ukraine border because we cannot dismiss it.  There is a real prospect of further harm.<\/p>  <p>  Even before this spike in inflation, I raised these issues and pointed out that our living costs, before this inflationary spike, were 36% above the EU average.  Ours are the highest house prices in Europe.  We have the fourth highest energy prices in Europe.  We might say we are an island on the west coast of Europe and that is the reason this has happened.  However, prices can be compared between the North and South.  If we compare house prices between Belfast and Dublin, Cork and Derry, there is a significant difference.  Look at food prices.  I do not accept that as an argument and nor do I accept that nothing can be done.<\/p>  <p>  This is a Europe-wide, international crisis.  We accept that.  However, does that not mean there is an opportunity to do something collectively about these issues?  Inflation will equally have a bearing on household bills in other jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  People are genuinely choosing between heating their homes and putting food on the table.  They are genuinely making that decision, as we heard from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul yesterday.  A number of people have made contact with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  This is not something we can ignore.  It is having a direct impact not only on quality of life but also on the health of the nation.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Sherlock's point about the cost of energy for businesses.  I raised the issue with the T&aacute;naiste some months ago.  I raised the matter of one particular local business with more than 100 employees.  That business told me it would not lose business but would not win any new business as a consequence of the rise in the cost of energy.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government is gaining by virtue of the fact that increased prices bring in increased levels of VAT.  A newspaper today reported that Energia paid out &euro;30 million in dividends as profits soared during the last financial year.  This is not a one-way street.  The Government must take more immediate action and recognise we have a problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600014#M00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1643194920,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I thank the Labour Party, in particular Deputy Nash, for facilitating this important discussion.  We are in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis.  Inflation has leaped to a 21-year high of 5.5%.  Families and especially those on fixed incomes are feeling the effects every day.  Energy prices are soaring and young families are burdened with rents and incredibly expensive childcare costs.  Pensioners and disabled people are unable to heat their homes.  Households are depending on the fantastic work of food charities to get by.  Women and children are trapped in situations of domestic violence due to the cost of housing.  Our cost of housing is the highest in Europe.  The cost of goods and services in Ireland is the second highest in Europe.  Our fuel costs are the fourth highest in Europe.  Ordinary people and families are struggling.  Where is the Government commitment to do better?<\/p>  <p>  Our spiralling cost of living starts early in life.  Childcare costs are among the highest in Europe.  Many families are paying more on childcare than on mortgage repayments.  Families in Denmark and Germany are paying a fraction of that cost.  Ireland spends 0.3% of GDP on early years care and education, which is well below the UNICEF-recommended benchmark of 1%.  Education is anything but free.  Annually, it costs over &euro;1,300 to put a child through primary education, over &euro;2,000 for secondary, and more than &euro;12,000 for college, according to research by Zurich.  That is over &euro;70,000 across a young person's education and those costs keep rising.<\/p>  <p>  At the other end of life, the situation is equally challenging.  Before the budget, the Government knew that the purchasing power of the pension had fallen by &euro;10.24 since 2019 and despite rising prices, a disgracefully low &euro;5 increase has already been eaten up.  Fuel poverty is a major issue for older people.  We all know about pensioners who are going to bed early in the evening to stay warm and families having to choose between food and energy bills.  The Government's &euro;100 credit for energy bills is a limited intervention that will provide only minor, temporary relief to those in need.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of living is even higher for disabled people.  The Government's own recent report, The Cost of Disability in Ireland, revealed that people with disabilities face extra costs of up to &euro;12,300 annually on transport, fuel, equipment, aids, medical expenses and much more.  It is no wonder we have one of the highest rates of poverty and social exclusion in the EU for disabled people.  Families of children with disabilities are consistently failed by the State in its provision of proper education and therapeutic measures.  Those with the means to pay for it privately do so, and those who cannot afford it are left on waiting lists.  The ombudsman's report criticising personal transport supports described the available schemes as \"inadequate, unfair and inequitable\".  This failure increases social isolation while also reducing employment opportunities.  There is a need for targeted social and health interventions to enable disabled people to live independent lives.<\/p>  <p>Fuel prices are rising.  That hits all households.  We see more families having to turn to food charities.  Somehow, while food prices are rising, primary producers are not making more.  Farmers, inshore fishers and small producers are barely getting by.  There is no such thing as cheap food.  We need to have a serious conversation about food policy in this country.  We need a food system that provides affordable and healthy food while ensuring that producers can make a living.  A more equitable and sustainable approach can benefit all producers and consumers if we have the political will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600014#M00300","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643195520,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Nash for tabling this motion on inflation and the cost of living.  We are happy to support it.  We will move two small but important amendments on the issue of introducing energy price caps and supporting workers who put in pay claims to keep their wages and income ahead of the galloping rate of inflation and rising cost of living.  The inflation figures are bad enough if they are just taken on their own terms, at 5.7% in December, and they are expected to be above 4.5% next year.  That means if people are only getting a 1% pay increase, they are taking a pay cut.  Workers are taking a pay cut.  I am on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  It showed that the State contributory pension has nominal increases but the actual real value of the pension dropped by 2%, so pensioners are taking an income cut.  That does not tell the whole story, because inflation figures are averages of the cost of living across the economy.  The areas where it is much worse are those that really hit the people who can least afford it, who are the vulnerable, low-paid working people.<\/p>  <p>  The area of housing is a disaster.  People end up homeless as a result of the failure of this and previous Governments to control the price of rent and houses.  We do not have time to go into the housing debate now, but it is outrageous that the Government refused to introduce a rent freeze.  We would go further and introduce rent controls where the Government controls the rent that can be charged, so that rents are linked to incomes, and are affordable for people.  That has to be done urgently.  Rents increased by 8% last year and 8% the year before that.  A critical point is that the income of landlords in that same period went up by 16%.  This is a key point about inflation and the cost-of-living crisis.  Rents, childcare costs and energy prices are going up and somebody is making money out of it.  Landlords are creaming it.  The Government's failure to control rents is not just impoverishing people who need housing, but it is enriching people who control the property sector.<\/p>  <p>  This is a basic elementary truth about inflation.  For inflation to go up, the producers of goods and services have to increase prices in order to increase their profits.  Profits in this economy have shot through the roof.  Ordinary workers are stuck on low pay.  It is laughable for the Government to talk about high wage rates in this country.  We have one of the highest levels of low pay anywhere in the western world.  Some 370,000 workers are on low pay in the retail, private security, transport, health and manufacturing sectors.  Many are on abysmally low levels of pay.  They are poverty levels.  The working poor are now being hammered by energy price hikes because of the profiteering of energy companies across the world and in this country.  We need to control prices and rents.  We need to support workers who are putting pay claims to keep ahead of the galloping rate of inflation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600015#N00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1643195520,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Listening to the Taoiseach yesterday, his remarks were striking.

In reality, he attempted to blame workers for the inflation that we are seeing.  The truth is that inflation is profit-led, not cost-pushed.  Let us look at the real examples, such as energy bills.  Everybody acknowledges the rapid inflation of bills.  Energia announced today that its profits increased by an astounding 50% last year, making money hand over fist, and the Government is letting the company get away with it.  It is price gouging, pure and simple.  It is time to tackle the profiteers by imposing price caps on the unit cost of electricity and gas.  The Minister has the power to implement these controls.  He could do it today if he wished but chooses not to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The privatisation and deregulation of electricity and gas companies in this country has been a disaster.  Record profits are being made by energy companies while heating bills are going through the roof.  Rather than leading to investment in renewable energy, it has led to more and more money being wasted on advertising, telemarketing, and coming up with a plethora of introductory offers with sneaky fine print, making people unsure of shopping around, which is combined ultimately with higher prices and worse conditions for workers.  The energy sector should not be run for profit.  It should be brought back into public ownership and run democratically as part of an ecosocialist green new deal.<\/p>  <p>  If the Government will not take action to bring down the cost of living, then workers are left with no option but to fight for pay increases higher than the rate of inflation.  Workers across the country would be absolutely right and would have the support of People Before Profit to follow the example of the Dunnes workers who won a 10% pay increase recently.  There is no reason other workers cannot do the same.  What is needed is workplace organising, building the courage, determination and unity needed.  I would say the same to public sector workers who are being told that all they will get is the paltry 1% increase previously agreed.  The rapid inflation and the Government's refusal to address it makes those agreements obsolete.  A 1% raise is a significant pay cut and it should not be accepted.<\/p>  <p>  Simultaneously, the minuscule increases in the minimum wage are not enough.  They also amount to a pay reduction.  Minimum wage in this country is a poverty wage.  Even working a full 40-hour week on the minimum wage would leave someone below the poverty line, unable to pay rent.  No worker should be living in poverty.  We need to build a movement to fight for a &euro;15 an hour minimum wage to raise the wage floor and raise wages for all workers in this country.  That equates to &euro;600 a week before tax, or just over &euro;30,000 a year, a fraction of what Deputies pay themselves.  Many of these minimum wage workers are those essential workers who kept shops opened and kept society functioning in the course of Covid.  They got a clap but they deserve a raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600015#N00300","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1643195520,"counter":61,"content":"<p>The biggest Internet database in the EU relating to the cost of living ranks Ireland as the sixth most expensive country in Europe in which to live.  We are ranked the most expensive for the cost of rent, with only Switzerland and Luxembourg being more expensive than this State.  The more frequently updated website, Expatistan, ranks Dublin as the fourth most expensive city in Europe, with only three Swiss cities being more expensive.  The Minister's Government, including Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, is presiding over a rapid increase in costs in this State, including costs to families, businesses and to society.  Precious little is being done by the Government to put the brakes on these increases in costs that are affecting people throughout society at the moment.  There have been 31 separate price increases in energy supplies in 2021 alone.<\/p> <p>Farmers who are producing food have seen fertilisers, one of their most important inputs, triple in price in the last 12 months.  That will mean an increase in food prices in the family home shortly as well.  Energy costs have increased by more than 50%.  Inflation in this State hit a 20-year high last November.  There is no doubt that there are international factors, but the Government is playing a role in the increase in costs to families at the moment.  <br\/><br\/>I want to mention the issue of housing and supply chains in this State.  In the first quarter of 2021, house building was closed down.  For four months, no homes were built.  A total of 10,000 home under construction were not worked on.  We were the only country in Europe that closed building sites completely in the first quarter of last year.  Therefore, the country that had the biggest housing crisis was the only country that completely shut down the building of houses.  Many of the supply chain problems we are seeing are outworkings of the Government's over-reliance on enormously long and severe restrictions.  It is unfortunate that no other party will mention that in this debate.  <br\/><br\/>Fuel is one of the main sources of these price increases.  The Government has settled upon a carbon tax policy, which is draconian and blunt.  It raises tax years in advance.  The Minister does not even know the circumstances that people are going to be living in in two or three years, yet he is setting a carbon tax for those years, which is incredible.  Carbon tax is meant to achieve a price to push people away from carbon fuels, but if the market has already achieved that price, then the carbon tax is punitive.  It has no purpose other than to hurt many families around the country.  The Minister could go to the EU and look for a VAT derogation.  I spoke to the Taoiseach yesterday.  He said that he has never asked the E U for a derogation on VAT.  The only thing that seems to be warm this winter is the Government&rsquo;s hands, from sitting on them all the time in regard to these issues.<br\/><br\/>I would bet the Minister all the money that we have that the Government has never gone and asked the EU to set the interest rates to have some level of break in respect of inflation.  This is because Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il do not do that.  It is a <i>laissez faire<\/i>political party that allows these things to happen to families right across the country and it is wrong. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600015#N00400","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643196120,"counter":63,"content":"<p>First, I take this opportunity thank the Labour Party for tabling this important motion for us to debate here in the House.  I am glad the Minister is present.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we speak openly about what is happening at the moment.  In my constituency of Galway East, there is a huge amount of angst over the fact that fuel prices are going up.  The reason for this angst is that the car is the essential mode of transport many people in the constituency.  It is important to point out that the carbon tax is driving up that price right now, as well as all the other prices.  The people who are paying this carbon tax and who need their cars as an essential to travel to work, to draw their pensions or whatever it is, have no other mode of transport.  They are getting nothing back from that.  It is important that we recognise that the carbon tax are not giving anything back to these communities.  They cannot see it.  While it will happen, it is not happening right now.  We need to look at the carbon tax for people in areas where the car is the only mode of transport.  It is ill-timed, given the rising increases.  <\/p>  <p>  As a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, I would also raise the fact that people with disabilities who are on a fixed income are really suffering at the moment.  They do not have enough money to live, never mind to meet the price increases.  An Indecon report stated that for a person with disability, the cost of living is in excess of &euro;9,000 per annum more than for those without a disability.  That needs to be examined.  The transport support schemes for people with disabilities and the primary medical certificate need to be sorted out as a matter of urgency.  The resignation of the appeals board again shows that there is something fundamentally wrong with the way we are trying to support people with disabilities.  I ask the Minister to take that on board as a matter of urgency.  <\/p>  <p>  It is all very well to talk and criticise or whatever, but we need to provide solutions to these problems.  The first thing that should be done is that anybody who is on a fixed social welfare income and who is in fuel poverty should have their income linked to the consumer price index as a baseline.  The reason for that is that they will achieve the same income regardless of where inflation is going.  On top of that, we should look at how we can repair the stagnation in their incomes during the recession when the Government did not give increases in social welfare.  People who are retired and people who are in fuel poverty deserve something more than what they are getting at the moment.  I ask the Government to look at this in a meaningful way.  <\/p>  <p>  I refer also to agriculture and food production.  One of the biggest challenges facing farmers right now is the cost of fertiliser.  People might ask what that has to do with the cost of living.  It will directly feed into the cost of food.  It will directly feed into an increase of the cost of milk, meat and whatever will be on the shelf.  That is not scaremongering.  This year, fertiliser costs three times the price that it did last year.  That is continuing unabated.  It is important that we look at that in a way that addresses the problems that are rising with inflation.  I do not believe that increasing wages will solve all the problems.  It may add to further inflation.  We need to be careful about how we manage this.  Some people will say that some of the increases that are happening now will abate and we will end up getting back to normal.  However, the reality is that if the price increases stagnate now, they will remain at that level.  That is a hell of a lot higher than they were this time last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600016#O00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1643196120,"counter":64,"content":"<p>There has been more inflation and price volatility in the past 11 months than there has been in the previous 12 years combined.  Fuel and electricity account for approximately half of current inflationary pressures.  Green policies are the main cause of this.  Inflation forecasts are unusually uncertain due to ongoing changes in the global circumstances.  Covid-19 has disrupted global supply chains, transport and manufacturing, mainly because of pandemic restrictions globally.  The rushed and ill-conceived policy changes being brought in by this Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party Government to meet climate change targets are likely to increase inflationary pressures significantly in the long term, especially for fuel, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office in its January report, Inflation Issues for Ireland 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Housing, land and rent prices have increased significantly due to the demand.  They are likely to continue to do so depending on supply.  Irish farmers are experiencing a nightmare with input costs as fertiliser prices have hit record high levels in the past several months, with all three groups of nutrients, potash, phosphate and nitrogen more than doubling, and even tripling in prices in some cases.  Average fertiliser prices a year ago were high at a cost of &euro;300 per tonne.  Today, prices have skyrocketed, with calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN, fertiliser costing Irish farmers more than &euro;600 per tonne.  Urea costs more than &euro;900 per tonne.<\/p>  <p>  The latest EU data indicates that inflation across the eurozone rose by a further record 5% in December alone.  This destroys the Government&rsquo;s argument that inflation is transitory because increased price pressures remain high.  Rising consumer costs on everything from groceries to home heating and electricity are having a crippling impact on Irish workers and families.  Many households have experienced a significant income drop due to the Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns while outgoings continue to climb.  This is putting huge pressure on families and finances.  It is putting many into financial crisis situations.  In west Cork, every weekend there are people in my clinic offices telling me that they cannot continue and that they cannot afford to pay the bills that are being put before them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600016#O00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1643196120,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I am glad to speak to this motion.

I am very mindful of the struggles that many rural farming families face in terms of rising costs of fertiliser and a very unfair and unjustifiable carbon tax that was imposed on people.<\/p>  <p>  I note in particular that the motion highlights the fact the average Irish mortgage interest rate of 2.79% is more than twice the EU average of 1.31%, costing households more than &euro;2,000 a year.  In many cases, that can be the making or breaking of families, and in this case it is the breaking of families because they are obviously being charged a lot more than the EU average.  That is something the Government must tackle.  There is no excuse for that but there has been no action to date from the Government to bring this down.  It has to happen.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue I want to highlight is that Ireland has the second-highest OECD household spend on childcare costs, with couples spending an average of 24% of income and single parents spending 29% of their wages on childcare costs.  This can be a factor that pushes women out of the workforce and it needs to be addressed.  Obviously, we need reform of the childcare sector and services and how that operates, but we also need to ensure that families receive proper childcare value for money and that the service providers are in receipt of proper interventions to allow them to continue in their businesses.<\/p>  <p>  I am very concerned by the fact the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has said its calls for help this year will be at the highest level in its history and that it could reach 200,000 people by the end of this year.  That is deeply alarming and is something we must address collectively.  I call on the Government to stand up for people, in particular low income families and working families, who are being treated appallingly in this country, as well as for our pensioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600017#P05900","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1643196720,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion on the cost of living and I thank Deputy Nash for putting it on the agenda.<\/p>  <p>  We know that, over the past 14 months, inflation has risen by 5.5%.  That 5.5% is just a figure but the reality of that 5.5% is increases in basics such as bread, milk, butter, pasta and other groceries.  It is estimated that the weekly shop for the average family is up by &euro;15 a week, or &euro;780 a year.  If we add in extra costs like energy, which is up by &euro;500 per year, and another &euro;500 for petrol and diesel, it is heading towards the &euro;2,000 mark.  To recoup that in wages, when we take account of income tax and PRSI, a person would need an increase of somewhere between &euro;3,500 to &euro;4,000 in their pay packet.  The typical pay for 50% of wage earners is &euro;34,500 so a &euro;3,500 increase means a 10% rise.  If a person is one of the 25% earning less than &euro;21,700 a year, they would be looking for a 15% pay increase, and that is just to stand still and not even to get ahead of it.<\/p>  <p>  We live in a very unequal society and the key factor is a very unequal distribution of pay.  Between 2010 and 2019, the higher paid managers and professionals had a nominal wage increase of 20%, whereas most workers' wages were at best stagnant and low skilled workers in the public sector saw a nominal fall of 3% and, in real terms, 10%.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach was appalled at the notion of what he described as a wage spiral, but this is precisely what is needed to challenge the huge inequalities in our society and the huge disparity in wealth and incomes that increased during the pandemic.  The Taoiseach should look at the latest report on wealth from Oxfam, which points out that wage increases do not cause inflation; they reduce profits.<\/p>  <p>  The motion calls on the Government to legislate to enhance collective bargaining laws and frameworks to ensure that working people obtain a fair share of the wealth they produce.  I would fully support such legislation but I would also say to workers, especially low-paid workers, not to hold their breath and to join a union, get organised and fight for what they need and are entitled to.<\/p>  <p>  I fully agree that the &euro;100 credit on energy bills is tokenistic.  The Government needs to do much more in targeting measures to help those on the lowest incomes.  The &euro;5 weekly increase across the board in basic welfare payments was not enough to keep pace with inflation, even before these increases.  To make up for the fact there was no increase in the provisions in the previous two budgets, this would have needed at least a &euro;10 per week increase.  It is crucial this is now remediated.  A 30 cent increase in the hourly minimum wage is a joke.  Some 630,000 people live at risk of poverty, including some 200,000 children.<\/p> <p>These are the people who will be hit hardest by these increases and this is before we consider the cost of childcare, with single parents paying 30% of their income on it, the huge increases in rents and house prices, interest rates and the fact that mortgage interest rates are double the EU average.  We need a revolution.  We need a mass movement of workers not just to demand change but to achieve it and, after 100 years, to create the republic we never got.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600017#P06000","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643197320,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this motion.  While I do not support it, it is a very valuable opportunity for the D&aacute;il to reflect on where our economy, society, citizens and workers stand today as we continue to see very significant change and new pressures in our economy, with which I will deal in my statement.<\/p><p>I acknowledge some common ground on the issues being raised by the Labour Party and the analysis I and the Government have regarding where we are.  I acknowledge that for many families, workers and employers, particularly small and medium-sized employers, just as we hope we have put the darkest days of the Covid-19 pandemic behind us along with the significant economic insecurity and anxiety and the basic fear workers had to confront in recent years about whether a job would still be available once we defeated this pandemic, many families, businesses and workers find themselves dealing with a cost of living crisis, with prices of their key essential utilities and services rising far more quickly than was the case in their recent experience.  I acknowledge the added level of worry and challenge this presents to many at the moment, especially those on fixed and low incomes.  I acknowledge the points made by Deputies Nash and Howlin and others in recent days.<\/p><p>However, I will make two points that have not been present in the debate today.  The first is that as we exit this pandemic, we have a national debt that is more than a quarter of a trillion euro.  Many of the different demands I heard articulated here this morning regarding spending and doing more do not reflect the fact we now have, on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis one of the highest levels of public debt in the developed world.  That matters too for the living standards and prospects of the citizens being discussed today.<\/p><p>The second point is to underscore that while our economic prospects are changing and getting better in terms of job retention and creating more jobs in the future, we cannot forget the risks we were aware of before we entered the very dark days of this pandemic.  These risks have been raised with me by some in this House and many outside it regarding where we stand with corporation tax in the future, with a reliance on corporation tax revenue that has deepened as we have moved through the darker days of this pandemic.  Of course, that revenue was coming in at exactly the point where we needed it.<\/p><p>The further area of difference, which is telling in this debate, is that when we have had many debates in this House regarding the state of our economy during the pandemic, they have been dominated by the question of how we can keep jobs, how we can ensure those on the pandemic unemployment payment have a job to go back to and how we support the viability of employers at a point when we are asking them to close.  I acknowledge the role of the Labour Party regarding ideas it brought forward during the pandemic and its support for many measures brought forward by the Government to deal with Covid.  Seeing the debate that broke out across the Opposition benches, I acknowledge that if it was not for the role played by the Labour Party and some of the Deputies putting forward this motion during the equally dark days before the pandemic hit, we would not have an economy that was in recovery and national finances that were in such good condition before the pandemic hit.  It is a point that will not be acknowledged by others but I acknowledge the role played by the Labour Party in getting us to this point.<\/p><p>Having acknowledged the areas where I agree and disagree with the Labour Party, before I address what the Government has done and is willing to do, I again say we recognise the challenge and understand the added anxiety and worry many workers, families and businesses are facing, but this is exactly what guided the introduction of the measures in budget 2022 that are being implemented.  These measures were about how we deal with a cost of living we expected to increase, the clear warning signs of which became apparent across October, November and December.  It is the reason we brought forward a range of social welfare measures dealing most importantly with the key rates, such as increases of &euro;5 that make a difference to those on those rates, although I acknowledge that with the existing pressure, those people will be looking at how they deal with a cost of living that is increasing.  This is the reason the Government brought forward not just a change in the key rates but also changes in the qualified child allowance, energy payments and the working family payment.  We made increases in those payments in anticipation of the challenges many are facing at the moment.  It is also why, through the Minister for Health, the Government brought forward measures to help families with the affordability of healthcare relating to GP care and prescription costs, again recognising this is adding to the cost that many are facing.  It is also the reason the Government brought forward measures to slow down and, where we can, freeze the increases in costs many are facing regarding childcare.<\/p><p>The Government has brought forward measures and put forward a package to deal with the challenges that exist at the moment, but it is also the reason we brought forward changes and increases in personal tax credits and measures to increase the amount of income at which somebody will pay the lower rate of tax as opposed to the higher rate.  We brought forward measures that make a difference to every taxpayer in the country.  This House resisted and voted against this measures.  The reality is that, if I had not brought forward those measures, the Deputies who voted against them would be here today accusing me of presiding over stealth charges.  They would be accusing me of not making changes that are needed for low and middle-income workers to make a contribution to their after-tax pay rising with the cost of living.  That is an essential area of difference.  This Government and I believe affordable changes relating to personal taxation at a time when the cost of living is an increased burden for many is a core part of how we can respond to the challenges we face.<\/p><p>I heard Deputy Paul Murphy make the point that as wages and the cost of living increase, for some taxes, particularly income tax, in many cases this will automatically make a difference to the level of personal taxes collected by the State.  I believe that at a time of rising inflation when wages are changing, for this and other reasons, it is very important to use a share of that to help workers deal with the increased cost of living.  It is a reality that this is a measure that was opposed by many who support this motion today.<\/p><p>It is also why, through the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Government recently introduced a measure to help with the increased cost of energy at a time when this cost is really biting for many.<\/p> <p>Again, I hear from many descriptions that it is tokenistic and should go further.  The key argument I would make to the House this morning is the importance of seeing all these measures in the round.  The measures I have just detailed, which are worth between &euro;1.2 billion and &euro;1.3 billion, have been implemented through the budget.  Those further changes were introduced this year to help with what we acknowledge is a rising challenge for many.<\/p> <p> I heard Deputy Joan Collins conclude by saying what we need is a revolution.  What we need is progress.  With the State having shown its ability to stand by citizens at a time of such challenge, we are seeing the effect of our efforts now as our economy shows the signs of beginning to recover very strongly.  The Government will use the proceeds of that recovery that has been delivered by the stamina and resilience of our country, combined with the right decisions by this and the previous Government, to continue to do all we can to make a difference in what we acknowledge is a rising burden and cost and an additional source of anxiety for many.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600018#Q00200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643197920,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I will share time with my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith.<\/p><p>I commend and thank my friend and colleague, Deputy Nash, for crafting this motion, which addresses the most serious and fundamental issue facing Irish society and our economy.  I would have thought it would have united this House in collectively trying to find solutions to the real hardship that affects people.  It is disconcerting there are still Members here who want to make political capital rather than try to solve real issues that affect all our citizens and constituents.<\/p><p>My colleagues have covered a broad canvas in this debate but at its core is the real challenge of the crisis being faced by ever more households to meet the cost of everyday living, including heating, transport, food, clothing and rent.  It has all been put in very stark detail to the House.  The sums for a growing number of families simply do not add up, and the consequences are depression, despair and a sense, which we all are hearing increasingly in our offices, that working people are working ever harder and they just cannot keep going because it seems the harder they work, the deeper they are sinking into debt.<\/p><p>I want to touch on the issue of work and pay.  Members will have read of the research done by the Irish Tax Institute in conjunction with KPMG.  It took a look, on a worldwide basis, at tax rates on income in 2021 and what it set out is no surprise to us.  Ireland has the most progressive tax regime on income in the OECD.  High earners here pay relatively high taxes.  On an income of &euro;150,000, an Irish worker pays an effective tax rate of 43%, almost the same rate as a German worker but more than double the rate of a Singapore-based worker, more than 40% more than a US worker and 9% more than a UK-based worker.  At the other end of the spectrum, thanks to Ireland&rsquo;s progressive system, workers here on &euro;25,000 pay an effective rate of 12.5%.<\/p><p>However, the most telling issue that came out of that analysis is the high proportion of Irish workers who do not pay tax at all.  Fiona Reddan in an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>yesterday quoted Revenue figures that tell us that in 2022 almost 1 million earners will not pay income tax and 797,600 will not pay either income tax or the universal social charge.  That is 27.8% of all income earners.  That is less than last year when it was 30%.<\/p><p>The lesson I want to highlight from that is not an issue related to taxation, which we have worked hard to achieve - the Labour Party, in successive governments, has helped build that progressive income tax platform and it has been one of issues upon which we focused - rather it is to point out to the House the fact that far too many Irish workers exist on low pay.  We have partially masked that through our tax system and income transfers through the social welfare system through what was formerly known as the family income supplement and now known as the working family payment.  One million workers do not earn enough to pay tax.  Too many Irish workers are paid too little.  That is the simple message.  Workers need a break.<\/p><p>We built two economies, one where at least a third of our workforce is barely getting by, that 30% I mentioned, and cost pressures are now putting them under, and a second economy where tech, medical devices, ICT and pharma and many professionals servicing those are thriving.  I am delighted to see a thriving sector of our economy but we cannot have two parallel economies, one doing really well and one where people cannot get by on the wages they are earning.  We have to address that reality.  It was depressing to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments at the beginning of this debate and the Taoiseach say yesterday that somehow workers looking for wage increases will cause wage price spirals.  The real issue in our economy is a skills shortage.  Those with those skills who are already reasonably paid will get more but we cannot leave 30% of the workforce behind.  I hope the realisation that we need to address low pay in our economy will be one of the outcomes of this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600019#R00300","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1643197920,"counter":131,"content":"<p>A debate on flexible working arrangements is currently taking place and we cannot miss this opportunity to introduce strong flexible work legislation because it has cost of living benefits in areas such as transport.  People are being pushed back into overcrowded buses and trains, the fares for which are expensive, and into their cars, which emit carbon and damage the atmosphere, when we could provide stronger protections to enable them to work from home and to be as productive as they were during the past two years but also to enable them to save money and improve their quality of life, which is unquantifiable in many ways, and reduce their cost of living in areas such as transport.  The Government has promised a National Transport Authority flexible tax-saver ticket but we have not seen the details of it.  If flexible work arrangements are to be introduced in any fashion, such a ticket will be required.  Half-price fares for those under the age of 24 have also been promised but there is no sign of that being delivered.  There seems to be some sticking point about that.  The measures promised seem very far away from being delivered.<\/p>  <p>  In the area of health, there are cost of living issues related to GP costs for families.  Children aged eight and over are still excluded from the free GP scheme.  I raised a Topical Issue matter on dental care this morning.  Medical card holders with additional needs have to pay out of their own pockets for emergency dental care.  These are real, emergency cost of living issues for people.  We seem to be moving beyond the pandemic in terms of politics but there is still a role for the State to provide antigen tests and FFP2 masks to help suppress the virus throughout 2022.<\/p>  <p>  I have been following the entirety of the debate and I thank my colleague, Deputy Nash, for leading on it.  I have seen the work behind the scenes and how much we as a party believe in this issue and have pushed it earnestly, honestly and with some integrity.  That has been acknowledged by the vast majority of the Opposition and I thank those Members for that.  Those are Opposition Members who have crossed swords with us down the years and will do so again because we will differ on issues.  They know that when we or any other party bring forward a measure, be it a motion or a Bill, that is coming from the right place and will help people, they will support it.  They may make amendments to it, and we will accept the People before Profit amendment to motion, and make good contributions on it in the D&aacute;il.  That is why it is very disappointing when we see theatrics in the middle of a debate and Deputies who are more worried about a clip for their local radio station or their TikTok accounts than dealing with the substance of what is being discussed.<\/p>  <p>  In this debate the Opposition has reflected what we are saying, namely, there is an issue with low wages in this economy.  We need to see wages rise.  The Minister is an avid cinemagoer, an avid reader and likes to listen to music, but if he were to go to a cinema, a bookshop or buy traditional music and ask the retail or service workers in those establishments about this issue, he would know they would be struggling with the cost of living because the vast majority of them are living on low pay or below the living wage.<\/p> <p>That is what needs to change and that is at the centre of this motion.  Social welfare rates are so far behind the rate of inflation that any increase provided for in the last budget and, indeed, the previous budget has been wiped away and evaporated and it has had no real impact in improving the quality of life for those people.<\/p> <p> We are also proposing a windfall levy tax on energy companies and others.  That has worked in other jurisdictions and it would work here.  These are practical solutions.  Like everything we bring forward, this is a pro-worker motion that will help people in every part of Ireland.  We do not see Ireland as being divided.  We see one country and every region of it needs help and assistance from this Government and this House.  That is where we are coming from and where the vast majority of Opposition Members are coming from when they contribute to debates like this.  I commend this motion to the House and I hope it will receive support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600019#R00400","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1643198520,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1643198520,"counter":134,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600020#S00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1643198520,"counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600020#S00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1643198520,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Yesterday, I raised with the Taoiseach the out-of-control cost of living and the never-ending price hikes that workers and families are forced to endure.  I must say he came up very short in terms of a complete Government plan in respect of energy cost.  It seems he is either unable or unwilling to grasp the scale of the crisis that hard-pressed households deal with every day.  They know - even if the Taoiseach does not - a &euro;100 credit will barely make a dent in their colossal energy bills.<\/p>  <p>  I want to move on and ask the Taoiseach about another area that is driving the cost-of-living crisis.  Rip-off rents continue to soar on his watch in Government.  In fact, since Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael came together in 2016, rents have jumped by a colossal 46%.  Last year alone rents increased by over 8%.  Today the average rent is now over &euro;1,300 a month and in Dublin the average is a staggering &euro;1,916 per month, almost &euro;2,000.  This is extortionate.  This has real consequences on people's lives.  More than one third of young people in their mid to late 20s live at home with their parents.  Homeownership rates are collapsing among those aged between 25 and 54, and is it any wonder?  How on earth could anybody save the money for a deposit while forking out &euro;2,000 a month to a landlord?  That is before they deal with the sky-high cost of energy, fuel, groceries and, of course, childcare.  It is little wonder that we hear stories from renters having to choose between putting food on the table or paying their electricity bill.<\/p>  <p>  Generation rent, as they are called, is the generation cast aside by bad Government policies that continue to favour big landlords and institutional investors over the interests of those in housing need.  The Taoiseach's approach is failing.  His rent caps do not work for rent pressure zones and in counties where they do not apply, renters are left struggling with astronomical rises.  Meanwhile, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, delivered just 5% of the affordable rental homes promised for 2021.  Just 25 affordable rental homes were delivered in a whole year.  That is a serious failure when renters are being crucified and are crying out for quality accommodation with fair rents that will not break the bank.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has to get real now.  It is as simple as that.  It needs to turn away from policies that have not worked and embrace those that will.  T&aacute; c&iacute;osanna as smacht ag cabhr&uacute; leis an ng&eacute;arch&eacute;im costais mhaireacht&aacute;la a spreagadh.  T&aacute; teipthe ar chur chuige an Rialtais.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar am &euro;1,500 a chur ar ais i bp&oacute;ca&iacute; c&iacute;os&oacute;ir&iacute; tr&iacute;d ais&iacute;oc c&aacute;nach agus cosc a chur ar arduithe c&iacute;osa ar feadh tr&iacute; bliana.  Renters need a break and they need it now.  What the Government needs to do is to put money back in renters&rsquo; pockets by means of a tax rebate and it needs to place a ban on rent increases for three years.  It needs to do this with urgency because renters cannot wait any longer for the Government to act.  Let us be clear: unless the Government takes these actions, we will see more people pushed into homelessness, more young and not so young people moving back home to live with their parents and home homeownership will remain a pipe dream for an entire generation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600020#S00500","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1643198520,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising what I have repeatedly raised in this House, and since I became Taoiseach one year and a half ago, that housing is the single most important social issue facing our country at this time.  It is an enormous challenge that goes to the heart of cohesion within society and above all of giving younger generations, in particular, the opportunity to own their homes, to be able to buy homes at an affordable rate and to be able to rent at an affordable rate.  In addition to that, for those who are not in a position due to income and so forth we must provide a sufficient supply of public housing to enable people to get housing at a social-housing level.  That is why Housing for All represents a step change in housing policy.  It is a whole-of-Government approach to increasing supply significantly and getting more houses built annually.<\/p>  <p>  We were stymied and knocked back a bit due to Covid-19 in terms of the two lockdowns experienced in 2020 and 2021, but we have bounced back well in terms of construction.  The good news is that up to 30,000 commencements have been recorded in the 12 months up to last September.  That is very positive news.  The momentum is there, as is the pipeline.  Supply is important in ensuring affordability and an adequacy of housing availability across all the different models.  Housing for All allows for cost rental, affordable homes, social housing, as well as private sector investment which we need.  Housing for All estimates that we will need approximately &euro;10 billion per annum of private investment in addition to the State investment of &euro;4 billion per annum.  This is an unprecedented approach to housing but we need everybody on board.  I was struck by this and said it to the Deputy yesterday.  When we sanctioned at Cabinet the O'Devaney Gardens project yesterday, it is an illustration of what is holding back housing policy in this country-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600020#S00600","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1643198520,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600020#S00700","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1643198520,"counter":139,"content":"<p>-----that the most recent attempts, which started in 2008 and attempts were made in 2015 to get that project off the ground, was defeated by politics-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600020#S00800","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1643198520,"counter":140,"content":"<p>By Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600020#S00900","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1643198520,"counter":141,"content":"<p>-----on a consistent basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600020#S01000","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1643198520,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Greedy developers.

It is very distressing for all of the families concerned.  These parents did the right thing and went to south Kerry CAMHS to get professional help for their children.  Some waited up to two years to access that service.  Instead of helping their children, the service actually harmed them.  The treatment of 227 children by a junior doctor, who is not named in the report although he has been named in the media, was deemed risky.  Some 46 children suffered significant harm, including lethargy, distress, raised blood pressure, significant weight gain and even the production of breast milk.  The trauma these children and their families endured is unimaginable.  While this junior doctor's prescribing practices and the inappropriate use of combinations of drugs, including antipsychotic drugs, were clearly appalling, the damage caused to children would not have been as long-lasting or extensive if he had been properly supervised.  Of course, he was not.  The report details a service that was entirely chaotic.  Concerns were raised about this doctor in 2018 but these concerns were not followed up on.  In fact, the doctor was recommended for other jobs in 2020.  There has been no full-time consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist in south Kerry CAMHS since 2016.  There is still no full-time consultant.<\/p>  <p>  This report details endemic problems with south Kerry CAMHS, but media reports today suggest that a review is also to be undertaken in north Kerry CAMHS.  I am sure that many families accessing CAMHS across the country now have questions they wish to be answered.  It should be noted that there are nearly 3,000 children on CAMHS waiting lists.  Most of these have been waiting for an appointment for more than three months.<\/p>  <p>  What is going to be done to ensure accountability for what happened in south Kerry CAMHS?  Is anyone other than the junior doctor in question going to lose his or her job or even be formally reprimanded?  When will a full-time consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist be appointed to south Kerry CAMHS?  Is the Government going to authorise a wider inquiry into CAMHS around the country to ensure the care of children is receiving appropriate supervision and resourcing in order to restore public confidence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600021#T04800","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1643199120,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this profoundly serious issue.  I have read the executive summary of the report - the preliminary section of it.  It is shocking and very serious.  What happened is unacceptable.  It represents a damning indictment of the service.  The first principle of medicine is to do no harm.  Children were harmed here by a complete failure of clinical performance and oversight and by the entire management of the service.  As the Deputy has outlined, the treatment of 227 children was deemed risky by the report, which does not pull any punches to be fair to the consultant, Dr. Se&aacute;n Maskey, who came over from the UK.  The report says that 46 children were harmed significantly.  It goes through what is meant by harm.  Some children gained a lot of weight.  Some were sleepy during the day, had raised blood pressure or produced breast milk.  These were the results of overprescribing and a lack of oversight.<\/p> <p>It demands a fundamental review, not just of south Kerry but of the overall situation pertaining to child and adolescent mental health.  To be frank, it is not a resources issue.  The resources are there to make appointments.  It seems there have been ongoing difficulties over the years in recruiting senior clinicians in psychiatry to these posts in certain parts of the country and especially in CAMHS.  Following the publication of the report, the HSE has apologised and communicated with all the parents involved.  My understanding is that there has been an extensive look-back over 1,300 files.  I outlined the outcome in that regard.  It is important to say that it is not the parents&rsquo; fault, because many are feeling guilty.  I watched one parent last evening on the \"Six One News\" say that she was taking on some of the guilt herself regarding what had happened.  It is not the parents&rsquo; fault, though, because they will go by what is indicated or advised by the treating clinician.<\/p> <p> Following the publication of the report, there will be a full audit nationwide of compliance with CAMHS operational guidelines by all CAMHS teams.  In addition, a prescribing audit will be conducted in each of the 72 CAMHS teams.  It will include a random selection of files proportional to the medical caseload from a continuous six-month predefined period in 2021.

He has now resigned from the HSE because he said he received no support and was sidelined after he blew the whistle.  Again, serious questions are being raised in our State agencies about the treatment of whistleblowers.  This of course raises very serious questions for senior management within the HSE and about the culture there.  I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment to a wider inquiry.  I ask him to confirm that this wider inquiry will also include an examination of the treatment of the whistleblower in this case.

It must also be said that there are many good practises across the country and many good practitioners and psychiatrists who are angry and annoyed with what has transpired here.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct, however, in saying this is not just about one in NCHD.  There is a systemic collapse here in respect of overall clinical governance and overall management of the service.  Any review must look end-to-end at it.  Questions were raised, including the fundamental decision to have an NCHD in charge of a community area and so on.  People may have made a call at the time, but even that must be interrogated in respect of best practice in future.  There is a broader issue around the recruitment of qualified personnel within the mental health arena generally.  We must face up to that now.

Incredibly, the T&aacute;naiste cited a 3% increase in the minimum wage as an example of the Government protecting workers from the ravages of inflation.  How can the T&aacute;naiste make such a comment when he knows lower-paid workers are the ones hit hardest by inflation and that inflation is increasing at nearly twice the rate that the minimum wage increased?  At a time when Germany is increasing its minimum wage to &euro;12 an hour, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government has effectively cut the wages of the lowest-paid workers in this country.  Shame on you, Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  He also voiced opposition to wage increases in line with inflation here yesterday.  He tried to deny it, but he did.  Instead, he said that workers would need to be compensated by an increase in the social wage.  Does the Taoiseach expect working people to have any confidence in his words when he decided to compensate them for about 15% of their increased energy bills, while leaving them to dig deep for the remaining 85%?  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s words might be taken a bit more seriously if he were to introduce free childcare for all, legislate to cut rents, bring in free public transport or abolish fees for third level.  Anything less than measures such as these and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments about the Vincentian model will be seen merely as waffle and guff.<\/p>  <p>  Workers at Glen Dimplex in Northern Ireland have won a 13.5% pay increase.  Unite the Union has won 25 pay increases at, or above, the rate of inflation in Northern Ireland and Britain.  How did it do that?  How did it successfully defend workers' living standards?  It was not by politely asking employers maybe to grant pay increases, as the T&aacute;naiste did yesterday.  The union did it by organising, by balloting for industrial action and by taking industrial action where necessary.  That is the example which must be followed here now.  The bosses can well afford it.<\/p>  <p>  Let us talk about profit inflation.  The Musgrave Group made pre-tax profits of &euro;98 million in 2020, while Facebook made after-tax profits of &euro;623 million.  I could quote hundreds more examples like that to the Taoiseach, if I had the time.  A rise in wages leads to a cut in profits and not to a rise in prices, as the Taoiseach falsely implied here yesterday.  Within one month, therefore, will the Taoiseach introduce an emergency package of measures to compensate ordinary people fully for inflation?  Will he revisit the question of the minimum wage now that inflation is double the rate of the increase?  Will he also voice support for workers submitting pay claims which, at the very least, match the rate of inflation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600022#U00600","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1643199720,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Again, people at different times can distort what gets said.  I warned against a wage-price inflationary cycle, but not against wage increases, which have occurred in the Irish economy and that have been linked with productivity and other factors.  The latest data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, show that average hourly earnings rose 3.8% in the third quarter of 2021, from a year earlier, and were up 7.6% from their pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of 2019.  We could go through the annual average wage inflation over that period as well, but that is not relevant now.  It may be academically, but the reality now is that prices are increasing significantly because of the global energy crisis and supply chain issues arising out of the impact of Covid-19.  I was simply pointing out yesterday that the global situation has to be taken on board.  It is not the Irish Government that has cut anyone&rsquo;s wage or income.<\/p>  <p>  The Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland is clear that the wage increases so far are linked to increases in productivity, which is a good thing for the economy.  If we were to have wage increases greater than the increases in productivity, that could lead to businesses having to increase prices and so on, and that is in no one&rsquo;s interest.  What I said yesterday is that we must work intelligently through this.  That is why the Government worked in the budget on tax relief and on specific, targeted social welfare measures that would help low-income families in particular.  In addition to those social protection measures, however, we also took other decisions concerning the cost of living that would impact families in particular.<\/p> <p>Reducing paediatric hospital charges, increasing eligibility for families to access GPs for six- and seven-year-olds, and reducing the drugs payment scheme threshold are very targeted measures that make a real difference to families in certain circumstances.  It is the better, more intelligent approach to deal with the unprecedented inflationary cycle that we are currently experiencing.  The Central Bank believes that it will peak in 2022 and that we should hopefully be out of it by 2023.<\/p> <p> The Government has also taken measures in respect of the cost of energy through the rebate, which is a &euro;200 million cost.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan has introduced that.  The Government has approved the legislation which will reduce electricity bills by &euro;113.  We acknowledge that these measures just contribute to easing the burden of inflation on many families.  We will continue to work across the different areas to see if we can reduce that impact.  We would also like to engage with the social partners and others in terms of adopting an intelligent way to deal with this inflationary cycle that retains the best of what the economy has going for it right now.  The economy is producing jobs, which ultimately are the best protection against low incomes and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600022#U00700","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643200320,"counter":212,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach referred to a 3.8% year-on-year wage increase for workers.

Rents are up 8.3% and a lot more than that for many renters.  What we have in Irish society is a de facto wage cut for workers.  The Taoiseach is standing over that.

Gas prices are up 28% and home heating oil is up 53%.  Petrol and diesel are up 34%.  Food prices have not risen to that extent except for bread and cereals, which is problematic.  The problem is that energy prices feed into higher costs of production and distribution, which ultimately creates pressure in terms of inflation.

I did this before back on 3 November last.  I want to know what the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Taoiseach and the Government have done to get the price of fertiliser down to an acceptable or reasonable price for small suckler farmers in south Kerry and for dairy producers and tillage farmers in mid and north Kerry.  This time last year urea was &euro;330 a tonne.  It is now &euro;930 a tonne.  Nitrogen was &euro;240 and is now &euro;690.  Pasture sward was &euro;350 and is now &euro;700; and 18:6:12 is now &euro;790.  One farmer had a bill of &euro;7,000 last year, but it will be &euro;17,000 this year.  Farmers will go broke and fast, especially small farmers in Kerry.<\/p>  <p>  The main driver of the increased fertiliser costs in the EU and here is the massive increase in natural gas prices due to the green agenda to decarbonise electricity generation and also the EU policy to protect EU fertiliser producers by imposing levies on Russia and other countries supplying fertiliser into the EU.  I am calling on the Taoiseach to intervene with the EU and get these levies abolished.  Last Wednesday I attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and with others asked Fabien Santini of the EU Agriculture Commission what could be done to help our farmers in Kerry and around the country.  From his reply we understand that each member state will be allowed to provide unique farmer support through relaxation of the state aid framework.  This facility is only allowed until June this year.  At that meeting, the Green Party Deputy Brian Leddin outlined his pleasure at the increased cost of fertiliser to force crippled farmers into organising farms.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Green Party preventing the Taoiseach from helping the farmers?  If the Taoiseach cannot do something about fertiliser costs, in order to survive farmers will have to increase the cost of their products to the consumer.  Otherwise, they will go bust.  We all have been told recently that the cost of groceries to the housewife has gone up by &euro;780 in the last year.

I would point out that close to &euro;10 billion in total between European Union and Exchequer funding will support over 120,000 farm families over the next Common Agricultural Policy period between 2023 and 2027.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue has worked very hard on behalf of Irish farmers to get the best package possible in the context of the common agricultural strategy over the next number of years.  In addition to that, close to &euro;4.5 billion has been paid out to farmers since June 2020 through various schemes like the basic payment scheme, the areas of natural constraint scheme, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme and the beef scheme.  Average family farm income increased during 2020 and again in 2021 for the third year in a row, reflecting good output prices.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Deputy is correct when he says that there is very significant concern on the cost side in 2022 for farmers in the context of what he has outlined, the price of fertiliser.  The high price of natural gas, which is a key ingredient in fertiliser production as the Deputy knows, has caused very significant disruption in production in the international fertiliser industry.  This is a global problem and issue.  Large increases in energy prices are a Europe-wide phenomenon.  It is a combination of global demand for gas as economies recover from Covid as well as lower flows of gas from Russia.  Given that Europe receives a large amount of its gas supply from Russia, the geopolitical impact of the current build-up of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border may even drive gas and fertiliser prices up further.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, has raised these rising costs at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting.<\/p> <p>He has called on the European Union Commission to consider all options to ease the pressure on farmers at this time.  That includes monitoring the evolution of markets linked to agricultural impacts, particularly in relation to fertilisers; the question, which I think the Deputy raised, as to whether the imposition of anti-dumping duties on fertiliser imports continues to be appropriate, given the current crisis; and for this matter to be examined as a priority.  The Minister has raised that with the Commission.<\/p> <p> This is nothing to do with national politics or the particular political perspectives that parties may have in respect of climate and so on, but side by side with that, the Minister is working on giving supports through a number of measures, including soil fertility, greater use of clover and multispecies swards, to reduce dependency on chemical nitrogen fertiliser.  That work is under way.  That will help but the bigger issue is to try to deal with the current crisis in gas price increases that is feeding into the fertiliser problem.  It is a very significant issue.  I know that the Minister has asked Teagasc to develop a roadmap for assisting farmers in the short term as well as offering some long-term solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600023#V00700","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643200920,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply but I am not satisfied that we are helping farmers with their current plight.

I am asking the Government to subsidise the cost of the fertiliser.  If we look far enough ahead, we will see that the current situation will increase the cost of food as well.  If the cost to the farmer of what he or she produces increases, who will pay for it only the consumer?

In addition, we have, through the carbon tax revenue, ring-fenced significant funding for a new ambitious agri-environmental scheme to be rolled out under the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, programme.  That new agri-environmental scheme will target in the region of 50,000 participants with a maximum payment of up to &euro;10,000 to individual farmers.

In order to give students and teachers clarity and a chance to focus on the months ahead of them, a decision is needed as soon as possible.  Will the opportunity to learn from the past two years be taken and an improved leaving certificate put in place this year instead of the traditional leaving certificate?

Young people are being targeted by older experienced drug dealers to sell and deliver drugs.  Children are being groomed and coerced by unscrupulous drug dealers.  They are attracted by the flashy cars and new runners, a few bob in their pockets and the status of being considered a so-called somebody.  These criminals are nobodies.  They groom our children, suck the lifeblood from our communities and offer nothing in return.  While we need to examine the underlying reasons children are attracted to this lifestyle, such as poverty, we also need as legislators to put things in place that will make it more difficult for these criminals to operate.  The Bill would mean a prosecutor need not prove the drug is a controlled drug nor prove the person being prosecuted knew the child was a child irrespective of the quantity of drugs involved.  The Bill would close any loophole the criminals may be exploiting at present.  The Bill would make it a stand-alone offence for adults to use children for the sale and distribution of drugs.  It would make it easier for the Garda to press charges against these adult criminals.

In that context, I requested that an investigation be carried out.  The investigation is being undertaken by a senior official in my Department and is being done in the context of a broader examination of the overall arrangements that are in place for the management of documents for Government meetings and the protection of their confidentiality.  That process is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  What I can say is the Government is very clearly focused on making progress with the comprehensive action plan we have set out for the survivors and former residents.  As the Deputies are aware, on 13 January 2021 last, I apologised on behalf of the Irish Government to those who spent time in a mother and baby home or a county home.  The Government engaged with the groups and published an action plan for survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions on 16 November 2021.  This plan recognises the failures of the past, acknowledges the hurt that continues to be felt by survivors, and seeks to rebuild a relationship of trust between the State and those who have been so gravely wronged.<\/p>  <p>  The 22 actions set out in the action plan have been developed to respond to the broadest range of needs and wishes that survivors have expressed.  Actions have been arranged into central themes that have emerged as fundamental in how the Government responds.  These are: a survivor-centred approach, a formal State apology, access to personal information, enduring archive and database development, education and research, memorialisation, restorative recognition, and dignified burial.<\/p>  <p>  Central to the development of each of these actions has been detailed and sustained engagement with survivors and their families.  The establishment of the mother and baby institutions payment schemes will provide financial payments and an enhanced medical card to defined groups in acknowledgement of suffering experienced while resident in a mother and baby home and county home institution.  The State will fund the scheme and it is estimated that it will cost approximately &euro;800 million.  The Government intends to seek contributions towards the cost of the scheme from the religious congregations that were involved in operating the institutions.  The legislation required to establish the scheme is currently being developed as a matter of priority and it is intended that the scheme will open for applications as soon as possible in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies know, on 12 January last, the Government published the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022.  It passed Second Stage in this House last week and has been referred to the select committee for detailed examination.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has taken possession of the archive of the commission of investigation and has established a dedicated information management unit to lead on the management of the commission's archive, including applications for access to these records.  A professional archivist has been appointed to work within the unit to focus on the preservation of and public access to these records.<\/p>  <p>  The draft certain institutional burials (authorised interventions) Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the first half of 2021 and the joint committee published its report on 15 July.  It was clear from engagement with survivors and former residents that memorialisation was considered to be a very important part of the healing process for those affected.  The Government also acknowledges that memorialisation plays a role in helping to remove the stigma and shame that has deeply affected so many.  The commitment to a national memorial and records centre will be progressed by means of a group chaired by the Secretary General to the Government.  Funding has been secured to support this process, which will develop an overarching vision and proposed approach for the creation of the national centre and which will be brought to Government for approval.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600028#AA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1643203320,"counter":329,"content":"<p>We have 11 minutes remaining and I suggest we will have one minute per question if we are to get through all of this business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600028#AA01600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1643203320,"counter":330,"content":"<p>A year has now passed since the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, wrote to the Secretary General of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department seeking an investigation into the leaking to the media of the commission&rsquo;s final report.

The Taoiseach&rsquo;s response on this delay is not acceptable.  He gave a commitment to investigate this leak.  Survivors, their families and those of us who represent them here were repeatedly told the process is ongoing without providing any detail of what that statement actually means.  It was the decision of the Taoiseach to tag this investigation on to a broader examination of multiple Cabinet leaks.  If this particular examination cannot be completed in a reasonable timeframe, then it is time to separate this out from the rest of these.  This dithering and delay is in the context of the Government having to accept and acknowledge in the High Court that the commission of investigation treated witnesses unlawfully and the release of a redress scheme based on findings and recommendations that have been utterly discredited.

Will the Taoiseach tell the House when this investigation is over?  If he cannot find out what happened, he should just say that, as bad as that would be.  These people deserve closure.  If he cannot find out what happened or, dare I say it, some people may not want to say what happened, that would be wrong but at least it would bring some form of closure.  The idea that this can just rumble on and on is just another slap in the face to the families and the survivors.

Despite the constraints of the pandemic, considerable progress has continued to be made, as set out in the Global Ireland Progress Report published in May 2021.  This includes: a further significant expansion in our network of missions and agency offices; new strategies for IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland; our success in securing a seat on the United Nations Security Council; and support for the cultural sector, including for the new Irish Arts Centre which I was pleased to be able to dedicate in New York.  Since the publication of that report, further progress has been achieved in a number of areas and more work is planned for the year ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has approved the opening of embassies in Dakar, Senegal and Tehran and of consulates general in Toronto, Lyon and Miami.  A new office is also being opened in San Francisco by Tourism Ireland, and IDA Ireland is appointing representatives in Israel and Argentina.  A strategy to guide Ireland's relations with Latin America and the Caribbean will be launched on 15 February.<\/p>  <p>  As the House will be aware, as a result of the pandemic it was not possible to celebrate St. Patrick's Day in the traditional way last year, with most events moving online.  We hope that it may be possible to resume some in-person events this year, depending on public health developments, which remain the most important consideration.  This year will mark the 13th Tourism Ireland Global Greening, which saw a record 725 sites and landmarks in 71 countries take part in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is currently preparing a new trade and investment strategy to advance Ireland's trade and investment goals, which will see us sustainably grow and diversify our export markets, including for our SME sector, and develop and expand our foreign direct investment, FDI, base.  We are also continuing to invest in developing new markets for Irish food - 2021 saw Minister-led virtual trade missions to Asia, Africa, the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.  It is hoped that in-person missions can recommence, when it is safe to do so, in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is playing an active role on the UN Security Council, leading efforts to secure humanitarian assistance in Syria and achieving an agreement on peacekeeping transitions.  We have also sought to highlight the dreadful conflict in Ethiopia and its humanitarian consequences.  In September, I chaired a meeting of the UN Security Council on the issue of climate and security.  We will continue work on this issue.  In budget 2022, the Government increased our overseas development assistance, ODA, budget by &euro;140 million, bringing Ireland's investment in ODA to over &euro;1 billion for the first time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600029#BB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1643203920,"counter":359,"content":"<p>We can take a little more time on these as there are not as many questions.

Throughout the pandemic, political leaders have correctly argued that we need to trust the science and listen to medical experts and clinicians.  Nevertheless, the Taoiseach's Government has set its face against the arguments of the WHO and so many experts on delivering vaccine equity.  Equally unjust is the European Commission blocking the introduction of a TRIPS waiver on Covid-19 vaccines and technology at the WTO's TRIPS council.<\/p>  <p>  A doctor living in my constituency wrote to me last week, reflecting on how appreciative she is to live in a country where a Covid-19 vaccine is readily available but saying that the arrival of the Omicron variant highlighted both the injustice and the real and remaining public health risk of global vaccine inequity.  She also noted that more than 100 companies across Africa, Asia and Latin America have the capacity to produce mRNA vaccines.  The proposal for a TRIPS waiver to remove barriers to vaccine production in the global south has the support of more than 100 countries, including the United States, yet EU governments continue to oppose the waiver.

There is no single or simple answer except that we must improve production capacity within Africa.  The European Union is uniquely the global organisation that will do just that.  Africa currently imports 99% of its vaccines and 94% of its medicines.  That is unsustainable and we must work within the EU with our partners in Africa.  There is a summit coming up and the European Union, through technology transfers in the short term, wants to deal with vaccine shortages.  It must also deal with distribution and logistics within many of the countries.  The question will no longer be about production or supply for the remainder of 2022 but rather distribution and getting vaccines into the arms of people.  That is something on which the European Union is committed to engaging with African partners on, with an overall package for Africa.  I am pushing strongly as Taoiseach that the European Council, along with the European Commission, should advocate a specific package for Africa in the context of Covid-19 and in the more medium term.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Aid and other organisations must refocus in the short term to help with the vaccine effort in the countries we help or support more generally across food, health and so on.

There will be a mid-term review in respect of the strategy.  On the Security Council, I commend the work of the Irish ambassador to the UN, Ms Geraldine Byrne Nason, and the team there.  I was delighted to meet with them in September.  I was struck by the idealism and commitment of the young civil servants working on the Irish team in the UN in New York.  It would give one hope for the future of this country that we have such quality people working on that UN Security Council brief, and learning so much.  They are working on some very difficult issues, from Syria to Ethiopia, and having an impact at the highest levels of international diplomacy.  We must continue to resource that and work very hard in our presidency of the United Nations Security Council.<\/p><p>I take Deputy Boyd Barrett's point.  Ireland's reputation is one of the countries with the highest numbers of recipients of the Nobel prize in literature and <i>per capita<\/i>I believe we have the highest number of Booker prize winners.  We support the arts and there has been an increase this year.  I am aware that the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin is working to try to create more embedded structures to support artists.  The first rationale for this is to try to develop creativity within our own country and within our own society, and to prioritise the arts and the flowering of the arts so that young people would aspire to be artists, writers, performers, musicians and so on.  We need to create a sustainable base for that.  While I would not understate the progress that has been made in this regard over the decades, more can always be done.  We must also take lessons from the Covid-19 experience.<\/p><p>I recall organising the first Global Irish Economic Forum in 2009 when I was the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The people of the Irish diaspora who were involved in senior positions across the globe came back in and did a bit of work over that weekend.  They came back with the idea that the most important calling card for Ireland is its creativity and, dare I say it, its prowess in the arts and creativity.  These were people who may not ordinarily have agreed with Deputy Boyd Barrett's financial or economic positions, and it is interesting that this came from them.  That has never left me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600031#DD00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","time":1643205120,"counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600031#DD00400"},{"type":"question","time":1643205120,"counter":376,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[61502\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600031#DD00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the advertising spend and initiatives promoted by his Department in 2021; and the project budget and plans in place for 2022.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1643205120,"counter":377,"content":"<p>My Department incurred expenditure of &euro;11,615,375 on advertising in 2021.

I understand that over &euro;9 million was spent on Covid-related advertising last year.  More than &euro;500,000 of that was spent on social media advertising.  By and large, this is a huge level of expenditure by the Government.  While it is absolutely necessary, I posit that it also gives the State a huge power when it comes to media.  The Government is a huge contributor to media advertising, which we all know with the changing media they are very dependent on.<\/p>  <p>  With most restrictions lifted, the prospect of less spend will also have a major impact on the revenues of newspapers and broadcasters, etc.  It is not clear to us what oversight is in place for this spending and who decides where the advertisements are run, where the spend goes and what the reasoning behind it is.  Will the Taoiseach give us some information on who make those decisions and how?  I am aware from many people who work in local media - radio and newspapers - that this has caused great concern with regard to how X publications and Y broadcasters were included but they were not.  Local radio stations and local newspapers are deeply concerned and would like transparency on this.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House who was particularly in charge of authorising the individual spend and deciding which media bodies got advertising across the country, nationally or locally and by broadcast and by newspaper?  Perhaps the Taoiseach will tell us if it was outsourced or partially outsourced, and if there was oversight by the Taoiseach's officials in the Department of such outsourcing.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House if his Department expects to continue the same level of spend this year, or how much he estimates it will be tailored down?  There are a lot of major questions with regard to the impact of the spend, how it was decided and whether it was outsourced.  One such question relates to the possibility of disproportionate spending with some broadcasters and media compared to the smaller media, broadcasters and newspapers across the State.<\/p>  <p>  Outside of the pandemic spending, what specific campaigns are planned by the Taoiseach's Department for this year?  I note, for example, that the volume of people going for screening is not what it should be.  The Taoiseach is aware that I have spoken to him on this issue many times.  Will the Taoiseach be contemplating campaigns to increase awareness and participation in screening programmes, especially as they are so important?  The HPV vaccine is a real concern for me.  This is another issue on which I have campaigned and fought for inside this Chamber.  Will the Taoiseach include campaigns on the HPV vaccine?<\/p>  <p>  Are there other campaigns that relate to the promotion of Government launches, plans or reports that the Taoiseach's Department is projecting for this year?  Surely at this stage, at the end of January, the Taoiseach will have decided same.  Does the Taoiseach expect any spending on advertising to take place outside of the State this year?  If so, will the Taoiseach tell the House if this spending will take place in the UK, Northern Ireland, the EU or the US?<\/p>  <p>  I must have asked ten different questions there.  I ask all of these questions because I remember quite distinctly the Taoiseach's contributions in this Chamber - when he sat over where Deputy McDonald sits now - on the strategic communications unit, spending, the lack of oversight, the lack of foresight, small newspapers, small radio stations, political actions etc.  We need full accountability and full transparency, and we also need a full audit of how spending has been done, who made the decisions, whether it was outsourced, and who made the final calls.

One of the most urgent actions required to address Ireland's failure in this area is our obligations under the Istanbul Convention on Domestic Violence, in particular refuge places.  A report published by Safe Ireland during the pandemic found that, on average, seven requests every day for refuge went unmet because of a lack of capacity.  We know there are nine counties with no capacity at all in this jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  This week, Tusla confirmed to my colleague, Deputy Violet-Anne Wynne, that the refuge and safe home capacity has increased by just four places over the past seven years.  Where there is no route out of domestic violence, victims and their children are very often left with no option but to go back to an abusive and violent partner.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, wrote to me on 16 December to confirm he intended to bring the completed Tusla review of accommodation for victims of domestic violence to Cabinet in early January.  He said the review would be published at the same time and that all stakeholders would be briefed by Tusla.  <\/p>  <p>  However, yesterday I was informed by the Minister that the review will not now be published this month as promised and that the timing of its publication is now only being considered by the Minister for Justice.

Did the Taoiseach agree to the delay of the publication of the Tusla review at this meeting?  If so, what was his rationale for that?  I know this is a very bad decision.  We need to see the review and I urge the Taoiseach to ensure it is published without any further delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600032#EE00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1643205720,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I would like to see Government information flowing in respect of two areas with the sort of frequency and sophistication that we saw around Covid announcements.  I note there is a Government of Ireland document entitled Be Winter Ready.  We discussed at length the question of fuel energy price hikes.  Notwithstanding the debate around all of that, there is a real danger of people on low incomes, such as pensioners and so on, freezing during the winter and excess winter deaths.  Many of those people do not know where they get help.<\/p>  <p>  We can debate whether the help that is available is sufficient, but many people do not know where to get that help.  I am dealing with a man who has cancer.  His boiler has been broken for three or four months and he has been freezing since October.  He does not know where to go.  He needs help and information.  The Government is telling people to be winter ready.  We need to get information out to the people who may need to make choices about turning off heating or who do not have their heating on about where they can get help and how they can get out of that situation.  I appeal for that kind of information to be made available.<\/p>  <p>  Second, there was a shambles around the PUP over the Christmas period, and that continues.  There is huge confusion about the entitlement to the PUP.  I discovered from our taxi driver friends, who were one of the big victims of this, that people thought PRSI contributions were being awarded to them while they were in receipt of the PUP.  As far as I understand it, that should have happened.  However, when people went to apply for the PUP they were told they did not have sufficient PRSI contributions or there was significant confusion.  People are having difficulty getting the help they need.

In any event, I will deal with the core point he made.  I did not involve myself with the specifics.  I take the Deputy's point about power and such a large volume of expenditure being allocated to advertising.  It happened in the context of a once in 100-year event.  The pandemic is still with us, and I remember right throughout the pandemic Members in the House calling for different types of communication.  The breakdown of the money spent might be of interest to the Deputy because we hear different things and people will complain.<\/p>  <p>  A breakdown of the advertising spent on public information campaigns shows an even split of spend across national and regional media outlets.  I am told that in 2020 the national radio advertising spend was &euro;4 million and the regional spend was &euro;4.8 million.  The 2020 national press advertising spend was &euro;3.4 million, with the regional spend being &euro;3.5 million.  In 2021, the national radio advertising spend was &euro;2.1 million and the spend on regional radio advertising was &euro;2.4 million.  The 2021 national and regional press spend were both &euro;1.3 million, an even split.<\/p>  <p>  I will have to come back to the Deputies on some of their questions on whether external advisers in the media world were brought in.  At one stage, we were concerned about social media, in particular campaigns targeted at young people.  We improved on that in terms of the campaigns developed following a significant increase in case numbers among 18 to 24 year olds in autumn 2020.  The Government Information Service, GIS, Department of Health and HSE engaged with representative groups to understand the needs of this demographic.  They worked with young people.  <\/p>  <p>  The insights generated from the research these groups conducted confirmed that young people had been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, and were concerned about it and its impact on them and their loved ones.  It also revealed that they wanted this to be recognised and for information to be given to them in the appropriate way by their peers.  Taking on board this insight, we worked with an agency with a track record of communicating with this demographic and developed the anti-viral campaign that encouraged this group to assume a leadership role in dealing with the pandemic, generating a movement they could relate to that was delivered by their peers.  The campaign was very successful, and utilised platforms like TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.  It evolved based on feedback from young people and the final strand featured the stories of young people who had been directly affected by the virus.  It has been particularly effective and has performed extremely well, with overall impressions and reach of 18.8 million and 1.48 million, respectively.  I can send the Deputies information on the engagement metrics.  <\/p>  <p>  That is an illustration of the approach that was adopted.  It was all about getting the message about Covid restrictions and behaviour across.  The most recent campaign, RSVP, was particularly effective, and involved information on moving from a restrictive environment to what people should and should not do and what steps they should take.  <\/p>  <p>  I will follow up on Deputy McDonald's discussion with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, in terms of the audit.  We need to move very quickly on the gaps in the provision of refuge places and centres.  Our meeting was focused on the lead Department, which is the Department of Justice, and how to deal with wraparound services.  The outcome of the meeting was that the Minister for Justice's Department would be the lead Department in respect of domestic violence.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Murnane O'Connor has, in fairness, consistently raised the issue of the absence of a centre in Carlow.<\/p> <p>We will continue to work with the Deputy and other public representatives in the area to proceed with that.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Boyd Barrett's point was well made in respect of winter-ready campaigns.  Once we emerge from the pandemic, we should be able to do more specific campaigns.  That should also fall to other Departments.  The Department of Social Protection and other Departments have campaigns within their policy remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600032#EE00800","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1643206320,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Is f&eacute;idir teacht ar Cheisteanna Scr&iacute;ofa ar www.oireachas.ie.\r\n\r\nWritten Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Post-European Council Meeting: Statements","time":1643206320,"counter":388,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600033#FF00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1643206320,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I attended a meeting of the European Council on Thursday, 16 December in Brussels.  Cruinni&uacute; suimi&uacute;il agus t&aacute;bhachtach a bh&iacute; ann.  This was preceded by the Eastern Partnership summit, also in Brussels, which I attended on Wednesday, 15 December.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council had a full agenda, addressing some of the most pressing issues facing the Union.  We discussed Covid-19.  We addressed the epidemiological situation in the European Union and the impact of Omicron, reiterating the importance of vaccination, co-ordination and international co-operation in the fight against the pandemic.  We took stock of work on the European Union's crisis management and resilience to enhance our collective preparedness for future crises.  We had a discussion on security and defence issues, and adopted conclusions reaffirming the European Union's intention to promote our interests and values and work towards global peace and security.  We discussed developments in Belarus and on Ukraine's borders.  We also discussed the external aspects of migration, building on previous discussions in June and October of last year.  Leaders discussed the preparations for the European Union-African Union summit, in which I will participate on 17 and 18 February.  We concluded with a discussion on the situation in Ethiopia.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will address crisis management and resilience, the external aspects of migration, the European Union-African Union summit and Ethiopia in his remarks later.  I will address all other items.<\/p>  <p>  Before turning to the European Council meeting, I take this opportunity to update the House on the outcome of the Eastern Partnership summit.  The Eastern Partnership summit took place on 15 December amid increased challenges in the European Union's eastern neighbourhood.  Since its establishment in 2009, the partnership has sought to foster stability, prosperity and mutual co-operation, to advance reform and to address global and regional challenges.  This was the first meeting in this format since 2017.  Ongoing developments in the region are a reminder that an effective partnership with, and stability in, our eastern neighbourhood, reinforces peace, security and prosperity across Europe and within the European Union.  I was glad to have the opportunity at the summit to exchange views with the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  I regret the necessary absence of Belarus from the summit and the continued refusal of the Lukashenko regime to abide by its international commitments.  Symbolically, Belarus was represented at the summit by an empty chair which I hope will be filled in the near future with a representative of a democratic government in Belarus.<\/p>  <p>  The declaration adopted by European Union leaders and our eastern partners at the end of the summit confirmed that our partnership remains rooted in common fundamental values, mutual interests and shared ownership.  The outcome reflects Ireland's long-held view that robust democratic processes, diverse media voices, gender equality, good governance and the rule of law are essential to enable all our societies to face the challenges of the 21st century.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising the challenges facing countries in the region, I emphasised that it is vital that the will and voice of citizens are always at the heart of decision-making.  In my view, the partnership has been a useful platform for co-operation, bringing improvements in trade and investment, infrastructure, people-to-people contacts, environmental standards and quality of life generally.  The summit gave it new impetus at a critical time with elevated political pressures across the region.<\/p>  <p>  When we met on 16 December, European Union leaders stressed the urgent need for Russia to de-escalate tensions caused by its actions along borders with Ukraine, where there has been a build-up of Russian troops.  We also reiterated our full support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and our willingness to impose severe costs on Russia should it pursue further military aggression.  Ireland never gives up on the prospect of a peaceful, diplomatic resolution to tensions.  That is what we are trying to achieve and is our primary goal.  I therefore hope that such sanctions will not be necessary, but Ireland and our European Union partners are willing to take steps such as these to defend our core values.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the intensified international dialogue on this issue, including between Russia and the United States, NATO and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  Of course, it is important that Ukraine's voice is heard in discussions which concern it.  Dialogue is the best way to de-escalate tensions and that should remain everyone's primary focus.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council also addressed the situation in Belarus.  European Union leaders condemned the regime's instrumentalisation of migrants, called for the release of political prisoners, an end to the repression of civil society and media, and reiterated the right of the Belarusian people to free and fair elections.  The European Union's united position and role contributed last month to the de-escalation of the humanitarian situation at the European Union's borders with Belarus.  We must now keep our focus on the challenge of ensuring all people in Belarus are able to realise their fundamental rights and freedoms.<\/p>  <p>  Leaders held a discussion on security and defence issues and adopted conclusions reaffirming the European Union's intention to promote our interests and values and to work towards global peace and security.  There is a strong emphasis in our conclusions on the EU's commitment to the global rules-based international order, with the United Nations at its core.<\/p>  <p>  At European Union level, Ireland has always engaged constructively in the development of the European Union's Common Security and Defence Policy, guided by our traditional policy of military neutrality and our contribution to crisis management and peacekeeping.  This includes ongoing work to develop the European Union's new security and defence strategy, known as the strategic compass.  The strategic compass will outline the European Union's approach towards our Common Security and Defence Policy for the decade ahead, offering a useful framework for the European Union to contribute to international peace and security.  It will also reflect ongoing efforts to strengthen the European Union's ability to respond to new types of threats, such as cyber and hybrid attacks.  It is expected to be adopted at the March European Council.<\/p>  <p>  At the time of our meeting in December many member states, including Ireland, were experiencing a surge in Covid cases due to the emergence of the Omicron variant.  This was a focus of our discussions at our meeting.  The European Council underlined the importance of overcoming vaccine hesitancy, specifically through combatting disinformation.<\/p>  <p>  We also called for adoption of revised Council recommendations on travel within and from outside the European Union, stressing the importance of a co-ordinated approach on the validity of EU digital Covid certificates.  We called for progress on the EU strategy for Covid-19 therapeutics which will form part of the European Health Union.  Thankfully, we have weathered the Omicron storm.  Ireland's world-class vaccination programme and the roll-out of boosters has utterly transformed our situation, preventing the recent wave of infection translating into much more serious levels of illness and death.<\/p>  <p>  Leaders underlined that the pandemic will only be overcome through global co-operation based on trust and mutual assistance.  Well co-ordinated multilateral mechanisms, such as COVAX, have proven their worth and highlight just how important it is to aim for greater coherence and solidarity across the global health architecture, with the World Health Organization, WHO, in the driving seat.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union is the largest donor and exporter of vaccines in the world.  The European Union, with its member states, has committed &euro;3.2 billion to the COVAX facility in support of the equitable distribution of vaccines.  The European Union has exported over 1.7 billion vaccine doses to 165 countries.  To date, Ireland has committed 5 million doses to COVAX with 1.34 million doses having already been delivered to Uganda, Nigeria, Indonesia and Ghana with further deliveries planned.<\/p>  <p>  With vaccine production challenges from early last year largely resolved, the imperative now is to strengthen co-ordination with partners to address the issue of distribution.  Now that there is substantial production capacity, we need to focus minds on the logistical challenge of getting vaccines into the arms of those who need them to meet the WHO target of 70% global coverage by mid-2022.  However, we also need to do more and to plan for the medium-term and further global health challenges.  As I said earlier, Africa currently imports 99% of its vaccines and 94% of its medicines.<\/p> <p>This is unsustainable and we will need to continue to work within the EU and with our partners in Africa and elsewhere in the developing world to change these statistics.<\/p> <p> At December's European Council meeting, we again discussed the recent spike in energy prices and considered the impact of these price rises on the most vulnerable.  We discussed this at October's meeting, and invited the European Commission to study the functioning of the gas and electricity markets with the help of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, ACER, as well as the EU emissions trading system market with the help of the European Securities Markets Authority.  We also discussed the Commission's toolbox of measures and how best to provide short-term relief to the most vulnerable consumers and companies.<\/p> <p> The Government's primary response is to utilise the tax and social welfare system to counter the rising costs of living, of which energy costs are one of the biggest drivers, with a number of measures implemented in budget 2022.  The budget 2022 package increased the weekly rate of the fuel allowance by &euro;5.  It also increases the qualified child payment, the living alone allowance and the income threshold for the working family payment.  This is in addition to adjustments to basic welfare and pension rates.  A &euro;210 million scheme has also been approved by Cabinet to credit all domestic electricity customers with &euro;113 in 2022.  Energy prices will continue to be a focus of attention in the period ahead.<\/p> <p> At the Euro Summit on 16 December, leaders heard from the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, and the president of the Eurogroup, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Pascal<\/p> <p>Donohoe, on economic prospects for the period ahead, including the recovery as we emerge from the pandemic and the likely future trajectory of inflation.  Leaders agreed that continued close co-ordination of euro area fiscal policies remains important, with the objective of firmly establishing a sustainable and inclusive recovery.  We also reiterated our commitment to completing banking union and strengthening the integration of our capital markets, including providing the Eurogroup with a strong mandate for advancing further work in this area.  We will review progress at our next meeting in March.<\/p> <p> Last Saturday, 22 January, marked a significant moment in contemporary Irish history.  It was on this day, 50 years ago, at the Palais d'Egmont in Brussels, that the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, along with the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and later President of Ireland, Dr. Patrick Hillery, signed the treaty on behalf of Ireland to join the European Communities.  The signing ceremony in Brussels set in train a process that saw the people of Ireland voting in May 1972, by an overwhelming 83%, in favour of joining the European Economic Community, EEC, and ultimately, Ireland becoming a member state on 1 January 1973.  Few events in our history as an independent State have been so transformative.  It is, therefore, a welcome opportunity to encourage reflection, debate and exchange over coming months on the Ireland-European Union relationship, and how we can best contribute to a strong and shared future.<\/p> <p> As we mark some of the significant milestones on the road to our membership in the period ahead, and as we contribute to the Conference on the Future of Europe currently considering how the Union should progress, I hope we will share the optimism, aspiration and hope that informed those who signed this treaty for Ireland fifty years ago.

We have been calling for this for many months and I welcome it as a positive development.  As I have outlined many times, the protocol is needed to prevent a hard border on our island and to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.  Where there are issues that remain to be ironed out, political leaders have a responsibility to resolve these through dialogue, and I welcome that the joint committee will be a vital avenue for this dialogue.  It is now up to political leaders to engage with the committee in good faith to produce solutions that deliver for communities and businesses impacted particularly in the North.  The vast majority of people in the North backed the protocol and want to see workable solutions, not brinkmanship or bluster from the Brexiteers.  Those who recklessly advocate for the triggering of Article 16 must not be entertained.  Will the Taoiseach set out the steps he is taking at European level to make it clear to our European neighbours that the people of the North support the protocol and want workable solutions, and to make it clear that the joint committee must be engaged with in good faith and cannot be another talking shop for Brexiteers to ramp up rhetoric at the expense of people in the North?  What steps have been taken to ensure this committee will meet soon and that this positive momentum - I hope it is positive momentum - can be built on?<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the cost-of-living crisis is clear to see.  As I raised with the Taoiseach earlier, workers and families across the State feel the pinch from all angles.  Rent, childcare costs, energy costs and food costs have skyrocketed.  Figures show that prices went up by 5.4% in the year to November 2021, which was the largest annual change in prices in more than 20 years.  People's pay packets simply cannot keep up.  As we know, energy bills are astronomical.  Despite this crisis, the Government has failed to act sufficiently.  When it should have taken decisive action to give workers and families a break, it has dithered.  When it has acted, it has been very little, very late.<\/p>  <p>  Before the Taoiseach went to Brussels, I asked him to raise the cost-of-living crisis with our European colleagues to ensure we can work together to provide solutions for hard-pressed families.  Many of our European neighbours have taken bold steps to stand up for their citizens in response to this crisis.  It is clear that solutions are available where there is a will and where political leadership is evident.  What steps has the Taoiseach taken at European level to address the cost-of-living crisis and to stand up for ordinary workers and families who now struggle to keep the lights on and pay their bills?  People need to know what solutions he is putting forward for people who need a break.  We also need to know what actions are envisaged at European level in a co-ordinated way in the search for these solutions.<\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks, the international community has witnessed a dangerous escalation of military presence by Russia along the Ukrainian border.  This is a dangerous situation with a growing potential for conflict in the region.  There must be zero tolerance for any form of threat by larger and powerful states against their smaller neighbours.  Respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine and its international borders is non-negotiable.  It is for the people of Ukraine to decide democratically their destiny without impediment or coercion, without threat or aggression.  It is, therefore, imperative that Ireland plays its part to see a de-escalation and a peaceful and democratic resolution of this crisis.  In that spirit, I ask that the multilateral apparatus, in particular, the United Nations and all of that capacity, is deployed in full and effectively to bring about a peaceful and democratic outcome.  I anticipate and hope that, as a member of the Security Council, Ireland will play its full part in making that a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600034#GG00300","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1643206920,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Undoubtedly, the most pressing issue of the moment is the potential for the outbreak of open conflict in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to the principles inherent in the United Nations resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 27 March 2014 in respect of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.  This resolution calls on all states \"to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, and to settle their international disputes by peaceful means\".  As a member of the UN Security Council and as a neutral nation, Ireland has the moral standing and political platform to actively pursue a course of action to push for a de-escalation of the current crisis in Ukraine.  As a nation, we must be seen to represent and to remain a voice for calm and reason.  We must use our position on the UN Security Council and within the EU to push for a peaceful resolution to the crisis.<\/p> <p> This morning, I met with the Russian ambassador to Ireland.  During this meeting, I set out the points I have just made and highlighted the need for a de-escalation of the current crisis.  I also raised the issue of the Russian naval exercises planned to take place off the southern coast of Ireland next week.  I voiced the opposition of Sinn F&eacute;in to these planned exercises.  I have previously spoken out against similar exercises conducted by the British navy off the coast of Donegal, during which Irish fishing trawlers were forced from the area by the British.  Such exercises also carry a threat to marine biodiversity and wildlife.  Under current legislation, the Royal Navy is required to consult with conservation groups to ensure its activities do not endanger wildlife in Britain.  However, when it enters Irish waters, there is no such requirement.  This is totally unacceptable and it is something Sinn F&eacute;in recently sought to change through amendments to the Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2021.  Unfortunately, these amendments were opposed by the Government.<\/p> <p> Ireland has an international responsibility to patrol its waters, both surface and subsurface, and its skies.  As a neutral nation, we must do so with the resources available to us.  The events of which we speak have clearly illuminated the failure of this Government to equip our Defence Forces to meet the challenges inherent in our national responsibilities.  We must not allow this Government's failing of our Defence Forces to become a Trojan horse to shuttle our country down a road that would see Ireland further immersed in the ongoing project to militarise the EU.  Ireland possesses a coveted position on the UN Security Council, which was acquired as a result of a record of decades of neutrality and peacekeeping.  This moment challenges our resolve to step up to the expectations of the nations of the world that voted to put us on the Security Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600034#GG00400","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643207520,"counter":395,"content":"<p>In the few minutes I have, I wish to cover two topics.  The first is the growing threat to peace in Europe posed by the massing of Russian troops, tanks and military equipment on the Ukrainian border.  Nobody can look into the mind of President Putin but, if his utterances and those of his Government are to be taken at face value, it appears he wants to turn back the political, economic and geographical clock of Europe to the time immediately following the Second World War.  He apparently wishes to re-establish a Russian zone of influence stretching not only into independent and sovereign Ukraine, but also into the territories of new member states of the European Union.  It is ironic that he wants to do is return Europe to its state at the time of the Yalta conference when that conference took place in Crimea, which is now illegally occupied by Russia.  That is a fanciful and impossible demand and one that we must resist.  The annexing of a neighbouring country's territory on the pretext of a common ethnicity is something we have seen play out on our Continent before with disastrous results.  Ireland must remain clear and resolute in standing with democratic Ukraine in defence of self-determination and sovereignty, principles that have underscored our country's foreign policy stance from its inception.<\/p><p>That brings me to the related issue of the conduct of naval manoeuvres by the Russian fleet in our exclusive economic zone.  I know this is a matter of interest to the Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach.  The Government has stated that Ireland has no legal recourse to challenge the holding of these manoeuvres at this time.  What is the Government to do?  I am glad my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague met the ambassador of the Russian Federation today and I hope he can come before the committees of these Houses.  He has dismissed Ireland's protests to date.  A representative of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation has taken a stand.  The CEO, Patrick Murphy, has rightly set out fishers' concerns about the impact of these drills on marine life and biodiversity.  He has said that Irish fishers will fish in these areas, as they are entitled to, at the same time as this naval show of strength.  Will the Irish Government do anything to support and protect Irish fishers should they take such a stand?<\/p><p>I will briefly touch on a second issue, that is, the ongoing - or should I say &quot;not-going&quot; - negotiations on the Northern Ireland protocol of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.  Before Christmas, there was optimism that the resignation of Lord Frost and his replacement by Liz Truss would calm matters and lead to an agreed settlement.  The fact that the UK side would now be led by the foreign secretary, supported by a department whose <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>is negotiation and diplomacy, gave us all optimism and hope.  However, to be diplomatic about it, progress remains elusive.  The British position is still to stubbornly challenge the protocol.  The protocol is an integral part of a negotiated agreement.  It cannot be simply wished away or ignored.  All of this is in danger of continuing into the Northern Irish election period, which will make it more difficult to achieve any progress.  Talk of a constructive atmosphere and laser-like focus is all well and good but the protocol must be implemented as agreed.  It may certainly be tweaked to meet the real practical difficulties experienced on the ground.  That is what Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d is most anxious to do.  I have spoken to him on that issue.  It cannot be undone, however.  That plain and inescapable fact has to be underscored.  If the British position is that the protocol cannot be tweaked and must be abolished instead, we risk undermining the work of years of negotiation which came up not with an ideal solution, but with the best possible solution to minimise the risk to the peace process that was so preciously won and which has been so earnestly guarded over the last 20 years or so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600035#HH00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1643207520,"counter":396,"content":"<p>As the Taoiseach has said, last weekend, Ireland marked the 50th anniversary of our membership of the European Communities.  The treaty of accession was signed by the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patrick Hillery.  The decision to join the European Economic Community, EEC, was overwhelmingly endorsed by the Irish people in a referendum in which 83% of the population voted \"Yes\".  It is a decision we have never regretted since, as demonstrated by opinion polls showing consistent support for the EU.  In short, membership of the EU has transformed every aspect of Irish life for the better, socially, culturally, economically and politically.  It has allowed us to truly take our place among the nations of the world.<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of the proposed Russian naval exercises to be held 240 km off the south-west coast of Ireland next month.<\/p> <p>As we know, these exercises are due to take place within Ireland's exclusive economic zone, EEZ, although not in our territorial waters.  The Russian ambassador to Ireland, H.E. Yuriy Filatov, has stated that these exercises are \"not a threat to Ireland\", that \"no harm is intended\" and that this is a \"non-story\", which \"has been hugely overblown\".  I do not agree with the ambassador's comments.  We cannot be oblivious to the global context of this proposed action.  I refer to the threat from Russia to invade Ukraine.  Everyone knows there are heightened tensions in Europe now.  Unfortunately, such naval exercises are routinely undertaken by Russia and other military powers.  This exercise, however, is intimidating and threatening.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, was right to say this planned activity is \"not welcome\" and to brief his EU foreign ministerial colleagues on the issue.<\/p> <p> The former Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, was right when he stated this move by Russia is \"provocative in its timing and nature\".  It is intimidating.  Why not carry this out activity somewhere else instead of on the western seaboard of the EU?  There is also the potential for disruption to marine life and fishing grounds on the Porcupine Seabight, to whales and dolphins especially.  There is also the question of possible damage to underwater communications cables.  We can probably not do much about this planned activity but it increases our determination to stand in solidarity with our European neighbours in Ukraine and to support the implementation of major sanctions on Russia should it decide to invade that country.<\/p> <p> Turning to the situation in Ukraine, the threat of a Russian invasion of the country is escalating.  Some 125,000 Russian troops are being massed on Ukrainian borders.  We are told that Russia feels threatened by the spread of European liberal democratic values, but those of us who subscribe to these values make no apology for doing so.  Ireland and the EU have clearly supported Ukraine&rsquo;s right to sovereignty and territorial integrity.  The EU is united in solidarity with Ukraine, and it will support a comprehensive and severe range of sanctions and restrictions on Russia should it decide to invade Ukraine.  It has also brought forward a financial package to help Ukraine, and that is very welcome.  Talks between the US and Russia are continuing, NATO members are considering the threat, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, is considering the matter, and discussions have taken place among EU foreign ministers.  The Taoiseach was right yesterday when he said we need a de-escalation of tensions.  Every effort should be made to bring about a negotiated settlement of this crisis and to avoid a military confrontation.  This approach would be far preferable to military action by Russia and NATO-led countries in the region.<\/p> <p> Meanwhile, as we have heard, talks between the UK and the EU regarding the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol continue.  Further meetings between the British Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, and European Commission Vice-President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d are scheduled for next week.  We are told that the latest round of talks has been constructive.  While no one is willing to impose a deadline for a conclusion of these talks, they must be given added momentum now due to the added proximity of the Northern Ireland Assembly elections in May.  We must also hope the current events involving the Conservative Party in Britain do not encroach on these negotiations.  Again, this prospect highlights the need to bring these matters to finality as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> I also take this opportunity to send my sympathy to our MEPs on the death of the President of the European Parliament in January, David Sassoli.  His death brought about genuine sadness in the European Union and I extend my condolences to his family on his passing.  The European Parliament has since elected a new President, Roberta Metsola from Malta.  She is the youngest MEP to obtain this post and I wish her every success in her new role.  I also welcome the support given at the European Council meeting in December to Lithuania, which has serious issues with China now.  Again, it is important for the EU to show solidarity if any member state is threatened in this way.  I note what the Taoiseach had to say regarding the eastern partnership summit and the poignancy of an empty chair representing the absence of Belarusian participation at that meeting.  I again use this occasion to raise the plight of political prisoners in Belarus and to call for their release immediately.  It is unacceptable that innocent people involved in politics there have been imprisoned.  We must not forget their plight.<\/p> <p> The council also dealt with the ongoing pandemic issue.  Associated with that is the need for vaccine equity.  The EU is the largest donor and exporter of Covid-19 vaccines in the world.  In the short term, that is the way to proceed regarding Covid-19 vaccine equity.  I refer to the COVAX mechanism.  I welcome that Ireland is wholeheartedly participating in that mechanism.  The Conference on the Future of Europe continues, and I have no doubt the Minister of State with special responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, will keep us updated on those events.<\/p> <p> The final issue raised in the debate here was the so-called strategic compass.  I have a question tabled for answer by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, tomorrow on this issue and Ireland&rsquo;s approach to it.  My question also asks whether Ireland&rsquo;s approach will involve our tradition of peacekeeping and multilateral diplomacy through the UN.  It is important our unique tradition as a member state in the European Union is brought to that process, and I have no doubt the House will continue to give this issue of the strategic compass further consideration in advance of the summit meeting in March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600035#HH00300","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643208120,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Regarding the recent forced displacement of Palestinian households in occupied East Jerusalem, the UN last week urged Israel to halt all evictions and demolitions in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, immediately after a family was forced out of their home the previous day.  I am referring to the Salhieh family.  They bought their house in Sheikh Jarrah in 1967, which is a long time ago.  It was before this State had joined the EU and at a time when Eamon de Valera was the President.  It should go without saying therefore, that, the Salhieh's claim to this land goes way back, and yet an Israeli court has just ruled against the family being allowed to remain in their home.  On Wednesday, Israeli police raided the Salhieh home, forcibly removed the family and then demolished their property.  Some 25 family members and supporters who had been demonstrating were arrested.<\/p>  <p>  That is just awful.  Both Houses have passed a motion to recognise the state of Palestine, but the Government has not formally granted recognition and has said it wishes to do that as part of a wider EU move.

Ireland has been a leader in the pursuit of justice and fairness around the globe, and we have long recognised the importance of Palestinian civil society in pursuing justice and peace.  Ireland's lack of action following the recent attacks on Palestinian NGOs is concerning.<\/p> <p>Last year saw significant increases by apartheid Israel in its targeting of Palestinian civil society groups, the settlements and the use of administrative detention.  Ireland nods obediently while the European Commission is giving the green light to Israel to target NGOs with no fear of any consequences.  Whatever happened to the concept of innocent until proven guilty?  Why is the European Commission allowed to exercise double standards when it comes to civil society groups operating in Palestine?  The Commission has frozen funding for these six civil society groups following unverified claims from apartheid Israel.  Organisations like Al-Haq are considered guilty until they prove themselves innocent.  We have seen it before where past allegations by the apartheid authorities of the misuse of EU funds have not been validated.  Ireland must raise its voice and not hide in the European herd.  We must demand that funding is released and the documentation that is being offered by Israel is made public.  How long will we allow the European Union to be complicit in the crimes of apartheid Israel?<\/p> <p> I heard Deputy Haughey refer to the release of political prisoners in Belarus.  The same applies for political prisoners held by Israel.  The Palestinians are held with absolutely no trial - nothing.  They are just arrested and held and they are literally tortured.

First is COVAX and the issue of vaccine distribution around the world, particularly in the developing world.  The Taoiseach has mentioned in the pre-European Council statements and again today in his discussion with Deputy McDonald the continued support for COVAX.  COVAX reached a milestone a couple of days ago on 15 January, when it gave out its billionth vaccine.  That was half the intended target announced earlier in the year.  Beyond that, only 36 of the 194 WHO states have vaccinated over 10% of their population.  Some 84% of people in Africa have yet to receive a single dose.  COVAX relies on the market, and the market has proven not to be a reliable source for confronting health inequalities around the world since the dawn of time.  COVAX is failing yet we continue to stay committed to it.  The <i>Financial Times<\/i>reported yesterday that COVAX is no longer able to accept any more doses because of cash shortages.  That is incredible.  The mechanism by which we are distributing the vaccine to the developing world cannot send any more doses because of cash shortages.  It needs $5.2 billion, we are told, in a time when there is militarisation happening on the borders of Europe that I guarantee is costing a hell of a lot more.  That is what is holding up vaccine distribution around the world.<\/p><p>We have started to see a little bit of sunlight in this country in respect of the pandemic but it is by no means over.  If people around the developing world are still unable to receive vaccines at an equitable level, we are going to continue to create the perfect incubation conditions for the virus to mutate, spread, transform and place us all at risk.  COVAX has proven not to be an appropriate mechanism to deal with this pandemic and plague.  It has demonstrated that powerful richer nations are placing their own needs before those of the rest of the world, foolishly.  I implore the Government and the Taoiseach through our role in the EU and on the UN Security Council to step away from this market-led attempt to address vaccine inequity.  It is not working.  Epidemiologists around the world are calling for a TRIPS waiver.  We have been calling for that from the very beginning of the pandemic.  It is not the be-all and end-all; there are other issues. It is certainly better than what we have and what COVAX has delivered.  COVAX is not suitable for its intended purpose.<\/p><p>We should also talk about the militarisation and build-up along the Ukrainian border and what I will call the Russian excursions.  While I do not really want to focus on the military testing that is happening 240 km off the Old Head of Kinsale, I also do not want to see that in isolation.  We have also seen Russian incursions into our airspace over the past two years.  We have seen Russians tracking over our undersea cables.  Now we see a missile test 240 km out to sea in our economic zone.  How we respond to that is very important.<\/p><p>Nobody here is going to claim our response should be any form of engagement in creeping militarisation of the European Union, NATO or anything like that.  We need to respond in the way we have always done, respecting our neutrality but also pressing forward in terms of our diplomacy and seeing ourselves as peaceful actors in the world.  That is the only response we can take.  Since the dawn of time it has been said that the strong do what they will while the weak suffer what we must.  Ireland is not a weak country by any stretch of the imagination.  Our role as peacekeepers and diplomats on the world stage means we should be people who attempt to bring others to the table, standing in solidarity with the people of Ukraine who have suffered enormously over recent years in conflict with the Russian Federation, but also saying this strong-man position that has been taken up by the US, Russia and NATO forces is not compatible with a modern world.  We know how that ends.  We do not want it again.  It is not part of our peace.  Too many lives have been lost in that regard.  We need to be strong in terms of holding the diplomatic response, engaging with the Russian ambassador as far as we can, and highlighting that we do not want these military actions taking place off our coast to the detriment of our environment and our sea life.  It has been said Ireland is somewhat of a weak link into the European Union or into NATO's territories.  That is not what we should be.  We should be forceful and strong in our condemnation of militarisation but also proud in standing up for peace in a world that seems to be becoming increasingly fragile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600037#KK00200","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1643208720,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this very important and timely discussion.  I am grateful to the Taoiseach for his update following the Council meeting held prior to Christmas.  While much has changed, much has not.  There are only three areas I want to focus on this afternoon.  One could focus on 300 areas if one really wanted to.  First is the extremely worrying situation on the European Union's eastern flank, to pick up from Deputy Gannon.  It has dominated much discussion over recent days and most recently at the Foreign Affairs Council.  Despite what some people might think, this does impact us not just because of military exercises taking place 240 km off our south coast.  It affects the entire European Union.  The knock-on effect in terms of energy provision and supply, the possible economic ramifications, and the fact we have seen cyber attacks in this country and hybrid warfare deployed along the European Union's eastern flank over recent months is absolutely something that impacts us.<\/p>  <p>  It is now that we truly need to see European unity when it comes to dealing with Russia, but we have not seen that up to this point, to be quite frank.  It is time we had an emergency European Council meeting.  I think we are moving to that position.  Despite the amount of discussion that is being held between certain European institutional and member state leaders with allies in the US and NATO, and discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council, we need to get people together at Head of Government level to see where there can be a united response.  We talk about leverage and the ability to de-escalate the conflict.  Diplomacy is obviously king and the best way to go about it.  No one wants to see an escalation of overt military action.  However, the European Union cannot be afraid to look at the economic leverage it has over Russia.  I refer to the proper use of sanctions, not blankly across the Russian Federation but targeted especially against the leadership, the elite and the oligarchs who surround the Russian President.  They have worked before; we know that.  That is how important they are.  Targeted, impactful sanctions need to be on the table.  Discussion about them needs to end.  They simply need to be implemented now.  It is not just the people of Ukraine who are viewing this escalation with trepidation and fear; it is all the people in western Europe, and rightly so.  This is not a new phenomenon.  It is an extremely worrying phenomenon.  It is not something that can take a weak or light response.<\/p>  <p>  It asks further questions about the security and defence capabilities of the European Union and, more pertinently, closer to home, what role we play in it.<\/p> <p>Are we contributing?  Are we overly reliant?  Where can we contribute?  Is it merely a matter of increased investment in our Defence Forces or is it a question of increased levels of co-operation, in particular in the sharing of security information?  After the cyberattack in the summer months, we saw the importance of working with European partners.  We must have an honest debate in the House about that.<br\/><br\/>The second point I would like to focus on is the ongoing Covid-19 situation.  While we in this country are moving away from the emergency situation - with the relaxation of restrictions, there is perhaps a different mindset and approach, and let us all hope we are moving from pandemic to epidemic - the situation is not necessarily the exact same across Europe or the wider world, in particular the developed world.  As we move into this period, we need to see an element of co-ordination and co-operation, especially on Covid passes.  We know that Covid passes for second dose vaccinations are due to expire.  Anyone who has travelled on the Continent knows that going from member state to member state comes with different Covid pass requirements.  While there remains a requirement in Ireland in respect of travel, we have to be clear on the responsibilities.  It behoves every citizen who can to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and get a booster, but it is also the responsibility of the EU and member state governments to continue encouraging their domestic populations to get vaccinated and diversifying the supply of vaccines around the world.<br\/><br\/>I do not know whether the Minister of State will be able to address my next point, namely, ensuring recognition for the vaccine status of Irish citizens, particularly those who have been vaccinated or boosted in Northern Ireland as well as those who have been vaccinated outside the EU, specifically the UK.  This matter caused quite a bit of concern when vaccine passes were introduced, and now that we are requiring people to have boosted vaccination passes, it needs to be prioritised.<br\/><br\/>I had not intended to speak too long about the ongoing discussions between the EU and the UK on the post-Brexit protocol because, like others, I had hoped that the change in tone that was mentioned was real.  With Deputies Niamh Smyth and &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, we met Commissioner &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d in Strasbourg and got a decent update.  We were all appeased that there was ongoing discussion at a technical level.  The Minister of State has been clear with the House about the progress that is being made and the opportunities that lie therein, but I have to be frank.  An hour ago, the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office, FCO, put out the most ridiculous tweet - it can only be described as Trumpian propaganda - and I have to question why.  When we need co-operation between the EU, the UK, the US, other western countries and NATO to deal with an escalating problem on the EU's eastern border in Ukraine and when the protocol talks are supposedly moving to a better place, out of nowhere a ridiculous video was put out not by a politician, but by a British Government institution - the FCO - saying all manner of things about how the Northern Irish protocol worked.<br\/><br\/>Are we being taken for mugs?  The British Government is saying one thing at one meeting and dealing with its own domestic chaos in Westminster but then saying the opposite things in a video published by a civil service body.  It was not published by a politician.  It was not a column in the <i>Daily Express<\/i>or the <i>Mail on Sunday<\/i>from a disgruntled Brexiteer from the ERG or whatever, which we could dismiss.  It was from an institution of a state with which we have a close relationship, albeit a relationship that has been tested in recent years.  We need to have a relationship that is based on honesty and trust.  You can best be someone's friend by being honest with him or her.<br\/><br\/>How in the name of God are we going to progress relations and get a solution on the protocol when the British Government once again and on an official basis trashes the very agreement it agreed to just over a year ago on the same day the DUP yet again threatened to pull down Stormont because it was not getting what it wanted in the protocol?  The very architects of Brexit - those who forced it through and convinced the people to vote for an absolute myth and nonsense - are once again failing to pick up their duties and implement their responsibilities.<br\/><br\/>I know how personally engaged and involved the Minister of State is in this matter, as are the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and I know the frustration I am showing from the backbenches probably goes a little further - I am in a position to do so as a backbencher - but we have to be clear in the upcoming discussions with Commissioner &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d and European allies and colleagues, and directly with British Government ministers, that we want to see the deal implemented and we need to do this with a level of trust that quite simply has not been displayed so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600037#KK00300","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643209320,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I will begin by expressing my deep concern about the current situation at the Ukrainian border, where an estimated 100,000 Russian soldiers are gathered.  I note among the conclusions of December's meeting that the European Council reiterated its full support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and has warned that any further military aggression against Ukraine will have major consequences and incur a severe cost in response.  I wish to reiterate Sinn F&eacute;in's opposition to the act of aggression against a sovereign state.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has particular roles it can play in terms of being a neutral country and by using our position on the United Nations Security Council.  We need to use these roles to play our part in achieving a peaceful resolution to the crisis and avoiding an escalation that would cost lives and international relations and all that go with those factors.  Calm and reason are needed.  The situation is balanced on a pinhead and, therefore, we must use our unique position to highlight the need for moral awareness, political dexterity and the ultimate goal of a peaceful resolution that has the sovereignty of Ukraine foremost in our minds.<\/p>  <p>  In December, the European Council also discussed the matter of security.  In particular, discussions were had on taking more responsibility in this regard, yet we are in a situation where Russia is set to carry out naval drills off the coast of Ireland next month.  This is yet another deeply concerning situation and is not helped by the fact our Defence Forces are overstretched and have been subject to underinvestment.  Our Naval Service is a case in point.  We also lack primary radar, thereby enabling agencies of other states to probe our airspace.  Now we find ourselves in a situation in which missile tests are to take place in relatively close proximity to Ireland and in our exclusive economic zone and we are ill-prepared to deal with them.  Many see it as a posturing exercise with old Cold War actions, but it is also placing increased pressure on our underfunded and overstretched Defence Forces, which lack key monitoring infrastructure.  When are we going to address our own deficiencies?  Are we just going to discuss ambitions at an EU level without dealing with our own issues?  Effectively, what is now being expected of our Defence Forces is to police a presence they are unable to see, detect or hear.  It only adds to the level of disillusionment that personnel feel.  Do we have to find ourselves in situations such as this before any action is taken to fund the Defence Forces adequately or is the Government going to continue ignoring the 2015 White Paper, which recognised that radar surveillance was a priority?<\/p>  <p>  What efforts are being made to protect our rights to fish?  Under current legislation in Britain, the Royal Navy is required to consult conservation groups to ensure its activities do not endanger wildlife in the area.  We have no such requirement and we can we see the ease with which the Russian navy can carry out its activities in Ireland's exclusive economic zone.  Our fishing industry is on its knees as a result of poor negotiation by the Government and EU rules that do it a disservice.  With quotas slashed, things were bad enough for the sector, but now we have military activity taking place in fishing waters that will disturb the catch and have profound implications for livelihoods in the fishing sector.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to mention the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver, to which the EU was described as the \"biggest roadblock\" by former President Mary Robinson.  Lower income countries do not want to rely on donations alone.  They want to be able to manufacture their own vaccines, but we are still meeting opposition to this from the EU.

I stood at many a protest over what the Russians did in Chechnya and the carnage they inflicted there and I did not see Members opposite there, so they should not try to confuse the issue.<\/p>  <p>  While I object absolutely to the Russians' massing troops on the Ukrainian border, to the whole nature of the Russian regime and, for that matter, to the carrying out of military exercises in the Irish maritime area, the problem is that I have heard not a word about the NATO military exercise on 24 January in the Mediterranean.  There has been no criticism of that military exercise, in which NATO flexed its muscles.  It was the first time since the end of the Cold War that an entire US aircraft carrier fleet came under NATO control.  What is it doing there except ratcheting up the tensions?  The Russians are massing troops on the Ukrainian border; they should not be doing so.  The Americans are planning to send troops into Ukraine and are arming the Ukrainians, as are many of the NATO powers - not Germany, notably, but many European powers are arming the Ukrainians with weapons that the Russians, as much as I criticise them, have a reason to be concerned about.  James Baker promised at the time that an eastward expansion of NATO would not happen.  That promise was broken and NATO was expanded aggressively, encircling Russia, inevitably provoking an escalation of political and military tensions.  There has been not a word on that from the Irish Government and no balance in its criticism.  That is why I say it is not being neutral or objective in this.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the world's media outlets that do not have an axe to grind for one side or the other are objective in their assessment of what is going on.  Ireland is not.  Why?  Because the Irish political establishment has always, in truth, wanted to facilitate the US-led western bloc, as it does at Shannon Airport, allowing it to prosecute the utterly disastrous wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, where hundreds of thousands of people were slaughtered and we facilitated it.  We facilitated the kidnap and torture programme that is US rendition.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and some of their coalition partners stood over that and allowed that to happen and continue to allow it to happen.  They want to sign us up to the permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, when the European military project being pushed is all about deepening the integration with NATO, which is a first-strike military and nuclear alliance.  I ask the House to just think about that.  NATO has a policy of first-strike use of nuclear weapons against states that do not have nuclear weapons.  That is an actual policy of NATO.  We should be railing against that kind of stuff.<\/p>  <p>  Let us uphold our shattered tradition of neutrality and call this out for what it is.  These are two nasty, expansionist military-political big power alliances.  Neutrality means calling them both out and calling for people to step back from the brink of war, to demilitarise the area, to de-escalate and to say that weapons and the deployment of same as well as military advisors and troops from either side are not acceptable and are adding fuel to the fire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600039#MM00600","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1643209920,"counter":416,"content":"<p>Since the last European Council meeting, things have escalated significantly, certainly insofar as the potential conflict in Ukraine is concerned.  It is very alarming every single evening to see the build-up of tanks and 100,000 troops on the eastern border of Ukraine and Russia.  It is very intimidating.  We see President Putin repeatedly put it up to all countries in the West, including Ireland this week with the potential of ballistics testing in our exclusive economic zone at sea.  I was watching the news last night like many people in this country and saw how a small group of fishermen in the south west of our country will take their own stand.  It is important that Ireland also take a stand.  We might be geographically a minnow nation but, geopolitically, we pack a punch and we need to use our seat as a member of the European Union and a member of the UN Security Council until 2023.  It is crucial that we use all voices we have to bring calm to the situation and to say in the clearest possible terms that we absolutely condemn what the Russian state is attempting to do.<\/p>  <p>  Before coming over to the Chamber, I took a look at the Russian exclusive economic zone at sea.  It encompasses a huge body of water of approximately 8.5 million sq. km.  Why can the Russians not do their training exercises there?  You would not see the Irish Navy going off the coast of St. Petersburg or the Irish Army playing war games.  It is the civilians of Ukraine and the people who depend on our fishing waters who will pay the price here because marine life will be hugely damaged by what is to happen.<\/p>  <p>  I have repeatedly raised the issue of Afghanistan in this Chamber.  The European Union and Ireland as a member state of the UN Security Council cannot take our eye off this.  One thing has bothered me hugely since taking up a seat in the D&aacute;il.  I have contact with a number of families in Afghanistan.  We talk every second day or two on WhatsApp.  They often send me voice memos.  You can hear what is going on in the background.  I probably got too personally involved with them and, as an elected representative of the D&aacute;il repeatedly raising their cases here, I probably give them too much hope that Ireland could bring them over as refugees and give them some safety.  It is harrowing each evening to hear what goes on.  I hope it is permissible to show this photograph in the D&aacute;il.  There is no face shown in it, but this is a ten-year-old boy in Afghanistan who was whipped within a few inches of his life only last week.  People in the media say continuously that the Taliban has turned a corner and is now at the table, that they are serious politicians and that we should talk to them and engage with diplomacy and dialogue.  The Taliban is anything but.  They are the same thugs and bullies they were a decade ago.  They are whipping ten-year-old boys.  I also have WhatsApp voice memos on my phone of machine gun fire going off on the street and a bullwhip being used to drive people into their homes when it got dark one evening in Kabul.  This is going on every single evening.  Because it has disappeared off RT&Eacute; News: Nine O'Clock, Sky News and BBC News, it is crucial that we at least at a political level keep this high on the agenda not only domestically but also internationally.<\/p>  <p>  A number of people who have been employed by an Irish-headquartered company are still in Kabul, having their lives put at risk daily.  We owe it to them, because of their long-established links to Ireland, to bring them over on the refugee programme and to give them the safety here that they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600039#MM00700","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1643209920,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Regarding the protocol of the House, we should avoid displaying images in the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600039#MM00800","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speech","time":1643209920,"counter":418,"content":"<p>Sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600039#MM00900","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1643209920,"counter":419,"content":"<p>In the past few minutes I have been sitting in the Chamber the focus has been on the tension between Ukraine and Russia and the huge impact it is having.  We think back to stories we heard about the Cuban crisis and the standoff there was there between the United States and Russia in the early 1960s.<\/p>  <p>  In the few brief minutes I have I wish to focus on the huge impact this is having on people's economic lives in this country and on energy costs.  What can we do to alleviate the hardship that is happening at the moment and the continuing crisis that energy costs and the way they have spiralled will impact every household and every business in this country?  The most vulnerable in society will feel electricity costs the worst.  Whether it is heating oil, diesel for the car or electricity, there has been huge inflation in recent months.  In every industry, whether hospitality, manufacturing or whatever else, the spiralling energy costs will have a huge inflationary effect that will be felt by all sectors of society.  I was talking to a publican the other night.  He is very glad to have his pub reopened but says his electricity bill has gone up by 250%.  After an extremely difficult two years, this will be a huge economic burden for publicans.<\/p>  <p>Last week, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of which I am Chairman, was briefed by Mr. Fabien Santini of the European Commission on what the Commission intends to do on energy costs.  Specifically, we were focusing on the cost of fertiliser to the agri sector.  I definitely got the impression at the meeting that the Commission is not overly concerned and feels the matter will sort itself out.  If the usage of chemical fertiliser dropped by 15%, 20% or 25%, the Commission would not shed too many tears.  However, it has far more implications than that.  First of all, we see food inflation at the moment.  I think we are going to have food inflation definitely in excess of 25%.  There has been no recognition of what impact it is going to have on the poorer nations of the world.  There are 800 million people currently in starvation in a famine situation.  There are 2 billion more living on an inadequate diet.  If there is a curtailment of food production, those countries are going to feel it the worst.  We will have many more people in a starvation situation around the world.<\/p> <p> Food security was one of the key cornerstones of EU policy for a long time.  It is something that I have not heard mentioned for a long time.  I think we will start to hear it again.  Food security is going to become an important cog of policy once more.  The cost of the production of food is going to increase dramatically this year.  There is an onus on us to ensure that the underprivileged in world society do not feel the greatest brunt of it and that we do not end up in a situation where there are billions of people around the globe who are starving because of this energy crisis.  It is beyond our control as a country to solve, but in my view, it is not beyond the control of the EU to try and resolve the issue and reduce the cost of energy.  It will affect the most vulnerable in world society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600039#MM01000","speaker":"1611","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643210520,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I wish to raise concerns around Russia and the planned military exercises off the coast of County Cork in the coming weeks.  I know that for some of my constituents, and in particular fishermen in Cork, there are a lot of concerns about these exercises.  While there are no rules to stop the Russians from doing them, it is deeply concerning that they are choosing to do them off the Irish coast.  The Minister of State needs to push his EU colleagues to support us in making it clear that these exercises are not welcome and should not happen.  Given the current tensions between Russia, Ukraine and NATO, now is not the time or the place for these sorts of exercises.  There is some frustration at the impact that they could have on fishermen, especially at a time when they are already struggling.  There are also real concerns about the potential environmental and fish stock impacts that these exercises could have.  Ireland is a neutral State, and we ask Russia and all other military powers to respect our neutrality.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to take the opportunity to mention the Women of Honour, for whom I have huge respect and admiration.  The Minister for Defence is refusing to listen to the Women of Honour, who are asking for respect and for a proper and full inquiry.  I want to pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Sorca Clarke, for the phenomenal work she has done in raising this issue here.  It is really disappointing to once again see survivors treated with disrespect and a lack of empathy by this Government.  The Women of Honour have attempted to work constructively with the Department of Defence and the Government, but are being shut out.  I urge the Minister for Defence to listen to these concerns now and to act urgently to take them on board.  The Department must accept that it is undermining the Women of Honour group's trust and it needs to work to repair it.  There can be no delays or attempts to sweep the issue under the carpet.  Have we not learned from the mother and baby homes, the CervicalCheck scandal and the Kerry babies case?  The way that we treat women in this State never seems to change.  Women like those in the Women of Honour group must be listened to and respected.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I want to use my remaining time to ask what the EU is doing to help and support the people of Yemen.  There are 21 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, 11 million of whom are children.  Some 10,000 children have either been killed or maimed because of the ongoing war.  It is said to be the worst place in the world to be a child, and still the war continues into its seventh year.  What is the EU doing?  There is an onus on all of us to act.

Membership has granted us access to vaccines as soon as the technology was developed.  Indeed, our membership also allowed us access to EU purchasing power which we could not have achieved on our own.  It has also provided us with boosters for younger age groups, along with the latest in antiviral medicine, which allows us to continue to combat this serious disease.  Indeed, access to vaccines and boosters is the primary reason we, in Ireland, are now emerging from the worst ravages of Covid and the Omicron wave.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach outlined how the EU is now the largest donor of vaccines to the developing world and acknowledged that 1.7 billion doses had already been delivered to developing nations.  Indeed, he said that the manufacturing was at such scale that potentially global distribution and roll-out can now be achieved.  He stated that we have to work with our EU partners in terms of distributing Covid vaccines.  This also highlights the potential for the emergence of a variant of concern while the developed world remains unvaccinated.  It also calls into question the present policy of Ireland and the Government to not support the TRIPS waiver that would allow for mRNA vaccine technology manufacture to be implemented under licence in the developing world, ensuring a faster roll-out of vaccines.  Has the Government taken any time to reconsider its position on TRIPS?<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach also spoke about energy and the rising energy prices, particularly in oil and gas, that are of concern across the EU.  He mentioned the Cabinet approval of &euro;210 million to provide a rebate to all households to offset rising energy costs.  Unfortunately, it is a fact that energy costs are here to stay for some time.  I would imagine that there will not be another rebate for a very long time.  What is the future of our overseas gas supply, given the European dependence on Russian gas?  We have made much of Ireland's potential to generate electricity from offshore wind, but in truth, we are more than a decade away from seeing this implemented to any great scale.  Therefore, we have to depend on the supply coming through the UK and from our EU partners.  <\/p>  <p>  The developing situation in Ukraine must give us all pause for thought.  The Russian amassing of troops and tanks close to the Ukrainian border is a deeply symbolic act of potential aggression against its neighbour.  Indeed, the proposed Russian navy live fire exercises to be conducted in Ireland's marine economic zone is also an unwelcome act of sabre-rattling to the EU.  The issue of Ukrainian sovereignty and its potential right to join or align with NATO appears to be the main concern of President Putin and his Kremlin officials.  What is the official Irish policy?  I ask the Minister of State to enunciate it and how it relates to our European partners.  Does this latest international emergency not yet again question Ireland's ability to defend itself, and for our Defence Forces to monitor our land and sea areas effectively, as well as to patrol our skies?  We may be neutral, but does this mean that our Defence Forces must remain neutered due to years of underfunding?  When will this situation be resolved?<\/p>  <p>  In terms of financial recovery post Covid, the Taoiseach mentioned the concerns in the EU regarding rising inflation and the headwind it represents to future Union economic growth.  It appears Ireland is to support further and deeper banking union and mandates.  It must be said that at present, the choice available to domestic customers in Ireland is at an all-time low.<\/p> <p>It is not uncommon at present for small builders in this country to access finance from larger builders at an annual percentage rate of up to 10% simply because they cannot borrow from the remaining pillar banks which have zero appetite for any risk and are only willing to support small home builders when they have a contract in place with a local authority for the sale of the houses.  For all its strategy, I suggest the Government must find a way to address the issue of builder finance.<\/p> <p> We signed our accession treaty in 1973.  It has to be said that Ireland has come a long way in terms of economic growth, improved standards of living and greater diversity in our population as a result of our membership of the EU.  It also has to be said that we have benefited from EU law and EU standards.  We hope this will continue to be the case.  We will continue to be a strong advocate of EU cohesion and EU policy.  It appears that at present the financial landscape is favourable or proving favourable but we must take every step in future to ensure any uplift in the tide lifts prosperity for all boats in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600040#NN00300","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643211120,"counter":424,"content":"<p>As we sit here today the spectre of war once again looms over Europe.  We can but hope that it will amount to sabre-rattling of old superpowers and that the dreadful vista of another conflict on our continent on the edge of the European Union does not come to pass.  Throughout history, wars have been fought ostensibly over territory, identity, religion and a myriad of other excuses or reasons but at the heart of many if not most wars has been resources, specifically access to and control of resources.  Europe is dependent on Russian gas.  It brokers for peace and stability with one hand tied behind its back knowing that the heat and electricity that flows to millions of homes throughout the continent can be curtailed and that the price of heat and electricity can be driven upwards.<\/p>  <p>  This is not a hypothetical scenario.  We know it is already happening.  The energy crisis we are experiencing and the deteriorating geopolitical crisis are two sides of the same coin.  As a member of the Green Party I have spoken many times in the House about why we must reduce our dependence on all fossil fuels as quickly as possible for inarguable climate reasons.  However, it is clear that energy security is another reason we must do so.  True energy independence and security of supply will come from developing our indigenous energy resources, with those resources being clean and renewable.<\/p>  <p>  We have more energy in the confines of our borders than we will likely ever need but we have barely started to harness it.  The events on the Ukraine border as much as the climate crisis compel us here in Ireland to expedite our efforts.  We should not and cannot do so alone.  The scale of the challenge to develop this infrastructure is such that we need Europe's help through financing, labour, expertise and regulation.  It is in Europe's interest that we in Ireland build up as quickly as possible our deep water port capacity to stage arrays of thousands of large wind turbines off the Atlantic coast and that our interconnection capacity is ramped up so that we, and not the Russians, can send vast amounts of power, and clean power as opposed to fossil fuel power, to Europe when it needs it.<\/p>  <p>  There are parallels today with the oil crisis of the 1970s.  Back then it was other European countries, notably Denmark and Germany, that seized the opportunity and ultimately developed major renewable energy industries.  Ireland faltered.  Instead we flirted with the idea of nuclear power at Carnsore in Wexford before settling on building a hugely polluting coal power station at Moneypoint in Clare.  Neither nuclear nor coal are the answer for Ireland now when we have vast quantities of realisable energy off our shores.<\/p>  <p>  In future our homes can and I believe will be heated with Irish renewable electricity.  For this to happen we need to undertake a massive retrofitting programme.  We will learn the details of this in the coming weeks.  The programme will set a plan for hundreds of thousands of homes throughout Ireland to remove fossil fuel boilers and install heat pumps.  We will reduce the need for energy by retrofitting installation and replacing windows with low u-value glazing.  The homes of the future will be airtight with heat recovery ventilation systems to ensure fresh air while reducing heat loss to outside.<\/p>  <p>  Everything I have said today indicates the direction we are going.  It will be a Herculean effort.  The question remains as to how quickly we can get there.  For climate reasons as well as for energy security reasons we must get there as quickly as possible.  It is urgent.  We must apply every lever at our disposal and turn to Europe to assist us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600041#OO00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1643211120,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I have to raise the issue of the impending missile testing due to take place off the west Cork coast by the Russian army.  At this point I have to outline the devastating impact this missile testing will have on marine wildlife in the area.  The area in question is known as the Porcupine Seabight.  To describe the Porcupine Seabight, it is almost like a chunk taken out of the continental shelf.  It is where the continental shelf eventually drops off into the deep.  It is a rich and incredibly important area of biodiversity in the north-east Atlantic.  It is important for whales, dolphins, fish species and other marine wildlife.<\/p>  <p>  To give an example of how important it is, I will go through some of the species that can be encountered there.  It is one of the most important areas in the north-east Atlantic for the blue whale.  The blue whale is the biggest animal that has ever roamed this planet at well over 30 m long.  This area is incredibly important for it.  Blue whales, like all cetaceans, hunt acoustically.  They use sound to hunt.  The impact of the high decibel volume of missile launches and missile testing will have a huge impact on this beautiful species.<\/p>  <p>  Another example, and perhaps an even better example of how it will impact wildlife, is the sperm whale.  The Porcupine Seabight is one of the most important areas in the Atlantic for sperm whales.  Sperm whales dive down to the depths to hunt where there is no light.  It is completely dark.  They use a high frequency click, like a sonar, to hunt and source their prey.  As we can imagine, as the Russian military amass off the west coast of Cork it will be monitored.  It will be monitored by NATO, the UK and the rest of Europe.  Therefore, we can be absolutely assured there will be Russian submarines pinging sonar at a high rate and a high frequency.  For a species like the sperm whale this is known to have a detrimental effect.  We will have mass strandings.<\/p>  <p>  Another species that is a good example is the long-finned pilot whale.  The Porcupine Seabight is one of the most important areas of the sea for this species.  When long-finned pilot whales were massacred in their thousands in the Faroe Islands, we in Ireland and the rest of Europe were astonished and absolutely shocked but now we propose to stand by and watch while the Russian army conducts missile tests that will have a devastating impact on a species such as the pilot whale that feeds at the deep.  We will have mass strandings of pilot whales, sperm whales and other deep sea beaked whales.  It will be an ecological disaster.  We must do everything possible to stop it.<\/p>  <p>  It is not just marine wildlife that will be impacted.  It will also impact on livelihoods.  We are all now well aware that a flotilla of 50 boats intends to go out to the Porcupine Seabight to peacefully protest this activity.  I am firmly behind the fishers of west Cork and the rest of Ireland who will do this.  The Porcupine Seabight, because it is such an important area for biodiversity, is one of the most important fishing grounds in Europe for species such as nephrops, prawns and blue whiting.  It is incredibly important.  Fishing is due to start in February but this cannot happen because the Russian army will be active there.  This will impact coastal livelihoods as well as wildlife, which is why we need to intervene.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard it said on a few occasions that there is no law we can invoke in Ireland to stop this happening.  Paragraph 1(a) of Article 56 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea states that in the exclusive economic zone of the coastal state, the state has sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring, exploiting and conserving and managing the natural resources whether living or non-living.  This is in the exclusive economic zone.  Fish species are a living resource and this says to me that we have the rights to conserve them and if we see a threat we can invoke Article 56.  I urge the Government to do so and to use our seat at the Security Council to do so and ensure there is not an ecological disaster on the Porcupine Seabight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600041#OO00300","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1643211720,"counter":426,"content":"<p>With the little time that I have, there are a number of issues that I need to raise.  The urgent one, of course, at this point is off the south-west coast and the Russian military exercise and the damage this will do to Irish fishermen as they fish in these areas, as well as the damage to so much marine life.  There is no doubt that this Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government has destroyed the income of so many fishermen in the sell-out of Irish fishing rights in a shocking Brexit deal last year.  Now we find that more difficulties are being heaped on our fishermen with this Russian military exercise bringing 140 warships and 10,000 sailors to take part in this exercise.  It looks like it is the fault of this and previous Governments to allow this to happen as the Irish have a lack of primary radar.  Other countries know this and some have been probing our air spaces and seas for years due to this.  It is high time, therefore, to stop talking and chasing Russians who are falling around and laughing at us but instead to cut out any blindspots we have in our own country itself.<\/p>  <p>  As I said earlier when talking about Europe, fishing and farming, of course, very much comes to mind.  The price of fertiliser has gone through the roof for farmers.  Many will go under if the Government stands idly by.  We are talking about increases for some farmers of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 for fertiliser this year and perhaps even more.   At last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which I attended as a member, there were many ways that Mr. Santini, deputy head of unit at the European Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development, explained where Ireland can intervene itself in its own State.  We are talking today, however, about European intervention and, yes, the Government will say that the price of gas is the issue, as Europe&rsquo;s green agenda is pushing us near the edge.  The issue of tariffs on fertilisers is another nail in the coffin for the Irish farmer.  Can the Minister of State tell us what the Government has done in Europe to ease the pressure on Irish farmers caused by the high cost of fertilisers?  Perhaps he might answer that question later because it is a very significant and worrying issue for many farmers who are trying to buy fertiliser at the moment and cannot.<\/p>  <p>  Why have negotiations on the fishing industry not yielded success?  We all know the filthy deal this Government signed up to last year.  When the dust has settled now, how can our fellow European countries involved in fishing call this a fair deal?

The Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il earlier and again yesterday that the Government could not do anything about the price of fertiliser when it was raised with him by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.  That conflicts directly with the evidence of the EU Commission representative given to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine last week, as referred to by Deputy Collins.  Of course we can.  We blame Europe all the time, saying that we cannot do this or we cannot do that.  We are the first country then to implement their punitive legislation and to add more statutory instruments to it.  I hear Deputies such as Deputy Cahill and other backbenchers blaming everything on the Russians in respect of the crisis at the moment.  We had a vote 15 months ago on the carbon tax.  Some ten Deputies supported my vote on that and all of the parties voted for the tax.  Now they are wringing their hands in saying that this is all to do with Russia.  We will blame the man above next.  A perfect storm has been created by the Government.  It does not want people to live and it is trying to force people into penury, hunger, starvation and God knows what.  We will not have a food supply.<\/p>  <p>  I come from a mixed farm and we grew everything every kind of crop.  These farms will not survive because they will not be profitable.  There must be a small profit margin but it will not be there.  <\/p>  <p>  When I heard Deputy Leddin, a Green Party member, saying in committee that he was delighted that the price of fertiliser had gone up, I had to ask what type of thinking was that?  What kind of respect is that from a man who lives in Limerick city but quite close to the country.  This is the madness that is going on here for two years, supported by RT&Eacute; and everybody else, about climate change.  I am not a climate change denier but we are rushing and forcing people through all of these cuts to go electric but they perish when there are power cuts because they have no other form of heating.  Now the Government wants to stop turf and coal burning and to take chimneys off houses.  The lunatics are running the asylum here and it is time that someone called a halt to it.  It is shameful the way Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are being dangled on a string by the Green Party and are being supported by some of the rural-based Independent Deputies in the Regional Group,on a daily basis.  I do not know how they are going to face the people.  <\/p>  <p>  They have run amok and rushed to implement Green Party policies with no thinking being done.  Our power plants must be closed down, coal burning must be stopped and we have nothing to replace it.  A Deputy said earlier that it would take ten years before we have any energy from the sea.  What will we have in the meantime?  We will have penury, going around with bags on our back like the mn&aacute; caoineach&aacute;in with shawls and begging and bringing a bag of leite on their backs.  Is that it?  The Government is driving people to despair and it has no shame in it where Europe and everybody else is blamed for everything.  The Government then sits on its hands and does nothing.  Someone said to me that the Government's hands will be shrivelled from the length of time that it is sitting on them because it is doing nothing about anything and is only penalising our people and our nation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600042#PP00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1643211720,"counter":428,"content":"<p>Deputy Connolly is sharing with Deputy Harkin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600042#PP00300","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speech","time":1643211720,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I just have two and a half minutes.  I will use my voice to say I am horrified at the sabre rattling, and not by Russia alone but by NATO, America and England.  It is completely unacceptable.  I will quote from Afri who have written to us all and pointed out, on the death of Desmond Tutu, where he \"identified war and the war industry as one of the great evils of our time [and] pointing to the immoral wastage of resources which it represents as well as the extent to which it destroys people and wreaks havoc on our precious planet\".  I agree totally with Afri, which also stated: &ldquo;On the occasion of the burial of such a great peacemaker, we ask: why is Ireland increasingly joining the war mongers club?&rdquo;  That is exactly what we are doing.  At that point in January the question was: why are we increasing spending on weapons of death and why are we encouraging Irish businesses to get involved in producing weapons?  If I had longer I would go into that with the Minister of State.<\/p>  <p>  For today I am using my voice to say that I do not agree with what Russia is doing.  I certainly do not agree with what NATO is doing.  What we have here is absolute warmongering, with games of war without any reality, or the voice of Ireland being neutral, and the use of that voice in a positive way.  <\/p>  <p>  The website of the Department of Foreign Affairs states in respect of Russian-Irish relations that: \"Ireland&rsquo;s election to the UN Security Council for the period 2021-2022 has enhanced high-level links between Ireland and Russia.\"  On those enhanced high-level links, what have we done with that role and how have we used that role?  Perhaps the Minister of State might enlighten us today rather than joining the voices of the warmongers.   Consensus has got into trouble before with information that led us &ndash; not me - to the invasion of Iraq, which was completely based on false information.  I am using my voice today to say that Ireland is a neutral country.  There should be no troops through Shannon Airport.  Let us make clear that we will not allow Shannon to be used.<\/p>  <p>  In my last few seconds I want to raise the issue of Palestine again.  Was that raised at the Council and what action are we now taking?  We have expressed concern as to the organisations that were designated as terrorist organisations.  Let us go beyond our concern and make a statement now as an independent sovereign country ourselves.  What have we done to help those six organisations that have been unacceptably and deplorably designated as terrorist organisations?

First, I want to strongly voice my support and call for intensive and sustained dialogue between the EU and Russia, NATO and Russia, and the US and Russia in an effort to de-escalate the current situation which is a real and present threat to peace in Europe.  At every opportunity, especially at the UN Security Council, we must make our views heard loud and clear to ensure that negotiations are front and centre of all approaches to de-escalate this potential conflict.<\/p>  <p>  I am not giving Russia a free pass here.  We all recognise what is happening with the severe and imminent threat that Vladimir Putin poses to Ukraine and to its territorial integrity.  Respectfully, I have to disagree with some of my colleagues who spoke about NATO manoeuvres and compared them with Russian military aggression.  I do not support NATO manoeuvres but they take place on the territory of countries and with the agreement of sovereign states.  Sovereign states also have a choice whether to be part of NATO.  That is very different from annexations and what is happening with Russian military aggression.  We need a tough, determined approach because we all recognise that military might is only part of the equation.  If tough, co-ordinated sanctions, financial and otherwise, are put in place, it will provide some deterrent.<\/p>  <p>  My second brief point refers to the need for the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver, which is the waiver on intellectual property rights on vaccines.  The Taoiseach mentioned COVAX earlier.<\/p> <p>Today, COVAX is pleading for funds to assist in its roll-out of vaccines to the world's poorest countries.  While it has some vaccines available, it does not have syringes or other necessary elements to ensure the roll-out of the vaccine.  The WHO has said it needs $5.2 billion to support it in rolling out vaccines globally.  A TRIPS waiver on vaccines will not solve the problem overnight, but it would be a massive leap forward and provide the momentum for vaccine production globally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600042#PP00500","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643212320,"counter":432,"content":"<p>We will now proceed to questions and answers for a period not exceeding 20 minutes.

The Government is deeply troubled by the evictions and demolitions which took place in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem on 19 January.  Israel must cease evictions and demolitions and comply with all obligations under international humanitarian law.  These actions undermine the prospects for peace and risk increasing violence.

I have charged that the Government is betraying our tradition of neutrality.  It did that with regard to Shannon and regarding numerous US military adventures.  It is doing it again.  It rightly criticises Russia for what it is doing off our coast with military exercises that are unwanted and should stop - Russia should be told we do not want them - and for Russia's often aggressive stance, military escalations and massing troops on the border, but has the Government any word of criticism about NATO?  If we are trying to be balanced and objective, has the Government a single word of criticism for the eastward expansion of NATO and for the US putting troops, military advisers and so forth into Ukraine?  Does it approve of that?  Does the Irish Government think it is a good idea that NATO is doing military exercises in the Mediterranean Sea while these tensions are ratcheting up?  Does it think these are good ideas, given how they will contribute to the escalation?  The Minister of State should give us a straight answer on that.  I suspect he has not got a word of criticism of NATO, but I ask him to prove me wrong.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of what he said earlier, and I realise we do not have time for a broad debate on it, I would not be so proud of defending the two-state solution.  Many Palestinians do not support the two-state solution.  Frankly, the two-state solution is the equivalent in Palestine of arguing for maintaining partition in Ireland.  That is what the two-state solution was, the partition of Palestine along ethnic and religious lines.  Some would argue, Israelis and Palestinians, that this is the main source of the conflict and that what is actually needed is equality and respect for human rights regardless of whether one is a Jew, an Arab, a Christian or a Muslim, and that a state where everybody has that equality would be a far better solution.

Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and other countries have very good reasons to be in military alliances, if that is their wish.  We are not in military alliances.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Deputy should not confuse military neutrality with taking no sides when there is a clear question of right and wrong.  If a country like Ukraine, a proud country with a proud history, has tanks on its border from Russia that are poised to act, no right-minded person can be neutral.  If one is for democracy and for countries' self-determination and the self-determination of their people, but not in Ukraine, then one is not for democracy and self determination.  There is no neutrality there.  There is no impinging whatsoever on our military neutrality.  The British are sending weapons and so forth.  Ireland is not doing that, but we certainly are taking a stand in international bodies, primarily at the European Council where the Taoiseach took a very strong stand about this.  Yes, the issue arises at the United Nations Security Council.  Of course, we cannot forget that the five great powers have a veto power in the Security Council, so that brings its own complications there.  That is not Ireland's fault.<\/p> <p>There has been a formal meeting on Ukraine, usually once every year in February, that Russia holds when it holds the presidency.  As I understand it, there will be a formal meeting on 17 February this year.  There have been other side meetings under the Arria formula as well on Ukraine.  We are in constant discussions but our diplomatic actions will be primarily focused with our European colleagues, primarily because Ukraine is on the European continent.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Coveney, when discussing this matter made clear his rejection of what Russia is doing in our exclusive economic zone.  The European Council, with the Taoiseach, decided in December that any action from Russia would result in massive consequences.  The truth is the potential for conflict is having a very destabilising effect around the world, particularly in respect of fuel prices.  The Deputy correctly mentioned the cost of fertiliser, for example, which is huge.  One of the biggest factors in producing fertiliser is natural gas and the price of natural gas is going up and up.  One of the current reasons for that is the potential for conflict and our dependence on Russian gas.  This relates to another point, which is that one way to avoid those types of price increases is what Deputy Leddin advocates, a rapid change to renewable energy.  That is the way out of this.<\/p> <p> Currently, this is a real problem.  It will be a problem for the people of Ukraine and the Russian families of dead soldiers if they go in.  That is the reality.  There will be issues with refugees and, from a price perspective, with consumer goods and food in particular.  It is a major crisis and Ireland will do everything it can diplomatically to avoid it.  We have a proud tradition of diplomatic efforts around the world that every Member has referenced.  We are one part of this but we certainly support the rights of people to defend themselves.

How can we move this forward?  I am interested in his view but if we had a TRIPS waiver on vaccines, it would act as a catalyst for the global production of vaccines, not just in this pandemic but for what we might face in future.  It is not just about now.  What is the Minister of State's opinion on that?<\/p>  <p>  My second question relates to COVAX, which the Taoiseach mentioned earlier, including our support for it, etc.  As I said, just today COVAX indicated it cannot distribute any more vaccines because it does not have money to buy syringes or other basic necessary accoutrements.

It is always worthwhile remembering that nobody is getting everything right in this pandemic but with vaccine distribution around the world, the EU is getting much right.  We are the biggest exporter and donor of vaccines around the world and we should be proud of that.  As the Taoiseach said, we must do more, and all this is under consideration.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that COVAX has sounded the alarm in recent weeks about the availability of funds to cover so-called ancillary costs.  As she said, this includes the cost of syringes, swabs, etc.  Ireland was an early donor of ancillary costs and we added &euro;1.5 million to our donations late last year to accompany the commitment to the dose donations.  We have received private messages of thanks from COVAX for being an early mover in this regard, in contrast to a number of other countries that have not given this funding that is required to go along with vaccines.  I am very proud of that and I am glad to be able to tell the House that.  The matter was raised by Deputies Shanahan and Gannon, I believe, and other Deputies.  It is very important.  Deputies Cahill and Crowe have also mentioned it.<\/p>  <p>  To date, we have provided &euro;8.5 million to COVAX and in the coming week or so we will disburse another &euro;5 million, bringing our total to &euro;13.5 million.  Ireland has a proud track record in this.  We want to get the vaccines out there as quickly as possible and there is more we can do.  A TRIPS waiver is definitely a potential part of the solution but there are other elements to consider as well.  We can simply give vaccines to these countries but we can also build up manufacturing capacity to ensure that if intellectual property waivers are given, there can be capacity to manufacture these complicated products.

It is always worth bearing in mind that this was one of the reasons we are in the Union, and one of the fundamental reasons for the Common Agricultural Policy, which is to protect food security in Europe.  The Deputy raised very important points that need to be discussed on an urgent basis.<\/p>  <p>  I join in the sympathies expressed by Members on the death of Mr. David Sassoli, the President of the European Parliament.<\/p>  <p> On crisis management and resilience, the December European Council endorsed the conclusions agreed at the General Affairs Council on 23 November, which I attended, and they invited our Council to take this work forward, and we are to do that.  This followed the earlier discussion in June taking stock of work to enhance our collective preparedness, response capability, and resilience to future crises.  The integrated political crisis response arrangements developed in 2013 have been flexible and useful for addressing the Covid-19 pandemic.  Building resilience against future crises means working now to strengthen the Single Market, particularly by removing unnecessary barriers to trade in services, where there is so much untapped potential.  We will keep this topic under review.<\/p>  <p>  I will now turn to external aspects of migration.  I believe that this issue deserves much greater debate and focus in Ireland.  Strengthening the external dimension of migration covers a number of issues such as returns and readmission; border management; targeting people smugglers; protection solutions and dignified reception facilities, which is a major topic of discussion in Ireland; legal migration pathways; and addressing the root causes of migration.  Leaders discussed the importance of addressing migration in a whole-of-route and comprehensive approach.  Nine priority countries have been identified for action plans: Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Nigeria, Niger, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkey, Afghanistan and Iraq.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will attend the EU&ndash;African Union Summit next month.  This will be an important milestone in our relationship with Africa.  Ireland wants a more ambitious and effective EU-Africa partnership.  At the European Council in December, EU leaders discussed the preparations for the summit and the possible themes and deliverables.  The EU aims to establish an ambitious future-oriented alliance with Africa that can build an area of prosperity and stability, underpinned by a transformational investment package.  Ireland will be strongly supportive of those initiatives.  Leaders also discussed the situation in Ethiopia.  Leaders were in agreement on the urgent need to ensure the protection of civilians and to ensure unhindered humanitarian access, and called for an unconditional ceasefire and for all parties to engage in an inclusive dialogue.  Ireland has played a leading role in the international response to the crisis, in particular at the UN Security Council and at the EU.  A coherent EU response is critical.  Such a response should include a strategy to increase political and financial pressure on the parties to de-escalate and to incentivise humanitarian access. <\/p>  <p>  On the issue of EU-UK relations, while not discussed specifically at the Council, discussions are continuing between the EU and the UK.  I note that some issues have arisen today around statements by certain parties, but we have had a very calm. firm and listening approach to this.  We want to make sure we can deliver solutions to some of the problems that Brexit has caused in Northern Ireland.  I am confident that we have seen a move from the UK towards real discussions.  From what the UK is saying, I detect a focus on fixing problems rather than simply, as some used to say, scrapping the protocol, which was never going to happen.  The protocol is here and is a legally binding international document.  We have the full support for and confidence in Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d and the Commission team.  They brief us regularly at the General Affairs Council, and the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and our colleagues who were in Strasbourg at the weekend also.  It is very useful dialogue and engagement, and we are very grateful for that.  We will let those negotiations continue knowing that they are in good hands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600045#SS00100","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1643213520,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

It is particularly timely and pertinent given the publication today of the independent report on the review of care provided in the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, in south Kerry.  The report sets out a catalogue of failures across multiple levels of the system in the care provided to young people accessing CAMHS in Kerry.  I am sure Members of the House will be with me when I say my thoughts are with the families and children affected by this report.  To learn of the systemic failings in their care is absolutely devastating.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has met 198 young people who have been affected, and their families, to discuss the deficits in the care they received and to provide them with key information and referral to any necessary services and supports.  This includes counselling supports and appropriate services from within child and adult mental health services.  The HSE apologised to each individual at these meetings, and subsequently in writing, for any harm caused.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge the significant and wide-ranging impact on the children and young people affected.  There were 227 children identified where the diagnosis or treatment given to them by a junior doctor or non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, exposed them to risk of one of more of following: sedation; emotional and cognitive blunting; growth disturbance and serious weight changes; metabolic and endocrine disturbance; and psychological distress.<\/p>  <p>  The report clearly identifies that the medicalisation of ordinary emotional responses in children and their suppression by medication risks delaying or damaging the development of emotional self-regulation skills which normally happens as children mature.  Thirteen other children were found to have been unnecessarily exposed to a risk of harm under the care of other doctors in the service.  Very importantly, there was clear evidence of significant harm caused to 46 children in the files that were reviewed.  This included the production of breast milk, considerable weight gain, sedation during the day and elevated blood pressure.  This figure of 46 will change as new information becomes available from meetings with the children, young people and families affected.<\/p>  <p>  The look-back review team also examined 34 files in north Kerry CAMHS where there was an indication the named junior doctor was involved in their care.  There were concerns raised in regard to 20 children and young people in that service.  The HSE has offered an apology to them and their families, and there is a process in place for any ongoing intervention that might be required.  The HSE undertook the investigation using its incident management framework and is liaising with other bodies, including Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Medical Council, as appropriate and as required.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the report has made findings about failings in the care and clinical oversight provided to numerous children and young people and has made recommendations to improve that care.<\/p> <p>These failings occurred at multiple levels of the system and over a protracted period.<\/p> <p> The key factors that contributed to these failings are extensive and include, among others, the absence of a clinical lead and CAMHS consultant from 2016 for the CAMHS team.  Another CAMHS consultant agreed to cover this vacant post until it was filled on the expectation it would be on a short-term basis.  The potential risks involved with this arrangement were not effectively managed and there was no regular, effective oversight of the NCHD's work through formal supervision and frequent joint working with a senior doctor.<\/p> <p> While concerns about the NCHD were first reported in 2018, no proof was found that these concerns were addressed after being reported.  The most worrying part of it is that those extra two years could have been prevented.  In 2019, concerns about prescribing medication were clearly identified.  However, the supervisor at the time advised changes but did not insist that these be implemented.  When a new senior medical manager started in the service in 2020, concerns were not raised in respect of the NCHD's practices.  The report outlines a number of areas where the supervision of the NCHD failed and where effective action was not taken; where concerns were apparent; and where the opportunity to change the doctor's practice was not taken effectively.<\/p> <p> Other contributory factors included that there was no system used by the doctor's supervisors to check the prescribing of medications or the quality of service; a lack of adherence to the national CAMHS operating procedure 2015 or the CAMHS operational guideline 2019; referral acceptance levels, including the high level of cases that were managed by the NCHD; the team not maintaining an electronic diary process to co-ordinate their work; and poor case record management processes.  There are also concerns regarding governance and oversight of the team by line management and the effectiveness of the CAMHS oversight group.<\/p> <p> The HSE acknowledges the extent of the failures that have occurred.  It has considered the report locally and nationally and has accepted the recommendations.  Work is under way to implement the full suite of recommendations as a matter of priority.  Among the recommendations made are an assessment of a reconfiguration of the service and a full nationwide audit of compliance with existing CAMHS operational guidelines by all CAMHS teams.  Furthermore, a prescribing audit will be conducted in each of the 72 CAMHS teams nationally.  A further audit of case files in north Kerry will also be carried out.<\/p> <p> With respect to reconfiguration of the service, and with the hope of instilling some comfort to all that services will be delivered in line with best practice, all governance and organisation structures will be reviewed with a view to assessing reconfiguration of the service to address the systemic failings that have occurred.<\/p> <p> People will understandably be concerned about CAMHS in their own communities.  That is why it is important there will be a full audit nationwide of compliance with CAMHS operational guidelines by all CAMHS teams.  In addition, I have asked the HSE to provide assurances regarding prescribing practices in all CAMHS teams nationally.  A prescribing audit will be conducted in each of the 72 teams to include a random selection of files, proportional to the medical caseload, from a continuous six-month predefined period in 2021.<\/p> <p> There are 35 recommendations in the report, which cover other areas such as, among others, staff training, clinical oversight, recruitment, care planning, and involvement of children and families in governance structures.  Beyond the recommendations set out in the report, I will also be calling for the reinstatement of a HSE national director for mental health, in line with our programme for Government.  I would appreciate support in doing this.  I believe this post is essential in driving the fundamental reforms needed across our mental health system, not least in our child and youth mental health services.<\/p> <p> An information line is open on 1800 742 800 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week for anyone affected by the report.  I would also encourage anyone of any age, wherever they are in the country, to reach out for help if they are affected by any of the issues raised in this report.<\/p> <p> I can assure the House that I will be staying in close contact with the HSE on the implementation of the recommendations set out in the Maskey report.<\/p> <p> We are all part of a family and we were all young once.  Many of us have children and most of us have young relatives.  Our children are the most important thing and to read of the systemic failings in their care is devastating.  This is not just about the clinical decisions taken by one person but about how staff and teams manage themselves, are supervised and overseen in terms of their practices, and identify risks to ensure issues are picked up early and addressed.<\/p> <p> More broadly, given the prevalence of mental health difficulties among children and young people living in Ireland, in addition to the mounting pressures experienced by our mental health services, the scale of the challenges we face is significant.  In response to this, a range of actions are under way in the areas of policy, legislation and practice to enhance the experiences of children, young people and families using our mental health services and ultimately to improve their mental health outcomes.<\/p> <p> Regarding national mental health policy, the national implementation and monitoring committee tasked with overseeing and driving implementation of Sharing the Vision has established a specialist group on child and youth mental health.  The work of this group will be critical to ensuring the specific child and youth recommendations of the policy are fully realised in practice.  This includes necessary improvements in the areas of out-of-hours supports, transitioning from child to adult mental health services, and greater collaboration between different sectors and agencies to ensure the individual needs of children and young people are fully met.<\/p> <p> Connecting for Life, our national suicide reduction strategy has been extended to 2024.  The strategy identifies priority groups, including young people, and provides a further opportunity to enhance child and youth mental health service provision in Ireland.  More than 20 partners are involved in the implementation of the strategy including Tusla, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and the Department of Education.  They each lead on or support a range of actions with the aim of reducing suicide, promoting mental health and well-being and enhancing services for our children and young people.<\/p> <p> Significant strides have been made to update Ireland's mental health legislation, in line with international human rights standards, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Reform of the Mental Health Act in full will enhance the rights and protections of people accessing specialist mental health services, including children and young people.<\/p> <p> The general scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act contains a new Part specifically dedicated to the care and treatment of children.  The general scheme also provides for the extension of the Mental Health Commission's system of regulation, registration and inspection to all community mental health services, including those for children and adolescents.  This provision is critical in enhancing the protections of people using our services.<\/p> <p> The general scheme is currently subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health, which commenced in November 2021.  I thank the members of the committee for all the work they are doing.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel commenced the drafting of the Bill itself the last week.  I hope to introduce the Bill to the House as early as possible this year.<\/p> <p> I take the opportunity today to highlight some of the recent developments in child and youth mental health service delivery.  These initiatives seek to address the challenges we face across our system, including, for example, ongoing issues with increasing numbers of referrals, staff retention and difficulties with recruitment, with it taking on average nine to ten months to fill a post.<\/p> <p> Budget 2022, which provided &euro;1.149 billion for mental health, includes specific funding to continue the enhancement of CAMHS.  More specifically, it will allow for the establishment of two new CAMHS tele-hubs and a dedicated &euro;6 million to expand the capacity of community mental health teams nationally, with a particular emphasis on CAMHS.<\/p> <p> Further investment will also be made in the national clinical mental health programmes this year, many of which are available to children and young people.  One example is the national clinical programme on eating disorders, which has secured an additional &euro;1.15 million in 2022 for the development of additional specialist eating disorder teams.<\/p> <p> Funding for 2022 also includes &euro;10 million for initiatives aimed at increasing mental health supports in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  This includes enhanced signposting and access to existing mental health services and supports; initiatives for children, young people and students; and additional psychosocial responses, recognising that people will require varying levels of support.  The HSE is actively working on these initiatives to get them up and running as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> A further &euro;10 million in once-off additional funding announced on budget day has been allocated to improve the experiences of individuals, including children and young people accessing specialist mental health services, in addition to community and voluntary mental supports.  I was very conscious when allocating this funding that the service user would be front and centre.<\/p> <p> Some &euro;1.8 million of the &euro;10 million fund is for vehicles and will support the transport needs of people using mental health services and promote their engagement within the community.  This may include, for example, travel to and from medical and other personal appointments, employment and education programmes, day centres and social activities.<\/p> <p>As part of the fund, &euro;1 million will be distributed in partnership with Mental Health Ireland to support the work of smaller local voluntary groups providing vital mental health supports in communities nationwide.  The fund will go live next Monday, 31 January, and I encourage any group with a proposal or project that meets the criteria to apply.  A further &euro;1 million of the overall &euro;10 million is for MyMind to deliver approximately 16,000 counselling sessions, in over 15 languages, free of charge to people impacted negatively by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Under 18-year-olds can access the sessions with parental supervision.<\/p> <p> Other developments that seek to respond to the challenges and increasing pressures on our child and youth mental health system include significant advancements in the delivery of digital mental health supports, including the 50808 crisis text service; NGO online supports such as those provided by MyMind, SpunOut, SilverCloud, Turn2Me, Jigsaw and many more; and the national roll-out of digital cognitive behavioural therapy to address depression and anxiety in Ireland, enabling individuals, including young people, to access essential supports within 24 hours of referral.  The commencement of two new Jigsaw services brings the total number of sites to 14 nationally and complements its digital services that are available nationwide.  It now has 66% coverage of the whole country with regard to premises and 100% coverage in relation to online supports.  There will be an investment of &euro;6.85 million to progress the national clinical programme on eating disorders.  Last year, I secured &euro;3.94 million to complete the three existing teams, of which two are CAMHS teams, and three new teams which are nearing completion.  Funding allocated in 2022 will provide an additional four specialist eating disorder teams, with one of these being dedicated for CAMHS.<\/p> <p> In line with programme for Government commitments, there has been a year-on-year decrease in the number of child admissions to adult acute mental health units.  In 2019, there were 50 such admissions, whereas in 2020 there were 27 such admissions.  Latest data from the HSE for 2021 indicate that as of November, there were fewer than 27 admissions for last year.  The vast majority of these admissions are among young people aged 17 and older, with some aged 16 years plus a number of months.<\/p> <p> Last month, I announced a significant reduction of over 19% among children and young people under 18 waiting more than 12 months to be seen by primary care psychology services.  This follows an allocation of &euro;4 million that I secured last August to address such lists through targeted initiatives.  I am fully committed to continuing to work with my colleagues in government to ensure the development of a sustainable primary care psychology service in the longer term.  I am seeking funding to continue that roll-out.  We were able to take 1,000 children off the list in a four-month period and if we could do that again, it would be very helpful.  All the children who were taken off the list were waiting in excess of 12 months.<\/p> <p> The HSE&rsquo;s psychosocial framework, which was launched last year, will complement the changes needed to fundamentally reform our mental health system, as set out in Sharing the Vision, and in line with the current overhaul of our mental health legislation.  This must also be supported by enhanced compliance with any existing or newly developed guidance to ensure consistency and standardisation in mental health service delivery.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, I thank Deputies for participating in this debate, including those who are present in the Chamber.  I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify how many of the concerns of Members of the House are being or will be addressed.  There is no doubt that we all seek continued developments and improvements across our mental health system.  I am fully committed to working with all Members to see this fundamental ambition realised.  It is essential that all individuals, including our children and young people, accessing mental health services and supports receive a high-quality service, delivered in line with best practice, that is standardised in all parts of the country regardless of where people live.  Finally, I thank mental health service staff and the community and voluntary sector for their immense work and ongoing dedication to supporting the mental health needs of people living in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600046#YY00400","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643215020,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I am pleased to address the House on this important subject and to outline the work being done in the area of public health and well-being and the national drug strategy to support our young people.  Healthy Ireland: A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013-2025, which was launched in March 2013, is a national framework action to improve the health and well-being of the country over the coming generation.  Since last year, it has been further supported by Healthy Ireland's strategic action plan, which provides direction for implementation of Healthy Ireland's plan from 2021 to 2025.  Healthy Ireland takes a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to improve health and well-being and to tackle the major lifestyle issues that lead to negative health outcomes, namely, smoking, alcohol, poor diet, physical inactivity and obesity.  Positive mental health is a key element of health and well-being and of the work of Healthy Ireland.<\/p><p>The report of last year's Healthy Ireland survey presented key findings on social connectedness and mental health in the context of the ongoing Covid 19 pandemic.  Needless to say, the necessary Covid-19 restrictions had a significant impact on people's social interactions and consequently on their mental health.  While the restrictions were absolutely necessary to control the spread of the virus, social interaction is a very important part of our lives.  Inevitably, there was a negative impact on people's mental well-being.  Over 80% of respondents reported that they were less socially connected as a result of the restrictions.  Almost one third of respondents reported that their mental health had worsened since the start of the public health restrictions.<\/p><p>As part of our response to these challenges, we have provided guidance and support for people to manage both their physical and mental well-being through public health information campaigns such as the In This Together and Keep Well campaigns, and through information networks including key organisations working with vulnerable people.  Working with partner organisations, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, NGOs and Volunteer Ireland, there was a particular emphasis on identifying and supporting those most at risk of isolation.  I wish to mention the support provided by the HSE to a number of organisations working in the area of youth mental health, such as Jigsaw, Childline and SpunOut.  The HSE website <i>yourmentalhealth.ie<\/i>provides information on a range of mental health support options available via phone, text and online.<\/p><p>The area of sexual health can be a source of anxiety for young people in particular, and counselling services are provided by a number of support organisations, such as SpunOut, and services are also provided by the LGBTI+ community, LGBT Ireland and BeLonGTo.  These organisations are all supported by the HSE and further resources are available online through the HSE's website <i>sexualwellbeing.ie<\/i>and B4uDecide.  I also wish to mention the great work being carried out by the children and young people's services committees, which have been developing and delivering youth-specific campaigns to support young people's physical and mental health and well-being.<\/p><p>One of the most exciting and growing areas of healthcare in recent years is social prescribing.  Social prescribing is one of the means by which we can achieve a greater degree of social connectedness for people and counteract isolation, thereby improving mental health.  Social prescribing is a simple but profound idea linking patients and primary care with sources of support within the community, which can include arts and creativity, physical activity, peer and group support, green activity and computerised therapy.  It has been shown to result in positive emotional, cognitive and social outcomes, especially by reducing social exclusion for disadvantaged, isolated, lonely and vulnerable people, many of whom experience depression and anxiety.<\/p><p>The Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund is supporting seven social prescribing programmes based in Dublin, Waterford, Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo, Leitrim, Wicklow, Cork and Kerry. I am pleased to inform the House that work is also under way on the development of a national mental health promotion plan.  In the context of mental health and well-being, there is a growing body of evidence at international level of the benefits to individuals and society at large when positive mental health is promoted and integrated across the life course.<\/p> <p>To inform the development of the plan, consultation with key stakeholders, including Government Departments, the HSE and the voluntary and charitable organisations that are broadly involved in mental health promotion, was required.  This consultation has now been completed and a report is being finalised.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the consultation process, an evidence synthesis is also being undertaken.  This will provide a summary of the international evidence on the impact of mental health promotion interventions to inform the new action plan and should be completed in February.<br\/><br\/>Last June, we launched the national healthy campus framework.  This will help the higher education institutions across Ireland to embed health and well-being in the campus life of staff and students.  Promoting positive mental health is a core element of all health and well-being activities on these campuses.  A national co-ordinator will be appointed to drive the initial roll-out of the healthy campus framework and charter and to support institutions in sharing learning and good practice.  This post will be advertised shortly.<br\/><br\/>One of the key priorities of the Healthy Ireland framework is the promotion of physical activity.  Get Ireland Active!, the national physical activity plan published in 2016, contains 60 actions intended to promote increased physical activity levels across the population.  Presentations at last year's Irish Physical Activity Research Collaboration conference made clear that regular physical activity can be effective in reducing the severity of symptoms associated with anxiety and depression.  Research carried out by Dublin City University regarding the Department of Education's Active School Flag programme, which is co-sponsored by Healthy Ireland, indicates the positive effects of this programme on school activity levels, but also on attendance, behaviour and learning outcomes.  I assure the House that Healthy Ireland will continue to work to improve the mental and physical health of our citizens.  <br\/><br\/>With regard to the national drugs strategy, a lot has been done to tackle the issue of drug use among our young people.  The consequences of drug use can affect a young person's health and undermine his or her academic engagement and, sadly, may result in serious injury or death.  We know that young people are most likely to experiment with drugs.  It is therefore important that we collectively address these issues.  It is important to consider some of the clinical advice and data that are available regarding the use of drugs, including cannabis.  Last year, information fact sheets made available by the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland showed that one in five adults who use cannabis are likely to have a dependence on it.  However, the risk of dependence for our young people is even more pronounced, with one in three young people likely to become addicted if using cannabis weekly or more often.  In addition, presentations to the child and adolescent addiction services indicate that cannabis is the main substance causing harm for those under the age of 18.  This is a matter of serious concern.<br\/><br\/>Our national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, aims to promote prevention initiatives.  It states that substance misuse prevention strategies need to be evidence-based and to target families, schools and communities in order to be an effective way of promoting health and well-being among the general population.  The first strategic priority following the recently completed mid-term review of our national drugs strategy is focused on the protection of children and young people from the dangers posed by drug use.  It is of utmost importance that we do everything in our power to protect young people by increasing their resilience, strengthening their life skills and promoting healthy life choices.  The issue of harms caused to children by drug use is a priority for me.  The newly identified strategic priority aligns with Article 33 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which sets out:<\/p><blockquote>\tStates Parties shall take all appropriate measures [...] to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances [...] and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances. <\/blockquote> <p>A multifaceted approach involving online resources, in-school interventions and targeted awareness campaigns can provide the necessary education to minimise the risk of substance misuse among young people.  I recently approved the launch of the prevention and education strategic initiative and funding programme, which will increase the focused delivery of evidence-based prevention programmes among the school-aged population.  There will be a number of funding streams within the programme through which we will focus on school-based interventions such as Know the Score, Ireland's first national evidence-based resource on alcohol and drugs for senior cycle students.  The overall aim of the resource is to enable young people to make conscious and informed decisions about alcohol and drugs.  The programme for Government commits to building on recent initiatives at junior and senior cycle and to supporting secondary schools in introducing drugs and alcohol awareness programmes such as Know the Score, with particular regard to the hazards of casual drugs use.  Not only do we have national policy guidance in this area, but the EU drugs strategy also includes prevention and education for our younger people in its strategic priorities.  It also recognises that families play a significant role in drug prevention and helping to keep young people safe from the misuse of drugs and alcohol.  Recognising this, the HSE has created a guide for parents, which is available at <i>drugs.ie<\/i>, that helps parents to talk to their children about the risks associated with drug use in a proactive way.<br\/><br\/>Education and awareness programmes that are delivered alongside other measures and that build life skills and confidence are far more likely to be effective in encouraging protective and healthy behaviour than stand-alone measures.  I am fully committed to supporting our young people and increasing the level of education on drugs and the dangers of drug use in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600048#AAA00200","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643215620,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to speak on youth mental health.  During yesterday's meeting of the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health, we undertook prelegislative scrutiny of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2021.  This is an opportunity to change for the better how people with mental health issues are treated.  However, the Government has left open a loophole that will continue to allow children to be admitted to adult psychiatric facilities.  There is provision in the Bill for children to be sent to appropriate facilities, insofar as is practical.  This loophole must be closed, plain and simple.  No child should be admitted to an adult mental health facility.  This is a symptom of a systemic failure on the part of the State.  It is the Government admitting that it has failed to resource children's mental health services properly.  We need to get rid of this draconian practice, which sees some of our most vulnerable children with acute mental health needs being admitted to adult psychiatric hospitals.  It is a very frightening experience for any child to be admitted to a hospital for a mental health reason but this is exacerbated for those children who are placed in adult units.  As we know, 27 children were admitted to adult facilities last year.  While I acknowledge that this represents a decrease on previous years, it is still 27 children too many.<\/p>  <p>  At yesterday's meeting of the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health, we heard from the Ombudsman for Children that children with mental health difficulties were also being admitted to inappropriate paediatric wards.  He informed us of a case in which a child was in a paediatric unit for three or four months with no therapy, no education and no interaction with anybody except from an occasional visit from somebody who needed to adjust that child's medication.  This is unacceptable.  The Minister of State does not have to take my word for it, as these are the words of the Ombudsman for Children at yesterday's meeting.  He said that the Government has become lazy and has allowed legislation to continue to permit children to be admitted to adult facilities.  It has let the idea that we do not have resources in place rule the fact that the best interests of children are not paramount.  I ask the Government to legislate for a zero option when it comes to admitting children to adult facilities.  If it does not, Sinn F&eacute;in will be proposing amendments to this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State will know, all experts say that early intervention is key if a child is to reach his or her full potential and developmental milestones.  Some 3,000 of our young people are currently waiting for appointments in CAMHS.  More than 200 of them have been waiting longer than a year for an appointment.  Last April, I raised my concerns about CAMHS, particularly the service in south Kerry, with the Minister of State after disclosures that young people might have been prescribed adult doses of medication.  As the Minister of State has said, the report was published today.  It is quite shocking.  Children were being overprescribed medication and effectively put into chemical restraints.  Not only was there no clinical lead, but there was also no consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist for south Kerry CAMHS since 2016.  There is still none today.  There was no system for the doctors' supervisors to check the medication prescribed or the quantity of service.  Concerns were raised about the overprescription of medication in 2018 and again in 2019.<\/p> <p>Despite this, when a new senior medical manager started in 2020, concerns about the doctor were not communicated to that new medical manager.  There were ample opportunities to prevent these young people from having to experience such appalling treatment.  I called on the Minister of State in April last year to conduct an independent national review of CAMHS across the State.  The Minister of State failed to act then, so I ask her to commit today to a full and comprehensive review of all CAMHS teams, and that should happen immediately and not down the road.  No more time should be wasted.  The HSE has issued an apology to all the affected families, but it must do much more.  People must be held accountable and the whistleblower who highlighted these failures must be commended.  <\/p> <p> I acknowledge and welcome that the Minister of State said in her opening statement that she would reinstate the national director for mental health in the HSE.  It is something we have been calling for since I became the spokesperson on mental health, but it should not have required something like this to happen to bring about this reinstatement.  The Minister of State could do some other things in the meantime to make it easier for children to access proper mental healthcare.  Resources could be put in place to allow trainee psychologists to become fully qualified.  Financial burdens exclude many psychologists from diverse socio-economic backgrounds from entering the workplace.  More than 9,000 children are waiting for an appointment for primary care psychology services.  The responses I receive from the HSE usually bemoan the lack of qualified psychologists to fill the vacant posts.  There is a workforce available and ready to go, but impossible financial obstacles have been put in their way.  We outlined in our alternative budget how we would go about this.  I will send the Minister of State a copy if she wants.  It might do her some good to have a read of it.  I also ask the Minister and the Minister of State to meet with representatives of trainee psychologists after they have requested it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600049#BBB00200","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643216220,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I welcome this debate.  I will start by quoting the words of Dr. Anne Doherty, who is a psychiatric professional:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe all make decisions every day about who is sick enough to warrant that bed of the four people in front of us.  Ideally, you would admit all four. <\/blockquote>  <p>That deals with the reality faced by many people.  I refer to the services simply not being there, whether those are inpatient beds in facilities that we need or community supports through CAMHS, autism or voluntary services.  We have seen the pandemic expose many weaknesses across the State, not least in housing and health.  We are also facing a serious problem in our mental health services.  When the Taoiseach announced that restrictions were to be lifted, many of us went back to the way we used to behave and back to going to the pubs, greeting people by shaking hands and being able to visit people.  No such switch is possible for many people affected by the mental health impact of these last two years.  Indeed, things are very dark and grey for many people.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, when they extend a hand for help and seek the State to reach out and grab them, it is nowhere to be found.  Therefore, I urge the Minister of State to examine bringing forward a real comprehensive strategy for mental health services.  I and my colleagues, Deputies Mac Lochlainn and Ward, who has been doing Trojan work on this issue, had the opportunity to meet with many of the mental health advocacy groups, including those in the health organisations, those that are State-funded and those that are charities, and they all had a similar message for us: that far more needs to be done, that far more joined-up thinking is needed and that far more supports need to be provided at all levels.<\/p><p>I could talk to the Minister of State about constituents of mine and their experiences.  We have seen a spike in numbers in this regard in recent years.  One in five young people admitted to mental health institutions suffers from eating disorders.  The reality, though, is that the beds are not there.  When we look at the three public beds in the State, and the numerous reports in this regard, for how many years and how many times are we going to have headlines about this situation in newspapers?  How many times are young people going to reach out to ask us to do more, only for those calls to fall on deaf ears?  I welcome this opportunity, therefore, but what I would welcome far more is a real response to dealing with the most vulnerable people in our society and an acknowledgment of the impact of the pandemic on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600050#CCC00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1643216220,"counter":470,"content":"<p>This week I received an email from a 16-year-old girl from County Tipperary concerning what she termed the mental health crisis in Ireland.  Like so many others of her age, she has lost several friends to suicide.  She related to me that when she was feeling that way as well, she presented to the hospital only to be sent home four hours later.  She is still affected, and has since appealed to me to make the case on her behalf concerning the need for more funding to be allocated for mental health services and for more training for service providers.<\/p><p>What kind of country are we living in when a 16-year-old who should be enjoying her youth has instead to write to me to make this case for her and many other young people who feel abandoned?  We spoke previously about setting up the Jigsaw project in Thurles, which ran over half a year late.  I am waiting to hear if we will get physical hubs in other parts of the county.  When I inquired about waiting times for the services as they stood on 31 October 2021, I was told that they were running at seven weeks.  That is far too long for young people to have to wait.<\/p><p>Tipperary has seen the closure of St. Michael's psychiatric unit.  People in urgent need now must present at an accident and emergency department.  Centres that facilitate counselling services are living hand-to-mouth because of a lack of sustained funding.  There must be an independent review of CAMHS after the surfacing of issues with the services in south Kerry.  Children being overly prescribed medication is a major concern, as is the lack of a clinical lead and consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist for CAMHS in the south Kerry area.  The services the young and the old can get are often determined by their postcode instead of by their needs.<\/p><p>Let us take the example of CAMHS in the CHO 3 health area, which includes north Tipperary.  Some 355 young people were waiting near the end of the year.  Of that total, 76 had been waiting for more than a year.  In CHO 5, of which south Tipperary is a part, 221 young people were waiting, and 12 of them had been waiting for more than a year.  Clearly the speed with which people are seen in Tipperary depends on where they live.  The same problem exists with child primary care psychology waiting lists.  This game of chance being played with the mental health of our children is the result of a chaotic strategy on the part of the Government, which cut additional funding by 50% recently.  Serious change is needed for young people.<\/p><p>Our young people are saying this based on their experiences.  I conclude with a passage from the email sent to me by the young girl I referred to earlier:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe need more funding for the mental health system.  Please, it needs a change.  I am looking towards you for help.  I would love to chat to someone about what ideas I have to help because I think I can make a change and I&rsquo;m willing to fight to make a difference.  Please hear me and all of the other people in this country who NEED you to listen. <\/blockquote>  <p>I urge the Minister of State to start listening to the words of this young girl and the other youngsters in this country who have taken the time to express their feelings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600050#CCC00300","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1643216220,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic.  The report on the look-back review into CAMHS services in south Kerry is a damning one on a disgraceful situation.  I commend the whistleblower on coming forward and on what that has done.  We would not do what was done here to animals, and that is being honest.  I also bring another situation in the youth mental health services to the attention of the Minister of State.  If children have autism and mental health issues, there is nothing in this country to help them.  They are on their own.  One of the speakers mentioned early intervention.  There is zero intervention for these people or their families.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to Neil Prendeville's radio programme on Red FM this morning.  I heard mothers speaking about their autistic children and how they have got zero help.  Those children's mental health has not been addressed because they are not even getting assessments.  The mental health of the families and the children's siblings has been destroyed.  I have heard of cases where children were chewing dog leads and eating the bannisters of stairs.  The Minister of State may not be aware of this, but during the last D&aacute;il I worked with Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on disability issues as well as mental health matters.  Families told me about situations where they put their own children into Alsatian dog cages in the kitchens of their houses when the mental health issues kicked off.  That was for their safety and that of the rest of their family.<\/p>  <p>  While we are focusing on this subject of youth, child and adolescent mental health services, there is a huge gap in our mental health and autism services that must be addressed.  Regarding what is happening here, all children in this country have a right to the best life that a parent can give them.  They need assistance at times, but the problem is that the State has failed us.  I am blue in the face from coming in here to talk about mental health issues and the lack of services over the years.  There must be a root-and-branch change in this area.  I welcome the positive things that have been done, and I always will.  The Minister of State will always get credit where it is due.  She should listen back, however, to the parents who were speaking on that radio show this morning.  Hundreds, if not thousands, of families are going through the same pain and suffering, but they will never get access to mental health services or assistance because their child has another disability.  I hate using that word.  Families feel that their children are being abused in their own homes, not by their families but by the Government because of its failure to provide the services.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600050#CCC00400","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1643216820,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Over the past couple of months I have been dealing with a family whose teenage daughter is being fed through a tube.  When they reached out in desperation due to her eating disorder, they found that &Eacute;ist Linn, Linn Dara and Merlin Park were unavailable to them because there are not enough beds.  The simplest answer is that there should be more beds but there should be more consultants.  The report that came out today by Dr. Se&aacute;n Maskey mentions the difficulties with finding consultants.  It is not good enough to say this when the support structures, support staff and equipment are not in place for doctors.  That is one of the reasons consultants cannot be found.<\/p>  <p>  This report contains devastating findings and exposes a lot that is wrong in our health service or lack of health service for some people.  I spoke to another father today who told me that his daughter had social anxiety when she was transitioning into secondary school and went to see a doctor through CAMHS.  Having read the report today and having received his apology, he feels sickened.  It is soul-destroying, he said, to read the report.  The family is devastated, angry and upset, not only because the structures were not in place but there was no care plan, no psychologist, no cognitive behavioural therapy, no oversight, no organisation, not even a shared diary.  Referring to the south Kerry group as a team is a complete misnomer.  Quite clearly the doctor who had got a reference from somebody, I do not know who, was working solo.<\/p>  <p>  Children who did not even have ADHD were put on risperidone, an antipsychotic medication.  One child, I was told, did not even recognise her parents, did not establish reality and did not know whether she was dreaming or it was reality when her parents would come into her room.  Another parent told me his child went from 9 stone to 18 stone from when he was 15 to 17.  I remember meeting that child and wondering how he had put on so much weight.  He was suffering from depression and his weight increased.  The scandal here is why were so many children put on risperidone.  Why was that being carried out across the board?  We do not know how much was known.  Still with some of the parents there has been no intervention and there is still no care plan.

I want to give the Minister of State a specific example of the impact this has.  Cillian is a 14-year-old boy in second year.  When he was in third class he was given a psychology follow-on referral from his GP because of concerns raised by the school.  He went to multiple appointments; his mam was told they would be in touch but that never happened.  Today the HSE is categoric in its stance that those meetings never took place and that Cillian has been on their books since 2019, not 2016.  Despite repeated pleading, Cillian has not received one psychology assessment in all of those years since he was in third class.  The family has been told he is on a waiting list.  This is actually contradicted by a reply to a parliamentary question that I received recently.  This young man has a family who are doing all in their power to help him, a school that is doing all in its power to help him.  What Cillian actually needs is urgent professional assistance.  Literally years of this young man's life have passed him by.  If this continues, Cillian will age out of the programme.  What is going on here?  It is absolutely detrimental to this family.  If it was not so serious it could also be almost laughable because it just beggars belief.<\/p>  <p>  In a reply I got back in November regarding a long-vacant psychology post in Longford, the HSE actually attempted to criticise potential candidates because they may want to live in more urban, larger areas.  That is not an excuse for not being able to fill a post.  It is certainly not a reasonable excuse.  At the very core of this and of these waiting lists that are entirely unacceptable is the accompanying issue of staff resources and supports for those in the positions where we desperately need them.<\/p>  <p>  Cillian is not alone.  Thousands of young people are facing unacceptable delays in accessing care.  Over 9,500 young people are awaiting psychology and 588 of them are in my constituency.  The HSE cannot continue to use Covid as an excuse for the delays in treatment.  This is reflective of years of underinvestment and a lack of priority and provision given to the mental health service.  The system was in crisis before Covid; it is now much, much worse.  I am asking the Minister of State to act urgently for children like Cillian and all those who require services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600051#DDD00200","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1643216820,"counter":474,"content":"<p>This is an issue we have all been dealing with for the last number of years and we are well aware of it.  I spoke to the Minister of State previously of a situation in Sligo-Leitrim, in CHO 1, where there are 280 children on the waiting list for CAMHS.  That is almost 10% of the national figure.  In most cases there is meant to be a multidisciplinary team in place.  I understand the multidisciplinary team in the CHO 1 area is about 60% of what it should be.  That is the case across the board and across the country.  In many cases there are people working in these areas who do not have child-specific qualifications.  That is another problem which is probably having its impact in much of these misdiagnoses and issues that come up for a whole range of young people.  They go and seek help and families do their best for them, but they find they are up against a brick wall.<\/p>  <p>  I recently had a family contact me.  Their young daughter had gone to CAMHS and been diagnosed for a particular medication and everything was fine.  She was supposed to be reassessed in six months.  They rang and rang and rang but could never get an appointment.  It was over a year before they got an appointment to re-examine the medication she was on.  They were told to go to the GP.  The GP said he did not diagnose and could not deal with it and that it had to be CAMHS that would do it.  They continuously push people away rather than take them in.  That is an issue across the entire country.<\/p>  <p>  In the justice portfolio that I am in, I continually come across people who end up falling foul of the law because ultimately at a young age they did not get the early intervention they needed in mental health services.  We know that and we all acknowledge it.  Both Ministers are aware of it as well.  However, we continually come back to this problem.  We cannot recruit the people and we have all these issues.<\/p>  <p>  Under the last Government we were here five years ago and we had the same problem.  Five years later we are still in the same problems.  Why was nothing done in those intervening five years?  It is beyond belief that as a society we cannot put the effort in to ensure that we train an adequate number of people to deal with the problems we know are going to be in our society.  We have not got the impetus in place to ensure we can have the medical professionals in place in our country to be able to deal with the problems we know we are always going to have.

Before Covid, the mental health services for young people were a major problem.  Now they are beyond crisis point.  Expert evidence shows that the onset of mental disorders peaks during the adolescent and early adult years and is one of the leading causes of disability among many young people.<\/p>  <p>  Risk factors associated with the experience of mental ill health among young people include family difficulties, health issues, employment or relationship stresses and coming to terms with sexual orientation.  Adolescents experiencing mental ill health can be a risk factor for mental ill health and substance misuse on reaching adulthood.  This in turn can be an obstacle to employment and an associated increased risk of unemployment in the young adult.<\/p>  <p>  Studies show that there are significant numbers of young people who are deliberately harming themselves and that many young people experience suicidal ideation.  For some young people misusing alcohol and other substances can result in them developing mental disorders.  Unfortunately, the services available to help people especially with dual diagnosis are virtually non-existent.  Young people have no other option than to present to the accident and emergency department or to their doctor's surgery, neither of which is trained or equipped to deal with individuals who have such complex needs.<\/p>  <p>  This is a terrible situation for a young person to find himself or herself in when looking for help.

It is not like other illnesses.  It is not like going in with a broken leg or cut where someone can see the treatment.  It is not an easy-to-understand procedure like an operation.  There are degrees to which medication needs to be provided or withdrawn.  It is delicately balanced and complex.  A great deal of trust goes into this type of care.

I asked why it was gone but no one could answer.<\/p>  <p>  When people were asked during Covid what the most important issues to them that needed to be resolved were, they mentioned climate, housing and employment.  The fourth issue they mentioned was mental health.  It would not even have been in the top ten a decade ago.  Now, people want to understand mental health.  They want the supports to help themselves, their loved ones and others, including those in their social circles who may have mental health issues.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, I shared a story from my experience of ten years of taking advice clinics and meeting people.  Ten years ago, people would have come to an advice clinic and said they had a housing issue.  Through the course of that conversation or dealing with them down the line, they may have then mentioned issues with their mental health.  Perhaps they had a letter from their GPs.  Now, mental health is among the first issues they mention.  This is a positive in terms of where the country is now compared to where it was.  We are talking about it and want to deal with it, but we need the services to do that.  I hope that, given Deputy Butler's role as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, her call for the reinstatement will result in it being delivered.  I do not know where the resistance to it would be.  I would be surprised if the Minister for Health was resistant to it.  I would be surprised if there were budgetary constraints.  It has to happen.  If it is one of the things that come out of this tragic series of events in south Kerry, at least that will be something.<\/p>  <p>  I will move beyond the case and its outcome now because we will discuss it again.  We are coming out of nearly two years of Covid and we have seen an increase in the number of presentations at mental health services by young people.

This right covers the full spectrum of health and well-being and guaranteeing it requires a comprehensive multisectoral response through an integrated system that involves parents, peers, the wider family, schools and the provision of support and assistance via trained staff.  These are wonderful words.  Delivering on them will not be easy, but they must be delivered.  We need a sea change in how we approach mental health and deliver mental health services.  We need to make that delivery a norm in our system, including our schooling system, and in how our peer groups and families operate.  We have a great deal to do to catch up.  Our country is distinct from others, in that we have a particular condition and we have been doing great work in trying to bring mental health and our discussions on same to the fore, but we need to back that up not just with resources, but with whole-of-system changes in how we approach the matter.

Partners included For&oacute;ige, GROW, Ossory Youth, the Samaritans, Shine and may others.  We embarked on a participative planning process that led to the development of one of the first suicide prevention plans in the county and, indeed, country.  That template subsequently informed HSE approaches to county suicide prevention plans, which were supported by the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  In formulating the plan, we held workshops with young people, led by Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, For&oacute;ige and Ossory Youth, from which it became clear that there was a need to integrate youth services into the available supports for young people's mental health, establish LGBT+ peer support groups, make support material readily available online and set up youth caf&eacute;s and other facilities.  Comhairle na n&Oacute;g in Kilkenny later led on a more immersive youth mental health initiative that advocated for more resources for counselling, greater interaction of voluntary and youth services with CAMHS, and supports for families of young people experiencing mental health difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  Through my involvement in these projects, I was consistently impressed by the work of the young people participating in them.  As they now emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic, they face many additional challenges in life, but those who are already vulnerable are at risk of being lost in a system that needs to be led by the voices of youth.  Many of our young people feel lost and abandoned in a world that is becoming increasingly materialistic and uncaring.  Families of young people who are experiencing severe mental health challenges, are self-harming or have alcohol or drug dependency or eating disorders often find accessing services difficult.  We heard yesterday during the leaving certificate debate about the real apprehension and confusion over the sitting of exams following two years of disruption.<\/p> <p>Eco-anxiety is a more recent development sparked by the climate crisis.  We should not doubt that the uncertainty of the future of our very existence as a species is causing a deeply felt sense of despair among our young people.  We need only look at the burden we have placed on their shoulders.<\/p> <p> Young people from minority backgrounds experience an additional burden, but very often mental health challenges go unseen, particularly among those who have fled conflict or persecution in another country and those who are Travellers or Roma.  There need to be specific targeted programmes for such young people too.  I heard the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on that and welcome her intervention in that regard.  I also welcome her commitment to addressing the challenges of listening to and resourcing young people's mental health services and youth services.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is engaged in just that, resourcing youth services such as Ossary Youth, in Kilkenny, to continue to provide safe and welcoming spaces for young people in projects such as Open Door for LGBT+ youth and for vulnerable children and adolescents generally.<\/p> <p> I welcome too the introduction of minimum unit pricing on alcohol.  It will have a positive impact in reducing alcohol consumption among people.  I remain concerned about the potency of the cannabis currently being sold on our streets.  I think it is having a detrimental impact on mental health.<\/p> <p> For young people with acute mental health challenges, we must ensure there is accredited, integrated, interdisciplinary, robust, safe and well-resourced counselling and psychotherapy services available to meet their needs and to support their families.<\/p> <p> I will close my comments by saying once again that I really feel for the families and young people so badly let down by CAMHS in south Kerry.  We have community or State-run mental health services.  There must be a rigorous monitoring of the effectiveness and safety of such services.  Earlier today, in this Chamber, An Taoiseach said there had been a systematic collapse in clinical governance.  This is truly a damning indictment of a service that is in place to protect and care for young people's mental well-being.  Investing in our young people, early childhood development, education, early intervention and diagnosis and in families by addressing poverty and exclusion and, critically, listening to the voices of youth will ensure that, as a State, we cherish and value them and listen and respond to their needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600052#EEE00600","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643218020,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Since the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, assumed office, I know she has fought tooth and nail for every resource she can get: material, personnel - the whole lot.  She has done her best.  It goes without saying, however, that the news that has come from Kerry in the past while will dominate my contribution.<\/p>  <p>  I came off a call with Michael Fitzgerald from the South\/South West Hospital Group about half an hour ago, and the picture he painted us and what was contained in the report was quite bleak.  I have listened to what the HSE has had to say and can safely say that what happened in Kerry with the provision of CAMHS was appalling.  The independent review of almost 1,500 children found that 240 young people were adversely affected or identified as having received deficits in their care.  That is an alarming number of people and a significant percentage of the 1,500 files reviewed.  My thoughts tonight are with all those children and families who were neglected and adversely affected in a variety of ways.  I note that some children received \"unreliable diagnoses, inappropriate prescriptions and poor monitoring of treatment and potential adverse effects\" which \"exposed many children unnecessarily to the risk of significant harm\".  The report continues that significant harm was caused to 46 children and young people, including weight gain, sedation, elevated blood pressure and galactorrhoea, so there have been significant adverse effects on many young people but not what the HSE has described as catastrophic failings.  I am not sure what the difference is between significant adverse effects and catastrophic failings.  If the Minister of State could ask the HSE what the difference is, I would appreciate feedback.  As a father, I know that if my child were misdiagnosed, prescribed incorrect medication, with varying side effects, and not adequately monitored, I would find that to be a catastrophic breach.<\/p>  <p>  In one respect I am glad we have the report.  I would now like to know what we will do to improve the services.  I note the 35 recommendations.  I read through them all this evening and hope they will be followed up on.  I implore the Minister of State to do a quarterly review, if possible, on the progress made and the implementation of the recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  I also note that the HSE has unequivocally apologised and has been transparent in the report, and I welcome that, but many questions remain.  Are we confident a clinical lead psychiatrist can actually be hired?  The HSE has tried to hire one for the Kerry area since 2016 and failed to fill that post.  A locum has operated with support to fill the gap, but if we have failed to fill that post for over four years, how confident are we of attracting somebody via normal competition to the post, particularly now, since the successful applicant will have to go in and try to address the situation in south Kerry?  If we cannot fill the post through normal competition, the HSE will need to look seriously at redirecting somebody from some other CHO that is performing adequately to south Kerry, rebuilding faith and confidence in the services there.  I imagine the people in Kerry are questioning the level of service there at present.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State might not be able to speak about the doctor at the centre of all this, but is there any clarification as to whether he is still practising, whether he has been referred to the Medical Council or whether he is subject to any type of investigation or disciplinary action?  People need to be aware of the repercussions and the consequences that are there for the person at the centre of all this.<\/p>  <p>  As for the services provided, is the HSE now ploughing resources into this CHO to compensate for years of mistreatment and misdiagnosis?  If that is the case, will that have adverse or knock-on effects on adjoining CHOs?  As many Deputies here will attest, there is a difficulty in that the waiting lists are quite lengthy and we would be conscious of any potential knock-on effects for adjoining CHOs.  I hope the Kerry CHO will get the additional resources it needs to catch up.  I hate to use the phrase \"catch up\", but in this case it has to catch up because it has failed these 240 young people.  If that is the case, I know that many of those people will have aged out of CAMHS and possibly progressed to adult mental health services.  I would like to know if additional resources will also be ploughed into the area of adult mental health in that CHO.<\/p>  <p>  My last remark is on the Taoiseach's commitment today in respect of a full review across the country.  It has to be done.  It is necessary.  Many of us in our CHOs have concerns, and I welcome the Taoiseach's words in that regard.  I just hope and pray that what people are discussing here regarding Kerry is not replicated in other parts of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600053#FFF00200","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1643218020,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Now that we are exiting the period of restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic, I fear we could soon face a deluge of people seeking assistance for issues related to mental health.  The period of the pandemic has challenged us all but, as we are all aware, has been particularly keenly felt by our young people.  With such long periods of isolation and remote learning, it is really a credit to the youth of the State how well they coped with restricted living over the past two years.  The pandemic placed huge pressures on mental health services which, prior to Covid-19, had suffered years of underinvestment and, as a result, were wholly unprepared and totally under-resourced in both funding and staff to deal with this emergency.<\/p>  <p>  Too often in Limerick it has fallen on volunteers to deal with the consequences.  I acknowledge the vital role played by many mental health organisations in Limerick.  We have a branch of Jigsaw.  It does incredible work in the area of youth mental health.  The volunteers of the Haven Hub and the suicide watch teams in Limerick should also be commended.  These folks give up their time, including their weekends, to be available to those who are suffering.  Without their operating, particularly in the early mornings, I fear how much worse the mental health crisis in Limerick would have been.<\/p>  <p>  The stark reality is that, due to years of underinvestment, CAMHS simply does not have the resources to deal with the influx of contacts in the mid-west region.  The wait time for child and adult mental health services has doubled in the past few years.  In the past five years the number of young people waiting to access critical community-based mental health services has not dropped below 2,500.  This is a damning indictment of the attitude of this Government and the previous Fine Gael Government.  I, like many other Deputies, have been contacted by parents facing huge behavioural challenges with their children.  Half the battle for parents is simply getting access to mental health services, and the pattern is only getting worse.  By the end of quarter 4 of 2019, 188 children and teens were waiting in the mid-west region.  By quarter 3 of 2021, that figure had escalated to 364 youths.  This is simply not good enough.  These are young people in their formative years who need support.  The failure to intervene early should concern us all.  Issues will manifest and, without early intervention, will escalate and accompany these children into their adult life.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2021 Sinn F&eacute;in brought forward a motion on the mental health emergency.  One of the key recommendations we made was the establishment of a crisis de-escalation team in every CHO area.  It is welcome that such a unit will be trialed in Limerick later in 2022.  The scheme will allow for the triaging of contacts relating to mental health by a professional team of paramedics through An Garda and mental health services.  I welcome that very much and I welcome this discussion.  Sinn F&eacute;in will not be found wanting in supporting the Government if and when it treats youth mental health as a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600053#FFF00300","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1643218620,"counter":485,"content":"<p>We call it mental health, but the news from County Kerry shows there is a sickness in the operation of our youth mental services.  Dr. Ankur Sharma opened up to public scrutiny what could be serious systemic failures in the youth mental health services and their operation, perhaps at considerable cost to himself.  Instead of being commended, it was reported he was asked to take leave, stripped of his role as clinical lead and reassigned to administration.  While young people and their families were desperate for help, there was appalling treatment of families and of the doctor who blew the whistle on the system.  The treatment of Dr. Sharma would not surprise any whistleblower in Ireland, given this State's treatment of whistleblowers.<\/p>  <p>  I know apologies have been offered to the families.  I also know how easy and handy it is to sideline or scapegoat a whistleblower to save a system.  I hope the Minister of State is not going to do that.  I am glad the Taoiseach has heeded the call of my colleague, Deputy Ward, and has ordered a review.  It must be made public how the doctor in question and all doctors in the CAMHS system were recruited and selected.  This is public work.  The services are funded by public money that is paid for by the public, and the services treat members of the public, particularly those who are extremely fragile and vulnerable.  I watched the Minister of State's speech earlier.  I know she is aware we are not talking about people with broken fingernails here.  We are talking about people who sometimes have broken hearts and broken lives.  They need proven expertise.<\/p>  <p>  In north Kildare, parents cannot get a mental health appointment for their children for love nor money.  I have spoken to parents and they are petrified.  There is a terror that comes into your heart if you are worried about one of your kids.  When the parents get that help, they need to know the professional into whose care they are putting their child is properly qualified, recruited, selected and supervised, if necessary.  In response to a parliamentary question I submitted last March, I was told by the HSE that vacant posts in Kildare and Kilcock would be filled imminently.  I have queried it since because the posts were not filled.  Today, it was announced that appointments made to these two posts will be taken up in a few months' time.  I do not call that imminent.  Where is the urgency?  If the appointments have been made, I am relieved for my constituents who are waiting, watching their children suffering.  I wish whoever takes up the posts the best.  They will be very welcome because they are very much needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600054#GGG00100","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1643218620,"counter":486,"content":"<p>From almost two years, our lives have been on pause.  We have all been in a kind of limbo and it has been exceptionally difficult.  However, for children and young people, this pause has had an especially profound effect.  While milestones were missed and the freedom to play and socialise was severely curbed, the crisis in youth mental health accelerated.  In fact, it is now at a serious crisis point.  Last year, almost 12,000 children and teenagers were referred again or were newly referred to CAMHS community teams.  Some 3,357 of them were still waiting to access CAMHS by the end of November.  According to the HSE, 1,686 of them were expected to be seen within three months, while the wait time for the remaining 1,671 was completely unknown.  There is no plan there to manage the waiting lists.  It has been said that having a mental health issue is not like having a broken toe or something like that.  A young person with a serious mental health issue needs attention fairly urgently.  The idea that more than half of the young people waiting for services have been waiting more than three months, and many of them for much longer than that, is an absolute scandal.  We have to face up to it.<\/p>  <p>  We know early intervention is of the utmost importance.  All the professionals say early intervention is critical, before the situation becomes much more serious.  The kind of numbers I mentioned just cannot be tolerated.  While we all appreciate the pandemic and the cyberattack had an impact on all waiting lists, we know the problems in CAMHS predate both of them.  For years, these waiting lists have been stubbornly stuck at at least 2,500.  That is standard.  In some cases, the lists were even longer than that.  We cannot make excuses that it was the pandemic or the cyberattack.  There is a systemic problem there.  Staff shortages, a rise in demand and poor geographical coverage have created a perfect storm, forcing children to desperately seek help in emergency departments, which is probably the worst place they could go.  There is simply nowhere else for them to go.  According to Children's Health Ireland, CHI, attendances at emergency departments for mental health issues jumped by an incredible 58% over the second half of 2020 compared with the same period the previous year.  There is a clear indication the system is fundamentally broken when we have that level of increase in young people desperately needing help and support, and attendance at emergency departments rises by almost 60%.  Even when children do attend emergency departments, we know most departments do not provide any assistance.  They might keep a patient in for a while but no referral is made.  There is certainly no out-of-hours referral for people who find themselves in a crisis.  When a young person is brought to an emergency department, it is an absolute crisis.  Unfortunately, it seems the country has nothing to offer them in those circumstances.  That is the reality for so many young people.<\/p>  <p>  We know that this situation is replicated throughout the country.  Some areas are worse hit than others.  For many years it has been obvious there is something very wrong in how funding for community psychology services in particular is balanced, or not balanced, and managed across the State.  In September 2021, for example, those in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 3, CHO 4 and CHO 8 accounted for 85% of the children waiting more than a year for CAMHS appointments.  There is a systems problem there.  This raises a point I bring up on regularly, which is very important and is highlighted in Sl&aacute;intecare, namely, that an objective resource allocation model must be pursued.  We cannot continue with the practice of allocating resources to whoever shouts the loudest or to an area that is represented by a Minister in government.  Resources have to be allocated on the basis of objective measurement.  That is why we need the regionalisation of the HSE.  We need to know what is actually happening and the level of demand for services in different areas.  Nowhere is that more necessary than in youth mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  In CHO 9, which is my own area and includes the communities of Ballymun, Finglas and Blanchardstown, areas of high need, 66% of children have been waiting for more than three months for an appointment.  I ask the Minister of State to imagine being a parent in that situation with a child in crisis and having to wait more than three months to get an appointment.  It is shocking.  We are very much failing these children.  What is even worse is the true scale of the crisis is not even fully reflected in the figures.  For the countless children and teens growing up in areas where precursors to marginalisation already existed, the situation is far worse.  They are at the sharp end of the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, in my own constituency in Finglas, the Finglas child and family support network published a report that highlighted the considerable impact of Covid-19 on young people locally.  It found many young people had lost sight of what was normal between not being able to go to school, see their friends, take part in sports and hobbies or attend youth clubs, not to mention, of course, the challenges many families faced to pay bills and simply to put food on the table.  Several professionals working on the ground in Finglas reported that boredom and isolation had led to increased levels of antisocial behaviour and membership of gangs among children as young as 12.  It will certainly be an uphill battle to address these types of behaviours.  However, one thing is for certain: our approach has to be trauma-informed.  The report also flagged concerns about the impact of school closures, especially in instances where school was the only thing providing any sort of structure and consistency in a child's life.<\/p>  <p>  This leads me to the ongoing leaving certificate debacle and the effect it is having on young people throughout the country.  It is unconscionable we are having the same conversations for the third year in a row.<\/p> <p>This year's leaving certificate students have lived in flux for two years, constantly uncertain and confused about the manner in which their exams will take place, as if the leaving certificate was not stressful enough already.  A 2019 survey of almost 2,700 students found that 75% of leaving certificate students reported suffering extreme stress over the course of the two-year cycle, anxiety being the chief issue for 71%.  This was before Covid wreaked havoc on the State exams and the lives of children.  We must accept that running the gauntlet of the leaving certificate is harming our young people's mental health.  Meaningful and long-term reform is needed to remove the burden of stress and anxiety built into the traditional model.  It is a relic of the past no longer fit for purpose, particularly in a world that is arguably more difficult to navigate than the one many of us grew up in.<br\/><br\/>This generation of children and young people are the most digitally connected but a CyberSafeKids survey published last September found that 84% of Irish pre-teens between the ages of eight and 12 use at least one social media platform.  The research also shows that 93% of pre-teens have some kind of phone, tablet or other smart device.  It is clear we as legislators and policymakers are failing to keep up with this pace of change.  Young people are digital natives while we are still learning the new language of technology, or at least many of us are.  Despite the ease with which they use technology, it does not mean they inherently possess anything like the skills needed for safe and healthy use, especially when social media giants are preying on their insecurities.  An investigation last year by <i>The Wall Street Journal<\/i>into internal research by Instagram's parent company, Facebook, showed worrying links between Instagram use and depression in teenage girls.  There is a litany of information that shows the very negative impact many social media platforms have on young people.  There is a combination of issues, not least of which is the impact of the past two years.  We cannot continue with a system that is not fit for purpose.  The Taoiseach said it himself this morning.  There are systemic failures and we have to address them as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600054#GGG00200","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643219220,"counter":488,"content":"<p>It is very appropriate we are having this debate.  We all know from our constituency work the degree to which young people have been in need of attention, support and service support of a mental nature as well as an educational nature in recent years.  Remember that we were hit by an economic crash followed by Covid, all of which put a serious dent on society.  We tend to forget everything except the most pressing issue of the moment.  Young people are at the age when, having come through their childhood, they are looking forward to the future.  If they have had a stable home, they look forward with confidence.  If they have not had a stable home, they are not so confident.<\/p>  <p>  They then meet challenges and the challenges are many and varied.  Poor self-esteem is a regular issue.  There are eating disorders and various other pressures referred to by other speakers.  Deputy Shortall mentioned social media and the bullying that takes place among both sexes.  The extent to which society has time to address these issues is something to which we have to pay attention before it is too late.  Young people look for security.  They look for something to hang onto.  They look for an anchor.  Those anchors have not been there.  They need to be there and need to be put there as a matter of considerable urgency.  It is fine for people to say there are other pressing issues.  There are, but these are equally pressing issues.  Young people are being beset by drug barons.  This has been referred to by other speakers and the Minister of State.  The drug barons are ever-present, pushing their wares, ensuring they have a market for their product and bringing young people into that loop.  Once they are in the loop, they cannot get out.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to have had an opportunity to speak.  The Ceann Comhairle and I could speak for quite a long time on this subject.

When they look at the restrictions put on their lives, they will have the most questions to ask.  What is interesting with regard to what some of the previous speakers have said is what we would have done without social media over the past two years.  We can decry it and deride it and it has serious downsides, but I wonder how our young people would have survived without the ability to interconnect that social media provides.  I am not downplaying its downsides or its negatives.  The Minister of State should consider instituting a young person's citizens' assembly.  It ought to become a regular feature of Irish life and an annual occasion where young people get to tell us what they think rather than us articulating what we think they think.  It should be instituted quickly.<\/p>  <p>  An issue I have felt very strongly about for a long time is that there should be a gap year between the ages of 18 and 25.  Students should be able to exercise an option to take this and the State could provide meaningful alternatives to college, apprenticeship or work for that period.  Those young people could choose to do whatever they wanted to do that year but we should facilitate them taking a year out.  I use as an example people I know.  Many of them graduated from a college course that was not the first course they began.  They discovered after a year what they were doing was not what they wanted to do and that they wanted to do something else.  We owe this to them.  Over the period of the ages 18 to 25 young people should be able to take a year out to de-stress and see the world.  They should be able to take time out to consider and reflect on their future and what they might be able to do.

Something I would like to see the Minister of State push in government is the commitment to have a national director for mental health.  In 2016, the previous iteration of the Government pulled it.  It needs to be there.  We need a man or woman leading on mental health in the Department of Health so it is not the poor relation of physical health and that it is up there at all times with full parity and someone leading on it.  I ask the Minister of State to champion this in the Department.  If the officials are listening, this should go all the way up to Secretary General.  This needs to be listened to.  We need someone who always has his or her eyes on mental health to ensure there are no slippages.<\/p>  <p> I was a primary school teacher prior to my election to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Year on year the principal would go around to each classroom in the school to ask whether any child was in need of referral, usually to the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.  In that moment I would have to tell the children to work on the next few pages, scan the classroom and make a decision there and then, knowing what I did about the children and knowing that only three or four could be referred.  I and teachers throughout the country are part of the slippage because we allow only a trickle through each and every time.  I appeal to the Government I support every week to fund and resource properly the Department so that NEPS and CAMHS have enough therapeutic hours and people so that children do not slip through the net and I do not have to look at John and Mary in my class to choose one over the other and in that moment set their life on an entirely different pathway.  It is wrong.  Lessons will be learned from this.

This is particularly the case at a time when waiting lists for mental health services in the country are very high.  In County Mayo we have a two-year waiting list for primary care psychology and a 20-week waiting period for Mindspace Mayo, which is a primary care youth mental health service for 12 to 25-year-olds.

The high degree of unmet mental health needs in our young people nationwide demands that youth mental health be elevated to a top priority within the healthcare portfolio.

I am thinking of young people, in particular, who were living at home throughout the pandemic, who did not have their usual outlets for seeing their friends, and who may or may not have come out.  If they had come out, they may not have been welcome, as such.  They may have lived with particular difficulties where that had not been accepted by their family.  That is a very important issue.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to note the ongoing Government commitment to ban, as France did yesterday, conversion therapy.  That is a commitment in the programme for Government that I know is being worked on.  It needs to be cemented and just simply done.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to highlight the particular mental health challenges and access to services for young people in the Traveller community and for those in direct provision who, in addition to having other structural difficulties through education, which we know of and have spoken about in this House, are also othered or bullied in different ways.  It is important that access to services is made particularly easy for them where there have been additional documented difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  I met with a group today about online safety.  I am aware the legislation on the online safety commissioner is progressing through the House.  It is essential, however, there is a complaints mechanism within that legislation and that it is clear to young people who are flagging problems of bullying and other abuse material that they can see this can be addressed and redressed through that mechanism, and that when they flag problems, they will be taken seriously and addressed.<\/p>  <p>  A gentleman in my constituency contacted me recently in the wake of the tragic death of Shane Lunny to share his own story, which involved at least one hospital visit where, while he sat in the hospital on suicide watch, he literally had to beg for support to be committed to the psychiatric ward.  He was discharged at 1.30 in the morning with no money and nowhere to go.  Following that, at just 21 years of age he ended up in a treatment centre for addiction issues, which is something.  Now, having been three years sober and with those difficult days behind him, it is hoped, he still has a daily struggle with chronic anxiety.  Despite that, he considers himself one of the lucky ones because he had been able to access appropriate treatment when he ultimately needed it, albeit with the difficulties he had when initially going into hospital.  He is exhausted from battling mental health issues while having to continue to fight and advocate for himself and to navigate long waiting lists along with the financial issues that come with going private and being out of work because of mental health issues.<\/p>  <p>  This is not an acceptable standard for our country and I do not believe the Ministers of State in attendance believe that is the case either.  I know of the Ministers of State&rsquo;s commitment to resolving this.  The State has done very well in many different ways, with political and economic stability and recovering through the pandemic, but mental health is one of those areas which we have never got right.  We have an opportunity to change that now and to put the investment into it.  As my colleague. Deputy Dillon, said, this pays for itself over time.  Whether it is perinatal or youth mental health, we know there are particular moments of vulnerability in people&rsquo;s lives and we know the impact of failure to catch and treat these.  Youth mental health is especially acute and important.  We are becoming much more aware of that as a community, as a society and as a Parliament.  I wish the Ministers of State every success in what I know is their completely committed work to try to resolve as much as possible for our young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600056#JJJ00200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1643219820,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Deputy Tully is sharing time with Deputy Paul Donnelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600056#JJJ00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1643219820,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Mental health services prior to Covid-19 were in crisis but it is now an emergency situation.  The child and adolescent mental health services and Jigsaw both report an increase in demand of over 40%.  Similar increases are relayed to me by community and voluntary organisations working in this area in Cavan and Monaghan.  There is an over-reliance on community and voluntary services, with the HSE routinely signposting people while neglecting to increase their funding or not providing funding at all to some organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Poor geographic coverage, a chronic staff shortage, and the fact most CAMHS services still operate from 9 to 5, Monday to Friday have led to long waiting lists and to children with complex needs unable to access timely support.  One child with anxiety returning to school after the lockdown this time last year was referred by his GP to CAMHS.  The services dithered about whose responsibility it was to see this child.  This went on for months, with the child&rsquo;s anxiety worsening all the time before the child was finally admitted into their services, I believe in September.  It was from April until September before he was admitted into their services.  That caused a build-up of anxiety and waiting time.<\/p>  <p>  Young people have missed so much in the past two years, with many of the services they frequent drastically reduced or closed altogether.  These services need to be expanded and better resourced.<\/p>  <p>  Mental health services still rely heavily on the medical model and this does not align with the public health and the psychosocial support approach underpinned in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.<\/p>  <p>  A child with a diagnosis of autism is being refused access to mental health services.  What is that about?  I am hearing from parents who are not informing CAMHS their child has autism because they will not be seen.  The child cannot then get the proper treatment because the services do not know everything about that child that they need to know.  The rate of suicide among adults with autism is higher in society than among those who do not have this condition.  Suicidal ideation among children with autism is also regular.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to highlight the lacuna that was pointed out by the Mental Health Commission between the heads of the Bills to reform the Mental Health Act and the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act.  The mental health Bill is set to provide for 16- and 17-year-olds to give or withdraw consent to treatment in mental health service if they are deemed to have capacity.  The heads of the Bill state the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act would apply for the purpose of conducting the necessary capacity assessment.  However, the Act does not provide for decision supports for those under 18 years of age.  This needs to be addressed promptly because the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act is vital for the ratification of the optional protocol of the United Nations Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600056#JJJ00600","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1643219820,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s call for a nationwide audit of CAMHS because the report today makes for shocking reading indeed.  Thankfully, the stigma around mental health is lessening in recent years, thanks to societal changes and organisations in my own area such as Jigsaw Dublin 15, Suicide Awareness Dublin 15, and other similar organisations throughout the State.  Emergency medical services are 24-7 and we must have mental health services that are 24-7.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to assist community organisations to provide mental health supports and facilities.  It is about getting that first responder support and ongoing support but they also need connections outside in the community, and that is why dance, music classes, youth clubs and sports facilities all add to this.  I have repeatedly asked for extra funding for Genesis Psychotherapy &amp;amp; Family Therapy Service in Corduff.  This serves the entire Dublin West community.  For a small investment, it could provide an extra 4,500 hours per year, bringing the service up to 9,000 hours.  It has a capacity at the moment and a waiting list of about six to eight weeks which could be easily solved by a relatively small amount of money.<\/p> <p> I will also mention another simple change that could help parents and supports.  I am aware of a family who were waiting years to get a service for their child with autism.  After great worry and stress they eventually got the service.  Unfortunately, however, they lived on the boundary between two different services areas and they were told, just as they were about to get the long-awaited supports, that they were not in the catchment area, a mistake had been made and they had to go to another area.  They were then put on the waiting list for the other area after waiting years on the previous one.  It was not the fault of the family.  They did what they were supposed to do and they waited.  Unfortunately, they had to wait again for that service, and are still waiting for it.  That is just bureaucracy gone mad.<\/p> <p> The other situation I will describe involves a young lad I worked with, and I worked for Tusla for many years.  He went to his local hospital three times.  Each time he was sent away with an appointment for three weeks in the future, after waiting up to 14 hours on some occasions.  The third time he left the hospital he went to the local park and died by suicide.  I am sure every community has a similar story.  We are talking about youth mental health and we just have to do better.  We have to invest and support these young people because they are in a serious crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600056#JJJ00700","speaker":"1476","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643220420,"counter":498,"content":"<p>We all were young once.

Sometimes it is a generational thing.  It is difficult, especially now.  Being young now is very difficult.  It brings its own challenges.  One of them is in regard to intervention.  We say that when a young person needs intervention it has to be there because early intervention is key.  Most of us would say that intervention by mental health services for young people in this country is very arbitrary.  If one is waiting more than three months for intervention, and in some cases for six months or a year, there is something very wrong.<\/p>  <p>  I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care in the last D&aacute;il.  It issued a report in 2018.  Like most things, reports can gather dust.  However, I looked over it before I came to the Chamber and one of the recommendations was with regard to the domination of medication as a treatment option.  This is very pertinent given what is happening in south Kerry.  Overmedication was compensating for the lack of services.  That is key to what we are discussing today because there are many other interventions young people can get aside from medication.  In the last 25 years, the prescribing of medication, particularly for young people, has quadrupled.  That is very worrying.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to primary care psychological services, and I will have to be very careful here, they are not meeting the needs of young people at present.  In the last year those interventions in CAMHS have increased by at least one third, so there is a demand.  Obviously, the pandemic has caused quite detrimental things for all of us.  Young people have shaped that in their own way, but intervention is key.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the key thing in this debate is resources.  The Minister of State knows that Ireland spends 5.2% on mental healthcare.  The European Union, the WHO and Sl&aacute;intecare say that should be doubled.  To do that it would be necessary to invest an extra &euro;1 billion in mental healthcare.  The current &euro;1 billion is welcome but it needs to be much more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600057#KKK00400","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1643220420,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I was reading some of the online debate about the situation with CAMHS in south Kerry.  One comment struck me as if I had been punched on the nose.  The person said that if anybody had listened to the teenagers subjected to CAMHS, this would have been discovered years ago.  There was significant harm to 46 children.  The harm included putting on a lot of weight, increased blood pressure, the production of breast milk and sleepiness during the day.  According to the report there were unreliable diagnoses, inappropriate prescriptions, poor monitoring of treatment and poor monitoring of potential adverse effects.  According to reports, a staff member reported having heard that the person in question was running a private treatment service from the person's home, sometimes seeing people privately up to midnight, and was also working in a private clinic in another country.  The report said that the doctor worked extra hours and was observed to be very tired at work, but this issue was not addressed.  If that is true, it shows the madness of a two-tier health system where doctors try to hold down a job in the public health service and a job or jobs in the private sector at the same time.<\/p>  <p>  Second, there were clearly major issues with supervision and oversight.  The review states that no system was used to check the prescribing of medication or the quality of service.  Clearly, a far more radical review and change are necessary.  I want to highlight that the review recommended that children and their families should be invited to be part of the governance structure of CAMHS.  I strongly support that recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  Mental health services have been described as the Cinderella of the health services with 6% of the public spend, compared to more than double that in some EU countries.  We have to double the spend immediately in mental health services and in youth mental health services.  It is unacceptable that there were 3,357 young people waiting to access CAMHS last November, with 221 waiting for a year and more.  It is not all about finance, although finance is a huge part of it.  The spend must be doubled immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600057#KKK00500","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1643220420,"counter":502,"content":"<p>The scandal that has been revealed in Kerry, involving overmedication, losing files and children and young people with mental health issues not being looked after properly, is not at all unique to Kerry.  In 2018, psychiatrists in Wexford, including the consultant in CAMHS, resigned, saying the service was totally unsafe.  Dr. Sharma said he was sidelined because he expressed concerns about the overmedication of children.  I know of other people, and I will not mention their names, who were witch-hunted in CAMHS by the HSE because they protested at the level of overmedication.  Overmedication was compensating for the lack of staff and resources.  That is what is happening, and it is a scandal.  We have to monitor this.<\/p>  <p>  It is self-evident that there has been a stratospheric increase in the medication of children in this country and across the world over recent years.  That is what is happening.  If one wants to help young people with mental health problems, one starts, as Deputy Barry said, by talking to them.  That is the essence of psychology, psychotherapy and proper psychiatry - talking to them and asking what is wrong.  However, one needs qualified people to do that, and we do not have the qualified people.  That is the problem.  It starts at primary care.  If a young person is having difficulties, he or she goes to the GP.  What does the GP do?  Effectively, there are no primary care services to which the young person can be referred.  We do not have enough psychologists.  We do not have psychology departments in our schools, which we should have.  Many other countries have them, including the United States.  We do not have a staffed primary care mental health service, and CAMHS are nowhere near what was promised in A Vision for Change years ago.  We have failed so spectacularly on A Vision for Change that we revised it down in terms of staff numbers to cover up our failure.<\/p> <p>We removed the original targets for psychology in A Vision for Change completely.  That is what is going on.  It is a running scandal and those who raise that scandal are witch-hunted in the HSE because nobody wants to admit the truth.  Children are suffering because we have failed.<\/p> <p> We might then think about what we must do but perhaps we should start getting some of the psychologists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists we need.  However, we make it as difficult as possible for people to qualify with doctorates in psychology.  We charge them &euro;15,000 in fees so they drop out.  We give no funding whatever to educational and counselling psychology.  We give a little bit to clinical but none to educational and counselling psychology.  All our young psychologists, after getting their basic degrees, go to Utrecht in the Netherlands.  They get proper jobs over there and do not have to pay massive fees to qualify in psychology.<\/p> <p> That is the essence of the problem, which has been known for years.  It was identified in A Vision for Change more than a decade ago.  We have failed and failed again, and as a result we end up overmedicating our young people.  We have seen the terrible consequences of that in Kerry.  We must get real and start having psychologists in schools.  We must staff the primary care mental health services and the CAMHS we need.  We must of course address some of the big issues by listening to young people; they would tell us what matters affect them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600057#KKK00600","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643221020,"counter":504,"content":"<p>If we definitely know one thing, it is that our local and national services would not be able to provide the life-changing and life-saving services they do without investment and funding.  We need more funding in order to give them more means to help more people, particularly more young people.  We know the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a spike in young people accessing mental health services and I welcome the &euro;10 million mental health budget intervention in response to Covid-19.  With that rise in people accessing mental health services, we have seen a further increase in waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  Waiting lists are often part of the struggle cited by young people looking to access mental health supports.  Those waiting lists are a by-product of demand on an already overloaded service but in the case of mental health, when people need help, the last thing they need to hear is that they must wait to get help.  It takes much courage to ask for help when a person is suffering with his or her mental health.  It breaks my heart when I speak to parents who see their children going through this process, suffering with mental health problems and lost somewhere on a waiting list.  They feel hopeless.<\/p>  <p>  It is in this regard that I welcome the specific funding to continue the enhancement of CAMHS and the provision of two new CAMHS mental health hubs, along with the dedication of &euro;6 million to expand the capacity of community mental health teams nationally.  I hope this reduces waiting lists and improves access to our out-of-hours supports.<\/p>  <p>  I know many people have raised another area today and we should all continue to do so.  This is the need for better access to eating disorder supports for young people.  We have seen a really dramatic increase in the number of people requiring support for eating disorders since the pandemic began and we know the matter is particularly relevant for young people.  Last year almost &euro;4 million was secured for the national clinical programme on eating disorders.  There was a commitment to establish three new specialist eating disorder teams and the completion of three existing teams, and that will make such a big difference in treatment capacity.  In budget 2022, the national clinical programme on eating disorders secured an additional &euro;1 million for the development of extra eating disorder teams.  That is a really good start but we must continue to invest further.<\/p>  <p>  Many parents and young people find difficulties in the transition from child to adult when accessing services for mental health.  It is a major problem because, sadly, that is where young people fall through the cracks and become even more vulnerable.  Getting a young person the help he or she needs when he or she is seven years old or 17 years old should be straightforward.  The priority should always be placing them in a programme or providing them with treatment which is suitable for their age and, more important, does not put such people at further risk.<\/p>  <p>  This year, we have a record budget of &euro;1.15 billion for mental health.  That includes an historic increase of &euro;47 million on last year and it is so welcome for organisations working on the ground.  It is needed for people accessing services.  I will take a moment to acknowledge the services on the ground in my area that are doing amazing work with young people.  These are organisations like CAMHS, Pieta House, Archways, safeTALK, Aspen, the Beacon of Light, Somers and the Clondalkin Addiction Support Programme, to name just a few.  In recent years, unfortunately, we have seen the withdrawal of some services.  I am thinking particularly of Jigsaw in Clondalkin and I really hope the Minister of State might look at that further because we must support our young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600058#LLL00200","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1643221020,"counter":505,"content":"<p>Like the previous speaker, I welcome the Minister of State's leadership in the area of mental health.

That &euro;1 billion deserves somebody with clinical and administrative responsibilities.  Not only would such a person be a champion to join the Minister of State on mental health but he or she would also work for the delivery of services.<\/p>  <p>  For too long we have relied on charities and voluntary groups.  We must get back into the business of mental health being really core to the primary care services we deliver.  Both the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and her colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, in some ways represent the spectrum that exists, taking in everything from wellness to really acute mental health problems.  We have lifted the stigma on mental resilience but I am not sure we have lifted the stigma on really acute mental illness.  We have a long way to go.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the &euro;1 million community fund and there will be plenty of groups in my area, including the Finglas Support and Suicide Prevention Network, Finglas wellness groups and groups in Ballymun that will apply for that.  There are two areas we must consider.  The school inclusion model in education is bringing therapies into our schools and we must think about how we can fit mental health into that.  The second area is the ambulance service, which should have 24-hour access to support for mental health.  It is provided in the mainstream health service through the ambulance service and it is a key link.  If we go to the Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service, they could play a role as a bridge in the accessing of mental health services.

There are many areas from which one could approach this debate but there is only one I will raise.  Following my colleague Deputy Higgins, I will speak to eating disorders, which predominantly affect women and young people.  The average age for the onset of anorexia is 16 and for bulimia is 18.  The Minister of State and I have corresponded on this topic many times and dealt with a number of harrowing cases.  The cases we have spoken about highlight my concern in the area and a crucial factor.<\/p>  <p>  We have spoken about the need for funding, which is absolutely correct, but additional funding is absolutely pointless if services are not joined and there is a lack of joined-up thinking when it comes to dealing with eating disorders in this country.  There is a lack of joined-up thinking when it comes to geographic assessment and the fact that everything is set in urban areas.  We are dealing with young people who need to be close to their parents, family support groups and the resources they need.  Adding two or three hours of travel or a residential stay two or three hours from home will not help.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, people may be caught in the bind of being too young to be considered an adult but too old to be considered a child and they cannot get admission to a hospital, which they need.  These are the types of cases presenting every day to all our offices, regardless of party.  It is not just the individuals who are suffering because, most cruelly, parents are looking - usually at their daughter - wasting away in front of them.  They are wasting away because they cannot get a bed or somebody on the other end of the phone.<\/p>  <p>  We have spoken about the monetary allocation, which is welcome, and none of us will refuse to welcome that additional bed space, hours or funding.  It will be all for nothing, however, if we lose yet another young person to death arising from an eating disorder.  The numbers suffering from eating disorders increase every year, particularly since the onset of the pandemic.  Sadly, eating disorders have the highest mortality rate among mental health illnesses.  <\/p> <p>In closing, my appeal is to make sure that between the HSE, primary care and all services, there is an actual genuine clarity, so when the distressed parent makes the call or the young person approaches the doctor, there is a rapid plan to get them the care they need as quickly as possible, because as soon as they get that care it gives them a much better chance of recovering and, more importantly, living.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600058#LLL00400","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643221620,"counter":508,"content":"<p>In the very limited time I have, I want to outline some of my own concerns as a young person of 24 years of age.  I have discussed this issue with both Ministers of State previously.  I have a strong degree of concern about the rapid increase in cocaine consumption in Ireland, and the knock-on impact this is having on the mental health of so many young people.  Within this debate there are many different factors that feed into people's mental health and their self-esteem that can cause increased anxiety and pressures on young people.  Something that absolutely rings true to me is that throughout the pandemic many younger people have been using drugs more often, from what I have seen.  I have a deep concern about this.  In bringing this issue to the House I also want to bring some degree of a solution.  I believe that we need to see a strong national campaign on the airwaves, in the media and on social media that targets this particular issue and tries to increase awareness about it among younger people and their parents.  If there is anything I would like to see being taken away from the debate, it is this.  This problem will cause more issues in the future.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on the work she has been doing in the Department.  It has not gone unnoticed.  I am aware of how much she is committed to this issue.  The Minister of State has worked very closely with me.

In my experience as a child protection social worker trying to interact with CAMHS, the services are just not fit for purpose as they are currently put together.  I have heard other GPs complain about standard operating procedures being inconsistently enforced and needlessly restrictive.  They are drawn in such a way that they can be used as a gatekeeper to stop young people coming in through the doors and to keep people off these waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen, dealt with and supported constituents who have had referrals to CAMHS refused, with no reason given.  When I go looking for a reason, all of a sudden they get offered an appointment.  As a social worker I have dealt with young people who are experiencing very real pain and trauma, and they have been told by CAMHS \"No no, this is simply behavioural, it does not fit the profile of this service.\"  I have seen cases where young people are referred on to community services that do not exist.  If CAMHS is not there to support young people in need in a time of trauma and a time of mental health difficulty, what the hell is it there for?  In my experience, and I have no doubt that this is also the experience of social workers across the State, CAMHS is simply gatekeeping and trying to keep referrals away from the service.  In the past I would have said that if one could not use medication, they did not want to take it.  Now, this recent report in Kerry is very worrying particularly in that vein.<\/p>  <p>  There are other problems.  CAMHS provides automatic discharges if a young person does not engage.  This is a terrible policy because it ignores homeless children who may have difficulty engaging in geographically based services when they do not have any geographic home.  It ignores the difficulty of young people in trauma and mental health difficulty who cannot leave their room.  CAMHS has refused to meet with them.  I have been on the phone begging CAMHS staff to leave their offices and to come to meet a young person, whether in their home or at a neutral third venue, just to start building that relationship and to bring them into the therapeutic clinic, but CAMHS has refused to do so.<\/p>  <p>   Even if one can overcome all of these things and overcome all of this gatekeeping and attempts to restrict people, there are huge waiting lists, as other Members have spoken about.  If one can get through the waiting lists, quite often at the end of them there is no service.  I look back at my own time as a student social worker when I worked briefly in CAMHS.  A lot of the work I did was around autism spectrum disorder assessments.  At the end of it, we would present the diagnosis to the family and the family would ask \"What services do we get now?\".  We would shrug and say \"Well, we do not do that, here's the community service.\"  Again, the community services just do not exist.  The joined-up services referred to by Deputy Richmond are just not there.  The standard operating procedure, the referrals process and the gatekeeping by CAMHS render CAMHS as it is currently operating simply not fit for purpose.  All the money in the world will not change that unless we drill into those issues too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600059#MMM00300","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1643221620,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Galway, like every other county in Ireland, has been deeply affected by the mental health crisis in our young people.  This is probably the biggest issue that young people raise with me personally, which is a good thing in the sense that young people are being very vocal in relation to mental health services, or the lack thereof, and are looking to engage with us in that debate.<\/p>  <p>  After being elected to the D&aacute;il I took a particular interest in and focus on the crisis in the mental health services in Galway, as the Minister of State is aware.  I conducted a survey of young people and people across Galway who have used, and indeed not used, the mental health services in Galway.  I have met and spoken to a number of mental health service providers in Galway.  One thing that came to the fore among the people who engaged directly with myself, through the survey or in other ways, was the availability of mental health services outside of normal business hours.  There was a particular focus on this, and a lot of people felt that they had no option other than to attend at an accident and emergency department, when they felt that perhaps the accident and emergency department was not the appropriate place for them to go at that time.<\/p>  <p>  There were a variety of different responses from the people who spoke to me.  One person said that in multiple instances they were turned away from the accident and emergency department after the GP had recommended them to go there.  Another person reported that the accident and emergency department advised them to wait until the mental health clinic opened, but they left and felt vulnerable without support.  Others said that they went to the accident and emergency department and that they had a great experience.  The wide array of experiences is not surprising, but the reality is that people felt they had no other option at that point.<\/p>  <p>  Figures recently released by my party colleague Deputy Ward indicate that there were not sufficient levels of staff such as liaison psychiatrists in our emergency departments.  This adds more to those concerns and the fact that people do not have any other option, the concern being that a relevantly qualified person may not be available to assist the person who walks through the door.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue that concerns me is the fact that young people in Galway had the highest waiting times in the State for an appointment with Jigsaw, with some people waiting up to 20 weeks.  The Minister of State will be aware that as an adult 20 weeks is a very long time - it is five months - but for children that feels a lot longer.  It can take a significant amount of time for a person to come forward to say that they need help, but to have to wait that length of time really adds to it.  This really needs to be tackled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600059#MMM00400","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1643221620,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Whether we are dealing with youth mental health services or adult mental health services, it only works if we have every slot in the process that is necessary.  We have all spoken about our own constituencies and constituents who have come to us and cannot get appointments, assessments or follow-up services.  Some of them will have had difficulties in how they were treated by the service, and the services will have their own difficulties in that they do not have the positions.  Members have spoken about clinical psychologists and the fact that there is a difficulty in them getting the qualification.  There been no facilitation from the State in looking at filling a need where it is there.  The State does not go out of its way to facilitate people who want to get there so we can provide the services that are absolutely required by our young people.  Most speakers here tonight have referred to the disaster in the mental health services in Kerry, and unfortunately there is a question mark for those who work in CAMHS altogether.<\/p>  <p>  My greatest difficulty has always been for those people who could not access services.  As Deputy Farrell said, people do not know whether they should go directly to a psychiatric unit or directly to an accident and emergency department.  Generally, the result is not what it should be.  This is not to take away from these services.  We all know that we are failing, at a community level, to deal with it and that we are not providing those initial services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600059#MMM00500","speaker":"1498"}]
