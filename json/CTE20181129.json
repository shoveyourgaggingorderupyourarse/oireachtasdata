He is joined by Ms Josephine Mooney, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Kate O'Connell.  The minutes of previous meetings are being held over and will be cleared next week.<\/p><p>There are three categories of correspondence, the first of which is category A with briefing documents and opening statements.  No. 1745 A from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is dated 23 November.  It provides briefing notes for today&rsquo;s meeting on the various chapters, the outturn figures and various summary documents.  These are noted and will be published.<\/p><p>Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the committee, as well as other documents for publishing.  At last week&rsquo;s meeting, we dealt with a number of matters held over from previous meetings and left a few to be deal with.  No. 1560 B dated 7 September 2018 is from the president of Cork Institute of Technology.  It provides a detailed note requested by the committee on the preparation of the terms of reference for the KPMG review of anonymous allegations against Cork Institute of Technology in 2014.  We have discussed that.  It will be noted and published.  We will deal with it as part of the committee's upcoming periodic report.<\/p><p>No. 1637 B from the Office of Public Works provides the managing valuer's report on five historical cases on foot of a preceding submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have advised the correspondent that we may request a meeting with the individual in due course.  This matter has been discussed previously.  I propose to note and publish it.<\/p><p>No.1684 B from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is dated 24 October 2018 and encloses a minute from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on the third periodic report of our meetings from January to May 2018.  This will take a few minutes as it is the biggest item of correspondence.  I ask members to bear with me as we go through that.  We will first agree to note and publish the document.  It relates to the report the committee published on 11 July 2018 that covered a range of Departments.  The document contained 39 recommendations for the various Departments, 30 of which have been accepted and nine of which have not been accepted.  I do not intend reading out the document because it is 27 pages long.  We will briefly run through each recommendation.<\/p><p>Recommendation A1 was that a business case be made for all proposed major capital expenditure projects above a certain threshold.  The Department accepts that and is now updating its guidance as part of the public spending code, which is to be published.  We will write to the Department to ask when we can expect to see a copy of that.  It is very easy for a Department to accept a recommendation, but we are interested in how it follows through.  We want to know when the change to the guidelines will happen.<\/p><p>Recommendation A2 concerns public bodies that do not adhere to procurement policy.  It has not been accepted by the Department.  The committee had recommended that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform examine &quot;the imposition of appropriate sanctions for public bodies that do not adhere to public procurement policy.&quot;  The official reply indicates the recommendation has been noted and that the matter raised is for each contracting body, with the Department acting in a supervisory capacity.  It is interesting that the Department does not accept the principle involved.  It states this is a matter of good governance for each individual Department.  We stand by our recommendation and it is disappointing that it has not been accepted.<\/p><p>Recommendations B1 and B2 related to the Valuation Office's national property revaluation programme.  The office accepts all of the recommendations.  We were not satisfied with the timescales and the delays in revaluations, which was the basis for one recommendation.  The Valuation Office accepts that and has a new plan whereby they will do a revaluation every five years.<\/p><p>Recommendation B3 covers the variety of payment methods that should be allowed for ratepayers who, until now, must pay their rates bill in one or two annual instalments.  That has been accepted and agreed.  The change will be made in the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018.<\/p><p>Recommendation B4 addressed the sequence of the revaluation and how the Valuation Office chooses the counties to be included in the programme.  We asked it to present the logic for tis decisions.  The office stated the first revaluation is almost complete and that future revaluations will be conducted on a rolling basis of five to ten years.  There were some owner-assisted revaluations and some external contractors also did some revaluations.  We suggested the Valuation Office carry out a review to determine which is the most efficient and effective approach.  It has accepted that recommendation but states that it &quot;will have to be considered in the context of the overall funding allocation for the Housing<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">, <\/font>Planning and Local Government Vote Group.&quot;  The Minister indicated that the Department will make funding available to facilitate this.  We will write to the Department to find out how much money has been included in the 2019 Estimates to implement recommendation B5.  Recommendation B6, which recommends an independent external review, has been accepted.  The Valuation Office has accepted, in so far as possible, all of our recommendations.<\/p><p>Recommendation B7 concerns the National Shared Services Office and the management of salary overpayments.  The office accepts the recommendation and has established a new committee to liaise with clients to ensure there is proper agreement and understanding.  It wants to root out overpayments at source, which arise mainly from people being absent and notification not being given quickly enough.  We note, however, that the office seems to be improving in that area.<\/p><p>We asked what savings will be achieved as a result of the establishment of the National Shared Services Office.  The correspondence states: &quot;The Minister is further informed by that Office that the process for planning the evaluation of savings from the implementation of the Shared Services model has commenced.&quot;  The committee will write to the Minister to ask when this evaluation will be completed and seek a copy of the report.<\/p><p>The next recommendation from our periodic report related to the Dormant Accounts Fund, which was a disaster in terms of how it was managed.  The key issue was that responsibility for the fund transferred to various Departments over the years.  The Minister for Rural and Community Development currently has statutory responsibility for the dormant accounts disbursement scheme.  Some good recommendations made by the committee have been accepted.  We suggested that a substantial amount of money that had been locked in to older projects that were not going to proceed be decommitted.  The Department has confirmed that an action plan has resulted in decommittals totalling just over &euro;16.5 million and these moneys are now available to fund new measures in future action plans.  This is very welcome, and it is good that the Department has accepted our recommendation on the Dormant Accounts Fund because it was one of our more important recommendations.  The committee also recommended that the fund be maintained by one body to provide a stable platform for its effective administration.  As I stated, responsibility for the fund has been moved from Department to Department.  The Department notes our response and states that the allocation of responsibility for the fund is a matter for the Government and, ultimately, the Taoiseach.  We accept that response and that it is a matter for the Taoiseach to outline ministerial responsibilities.<\/p><p> The final recommendation, B14, concerns reviewing the scheme.  This is very important.  The committee recommended that the Department review the dormant accounts application process.  We felt it was overly complicated.  Our recommendation has been accepted and that is good.  The Department acknowledged that the assessment and selection procedures, in particular, would appear to be superfluous.  It also stated that some of the rules and recommendations go far beyond the normal accountability for Exchequer funds.  The Department has, therefore, accepted that some of the procedures were unnecessary and superfluous.  It is now dealing with that.<\/p><p> The next item was the decommittal of funds and that recommendation has also been accepted.  We will watch this space for future improvement.  It has been accepted, however, that some of the application procedures were overly and unnecessarily complicated, and the recommendation has been agreed to that some funds should be decommitted and available for new applications.  Those are two good achievements.<\/p><p> Our next recommendations were to a Department that, by and large, accepted very few of our recommendations.  I refer to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It noted everything we said but does not seem to have accepted any of it.  The committee recommended that the flow of funds from central government to local government be reviewed to simplify the process.  That was noted by the Department and it stated that the Comptroller and Auditor General has a chart which explains it all.  I think that chart highlighted how complex the whole issue was rather than simplifying it.  We will be coming back to that Department because, in its answers, it has not taken on board the spirit of what we were saying.  It might be understood by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Accounting Officer, but the public also needs to be able to understand these things.  The Department has not simplified the issue.<\/p><p> We also spoke of the fragmented nature of funding for local authorities from the different Departments.  That has also been noted.  The Department also stated that a review group has been established by the Minister to bring greater balance and equity for local authorities.  That is the funding model and that is being examined.  It was recommendation B18 and we are writing to the Minister to see when we might see that implemented.<\/p><p> The next item is about roads.  The Department has stated that it is providing additional funding for serious road accident blackspots.  The next recommendation, B20, was noted.  That was where the committee recommended that there should be a &euro;5 charge for online transactions for taxing cars and that the excessive charge for the quarterly issue of tax discs should be reduced.  The response from the Department states that this would be a charge on the Exchequer.  It is being stated by the Department that the cost of &euro;5 for each online transaction is actually closer to &euro;10.  That does not tally fully with what we understood from the evidence here during the course of our meeting.  In any event, the Department has stated that any such change would require an amendment to section 152 of the relevant legislation.  We will note and publish this and if any Member or party feels that it is worth amending the legislation, a Private Members' Bill can be brought forward.  We have highlighted the issue now.<\/p><p> The next item is in respect of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  This concerns inspections.  The Department has accepted recommendation B22 and states that there has been some duplication where local authorities were inspecting private rental accommodation which might also be covered by a HAP inspection.  The Department makes a disappointing remark, but I admire the honesty.  It stated that while the inspections are being undertaken widely by local authorities, not every local authority is recording data for every HAP tenancy on the dedicated HAP system.  Inspectors are walking in and out, saying accommodation is grand and keeping no record.  That is a recommendation we need to follow up.  The Department admitted that inspectors are not recording their inspections.  That is extraordinary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112900002#B00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543482000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>That is across different local authorities, of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112900002#C00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1543482000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Department is stating that it accepts that it is not recording but-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112900002#C00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1543482000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>No, it accepted-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112900002#C00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1543482000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I know the Department accepted that but it is not accepting that it should do anything to change it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112900002#C00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1543482000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The last paragraph states that the Department accepts the recommendation and it highlights the particular problem which I just explained.

I thank the members.  We are getting there.  Next are the recommendations in respect of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  There were several recommendations in respect of the Galway art house cinema.  The Department has accepted all of them, that is, recommendations B23, B24 and B25, and stated that it has learned many lessons.  It is a historic issue at this stage but lessons have been learned from that.  The Department has also accepted that it should have had more oversight and that is the system it is planning to use for future projects.<\/p> <p>  The recommendations we made to Department of Finance are next.  The committee recommended that the Department prioritise the production of a consolidated central government financial statement.  That has been accepted and the Department is working on it with the help of the OECD.  Recommendation B29 was to bring forward proposals to improve co-ordination in Government accounting, including the various State bodies.  That has been accepted and is also part of the review being undertaken with the OECD.<\/p> <p>  We recommended also that the Minister for Finance should endeavour to make sure progress was made in respect of the use of gross national income (Star), GNI*, for measuring activity in national income.  The Department accepted that measurement is very clear but stated that it is not a European rule.  The official reply stated several times that there is no legal status for GNI* as it is purely a domestic measure and it is not defined in the European system of accounts.  We understand that.  The Department stated that the consent of all of the other European Union countries would be needed to change the European system of accounts.  It added, however, that the European Commission, while it uses the normal GNI and not the Irish GNI*, does take the GNI* measurement into account when dealing with Ireland.  GNI* does not, however, have legal standing and to change that would require a European Union change.  It has accepted that the point was well made at this committee.  GNI* is only a domestic figure and not an internationally accepted figure but the European Commission does take it into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112900002#C00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1543482000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>On that, it is important to restate that the European Commission might take GNI* into account in that it accepts that is the figure that is used, but that is meaningless.

We said:  &quot;The Committee recommends that the Chief State Solicitor's Office ensures its oversight mechanisms are sufficient to prevent reoccurrence of this unacceptable waste of taxpayers' money&quot;.  That relates to where the Probation Service took over a building in Wolfe Tone Street in Dublin but the building was never occupied.  We were told that advice from the Office of the Chief Solicitor was based on &quot;legal professional privilege&quot;, and it is good.  They accept this.<\/p><p>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has replied in writing that, &quot;The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will commence a process with relevant law officers to examine how legal professional privilege will be protected in future in a manner which is, so far as possible, consistent with the accountability role of the PAC.&quot;  The Department has accepted that we have a valid point, that it will go as far as it can to meet that in future but there will always be the issue of legal privilege.  However, the Department has accepted it needs to go the road with us, in terms of public accountability, which is good to see.<\/p><p>The next item is the Toland report on the Department of Justice and Equality and that Department accepted the view of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We know there is an ongoing programme for change in the Department.  We will continue to raise this matter when the Department comes before us again.  The Committee of Public Accounts recommended a number of steps to monitor the follow-through in terms of this matter, and the Department is doing so.  We can return to this matter, at any stage, when we deal with the Department again.<\/p><p>The next section deals with the strategic communications unit in the Department of the Taoiseach and that Department accepted our recommendation that &quot;this process should proceed in the manner outlined by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach in his review of the operation of the Strategic Communications Unit.&quot;  We accept the review conducted by the Secretary General.  The Department of the Taoiseach made matters clear, in terms of implementing that review, and I will read a couple of the points it made.  The Committee of Public Accounts recommended &quot;that public bodies should always ensure that they retain the right to sign off&quot; on documentation.  The Department stated that the following guidelines concerning paid content are now in place: <\/p><blockquote>(1) Any sponsored or paid-for feature articles should continue to be clearly identifiable ... and they should state clearly that the copy is 'advertorial', 'advertisement', 'sponsored' or a 'commercial feature'<br \/><br \/>(2) Where media partnerships or agencies (third parties) are used, final editorial control or 'sign-off' must be by the relevant Department<br \/><br \/>(3) Should anyone be interviewed for an advertorial or infomercial, they should be informed of the purpose and their permission sought.<\/blockquote> <p>That means people welcoming issues but not knowing that it is part of a paid advertisement.  The final guideline is as follows: <\/p><blockquote>(4) Politicians and public representatives should not feature in any paid-for content by Government other than relevant office-holders (Ministers).<\/blockquote> <p>That clarifies the entire issue.<\/p><p>The final matter is RT&Eacute; and its licensing system.  The minute states that a working group was established, that there were proposals before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, that it has sent proposals to Government and on 28 July a working group was established, arising out of the pre-legislative scrutiny by that committee.  The working group will report to the Joint  Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The working group will also consider the possibility of the collection of the licence fee by the Revenue Commissioners or contracting externally for licence fee collection as provided for in the Broadcasting Amendment Bill.  There is no commitment; it is just being examined.  <\/p><p>Finally, RT&Eacute; has accepted the final recommendation we made about the Eversheds report.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112900002#D01500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1543482000,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Yes, RT&Eacute; has accepted it.

That completes our consideration of the largest item of correspondence.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1703, from the CEO of the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, on a request from the committee for a copy of a report arising from a value for money review of Irish public bodies.  The report is subject to a non-disclosure agreement between the LGMA, Irish Public Bodies, IPB, insurance and PricewaterhouseCoopers.  The CEO has written to both bodies to request their consent for LGMA to release the report and awaits a response.  The secretariat of this committee will keep an eye on this matter and we will update the committee on the current position in December.  We note and publish that.  I think we have mentioned this matter in public session before.<\/p> <p>  No. 1725 is from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills regarding the structural assessments carried out in schools constructed by Western Building Systems.  We agreed to note and publish this item and to request a briefing from the Department when we meet them in the New Year.

The association states it will provide information and assistance to the Accounting Officer, that is, the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, who is the accountable person to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I believe that members are very disappointed that senior public servants in local authorities, who are at the front line when it comes to dealing with the housing crisis, have decided not to make themselves available, on a voluntary basis, to assist the Committee of Public Accounts in its examination of matters pertaining to housing.  We note and publish it.  We asked for advice and assistance and never suggested that those concerned were within the remit of, or accountable to, the Committee of Public Accounts.  We stressed that attendance was voluntary.  I am very disappointed that senior public servants chose not to attend.

The letter states that on completion of the 2017 survey the response rate stood at 94% of the total population.  On the face of it, that seems like a very high response.  If it had a 94% response, we can rely on the figure.  We just wanted to check the veracity of the survey.

There is further information on matching funds from the HEA contribution.  That is fine.  We sought that information but the HEA does not give us a detailed breakdown.

The information is included in our periodic report.  We will note and publish this.  The Garda provides a breakdown of all the different categories under the ICT contract.  In particular, it says the approach allows for the current skilled resource contract to be broken into a number of manageable contracts and for better competition under the OGP ICT skilled resources framework.  Rather than to have this one massive contract going to one company, it is now being broken down into manageable amounts that can be tendered separately.  There will be a bit more competition and hopefully a better result.  That is progress.  As such, it was good to follow that and the Garda acknowledges that.

Expenditure on the schemes is spread across two accounts: the appropriation account for Vote 37, and the account of the Social Insurance Fund.  The Department's overall expenditure on scheme payments in 2017 totalled &euro;19.3 billion.  Expenditure on administration of the schemes amounted to a further &euro;618 million.  An annex to the appropriation account provides a useful summary of the combined programme expenditure and sets out the expenditure on a scheme-by-scheme basis.<\/p> <p>  The Vote account is funded mainly through direct Exchequer issues.  In contrast, the Social Insurance Fund is financed mainly from pay-related social insurance contributions, which are collected by the Revenue Commissioners, acting as the Department&rsquo;s collection agent.  Receipts into the fund have recovered in recent years as employment and earnings levels have increased.  Total receipts in 2017 were &euro;10.2 billion, up 6.6% year on year.  The receipts included some &euro;422 million in levies payable to the National Training Fund operated by the Department of Education and Skills.  The surplus for the year was &euro;731 million, leaving the fund with accumulated reserves of &euro;1.2 billion at the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  I gave a clear audit opinion on the accounts of both the Vote and the Social Insurance Fund for 2017.<\/p> <p>  Welfare recipients may be paid amounts to which they are not entitled or which exceed their entitlements.  Such irregular payments can arise as a result of innocent claimant errors, deliberate fraud by claimants or the manner in which claims are administered by departmental staff.  Control surveys of welfare schemes carried out by the Department are intended to identify the types of cases where such excess payments arise.  The surveys also provide a basis for estimating the level of irregular payments affecting the schemes examined.  The results of successive control surveys suggest that there was a material level of payments in excess of entitlements on both the Vote and social insurance schemes in 2017.  As has been the case for a number of years, I have drawn attention to this concern in both audit certificates.  The matter is explained in further detail in chapter 11.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 14 presents an example of the type of circumstances that give rise to welfare payments in excess of entitlement.  As part of the audit of the 2017 appropriation account, a review was undertaken of jobseeker's allowance.  One of the matters examined was the correct application of age-related rate reductions, which have been implemented since 2009.  Reduced payment rates apply to most jobseekers aged 25 or younger but there are a number of circumstances where an exemption applies and the payment rate is not reduced.  At the beginning of November 2017, there were just over 30,000 claimants in the age cohort, of whom 5,225, or 17%, were not on a reduced rate.  The audit identified, based on the information held by the Department, that 486 of those claimants, or 1.6% of the cohort of claimants as a whole, did not meet the qualifying conditions for payment of the maximum personal rate.  As a result, they were being paid an amount in excess of their entitlement.  We estimated the cost to the Department of such excess payments at just under &euro;1.2 million in 2017.  This is attributable to departmental or official error rather than to claimant error or deliberate fraud.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 12 reports on an examination of the Department's JobPath employment activation service for people unemployed for one year or more.  The JobPath service has been delivered since mid-2015 across the State by two companies contracted by the Department.  The key objectives of the JobPath service are to move people from the live register into employment, to reduce the number moving back onto the live register, and to reduce the duration of unemployment when it arises.  The service has been delivered against the backdrop of a substantial upswing in employment levels in recent years.<\/p> <p>  Jobseekers selected by the Department for participation in JobPath are provided with information on the services available and a personal adviser is assigned to each jobseeker.  Together, the personal adviser and the jobseeker develop a personal progression plan, or PPP, which includes a series of actions designed to assist the jobseeker in securing employment.  The service provider then supports the jobseeker in implementing the plan.  Up to March 2018, the Department had referred 192,000 jobseekers to JobPath.  Almost 160,000 of those referred had commenced engagement with the service providers.  Approximately 16,000 had dropped out and a further 16,000 were still in the process of developing a personal progression plan.  Approximately 69,000 were working with the service providers in implementing agreed plans.<\/p> <p>  The engagement with a service provider can extend to around two years.  Consequently, in order to assess the outcome of the service, we looked at the outcomes for almost 63,000 jobseekers referred in the period up to the end of 2016.  Of these, approximately 25% had subsequently commenced employment, which was significantly higher than the target minimum rate of job commencement set by the Department.  However, the proportion who stayed in employment fell away over time, so that by the end of 12 months, only 7% of those who engaged with the service providers were still in a job.  As indicated in the diagram which is now on screen, this was just marginally above the reference job sustainment rate, which the Department based on its own previous performance.  Broadly speaking, the outcome pattern achieved was similar for the various categories of unemployed persons.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the cost, fees of some &euro;109 million had been paid to the two companies up to March 2018.  The payments were based on verification of the delivery of the service to individual jobseekers, and of continued employment for those who took up a job.  Fee discounts built into the contract were availed of in 2017 when employment in the economy generally exceeded pre-specified levels.<\/p> <p>  Rates of contribution to the Social Insurance Fund are based on earned income, but vary for different contribution classes.  The types of benefits available to contributors also vary considerably by class, reflecting the insurance nature of the system.  Chapter 20 reviews the procedures adopted by the Department to gain assurance that PRSI classifications declared by employers in relation to their employees and on a self-assessment basis by self-employed individuals are appropriate.  The report also considers the adequacy of the arrangements in place between the Department and Revenue in relation to the collection and reconciliation of PRSI receipts.<\/p> <p>  In 2016, 96% of persons classified for PRSI purposes were in one of three classes: A, M or S.  Class M, approximately 10% of the total, applies mainly to those under 16 or over 66 who are in employment and those in receipt of an occupational pension where no social insurance liability arises and very minimal benefits are available.  Class A, which is approximately 76% of the total, applies to the earnings of most categories of employees, while class S, approximately 10%, applies mainly to earnings from self-employment.  An individual may have more than one contribution classification, depending on the source of earnings.  The rate of personal contribution by persons is the same for class A and class S, at 4% of earnings, but in the case of class A, employers are liable for an additional contribution equivalent to 10.85% of their employees&rsquo; earnings.  Consequently, there may be a considerable potential economic incentive, at least in the short term, to categorise workers in certain circumstances as self-employed.  However, we noted that despite apparent changes in employment relationships over recent years, there has not been a significant increase in the proportion of earners in PRSI class S over the past ten years.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s scope section may make a formal determination of the appropriate PRSI classification if requested.  However, the number of such determinations is small, less than 1,000 a year.<\/p><p>The Department undertakes some testing of compliance with PRSI classification rules, including through joint investigations carried out with Revenue.  Targeted joint investigations in recent years have detected a significant incidence of misclassification in the construction sector.  Members will also recall the review of the circumstances of persons in RT&Eacute; classified as self-employed, which identified a significant number of cases that required further review as to whether individuals were employed by RT&Eacute; or were truly self-employed.  That potentially has implications for their PRSI classification.<\/p><p> The Department also recently undertook a pilot review of the social insurance class of company directors and concluded that such a review did not need to be repeated.  The examination found that the pilot review used a very narrow sampling frame, resulting in assessment of the cases of just 13 individuals.  That limits the conclusions which can be drawn from the exercise.  The examination concluded that there is scope for the Department to increase the level of compliance activity it undertakes in relation to contribution classification and recommends a programme of random reviews of PRSI classification.<\/p><p> Chapter 13 reports on the long-term prospects for the operation of the Social Insurance Fund, SIF.  That is based on the results of an actuarial review of the financial condition of the fund that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is required by law to commission at least every five years.  Based on the position at the end of 2015, the review projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the fund will move into a deficit position and the Exchequer subvention required each year to meet ongoing expenditure requirements will be substantial and will increase rapidly.  The review projects that the subvention, in constant 2017 prices, will be &euro;1.7 billion in 2025, &euro;5.6 billion in 2035 and &euro;11.4 billion in 2045.  However, these projections are heavily assumption-driven.  Changes in assumptions about real earnings growth and life expectancy have the most significant impact on the projected SIF shortfall.  The conclusion is that the periodic review is a valuable exercise that enables informed public discussion about the expected long-term implications of current decision-making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112900002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543482000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and invite Mr. McKeon to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112900002#N00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543482000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me here today to discuss the appropriation account for Vote 37, chapters 11, 12, 13, 14 and 20 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and also the account for the Social Insurance Fund, all for the year ending 2017.<\/p> <p>  I am joined today by Ms Anne Vaughan, deputy secretary of the Department, together with Ms Kathleen Stack, assistant secretary general with responsibility for control policy, Ms Deirdre Shanley, assistant secretary general with responsibility for finance, and Ms Patricia Murphy, assistant secretary general with responsibility for employment affairs and PRSI policy.  I am also joined by Mr. Jim McDonnell, the Department's chief accountant and Ms Gr&aacute;inne McGuckin, from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  With the Chair's permission, I may rely on assistance from my colleagues in addressing some of the questions members may ask.<\/p> <p>  I arranged for an advance copy of this statement together with briefing material on each of the chapters under review, the annual report of the Department and the annual statistics report and other relevant information to be provided to the committee secretariat last week.  I hope members found that material to be of use.  In my opening statement last year, I referred to the changes in the nature and role of social welfare over the period dating back to the establishment of the Department some 70 years earlier.  I spoke about the role of welfare in compensating for and mitigating the impact of failures in the market economy.  I spoke of how the more than 70 different payments and services provided by the Department contributed significantly, not just to cushioning the impact of the great recession but to helping the economy recover faster than it might otherwise have done.  I spoke about how our staff are acutely aware, through their everyday work, of the impact of welfare and employment services at the micro level - the level of individual citizens and families - and that while they are mindful of the need to control the distribution of scarce State funds, they are equally mindful of the vulnerability of the people who rely on our services.  I spoke about how we work to treat every person with dignity and respect and to make our offices bright and welcoming.  I also spoke of how independent research indicates that customers rate our staff and services highly, including those provided under contract by third parties.<\/p> <p>  I mention this again because the work of the Department is essentially the work of balance, not just the external balancing of market dynamics and social goals but also internal balances.  In our work we have to strike a balance between ensuring, on the one hand, that people have access to a payment and, on the other, providing them with, and requiring them to avail of, a service that can help to reduce dependence on that payment.  There is also a balance to be struck in, on the one hand, designing and managing large-scale service processes that are reliable, efficient and effective for the overwhelming majority of customers and, on the other, imposing controls and checks intended to reduce fraud and error.  As I said last year, we cannot pursue the elimination of error or fraud at the cost of denying entitlement to service or frustrating access to that entitlement.  There are also balances to be struck on the revenue side of our operations relating both to intergenerational and inter-temporal equity and to horizontal equity in terms of treatment of social insurance charges on different types of employment.  These are the balances at the heart of the five chapters selected for discussion today, and it is on these chapters that I will focus my opening remarks.<\/p> <p>  The first chapter, chapter 11, summarises the Department's approach to what, following feedback at the Committee of Public Accounts last year, we now call control surveys.  It outlines the results of 14 surveys conducted by the Department over the past six years, covering approximately 80% of the Department's expenditure.  These surveys are conducted to help identify the risk factors that give rise to incorrect payments on individual schemes and to inform changes to operations processes and control measures to help reduce the level of incorrect payments into the future.  The surveys also provide an indicative estimate of the level of control loss, or leakage, in the system at a point in time.  In general, for most schemes surveyed, this ranges between 0.5% and 5%, with farm assist being a notable outlier at 10.4%.  Across all 14 schemes, the net level of excess payments averaged about 2.2%.  As Accounting Officer, I agree, given the scale of the Department's expenditure, with the Comptroller and Auditor General's assessment that this level of control loss or leakage is material.  However, as I did last year, I also draw attention to the fact that this rate stands comparison with equivalent rates in social welfare administrations in other states, for example, in the UK it is 1.9%, in Israel it is 5% and in Canada it is 3.5%, and indeed to rates of bad debt, which typically range between 2% and 5%, and shrinkage, which is typically 2% in commercial industry.<\/p> <p>  The second chapter, chapter 12, reports on a review of the JobPath service by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  By way of background, JobPath is an employment advisory and case management service provided to long-term unemployed jobseekers.  The service is provided on behalf of the Department by two contractors who are remunerated based on their engagement with jobseekers and the employment outcomes achieved.  The service sits alongside and augments the case management and advisory service provided by the Department's own Intreo staff and the contracted service provided by local employment services.<\/p> <p>  In the past, at this committee and elsewhere, a number of queries have been raised in respect of JobPath.  The first is whether it is appropriate to provide and to require jobseekers to engage with a case management or employment advisory service.  The evidence on this is, I believe, very clear.  Of all of the types of labour market intervention provided by public employment services around the world, the form of intervention which is shown to have the most impact is case management and employment advice.  For this reason, it is important to provide an employment advisory and case management service and JobPath is simply a method of doing this.<\/p> <p>  The second question raised is whether such a service should be provided under a contracted model or should be provided directly by the staff employed by the State.  Different people will have different views on the matter.  What I can say as Accounting Officer is that most countries use a mixed model, contracted resourcing being used to ensure that resource capacity can be flexibly added as required to core in-house capacity.  This was the rationale for the procurement of JobPath services at a time when the Department's in-house resources could not respond, as required, to the large increase in unemployment.<\/p> <p>  The third question raised is whether the JobPath model provides value for money.  I have provided under separate cover some additional briefing material which sets out the costs of the JobPath service and the outcomes achieved.  These data indicate that the service is delivering on targets set and that the costs of the service compare favourably with other case management services contracted by the Department.  Committee members may be interested to know that preliminary results of an econometric study currently being finalised indicate that people who received the JobPath service have higher rates of progression into employment and higher earnings in employment than people with a similar profile who have not received the service.<\/p> <p>  The fourth question raised is whether the Department has sufficient controls in place to ensure that payments to contractors are validly made and supported by real evidence of sustained employment.  This issue was considered by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his examination of JobPath.  Overall, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report notes that the number of people moving into employment from JobPath exceeds the target levels and that the number of people sustaining employment is broadly in line with the reference levels, both of which were set at 62% of the counterfactual or base case level, by which I mean 62% higher than the counterfactual or base case level.<\/p><p>The report also notes that the Department has a reasonable basis for the key performance measures used to evaluate contractor performance and that payments made to contractors were validly supported by evidence of the performance achieved.<br\/><br\/>Other questions raised in respect of JobPath, including about its interaction with programmes such as community employment, were addressed in a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection earlier this year.  I have provided the committee with a copy of a statement on the JobPath service which was submitted at the time.  I hope it will address questions members may have, although I will be pleased to address further issues of interest.<br\/><br\/>Chapter 13 summarises the results of the actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund and notes that it is a valuable exercise to inform discussion on short-term decisions and their impact on long-term outcomes.  The actuarial review is a periodic study conducted every five years in accordance with statute to project forward the likely evolution of the funding position of the Social Insurance Fund based on a defined set of assumptions.  It is important to note that the Social Insurance Fund, unlike, for example, private pension funds, does not operate on a pre-funded basis, whereby contributions made by a contributor today are invested to fund future disbursements.  Rather, it operates on a pay-as-you-go basis, with current year expenditure funded by current year revenues.  Deficits in any year are funded by means of an Exchequer subvention paid from the Central Fund.  Surpluses in any year are invested by the Department of Finance for the benefit of the fund and used to supplement income in subsequent years, but they are not netted off against deficits incurred in prior years.  Therefore, although the fund is projected to be in surplus to the value of &euro;2.3 billion at the end of 2018, that is a somewhat simplistic presentation of the actual position.  It has run deficits in six of the past ten years and during the recession the total value of the deficits amounted to &euro;11 billion.  These data indicate that the value of benefits paid by the fund greatly exceeds the value of contributions made to the fund.  That position is confirmed by the actuarial review which indicates that the value of the State pension alone is more than the value of the contributions made.  For that reason, given the projected increases in the numbers of older people and increasing life expectancy, the actuarial review projects significant annual deficits into the future.  It is important to note that decisions on the funding of the Social Insurance Fund, in particular on the setting of social insurance rates and the investment of any fund surplus, are vested in the Minister for Finance.  <br\/><br\/>The fourth chapter for discussion is chapter 14 which sets out the results of an examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General of age-related jobseeker's allowance payments.  The report finds that approximately 1.6% of jobseeker's allowance payments to people aged 18 to 25 years were made at a higher rate than provided for in legislation, at a cost of some &euro;1.2 million in 2017.  It, therefore, recommends that the rules used to calculate payments be coded in the Department&rsquo;s computer systems and that, pending this change, a greater level of quality control be applied and additional staff training undertaken to ensure all staff are aware of the rules.  As Accounting Officer, I agree with the recommendations and have taken steps to put them into effect.  These steps are set out in the conclusions and recommendations section of chapter 14.<br\/><br\/>The final chapter earmarked for discussion is chapter 20 which deals with the collection of PRSI contributions by self-employed persons.  As this topic cuts across the operations of this Department and those of the Revenue Commissioners, I will be joined by Mr. Keith Walsh and Mr. Kevin Cashell from the Revenue Commissioners who will endeavour to address questions related to its work.  As noted in the chapter, self-employed persons pay the standard rate of employee&rsquo;s PRSI, or 4%, but they do not pay the employer-related contribution of 10.05%.  The difference in contributions may provide a financial incentive for an individual to be declared as self-employed.  However, the chapter also notes that despite this apparent incentive, there has been no increase in the proportion of earners classified as self-employed in the past ten years.  The issue of disguised employment was the subject of an interdepartmental review group study in 2017 which is referenced in chapter 20.  A copy has been provided for committee members under separate cover, together with a recent presentation on the subject to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<br\/><br\/>Classification of employment for social insurance purposes is based on self-declaration, typically by the employer, with the scope section of the Department determining the appropriate class in cases where the correct classification is unclear or in dispute.  The section utilises the agreed code of practice for determining the employment and self-employment status of individuals in making such determinations.  The Revenue Commissioners act as agents of the Department in the collection of PRSI.  Both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department, working separately and together, conduct investigations of compliance, with correct classifications as part of our standard investigations regime.  As part of his review, the Comptroller and Auditor General examined a random sample of 35 determinations made by the scope section during 2017 and found that the evidence supported the basis on which the section made its determinations.  No example of a misclassification was reported.<br\/><br\/>The examination also considered a pilot review undertaken by the Department of the social insurance class applied to company directors in order to assess the merits of a regular annual review and noted that the Department had concluded that such an annual review process was not merited.  In addition, the examination considered a number of cases where the Revenue Commissioners or the Department&rsquo;s inspectors had conducted investigations into social insurance classifications and did not find any issue of concern in them.  However, it did note that the investigations had detected what the Comptroller and Auditor General considered to be a significant incidence of misclassification, particularly in the construction industry.<br\/><br\/>The Comptroller and Auditor General concludes with three recommendations.  The first is that the Department introduce a random programme of reviews of PRSI classifications, both to provide assurance as to the accuracy of classifications and to act as a deterrent to deliberate misclassification.  In the main, I agree with this recommendation.  However, my preference is that it should be achieved by increasing the number of employer PRSI inspections, rather than reviews <i>per se<\/i>, and that the inspections should include targeted, as well as random, elements.  As members may be aware, earlier this year the Department conducted a media campaign on the issue of false self-employment.  Following the campaign, we undertook an intensive programme of employer inspections in the Dublin area and a targeted campaign in the construction sector in the Galway area.  Based on these exercises, the results of which are being reviewed, we intend to intensify our employer inspection activity, as part of which we will again conduct a media campaign in 2019.  The purpose of the campaign will be to increase employer and employee awareness of rights and obligations and encourage reporting of suspected cases of misclassification.  The intelligence garnered in response to the campaign will inform the targeting of specific business and industry sectors for inspection purposes.<br\/><br\/>The second recommendation is related to the compilation of sectoral data for self-employed contributors.  The data provided by the Revenue Commissioners does not include sectoral data for the source of PRSI receipts.  I agree that receipt of this information would be useful in targeting inspection activity and we are following the matter up with Revenue.  In the meantime, the Department has analysed the sectoral data for self-employment available from the Central Statistics Office.  I have forwarded a trend analysis of the data in the past 20 years.  In summary, it indicates that the share of employment comprising self-employment is in gradual but steady long-term decline.  This suggests that, at a macro level at least, the issue of disguised or false self-employment is not as prevalent as it is sometimes presented to be.  Within these data, there are some interesting trends worthy of note.  For example, the share of self-employment accounted for by the services sector has grown, whereas that accounted for by agriculture has diminished.  The share accounted for by other sectors is largely unchanged.  However, these changes are largely driven by changes in the composition of employment in the economy, in particular the growth of the services sector.  As a result, the share of employment in the services sector comprising self-employment has remained relatively unchanged, at approximately 11%, over the entire period.  Again, this suggests there is no systemic reclassification of employment in the sector.  <br\/><br\/>When the data are analysed by type of self-employment, a somewhat different picture emerges.  Two types of self-employment are captured for the purposes of statistical reporting.  The first is people who are self-employed and employ staff in their business.  It is very unlikely that such persons are misclassified as self-employed.  The second type of self-employment is people who are employed on their own account - people who do not have staff engaged in their business.  This type of self-employment could include some people who should properly be classified as employees.  At an overall level, the share of own-account self-employment is in steady decline.  This trend is common to all of the major sectors, with the exception of construction.  As shown in the charts forwarded to the committee, the share of construction employment classified as own-account self-employment was constant, at approximately 15%, in the period up to the start of the recession.  During the recession it doubled to approximately 30%.  This can mainly be explained by the fall in construction employment during the period.  It is notable that the share of own-account self-employment is falling again as construction employment has recovered in recent years.  However, it will be important to monitor the trend to ensure the downward trajectory is continuing.  Accordingly, the Department will continue to place a particular focus on PRSI compliance inspections in the construction sector in the next year.<br\/><br\/>The third recommendation is related to the process undertaken with the Revenue Commissioners to reconcile monthly variances in PRSI receipts versus estimates.<\/p><p>I agree that a more structured process would be useful and would expect more timely data that should become available as part of the PAYE modernisation programme will support such a process.  I am therefore arranging to have this recommendation followed up with the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p> I understand that members would like to discuss the issue of housing supports today.  This Department previously played a significant role in providing monetary supports to help people in receipt of welfare payments to cover some or all of their household rent.  The role of the Department has diminished since 2014 when the housing assistance payment, HAP, funded by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and administered by the local authorities, was introduced.  Payments by local authorities, which are not contingent on a person being in receipt of a welfare payment, and so avoid a welfare trap problem, now account for the majority, more than 70%, of housing support payments funded by the State.  In order to address any issues that the committee members may wish to raise I will therefore be joined by my colleagues Ms Mary Hurley and Ms Marguerite Ryan from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government later this afternoon.<\/p><p> In conclusion I would like to say that the scale and scope of the operations of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection are greater than perhaps any other Department or public body.  The managers and particularly the staff of the Department work hard to deliver services to the communities from which we come and in which we live, conscious that it is our families, friends and neighbours who not only depend on these services, but who, through their social insurance contributions and taxes, pay for these services.  We are proud of the work we do but we know we are not perfect and we do not always get things right.  That is why we welcome the oversight of the Comptroller and Auditor General and of this committee.  This process plays an important role in reminding us of our purpose, helping us to identify areas for improvement and helping us to learn from our mistakes.  It is through such a process that we would hope to improve.<\/p><p> I and my colleagues will be pleased to take any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112900002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543482000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McKeon for his opening statement.

This breakdown colour co-ordinates each Department in terms of the numbers of staff.  Mr. McKeon's is one of the bigger Departments, of 5,000 staff or more.  It says there may be fluctuations in smaller organisations because of their nature.  The bigger the organisation means there would be the full flavour of staff, in age, demographics, gender and so on.  It should not be the case that those statistics are higher, if that is the case.  This is according to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  It also says there might be an issue in the Department of Rural and Community Development because it was only established in 2017.  <\/p> <p>  My point is that it is unacceptable for Mr. McKeon to say it is a result of how it is classified and that if it was done differently it would show a different outcome because it would show a different outcome for everyone.  That caveat is not given to us here.  I appreciate we have not been given an opportunity to delve into the figure, but I think we need to understand why the average amount of working days lost is 13.  In the Irish Prison Service, the figure is 15.7.  We can accept it might be higher in that area, given the nature of the job and that people get assaulted in the course of their work who would then be out.  We can see obvious reasons for it to be higher in that area.  Mr. McKeon's Department is the next highest, at 13 days.  He said it was a concern but the explanation he gave does not really satisfy me.  I am trying to figure out why there is a difficulty in his Department that does not seem to apply in other Departments.  For example, in the Department of the Taoiseach, the figure is 3.5%.

Deputy Burke spoke about the length of time it takes to process carer's allowance.  One is looking at situations with carer's benefit, for example, where someone has to leave work due to a stroke and there can be a delay.  That needs to happen quickly as a person can be at work and suddenly have to depend on social welfare.  As the person may have some savings, community welfare officers do not really kick in.  That is one category but there are others in the area of disability.  I have come across people who were previously on an invalidity pension.  I realise it is not necessarily a pension for life where someone recovers.  One wants people to recover and go back to work.  It is a useful payment from that point of view.  However, I have seen people removed from payment in circumstances which make the mind boggle.  It is where someone has an obvious long-term illness.  If someone appeals that or a disability payment matter, there is a very high rate of reversals of departmental decisions in disability cases.  It is, or it certainly was, in excess of 50%.  That is not a very good use of administrative time.  In fact, it adds a layer of concern and bureaucracy for people who get the payment when they succeed on appeal.  Has the Department looked at that and has the number come down in recent times?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112900002#W00600","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543482000,"counter":468,"content":"<p>The Deputy raised two issues.  One was the issue of someone who was on a payment having the case reviewed and being taken off the payment.  It is very rare that happens.  It is very unusual.  If the Deputy has examples, I would be very happy to have a look at them.  That is very rare as it is generally the case that to get onto the invalidity pension payment, a person will tend to have a very profound medical condition.  It is very rare that happens, albeit it is not to say it never does.<\/p> <p>  With regard to appeals, the Deputy is right that approximately 60% of people who appeal a disability or invalidity related decision, which is approximately 1% of those who get a decision, which is the context in which this must be considered, get a favourable outcome.  The appeals office then sends the file back to the Department for another look and it is at that stage when most of them get the favourable outcome.  Generally, it is because people have provided additional information which was not available to the Department the first time.  We have worked with disability activation groups and carers.  We have developed a new form which is getting positive and negative feedback.  On the one hand, we are accused that the form is too long.  On the other hand, the Carers Association feels it is as long as it needs to be to ensure all the information required to make a first-instance decision rather than a second-instance one is captured.  We are continuing to work to try to improve the quality of the information available.  Our medical assessors are not like Attila the Hun, they are trying to look realistically and objectively at each case.

That does not mean that there is not a problem and that every case is not an issue to be dealt with, but just to make the general point, it is not as prevalent as people think. <\/p> <p>  For example, we conducted 2,000 employer inspections as our response to the media campaign that we ran, both in Dublin and in Galway.  In Galway, they concentrated on the construction industry.  We interviewed more than 170 staff and there was only one case that was suspicious.  When we finalised the investigation of that case, it was found to be correctly classified as self-employed.  In Dublin, when we did more than 1,000 inspections, there were three cases that we found to be suspicious, all of them, by the way, in the private security sector which is not something we were expecting to find.  Those three cases are being followed up.  If they lead to prosecutions in due course, we will follow them up.  I have no interest in presenting something that is not the case.  It is just that what we learned from our own data and our own experience is not what is sometimes presented to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018112900002#KK02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1543482000,"counter":838,"content":"<p>I will finish my contribution on this because I am aware Deputy Catherine Murphy wants to get in.<\/p> <p>  There are different views on how prevalent bogus self-employment is.

This Supplementary Estimate is required in respect of subhead B4, the general childcare programmes.  This subhead provides funding to subsidise the childcare costs of low and middle-income parents and those accessing education and training programmes.<\/p><p>An additional &euro;47.33 million is required in order to meet additional demand by parents for subsidised childcare as a direct result of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to assisting parents to access affordable and quality childcare.  This commitment led to what is now called the September measures.<b><i><\/i><\/b>We have seen significant additional demand for childcare places as a result.  I will revert to these measures in a few moments.<\/p><p>It is projected that there will be an underspend of at least &euro;27 million across other areas of the Department's Vote.  This includes &euro;15 million in once-off savings arising from changes made to the early childhood care and education, ECCE, payment calendar.  This reduces the net additional Exchequer funding requirement to &euro;23 million.  That is the figure we are talking about today.<\/p><p>I will expand now on the reasons that the additional Exchequer funding for childcare is required this year.  The general childcare programme provides funding for the community childcare subvention, the training and employment childcare schemes, the learner fund, funding for county childcare committees and national voluntary childcare organisations, and the S&iacute;olta and Aistear supports.  In addition, it provides for capital funding for the early years and school age capital programmes.  Another important element of this subhead is the provision for development costs associated with the introduction of the affordable childcare scheme in 2019.<\/p><p>The community childcare subvention programme is demand-led.  There has been a notable increase in demand following an extensive communications and media campaign to inform parents and providers of improvements to the scheme in advance of the introduction of the new affordable childcare scheme later in 2019.  These improvements were introduced in 2017 and included the introduction of a universal payment and an increase in subsidy rates across the different strands of the community childcare subvention and the training and employment childcare schemes.<\/p><p>These changes represent a major step towards accessible affordable quality childcare following decades of underinvestment in our childcare and early years sector.  Ireland is reported to be the most expensive country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, for childcare for lone parents and the second most expensive for couples.  According to OECD research in 2016, Ireland spends just 0.5% of gross domestic product on early learning and care and education, including expenditure on under six year olds in primary school, as opposed to an OECD average of 0.7%.<br\/><br\/>The September measures<b><i><\/i><\/b>include, first, a new, non-means tested universal subsidy available for all children aged between six months and three years of age or until they qualify for ECCE in registered childcare.  This amounts to as much as &euro;20 a week or &euro;1,040 per year for children in full-time childcare.  Second, there are enhanced supports of up to &euro;7,500 per eligible child per year to assist families to return to employment and-or training and education.  These changes have been highly successful in bringing subsidised childcare supports to the parents of some 13,000 more children than originally provided for in budget 2018.  This accounts for &euro;29 million of the additional funding required in 2018.  In addition, there has been a noticeable change to the mix or composition of the qualifying rates parents are entitled to with more parents qualifying for the higher band A rate.  We have seen an increase in parents availing of longer hours for childcare.  This accounts for some &euro;19 million of the additional funding required.<br\/><br\/>These initiatives are leading to positive change for parents and children and when measured in tandem with other childcare initiatives, such as the second year of ECCE and the introduction of the affordable childcare scheme in November 2019, should see some improvement in Ireland&rsquo;s position when measured against the OECD average.  The remaining portion of the required Supplementary Estimate is of a technical nature.  The reduced intake of receipts into the Department's Vote is to be offset against a corresponding reduction in expenditure on subhead B8 relating to the intervention programme for children and subhead B9 relating to the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, I commend the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs Vote to the committee and I am happy to address any questions members may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2018112900002#A00400","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543501800,"counter":1122,"content":"<p>The Minister will not be surprised to hear that I have no criticisms of additional funding being required in the Department.

The Minister has outlined on numerous occasions the stark level of underinvestment for decades in the State.  A number of schemes are due to come to fruition in 2019 and 2020 which will require additional budgets.  Regarding the 0.5% of GDP and the target of more than 1%, will the Minister outline her long-term strategy to get us closer to the OECD average and to ensure we can meet the demands of expectant parents or couples who might be thinking about parenthood given that this will be of benefit to them in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2018112900002#B00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1543501800,"counter":1123,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the positive comments on progress to date.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was questioned about some of these issues today in the House and he said that we are on an incremental path of increasing the investment and trying to move towards that target.  Incremental does not necessarily mean slow.  We have done some things quite rapidly in the past three or four years in terms of increasing investment by over 117%.  That is my first point.<\/p> <p>  Second, to move from 0.5% of GDP to the OECD average of 0.7% will require a significant amount of extra investment.  In increasing it rather rapidly in the last couple of years my practice has been to outline a rationale for the importance of finding additional money to prioritise the development of the infrastructure for childcare.  In the last budget, the arguments I made largely surrounded not only the importance of this type of support for children in terms of their early learning and care and the developmental aspects of that but also the fact that we need more investment to support parents who wish to return to education and training.  Many of them are inhibited from doing that due to the fact that it still costs too much for them to feel that they are going to receive additional benefits for doing it.  Part of what we are trying to do is identify Estimates for each year where if we increase by X% it will be enough to include some of the people who are trying to make a decision to go back to work, and within enough time to plan for that, and ensure that it will make enough of a difference for them to do that.  Taking this approach and spending in this way will not necessarily overheat the economy because we are increasing our productive capacity.  Those are some of the arguments I made in respect of the last budget.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, we recently launched the national early years strategy for the next ten years, entitled \"First 5\".  In that strategy we identify not only the vision for how we wish to increase investment but also the rationale for the approaches we are taking to get much closer to the OECD target.  The affordable childcare scheme is the main tool for that.  We must continue to increase the subsidies per child per week depending on the type of care the child requires.  We are also committed to increasing thresholds.  When one identifies a certain percentage of increases that one wishes to make for families in terms of incomes and so forth, working back from that helps to determine the type of threshold that would be required to increase living standards for families in a significant way.  With regard to that aspect of the question, we do not simply say we are going to try to reach 0.01%, for example, of an increase next year but instead we examine and try to calculate what we require to have a meaningful increase in the living standards of families according to the type of family involved.  That is the main aspect of trying to calculate the figures, and I have many of the people who do that well with me today.<\/p> <p>  There is another aspect to the increase in investment.  It is important to talk about the average percentage increase that is required to build the childcare infrastructure but if we always average the amounts we do not necessarily take account of the ways in which people are impacted differently because of the differential in their family income.  Therefore we will also be seeking to get enough money to pay more into a new model that we want to develop for early learning and care, which we call the DEIS-type model, where we make more investment in arenas which require it more.  Again, this is to assist levelling the playing field for our children.<\/p><p>I am not talking about percentages <i>per se<\/i>but the rationale which I hope will persuade Government to prioritise even more significantly than it has done in the past.  This is about the development of a new funding model for the early learning and care services in which more is invested in more settings and where higher quality can be delivered, at the same time as ensuring modest fees for families and better pay and working conditions for staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2018112900002#B00300","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543501800,"counter":1125,"content":"<p>The Department has been good at advertising some of the new schemes, using bright and eye-catching colours.

The Vote makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces and certain dependants.  The 2018 Estimate provides a gross sum of &euro;239.1 million for the Vote; however, gross outturn this year is expected to be approximately &euro;242.6 million, which leaves a shortfall of &euro;3.5 million.  The &euro;3.5 million required is 1.5% of the original gross Estimate.  I will deal with the recent spending review of Defence Forces pensions expenditure, which is particularly relevant in the context of this Supplementary Estimate, later.<\/p> <p>  I will set out the position regarding the relevant subheads of the Vote.  Subhead A2 is the largest subhead of the Vote.  It covers spending on all pension benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, and their dependants.  It accounts for 96% of all military pensions spending, including gratuities.  It is demand-driven and non-discretionary.  The original provision of approximately &euro;229.2 million for the subhead will not be sufficient to meet all requirements for the year.  In the circumstances, the shortfall on this subhead is estimated at &euro;4.7 million.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the main reasons for the shortfall in the subhead.  The number of Defence Forces pensioners has continued to rise during the past year and at the end of October 2018 there were approximately 12,450 military pensioners of all categories.  This is a net increase of approximately 460 since the end of 2013.  Based on available information, it is projected that approximately 340 military personnel will retire with a pension and lump sum in 2018.  Overall, this turnover during the year was greater than what was provided for in the original Estimate.  This is driven by natural turnover of Defence Forces personnel annually, allied with increased life expectancy generally.  New retirees going on pension continue to outnumber deceased pensioners by a ratio of about 2:1 on average.<\/p><p>In other areas of the public service, most people leave at a standard retirement age and so their numbers and timing of departure can generally be predicted well in advance.  However, the PDF is different because the vast majority of military personnel who retire on pension do so voluntarily; that is, before reaching maximum retirement age and at a time of their own choosing.  As these voluntary early retirements are not known in advance, this can contribute to greater than expected expenditure on military retirement benefits in any given year.  This situation is a product of the availability, for operational and human resources, HR, policy reasons, of the early payment of pension benefits immediately on retirement after relatively short periods of service and regardless of age.  In any given year, forecasting of Defence Forces pensions expenditure and the exact number of retirements is very difficult.  In 2017, some 70% of military personnel who retired on pension did so voluntarily and the picture is much the same for 2018.  In addition, many retirees qualified for the maximum retirement benefits, which also contributes to the ongoing increased expenditure.<br\/><br\/>The shortfall of &euro;4.7 million under subhead A2 will be partly offset by expected savings of &euro;1.2 million under subheads A3 to A6, inclusive.  To sum up, the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 35 is to seek additional funding of &euro;4.697 million for subhead A2 and to reallocate savings of &euro;1.197 million from subheads A3 to A6, inclusive, to subhead A2.  This leaves a net Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;3.5 million.<br\/><br\/>Earlier, I referred to the recent 2018 spending review of Defence Forces pensions expenditure.  The review, which was published on budget day, was carried out as part of the 2018 round of spending reviews and was undertaken jointly by officials from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Briefly, the review came to the following conclusions.  Defence Forces pensions expenditure and pensioner numbers have been increasing progressively year on year.  This trend is forecast to continue in the short to medium term.  Military pensions expenditure, in common with public service pensions generally, is demand-driven and non-discretionary, so it cannot be arrested or reversed in the same way as may be possible with other aspects of Exchequer expenditure.  Defence Forces superannuation arrangements differ in a number of key respects from the wider public service.  These distinctions include earlier and more unpredictable retirement turnover with entitlement to immediate pension benefit, and atypical faster rates of benefit accrual.  These factors make it more difficult to predict annual funding requirements accurately in any given year.  Of particular relevance is the review&rsquo;s conclusion that funding allocated in the annual Estimates process for Defence Forces pension benefits has proved insufficient in recent years.  This has led to an annual requirement for a Supplementary Estimate, largely met through identified savings from the Vote 36 - Defence.  In noting the Supplementary Estimates that have been required in the past, the spending review goes on to recommend that the Army pensions Vote should be allocated resources in line with the cost analysis in the review from 2019 onwards, to ensure that the full cost can be met.<br\/><br\/>As the committee will be aware from previous Estimates debates, it has been my stated intention to seek extra funding for military pensions as part of the overall budgetary negotiations.  I am pleased to report that solid progress has been made on that front.  As announced in budget 2019,<i><\/i>an extra &euro;10 million has been allocated in the 2019 Estimate for the Army pensions Vote, a 4.2% increase.  This follows an additional &euro;6 million in the 2017 Estimates and an extra &euro;9.5 million in the 2018 Estimates.  As stated in the pensions briefing material provided to the committee for today&rsquo;s debate, the extra &euro;10 million in Vote 35 for next year is generally in line with the forecast for Defence Forces pensions expenditure for 2019.  The situation will be constantly monitored over the course of the coming year to ensure that appropriate funding is in place to meet all requirements.<br\/><br\/>I commend this Supplementary Estimate for the Army pensions Vote to the committee.  I will be happy to take any questions regarding the Vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018112900002#A00500","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543491000,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and call Deputy Niall Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018112900002#B00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1543491000,"counter":1151,"content":"<p>I do not have any questions.

Should we be holding on to Army personnel for longer rather than giving people attractive pensions at a relatively early age?  I am throwing out the question, not necessarily making a suggestion.  The question has to be answered, however.  Can we afford to have a situation where people can retire on these terms?  It is part of their right under the existing scheme, so this would mean a change in rules and regulations for new people coming in, but it strikes me that it is an uphill battle all the time.  Are the Defence Forces under-strength as a result of retirements?  This naturally becomes a bigger problem when the economy is going well and people have other options.  We rightly spend a great deal of money on training people and on all the other things that go with the Defence Forces.  Then we are left at the mercy of whether these people are going to stay the course or take early retirement.  Has there been any thought of reviewing the conditions under which people join the Defence Forces and the length of time we expect them to serve?  It is a constant issue that we do not really know when people are going to take up other options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018112900002#B00400","speaker":"1219"},{"type":"speech","time":1543491000,"counter":1153,"content":"<p>That is a very important question.

The issue to which the Deputy refers is being looked at in the context of the White Paper.  He has a very valid point.  However, we have to reach a balance.  We have to have members who are fit, healthy and able to perform the day-to-day duties expected of them, whether overseas or at home, whether the person is male or female.

There are many opportunities for personnel to progress through the organisation in terms of promotion and so on and they have an opportunity to stay on well beyond the retirement age for a regular soldier.

It is also a first step towards delivering on that UN target of 0.7%.  Robust economic growth, however, has put a downward pressure on our ODA to gross national income, GNI, percentage outturn.  In the recent past, the target fell from a high of 0.59% in 2008 to 0.32% in 2017.<\/p><p>For 2018, we set ourselves a target of 0.3%.  As it stands, and based on current projections for GNI and allocated levels of ODA, we are unlikely to deliver on that target.  The Supplementary Estimate I propose will facilitate delivering the ODA-GNI percentage target of 0.3% in 2018.  That brings the total 2018 budget allocation to Vote 27 to &euro;515 million, which, coupled with ODA from other Departments and Ireland's share of the EU development co-operation budget, I am confident will deliver on that commitment to a target of 0.3% of GNI for this year.<\/p><p>These additional resources will help in the following areas: contribute to Ireland delivering on the target of 0.3% for 2018, to which we committed at the beginning of the year; support delivery on key political commitments, including the Taoiseach's commitment to increase Ireland's contribution to the EU emergency trust fund, EUTF, for Africa; contribute to delivering on Ireland's clear commitments to education and, in particular, education for girls; support effective multilateralism and rules-based international order in response to changing international politics, which has seen the withdrawal of funding from organisations such as the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, UNRRA, and the United Nations Population Fund; and build on a Government priority to increase support for conflict prevention and peace building.<\/p><p>In that context, I will briefly comment on Ireland's new policy for international development which will be launched early in the new year.  Our new policy will deliver a fresh approach to the transformative ambition of the United Nations' sustainable development goals.  It is defined by our values, reflects current realities and responds to the challenges of the increasingly complex international and development co-operational landscape.  It will be built on the foundation of the sustainable development goals, which provide an interconnected international policy framework for action, allowing the space to specialise and sharpen our focus.  As has been the case in the past, our primary focus will be on those furthest behind.  We will have a central focus on addressing extreme poverty, vulnerability and marginalised groups.  We will build on our track record in reaching the poorest and most vulnerable.  We recognise there is much to do and reaching those who have been left out of progress to date will be difficult.<\/p><p>We have identified a number of key areas which we are working to flesh out, including reducing humanitarian need, promoting gender equality, strengthening our work to address climate change and strengthening governance.  We want to work in a structured and strategic way across these key strategies, such that each reinforces the other.  A culture of respect for human rights will underpin all of our work.  We will use our leadership and influence in multilateral fora to build collective support for targeted actions in support of interventions in these areas.  Conflict prevention and protection will be a key focus, building on our experience at home and responding to the call of the UN Secretary General for the need to focus on conflict prevention.  We will seek to reinforce the intersections between Ireland's peacekeeping and conflict resolution work, political engagement, development co-operation and humanitarian action.<\/p><p>I have often said I am passionate about Ireland's development co-operation programme, as is my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and about ensuring we excel in how we target and deliver our resources for maximum impact in reducing inequality, poverty and hunger.  We bring our own authentic experience to this work, delivering a world-class programme aimed at some of the world's most vulnerable and marginalised people, helping to save lives, building livelihoods and bringing life-saving humanitarian assistance to those most in need at times of crisis.<\/p><p>I welcome comments and questions from the committee members.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1543491000,"counter":1171,"content":"<p>I welcome the commitment to providing more funding to UNRRA, especially in the light of the US decision to stop funding for its vital work.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned an additional allocation of &euro;2 million for the UN peace-building fund, and that it will coincide with Ireland's membership of the UN Secretary General's advisory group on peace building.  Will the money be specifically directed at one peacekeeping issue, or is it pooled funding?  Will he provide more details of our membership of the advisory group?  How long will the membership be and when will we join?  <\/p> <p>  I welcome the additional allocation of &euro;5.5 million proposed for the global partnership for education.  The Minister of State said much of it will be spent on education for girls.  Will a specific amount be ring-fenced for girls?  How will it operate?  We know that girls face a greater variety of significant challenges in accessing education than boys.<\/p> <p>  On the multilateral assistance, the Minister of State said there will be a &euro;3.5 million increase in the funding for the EU trust fund for Africa.  I have expressed concern in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere about this whole project.  The EU policy on migration seems to be based on an inherent contradiction.  On the one hand, there is acknowledgement of migration as a structural phenomenon with long-term implications, driven by deep development and governance shortcomings.  On the other hand, the EU's reaction is for the most part tailored towards the short term.  There has been an increased tendency to divert funds formerly allocated to European development co-operation to the task of migration management and border security, which are the elements about which I am most concerned.  <\/p> <p>  The policy weakens the EU action in the realm of poverty reduction and good governance.  Dr. Luca Barana, a researcher in the Piedmont centre for African studies in Turin, produced an excellent analysis of this.  Libya shows how such short-term fixes largely ignore deeper structural challenges.  Despite the chaotic situation on the ground, the EU has invested heavily in border and migration management in Libya.  This also includes matters related to the coastguard.  There was evidence given to the committee, in both public and private session, in regard to the armed militias, slavery, trafficking and so on.  The aim is to prevent people leaving Libya to seek asylum, which is a human right, and to keep them there, despite it being clear that their human rights are being violated.  According to current EU data, to date all EUTF contributions in north Africa, particularly Libya, have been devoted to the issue of migration management and control.  Is that where the extra &euro;3.5 million in Irish funding will go, or will it go to something else?  I hope it will.  We should stand against the increased focus on short-term security implications.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State also mentioned that some of the money would go towards conflict prevention and protection, which will be focused on building on our experience at home.

What does he hope to do?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018112900002#H00200","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1543491000,"counter":1172,"content":"<p>On whether the peace building fund will be specifically targeted, it will be in the general fund.  It is an additional funding of &euro;2 million, and it is strongly aligned with emerging priorities in our new international development policy.  It will coincide with Ireland's membership of the UN Secretary General's advisory group, of which H.E. Anne Anderson is a member with extensive experience.  In that peace-building endeavour, we bring to the table our experience of conflict resolution and peace building.  We bring the security of peace that we have in Ireland to an international context, and we have much to offer.  This additional funding allows us to come to the table with considerable credibility in our financial commitment and national experience.<\/p> <p>  On the global partnership for education, GPE, I was delighted to attend the pledging conference for GPE in Dakar a number of months ago, at which Ireland committed an additional &euro;25 million over three years.  The Deputy asked specifically about girls in education.  Having spoken extensively with the board of the GPE, which coincidentally is meeting in Dublin next week on my invitation, I know that girls' education, rather than being somehow singled out for special attention, pervades all the work it does.<\/p><p>A central tenet of their ambitions worldwide, especially in the countries in which they work, is to ensure that unique focus is placed on getting girls into education, keeping them there and ensuring that when they attend that they receive an exceptional high quality education. I was also very pleased, when I first met with the global partnership for education, GPE, to meet the Nobel prize winner, Malala Yousafzai, who has been a powerful global advocate for girls in education.<\/p><p> On the EU trust funds, the additional &euro;3.5 million is to meet the Taoiseach's political commitment to the trust fund for Africa.  As Deputy Crowe observed, it is about addressing the root causes of forced migration.  If we are to get to the very bottom of these issues, identify what they are and be credible in attempting to work to resolve them, we must make a significant financial commitment to it.  Ireland's total pledge is &euro;15 million and this extra funding, combined with other funds, will mean that we have delivered &euro;8.9 million of that by the end of 2018, and we will pay the balance in 2019 and 2020.<\/p><p> Migration is probably the challenge of our generation.

There is a lot of talk.  We could have a greater combined effort, say a European combined effort, to deal with these problems instead of us all going off and doing little bits and pieces but that does not seem to happen.  That is a bigger issue for me.  It is not one of whether we give another &euro;100 million, or whatever.  We are dealing with a problem that does not seem to be going away.

One cannot give up on working with other countries to help them embark on the exact same journey on which we embarked 200 years ago.  Donogh O'Malley's decision to make secondary education free for all in 1967 was powerful.  We can see the impact of that around us.  That is why we are investing &euro;25 million in the global partnership for education and why, when I sat in that room in Dakar, I heard education ministers from across Africa say they would roll up their sleeves and use the investment wisely.  It is a long process of their education systems evolving and giving them the same strength to empower their young people to have the same successes as our own experience now.<\/p> <p>  There are 1 million additional young people coming into the workforce annually in Tanzania and 2 million in Ethiopia.  By 2050 Africa will be the most dominant economic power in the world.  We must ensure those young people have the skills to partake in that economic growth.  The trading relationship between Africa and the European Union is unique.  Trade between the Continent of Africa and the European Union is 30% higher than it is with China and the USA combined, so the relationship is very special.<\/p><p>The upcoming new policy for our international development programme will focus strongly on working closely with our EU partners to maximise those trade opportunities so that ultimately our relationship with the African continent will evolve over time from one of aid to one of trade.  Ultimately, that is what we are working towards.  I am very optimistic.  While I know some members of the committee are travelling to the USA soon to meet our diaspora community, many members have also travelled to the African continent to see the work of Irish Aid and the NGOs we support on the ground.  When one comes home and reflects on the work and its impact, one can only be optimistic.  Our approach to international development has been recognised internationally over and over again as of a very high order.  It compares with the best in the world.

Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are similar.  The objective is to have consistency within the Bill.  The change proposed in amendment No. 1 would need to be made again in section 3.  Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are linked because they replace the definition in question with a different one.  These amendments are about consistency.  The Minister of State will recall the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2011, passed recently by these Houses, which makes provision for claims to be made for those who had insurance with Setanta or claims relating to that company.  I understand the payments are to be made later this week or early next week, which is very welcome.  The phrase &quot;risk in the State&quot; is consistently used throughout the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2011.  Therefore, it would seem logical to use the same wording here rather than the phrase &quot;Irish-based risk&quot;.  Amendment No. 6 defines this as per the 2011 Act.  Amendment No. 5 deletes the definition in the Bill and replaces it with the one in the 2011 Act, the purpose being to have consistency in how we interpret risk.<\/p><p>The Minister's definition, which amendment No. 5 deletes, states that an Irish-based risk means &quot;a risk, falling within a relevant class of non-life insurance, that, by virtue of regulations under section 7(1), is regarded, for the purposes of this Act, as a risk based in the State&quot;.  The current text ends up defining the subject as a risk based in the State.  The definition I am suggesting is that used in the 2011 Act.  If my amendment is not accepted, this Bill will define Irish-based risks and another two Acts would be defining risks in the State.  There is a lack of consistency.<\/p><p>Section 7, which we will discuss in more detail later and which refers to risks based in the State, allows the Central Bank to make regulations specifying what counts as risk based in the State, but we already have a definition.  The only reason for a redefinition, which is what is included in this Bill, is to limit the range of insurance types that would be caught by the definition.  It seems confusing given that we have two Acts that define the risks as risks in the State as opposed to Irish-based risks, which we are now trying to introduce.  The  amendments make the point that we should be using the definition already established and used in numerous Acts.  Is there any reason non-life insurance should be excluded from the database?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018112900002#B00600","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1543485600,"counter":1219,"content":"<p>I shall read my note and then deal with the Deputy&rsquo;s comments.

It is intended that risks in the State would be defined by regulation, rather than in the primary legislation, to minimise the need to amend the legislation in future.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are opposed on the basis that the incremental way in which relevant classes of non-life insurance will be provided for by in the database over time &ndash; we are starting with motor insurance - means that much of the text of the amendments would not be initially relevant or appropriate.<\/p> <p>  The definition of a \"risk in the State\", which is used by the Deputy, is that which is used in the Insurance Act 1964 in respect of the framework for compensation in the event of an insurance insolvency or administration.  That 1964 Act definition is split out in terms of what risks are excluded and uses categories that may not be contemplated in terms of the database - for example, travel insurance.  The current drafting requires the Central Bank to provide for the definition of an Irish-based risk in this Bill to be analogous to the 1964 Act definition while providing flexibility to vary it where appropriate.

Amendment No. 7 outlines a number of steps which can be counted in the context of the section.  It deals with the issue of transparency which is at the core.

The approach of individually specifying this level of detail is not in keeping with the general drafting approach taken in the Bill.  We propose to set down in primary legislation a framework within which the Central Bank will establish an administrative claims database that will allow the specific approach to evolve over time.  It is intended that the data to be collected from insurers will be defined by regulation, rather than in the primary legislation, to minimise the need to amend the legislation as the level of data collected in the future becomes more detailed.  The Central Bank has informed me that it will take the substance of the amendment into account when it finalises its data specification in order that the data outlined are collected in this way.  <\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about distortion in bookkeeping exercises, they are not going to be acceptable to anybody, let alone the Central Bank.  It is a sharp practice that certainly could not be accommodated anywhere.  <\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 7 is being opposed on the basis that it comprises detail which is unnecessary to drill down into the primary legislation and that is appropriately covered in the existing text.  In that regard, the existing provision which provides for \"the employment of the procedures under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board\" covers all of the cases which come within its scope, including those set out in the amendment.  It is similarly covered already.  <\/p> <p>  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has also highlighted in respect of this provision that there are deficiencies in the terminology used in the amendment.  As such, it does not properly reflect the wording of the original Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 which is referenced.  In addition, in trying to break down the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process into a series of component parts we run the risk of missing out on certain elements.  For example, having consulted directly with it, we understand the proposed amendment may not cover cases that the board releases almost immediately under section 17 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 where consent has not been sought from the respondents.  These may be cases such as psychological bullying, abuse, etc. that may ultimately be settled after concluding the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process.  This means that there is a possibility that it would not allow for all settlements made in the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process to be captured, thereby unintentionally decreasing the scope of the information that might be requested.  On the basis that the existing text captures all scenarios within the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process, I do not think it advisable for the committee to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018112900002#D00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1543485600,"counter":1267,"content":"<p>On amendment No. 7, what section of the Act already covers the two subsections I want to include?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018112900002#D00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1543485600,"counter":1268,"content":"<p>Section 3(b) of the original Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018112900002#D00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1543485600,"counter":1269,"content":"<p>I will come back to what the Minister of State has said on that issue.  On being prescriptive, the reality is that insurance companies are not to be trusted.  They are under investigation for engaging in cartel-like activities and were raided by European authorities.  I have no qualms in saying they are ripping people off.  I received an email late last night from a person who was being fleeced in seeking to get motor insurance.  It is not possible to pay insurance premiums upfront.  The insurance companies are then allowed to add additional charges because people pay in monthly instalments.  No matter what way they turn, they feel under serious pressure.  To tell the Minister of State God's honest truth, I would not trust insurance companies as far as I could throw them.  We know that this happens.  We know that businesses and accountants look at how expenses can be offset from a subsidiary here to one elsewhere to present figures in a different way and that best suits it.  Amendment No. 3 would not limit how business expenses would be defined, but it sets out clearly what needs to be included.  I do not, therefore, hear any reason it should not be included.  The Minister of State, rightly, talked about it not being in keeping with the Bill, as drafted.  He will see, however, in a number of my amendments, that I believe that, as legislators, after what we have come through and given the reasson we know that this is needed, we do not need to agree to loose legislation that allows the Central Bank which I trust to interpret what we would like to do.  The Central Bank is independent in implementing Acts and using powers passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is interaction where we set down the ground rules for how this issue will be dealt with.  Therefore, we do need to be more prescriptive.  The reality is that this has been happening and the Central Bank has not been the great protector of consumers who have witnessed increases of 70% over a period of three years.  The Central Bank was also not the great protector of consumers when it came to the scandal of tracker mortgages, etc.  There is, therefore, an onus on us to be prescriptive to a certain degree.  That is what amendment No. 3 attempts to do.  It tries to ensure, in so far as is possible, that we will not see the industry using its accountants to try to cook the books.  I refer to the use of business expenses as a way to reduce the figures that the industry will present in the claims database.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018112900002#D00500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1543485600,"counter":1270,"content":"<p>The Deputy might be shocked to hear that I agree with him on some of what he said.

I think the Deputy's criticism is fair and I agree with his point.  <\/p> <p>  On business expenses, I do not have the exact figure offhand, but awards account for more than 90% of funds paid out by insurance companies.  In talking about business expenses the Deputy used the term \"cooking the books\".  It is not one I will use, but in the scheme of things business expenses actually come to a small amount.  In this jurisdiction awards constitute the much larger amount.  We have had this conversation before and I have made the point to the Deputy.  If he is satisfied, I am prepared to give a commitment that what he is asking for can be captured by regulation, rather than primary legislation.  The legislation has been designed in that way in order that we do not have to be prescriptive.  There is flexibility to enable the Central Bank to capture everything we want it to capture in the future.

They have different methodologies for calculating what they pay out and at what stage.  Some settle claims very early, while some do so without a medical report.  Some settle them too early, while others challenge people with a very clear and obvious case for damages through no fault of their own every step of the way.

If we were to set the very high threshold suggested in the amendment, it could cause insurers to take an overly conservative view of the information they were comfortable in sharing with the bank, which would result in a deficit in usable data.  The amendment is also opposed on the basis that it is unnecessary in the context of data protection, as an appropriate safeguard has been included in the section to protect personal data.  Where an insurer provides information from which an individual is identifiable, the Central Bank is mandated under subsection (3) to ensure the information is not disclosed by it.  That requirement is in addition to, rather than in substitution for, any other data protection requirement in the Bill or the Data Protection Act 2018.  We do not want insurance companies to propose giving aggregated information to the Central Bank in order to avoid the potential identification of an individual from among a smaller number of claims, bearing in mind data protection requirements.

This was to specify that motor insurance or public liability insurance would be subject to this database.  We all know here that the intention is that motor insurers would be subject to this database but it does not say that in the Bill.  That is what the amendment sought to do.  It sought to ensure that the Central Bank does do that because it is not in the legislation.  It was ruled out of order because it would be a charge on the State.  How the hell could it be a charge on the State unless it was not intended to do it in the Bill in the first place?

I will talk to those responsible for ruling these amendments out of order and get a better understanding of the reasons for doing so but I make those points to say that the Minister of State should look at clarifying these issues by looking at some of the amendments that have been ruled out of order.

The problem with Central Bank reports is that from the point of view of ordinary people, many of them are inevitably highly technical.  Would the Minister of State be agreeable to providing broadly based information and comparators, including all other countries in the European banking system because they all collect data, so that is not putting any big burden on anybody?  In respect of the ongoing conversation about insurance and how expensive it is, it would enable us to build up comparators over time that would be useful to policymakers here and give us insights into how much value for money is provided by insurance in Ireland compared with how much it costs.  We have a lot of anecdotal information.  In many European countries that are part of the same European central banking system, financial services like insurance are simply not as expensive as they are in Ireland.  Would the Minister of State be open to discussing or even showing us what this report is likely to look like?  Given that the Central Bank is a member of the European system, can we not see how it shapes up in terms of this kind of regulation compared with other European banks?

We have benchmarked awards in Ireland through the report of the Personal Injuries Commission chaired by Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns.  On average, a soft tissue award in Ireland is 4.4 times greater than elsewhere, so if a person gets &euro;10,000 in the UK, he or she will get &euro;44,000 here.  This is not an attractive jurisdiction for insurance companies.  How do I know that?  Quite a few of them have left.

This consideration took into account the need for balance and constitutional proportionality and has been signed off by the Attorney General.  Therefore, while legislation can always be challenged, we are satisfied that constitutional issues should not arise in the context of these two limited amendments and that there should not be any unintended negative consequences for genuine claimants.<\/p><p>On section 8, the amendment deals first with the letter of claim and the potential consequences of a failure to serve a notice in writing on the alleged wrongdoer within a prescribed period from the date of the cause of action &ndash; currently two months.  The cost of insurance working group formed the view that section 8 should be amended to enhance the effectiveness of this statutory requirement.<\/p><p>The key aim of this amendment is to reduce the notification period for the serving of a letter of claim from two months to one month, to align the time period with data protection legislation and the new general data protection regulation, GDPR, which came into force on 25 May 2018 and which provides that data shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is obtained &ndash; generally no more than one month.<\/p><p>However an exception to this rule is where information on CCTV footage, video footage or digital footage is held in the context of an investigation, such as a personal injuries claim.  Consequently, by requiring a plaintiff to notify a defendant within one month of an alleged incident under section 8, the defendant will be given the opportunity to identify within the data protection time limits any footage the defendant may have of the incident, and keep it beyond the one-month period for investigation purposes where the defendant believes the claim is questionable.  This earlier notification period will also help a defendant prepare his or her defence in a range of other ways such as being able to put together more accurate employee witness statements where this is relevant.  It also may help the defendant in accepting his or her liability as early as possible, thus enabling the claim to be settled quickly with minimal legal fees incurred.<\/p><p>The existing wording of section 8 needs to be strengthened in order to ensure it is used more effectively by the courts.  In this regard, it is proposed that instead of a court having the option to draw inferences from the failure to serve a letter of claim on the alleged wrongdoer within the prescribed period of time through the use of the word &quot;may&quot;, it should be required to do so as a matter of course through the use of the word &quot;shall&quot;.  It should be noted that these inferences may not always be negative as the court may conclude that there was reasonable cause for the delay in notification.  However, where the inference is negative, the court may make no order as to the payment of costs to the plaintiff or deduct such amount from costs that would, but for this section, be payable to the plaintiff as it considers appropriate.<\/p><p>Finally, on this part of the amendment, the working group believes that the words &quot;or as soon as practicable thereafter&quot; should be deleted as this allows arguably too much latitude to a plaintiff to delay unnecessarily before notifying the defendant.  The working group, however, is of the view that with the deletion of these words, sufficient protection still remains for the plaintiff in this section, as only where there is a failure &quot;without reasonable cause&quot; can a court draw a negative inference.  That refers to section 8.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018112900002#H01300","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1543485600,"counter":1352,"content":"<p>This amendment to reduce the notification period for the serving of a letter of claim from two months to one month, in the context of data protection and GDPR, seems sensible.  I do not have an issue with that as such.<\/p> <p>  I have an issue with the other parts of what the Minister of State has done here.  The Minister of State has removed the words \"or as soon as practicable thereafter\", which allows for the court to decide whether it is practicable.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State has then determined in law that the court shall draw an inference and while the note he provided to us states that such inference can be positive, the language is negative and it is designed to be a negative conclusion.  The court has the power, if it so wishes, to draw an inference.  The reason it is written in that way is because inferences are negative so that it can draw a negative view in relation to this.  Now the Minister of State is saying they shall do it but it kind of states this is good and there is nothing negative there.  There is a serious issue in that regard.<\/p><p>The amendment to section 14 of the 2004 Act is tinkering around the edges.  I am not sure about it.  I have not heard any reasonable explanation for why a fraudulent claimant would delay his or her own proceedings.  I do not understand why that would be the case, but that is not the core issue, which relates to a number of steps that are being taken in the amendment.  We all want fraudulent claims to be stamped out.  I will give the Minister of State the opportunity to outline to us his conversations with Garda Commissioner Drew Harris on the establishment of a funded insurance fraud squad within the Garda force.  The official position is that such a body should be funded by the industry.  A number of steps are specified in the amendment.  It specifies a reduction in the notice period from two months to one month and proposes the deletion of the phrase \"as soon as practicable thereafter\".  Another phrase is used that is still more restrictive.  A further proposed change is that the court \"shall\" as opposed to \"may\" draw an inference.  The penalty for genuine claimants who fail to fulfil the terms of subsection (4) is that an order of costs could be made against them or the costs for that part could be made against them.  The change is far-reaching and for this reason, I cannot support the amendment.<\/p><p> I support the core principle of the amendment, namely, the proposed change in the term from two months to one month.  I do not have a problem with that, but the Minister of State needs to revisit the amendment on Report Stage.  If a court decides there is a reason for the claim not being been served on an individual, it is up to the court to draw a conclusion.  Courts are empowered to draw conclusions and we should allow them to make such decisions rather than dictating to them by using the word \"shall\".  The problem is that the change would make it harder for genuine claimants.<\/p><p> We are correctly coming at the legislation with the intention of stamping out fraudulent claims and driving down insurance premiums.  However, there is also a responsibility on us to look through the lens of people who are making genuine claims.  We must ask whether this is proposal will create three further hurdles that will allow insurance companies, which are multi-billion industries with lawyers akin to Goliath, to go up against individuals who were genuinely injured having been involved in a motor or other accident.  The Bill provides additional ammunition for the industry to tackle fraudulent claims but the approach would also have an effect on genuine claims.  We have got the balance wrong here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018112900002#H01400","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543485600,"counter":1354,"content":"<p>Will the Minister of State give us a copy of his detailed note because we only recently received information about this amendment?

A business is not able to defend itself in cases where no report of an incident of any nature has been made to a staff member.  I will tie this in with Deputy Doherty's point about why a fraudulent claimant would delay proceedings.  The best ploy available to a fraudulent claimant is to make a late claim because there may no evidence of an incident on the part of the business owner and, subsequently, to drag out the case for between three and five years.  This potentially leaves an open claim on a business's books for that entire period.  Business owners have frequently told me it is cheaper to pay off a claimant, even though they have no knowledge of any incident having taken place because as long as there is an open claim on their books, their insurance premium will increase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018112900002#J00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1543485600,"counter":1357,"content":"<p>To clarify my point, when I stated that it benefits a fraudulent claimant to delay I did not mean in the case outlined by the Minister of State, where there is an obvious benefit.

In my view and in the view of several businesses who have presented to me, this is almost 100% complete.  The number of occasions when fraudulent claims show up and they have no evidence that an incident did not happen is significant.  Heretofore, before the change in the data protection laws on 25 May, they could keep the footage for as long as they wanted - months, two years, whatever.  Now the law of the land says that footage must be deleted after one month.  It is only appropriate that we equalise the period for which the footage must be retained and the period within which people have to be notified of a case.<\/p> <p>  We are in no way removing the court's flexibility in dealing with somebody making a legitimate claim.  It is important to put on the record that whenever I meet businesses or groups who are concerned about insurance, everybody wants to ensure that the legitimate claimant is compensated, as we in this House do.  We provide for reasonable cause in the section to ensure that if somebody has a legitimate and reasonable cause for not notifying the party against whom they are making a claim, the court will consider that.  This does not impact upon that.<\/p> <p>  However, the matter of inference arose in the working group.  In this amendment, the inference pertaining to the plaintiff remains in cases where there has been a failure to notify without a reasonable cause.  If somebody rocks up with an insurance claim one year, 11 months, three weeks and three or four days later, we are again in a situation where the person against whom claims are being made has no evidence.  Staff members might be gone.  The respondent might not even know who was working on the night in question.  This situation could last for two, three or four years.  Drawing a negative inference in cases where there is no reasonable cause is a matter for the court.  It is important that we have enough protection for claimants with a reasonable cause for not giving notification.  We are here to protect the individual who has a legitimate case for damages against his or her person.  We are all at one in wanting to protect those people.  However, we have to move to a new space.  The period of one or two months and the provision for inference is crucial to make an impact.  We could pretend to make an impact and make a provision that is not legitimate.  I am not about that and I do not believe this committee is.  If we want to make an impact, this section is crucial.<\/p> <p>  We are not imposing on the courts.  Yesterday, the Attorney General gave his opinion and he is comfortable with this.

I continually have to say that I am not opposed to the establishment of a Garda insurance section within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.  As a personal view which I aired a long time ago, very early in the job, I am opposed to the industry funding the section directly.  If the industry provides the money to the Minister and the Minister provides it to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I am 100% comfortable with that.  That arrangement does the same thing.  Funding is provided to the Exchequer, which, in turn, provides the same funding.  I would look for additional funding to establish the insurance section.  That is what I would prefer.  The cost of insurance working group, which was present before I came into the job, also highlighted that.  It is the UK model.  However, it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.

That is the critical issue, whether we are talking about company directors or bankers misbehaving or fraudulent insurance claims.  I do not understand why a structure that allows action has not been developed.  We hear all the time about cases where a person comes into a restaurant, stages an incident some time later and then makes a claim.  As the Minister of State said, nobody has much knowledge of the incident at issue.  The only way to deter that is for the fraudsters to be prosecuted, as happens with fraud in other areas of business.  I do not know if the Minister of State has addressed that.  It is a scandal.  Judges openly say it in court and claims are withdrawn.

We need to get this up and running as quickly as possible.  As we have talked about in reference to section 14, personal injury claims should not be delayed.  That needs to be part of the database.  Personal public liability needs to be part of it, not just motor insurance.<\/p> <p>  I have made one point on a number of occasions to the Minister of State's predecessor and to the line Minister.  Any instance of big private business directly or indirectly funding our police service is inappropriate.  It does not matter if it passes through the Minister's hands before it gets to the Garda.  It is not acceptable.  It would also not be acceptable if a philanthropist came to the Minister and offered to fund a section of the Garda to investigate rogue or corrupt politicians, or if a big businessman decided he wanted something investigated and passed money through the Department of Finance.  It would not be done.  We need to establish this as a matter of principle.  Everybody on this committee and in the Houses of the Oireachtas believes the Garda should have an insurance fraud squad.  Then we need to publicly resource it.  Before the Minister of State meets the Garda Commissioner, he should get a commitment from the Minister and make it clear to him that the Houses of the Oireachtas stand four-square behind him.  The Garda Commissioner is independent in how he structures the Garda.  However, it is the view of the Oireachtas and of this committee that there should be such a unit within the Garda and the necessary resources should be made available.  Whether we want to raise additional money through taxes or levies on the insurance industry should be a secondary issue.  I welcome the Minister of State's comments about his personal view on this.  From my point of view, even if funding passed through the hands of the Minister before getting to the Garda, a precedent would be created.  It is just not right.<\/p> <p>  I can understand how frustrating it is to see people who have had their claims dismissed as fraudulent by a judge and who have taken up court time walking away without a worry in the world  because they are not going to be prosecuted.  We need to deal with this quickly.

I am joined by Mr. Donncha O'Sullivan, Mr. Seamus Clifford, Mr. Frank Maher and Ms Downey, who is in the building and may be joining us shortly.  I thank members of the committee for making time available for this consideration.<\/p> <p>  The net amount of the Supplementary Estimates is &euro;59 million for the Garda Vote, &euro;10 million for the Prisons Vote and &euro;8 million for the Department of Justice and Equality Vote.  The Courts Service Vote does not require additional Exchequer funding but requires that surplus receipts of &euro;600,000 are used to offset current expenditure requirements in a technical Supplementary Estimate.  The remaining Votes in the group for the Policing Authority and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will remain within budget and have surrender balances of approximately &euro;2.7 million at the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  A Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;59 million arises in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote this year.  This comprises a gross expenditure requirement of &euro;76.2 million, which is offset by a projected surplus in appropriations-in-aid of &euro;17.2 million giving a net additional requirement of &euro;59 million.  An additional &euro;46.4 million is being made available to meet payroll and overtime costs, including the Garda College subhead.  The additional requirement for pay and allowances is &euro;23.7 million and &euro;22.7 million relates to overtime.  I am pleased that in budget 2019, an additional &euro;72 million will be provided for Garda pay and allowances, which provides for the costs of accelerated Garda and civilian recruitment and costs associated with pay agreements.  There are additional requirements under a number of other administrative and operational subheads, including travel and subsistence, expenses associated with road traffic policing, maintenance of Garda premises, certain other station services, and clothing and operational equipment amounting to &euro;30 million after offsetting underspends in other areas.<\/p> <p>  The offsetting underspends arise across subheads such as superannuation due to fewer retirements than expected, at &euro;2.5 million, and compensation, at &euro;1.8 million.  There are surplus receipts of approximately &euro;17 million, mainly accounted for by pay-related pension deductions.  This is directly related to the increased expenditure on pay and overtime and the Supplementary Estimate is making these additional receipts available to offset a proportion of the overtime and payroll cost.  The Supplementary Estimate also includes the reprofiling of &euro;6.649 million in the capital building and refurbishment programme, &euro;3.581 million which it is proposed to carry forward to next year under the capital carryover provisions, and the balance of &euro;3.068 million being reallocated to ICT capital.  This is to balance a similar reallocation at the end of last year when a corresponding amount from the ICT budget was reallocated to the building programme.<\/p> <p>  A total capital allocation of more than &euro;92 million is being made available to the Garda Vote next year.  This will facilitate significant further investment in leading edge ICT of &euro;64.8 million, &euro;10 million for transport, and &euro;17.5 million for the capital building and refurbishment programme.  The current Supplementary Estimate process and the increased budgetary provision for the Vote in 2019 provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the financial resources to address the challenges it faces and, significantly, to support the ongoing reform programme, which will gain further momentum from the implementation of the recommendations in the report on the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The recommendations in the report are comprehensive and far-reaching and provide a blueprint for future development of the policing service in Ireland.  Specifically, on the financial front, it recommends the production of a costed policing plan presented in a multi-annual framework.  While the details have yet to be fully worked out, this has the potential to significantly change the way in which budgets and expenditure are presented in the future, including to this committee.  I look forward to the output from this process.<\/p> <p>  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;10 million is required for the Prisons Vote.  The requirement arises across a number of subheads, including pay and additional allowances of &euro;1.997 million, travel and subsistence of &euro;548,000, staff training and recruitment of &euro;1.1 million, building and equipment, mainly maintenance costs, of &euro;2.6 million, prison and operational services at a cost of &euro;2.3 million and compensation payments of &euro;2.4 million.  There are offsetting underspends available of &euro;2.129 million, including surplus appropriations-in-aid of &euro;1.5 million, which has reduced the net funding requirement to &euro;10 million.  There have been pressures on a number of the non-pay subheads in question in recent years but it has been possible to offset some of the costs from underspends in other subheads, including payroll.  This is not possible in 2018 as there are increased payroll costs arising from a pay agreement integrating rent allowance with basic pay.  While recruitment is ongoing in the Prison Service, it is not yet at the point, coupled with retirements, that all vacancies are covered.  It is necessary to fill some of the staffing shortfall through increased additional hours payments.  A number of once-off costs arose this year in respect of training expenditure, for example, where alternative accommodation had to be used while the training college in Portlaoise was being renovated.<\/p><p>In addition, particularly in respect of the maintenance expenditure, the severe weather conditions earlier in the year, the collapse of the Mountjoy circular roof and certain other unplanned works gave rise to some additional expenditure.  <\/p><p> Turning to the justice and equality Vote, there is a requirement for an additional &euro;8 million in the current year.  This mainly arises across criminal legal aid and asylum accommodation with a combined projected overspend of just under &euro;26 million.  However, in a Vote with in excess of 60 subheads across five programmes, there are a number of underspends and overspends against budget which have contributed to reducing the additional Exchequer funding requirement to &euro;8 million.  <\/p><p> The budgetary arithmetic underpinning the Supplementary Estimate requirement takes account of the various under and overspends across the budget.  As outlined, the areas of overspend relate to criminal legal aid, &euro;15.7 million, and asylum accommodation, &euro;10 million.  The volume of cases arising from criminal activity before the courts is increasing and this has a proportionate increase in the criminal legal aid budget.  The upward trend in the number of legal aid certificates granted increased by 18% in 2017 and this trend is continuing in the current year.  There is also evidence that the length and complexity of cases is contributing to the increased costs.<\/p><p> Another demand-led area of the Vote relates to asylum accommodation.  The number in accommodation is approximately 14% higher than this time last year.  The number of persons seeking international protection has increased significantly in the past 12 months, which has a direct impact on the numbers in accommodation.  Arising from the increased demand, it has been necessary to open six new accommodation centres providing 567 new bed spaces to date this year.  This contributes to additional budgetary costs. <\/p><p> An additional provision of &euro;2.4 million is being provided to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  This brings the total the total allocation to &euro;6.7 million for 2018 and the budget mainly relates to the payment of awards made by the tribunal.  The areas that have reduced the additional Exchequer funding required to &euro;8 million include surplus receipts in respect of immigration registration and visa fees of about &euro;7 million, underspends on payroll across a number of subheads, including Probation Service, &euro;2.5 million; Data Protection Commissioner, &euro;2.2 million; and Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, &euro;3 million.  This is mainly due to the delays in recruitment such that a full year staffing cost is not reflected in 2018. <\/p><p> There is also an underspend of &euro;5 million in the capital budget for the forensic science laboratory, after proposed capital carryover to 2019, pending the issue of an updated request for tender which is now expected to issue shortly with commencement of the main construction works in 2019.  Preparatory works on the site of some &euro;2 million were carried out during 2018. <\/p><p> The transformation programme in my Department is well under way with the internal teams and structures in place and an external support contract to be awarded to the successful bidder shortly.  <\/p><p> A technical Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000 is required in respect of the courts Vote.  This is mainly to offset certain administrative costs by a projected surplus of &euro;600,000 in appropriations-in-aid arising from court fees.  It is also proposed that an underspend of &euro;2.5 million in capital will be carried forward under the capital carryover provisions in 2019 and utilised for the implementation of a number of key ICT and reform projects. <\/p><p> In conclusion, I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee and I am happy to address any queries or questions and listen to any observations the committee might have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018112900002#A00700","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543501800,"counter":1386,"content":"<p>This is a Supplementary Estimate.

The Minister told us last year that one of the reasons a Supplementary Estimate was needed was Garda overtime because numbers were down due to of non-recruitment and that this year things were going to be much better because of all the new recruits.  The additional requirement we are now being asked to approve in respect of overtime is half what it was last year but it is still substantial.  Does the Minister think we might get to a point next year where there will not be a Supplementary Estimate for overtime?<\/p> <p>  Last April, he told us that ICT was a central component of Garda modernisation and renewal.  We have been told that &euro;342 million, including &euro;217 million in additional funding under the capital programme, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021.  The 2018 budget for ICT was &euro;40 million.  The briefing note informs us that some of the Supplementary Estimate was allocated to ICT under the heading \"Admin non-pay\" and underspend in the capital budget elsewhere in the Garda Vote has been relocated to ICT.  How much extra did it get and what was it spent on?<\/p> <p>  We know about all the problems with PULSE over the recent period.  The special rapporteur for children, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, devoted a section of the appendix in his section 12 report last he asked to be done was made available to the Garda.  Has that been done now?  Was any of the additional money reallocated to ICT spent on plugging the massive holes in PULSE, or what was it spent on?  Perhaps the Minister could take those few question first, before I move on to other sections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018112900002#B01300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1543501800,"counter":1398,"content":"<p>That is fine.

The Deputy initially asked a question about the need for such a Supplementary Estimate on an annual basis.  I am keen to obviate the need for one towards year end and will work towards ensuring that these issues can be addressed during the year through the original moneys allocated.  This is an issue particularly for Garda overtime which I have discussed, at an early stage, with the new Garda Commissioner, regarding the financial position of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We agreed it is essential that value for money be achieved within the resources available and I acknowledge what the Garda Commissioner himself has said to this committee in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Overtime is an issue.  In 2013, provision for overtime was &euro;50 million; in 2014, it increased to &euro;56 million; in 2016, it was &euro;91 million; and it has exceeded &euro;100 million this year.  We are anxious to ensure that value for money is attained.  There is a continuing recruitment campaign, which will result in a net intake of new garda&iacute; of the order of 500 per annum, with approximately 300 retirements.  That will result in a scenario where the overtime requirement should not be as marked.  However, arrangements for Garda overtime is not an issue for which I, as Minister, have direct responsibility.<\/p> <p>  A sum of &euro;3 million has been moved to ICT in the Supplementary Estimate.  We have &euro;60 million allocated to ICT for 2019.<\/p><p>That should allow for the increased investment, which will help ensure the implementation of the various projects under way.  For example, we expect a phased implementation of the mobility project, aiming to secure mobile access to Garda systems.  There is also the roll-out on a pilot basis of the investigations management system, which will standardise, digitise and further support the management of all investigations arising from a PULSE incident. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018112900002#B01500","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543501800,"counter":1401,"content":"<p>Perhaps it is because we have had a busy week but I did not really get that.

I posed the question in the context of this year's budget allocating an extra &euro;60 million for Garda pay but only &euro;6 million extra for Defence Forces pay.  If we have already allocated that in next year's budget, will we be given another Supplementary Estimate, again on overtime?  I do not believe that this or the issues about PULSE were answered.

Has funding been made available in 2019 for the expansion of these DPSUs to other divisions beyond the four?  Obviously the units are crucial, they were sought in Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report and by the Garda Inspectorate.

Half of this saving relates to the Irish passenger information unit, which has been established and currently processes extra-EU flights.

The Minister told us last year that recruitment would sort this out and that is kind of his answer again this time. The problem is that, while we wait another year, there are families and individuals who are going through an incredibly tortuous immigration system.  In some cases, families are looking to join family members or visit friends, and all of that good stuff that is a very serious consideration for people in our society.  I do not think this is being addressed.  There needs to be a specific analysis of why we have had such a problem with recruitment in this particular area.

I acknowledge there is something of a delay but one must factor into this the need for the ongoing exchange of documentation and up-to-date medical reports.

In many cases, outstanding medical treatment is a feature that forms part and parcel of medical reports that must be furnished to ensure a timely settlement of the claim.

All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not required to have advanced driving skills but I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have introduced a five-level suite of CBD courses with each level specifically catering for a required knowledge-based skills set.  It involves a three-week course.  I am advised by the Garda Commissioner - and I believe this issue was mentioned in the course of his recent engagement with the committee - that 6,000 members are qualified to drive using blue lights and sirens having completed the standard driving course CBD level 2.  There are varying degrees of skills and the Garda authorities are anxious to ensure there is a greater level of the optional course available.  This is important in the context of the increased resourcing for the Garda fleet and the fact that over the current six-year period, a sum of &euro;46 million has been available for investment in that fleet.  If we are ensuring the Garda has a modern, up-to-date fleet of vehicles it is important that there would be appropriate driving skills.  The CBD courses at level 2 and higher are available and over the course of next year, there will be a greater level of concentration on this, with further development of this important skills training.<\/p> <p>  On the body cameras, I am keen that the Garda would adopt this new and advanced technology.

The first relates to an issue that arose on Question Time earlier.  A number of additional direct provision centres have been opened recently but it is difficult for people to travel from sites such as Moville, Kenmare and Lisdoonvarna to Dublin and back within a day.  Will the Minister elaborate on plans to relocate some of the facilities in Dublin to the centres?  In addition, are there plans to provide direct transport to services that cannot be moved such as an appeals tribunal hearing in Dublin, and will the Minister provide details on that?<\/p> <p>  Second, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland anticipates substantial time commitments for the Garda being transferred to other bodies, for example, the Courts Service in the case of the transportation of prisoners to court, as well as a number of other obligations.  Clearly that will create savings in time and money for the Garda but does this budget foresee any additional burdens on the Prison Service and the Courts Service arising from these organisations taking on responsibilities that were previously those of the Garda?<\/p> <p>  Third, a point that has been raised on a number of occasions by the National Women's Council of Ireland is the lack of contact centres for supervised access for family visitation and so forth.  Currently, there is funding from Tusla where there is a child protection issue, but where there is no such issue, there is no stream of funding or pilot scheme.<\/p><p>Some facilities and family resource centres have even done this off their own bat, but it means that where there is no child protection issue, it is very difficult for a judge in a family court to refer for supervised access in a contact centre of that kind.

Where there is not an issue, the option does not exist in practice unless they can finance it themselves, and these things are not cheap.

There are in the order of 60 new entrants into the system every week.  I am very keen to ensure the State will provide the essential necessities of board and lodgings and shelter.  In that regard, I acknowledge the need for improvements and can safely say there have been improvements in recent times.  I acknowledge the contributions of people such as Mr. Justice McMahon who I met last week.  His independent report contained over 150 recommendations, many of which have been implemented.  Some have been partially implemented but are in the course of being implemented fully.  I want to continue to try to ensure applicants will have their needs met.  I acknowledge the improvements that have taken place during the course of the year, for example, providing for the right to work in certain circumstances and access to the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children.  <\/p> <p>  I do not want to underestimate the extent of the challenge.  I do not have a huge suite of alternatives in providing housing or more orthodox accommodation, if that is what the Deputy wishes to advert to.  I have an issue as far as accommodation provision is concerned.  The Reception and Integration Agency will shortly advertise again for appropriate accommodation which will be required to be of a certain standard.  There are in excess of 600 people in direct provision accommodation who have granted permission to remain in the State and who, in the normal course of events, might think of leaving it but who are are choosing not to do so.

Obviously, there are people coming into the country who are moving into direct provision centres.  The numbers are going up because so few are coming out of the centres.

That is why 600 people who are free to walk out have nowhere else to go, apart from the street.

Is it the case that, for whatever reason, some subcontracting arrangement has been made in the securing of hotel accommodation across a number of hotel facilities that are not accommodation centres?

Centres were opened in Lisdoonvarna, County Clare; County Westmeath; Monasterevin, County Kildare; Abbeyleix, County Laois, Mallow, County Cork; and Kenmare, County Kerry.  New centres are being planned to open in Moville, Donegal, and Wicklow.<\/p> <p>  The hotels to which the Chairman referred, other than the ones mentioned, to my knowledge would involve a form of temporary and emergency accommodation.  I do not have any knowledge of the subcontracting arrangement to which he referred.  The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, has published calls for expressions of interest a number of times this year, having regard to the increased demands.  The response to such expressions involve a visit from members of the agency, and an assessment of all of the offers, the standards of accommodation and the ability to provide the type of services that are important in the areas of education, health and sports and recreation.  This is the manner of the challenge.  Having regard to the increase in numbers, I expect that there will be a further round of expressions of interest shortly.  There are minimum standards and they raise an element of local consultation, often with local public representatives.

Nobody can be under any doubt but that we have a massive problem in how our criminal justice system deals with sexual crime.  One need not be a genius to work that out, from the inconsistent sentencing and the traumatising of victims by putting them on trial to the pathetically low conviction rates, the broader cultural problems and so on.  We should take as a given that it is an appalling situation.<\/p><p>The prevention of sexual offences, at the least, is not as simple as long prison sentences.  It is far too complicated to be handled by what is deemed to be the bluntest instrument in the criminal justice arsenal, namely, mandatory or presumptive minimum sentences, to which I have a strong opposition based on evidence and on information that tells us as a society that they do not work and that while they might make a nice media headline to make it look like we are doing something to deal with these issues, none of the evidence supports that view.  <\/p><p>It was interesting that in our deliberations on child sex offenders and putting the sex offender risk assessment and management initiative on a statutory basis yesterday, we as a committee dealt with those issues sensitively in terms of our key goal and what it should be, which is protecting the public.  These matters can whip up a significant emotional response to sexual predators but, in fact, how society is to be protected is more complicated.  Sure enough, the headline on the front page of today's edition of the<i>Irish Daily Mail<\/i>is, &quot;Should parents be told where predators live?&quot;,  Although the article was not as bad, that was a frenzied headline.  It is about whipping up and inciting emotional responses and so on, and this measure is in the same vein.  It is an emotional response to a problem that will not address the problem that it seeks to identify and it uses an instrument that will be problematic.<\/p><p>I made some points on Second Stage that I will repeat.  In general, years of evidence show us that presumptive or mandatory minimum sentences for any crime are not an effective deterrent.  This is reflected in the fact that the Law Reform Commission report of 2013 on mandatory sentencing and the 2014 strategic review of penal policy made clear recommendations that no new presumptive sentencing schemes should be introduced.  Why do we commission these reports if we ignore what they say?  The strategic review of penal policy, in particular, was a cross-agency report which included victims' representative groups alongside agencies tasked with crime prevention, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and so on.  While deterrents might be an appealing concept in theory, which sounds good as a headline for the tabloid press, the empirical evidence to support the theory is not there.  In fact, there is evidence that sanctions in general provide some deterrent, but there is none to suggest that the more severe the penalty, the greater the deterrent than a less severe one.  That is a fact.  We are having a feel-good session to vent the legitimate horror of the public to these appalling crimes and to give the appearance that something is being done, but it will not do anything.  <\/p><p>We must bear in mind the issues with the Judicial Council Bill.  The Judiciary has cried out for years for sentencing guidelines but it is entirely wrong-headed to introduce mandatory minimums <i>ad hoc<\/i>in advance of that.  Sinn F&eacute;in did a deal with the Government over the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, and those sentencing guidelines will be given, but why are we doing this in advance of that?  Judicial guidelines are a different matter as they are carefully considered, data based and evidence driven.  They are far more effective and a useful tool for the Judiciary to decide appropriate sentencing.  There is a problem with judicial sentencing but it is addressed by the guidelines, not by a blunt instrument like this.  The problem with the Bill, in common with other presumptive minimum sentence legislation, is that it allows for judicial discretion in the handing-down of a sentence.  If the court is satisfied that it would be disproportionate to impose one of the minimum sentences laid out in the Bill, the court may deviate from it, but that begs the question as to what is the point of having the Bill at all, given that the judge may ignore it if he or she sees fit.  Why do we not allow the judge who is in possession of all the facts of the case make his or her decision on what sentence is appropriate, as is done now?  What is the point of this window dressing?  <\/p><p>Furthermore, the evidence tells us the judges will ignore this legislation because they ignored the last one.  The Criminal Justice Act 1999 introduced a ten-year mandatory minimum sentences for possession of drugs valued over &euro;13,000 but over the years, convictions under the mandatory minimum legislation attracted a ten-year sentence in less than 4% of all cases.  As Mr. Tom O'Malley said about minimum sentencing for drugs offences, &quot;One suspects ... that [this section] seldom impinges on day-to-day practice, save to the extent that courts will have regard to relevant previous convictions as a matter of course.&quot;<\/p><p>From my experience in respect of the Coroners (Amendment) Bill, I know what a torturous process it is to get the Department of Justice and Equality to deal with legislation.  The Judicial Council Bill, which is necessary and which might address some of the matters this Bill attempts to highlight, has been 20 years in the making and has been languishing in the Seanad since last November.  Prioritising this Bill, however, which will not have any effect on repeat offenders, deter anyone or have any effect on the actual sentences handed down for repeat sexual crime, is taking time away from Bills like the Judicial Council Bill that would make a difference.  It is terrible.<\/p><p>It is interesting that on Second Stage while talking about on repeat sex offenders the Minister did not once say the Bill would make them less likely to reoffend or that it would be a deterrent.  Rather, he stated:<\/p><blockquote>By putting these provisions in place the Government is recognising the impact of sexual offences, both on individual victims and on society as a whole.  It is ensuring that appropriate measures are available to the Judiciary at sentencing in order to ensure that these crimes can be dealt with both appropriately and effectively.<\/blockquote><p>With respect, members of the Judiciary already have measures available to them at sentencing to ensure the crimes are dealt with.  The Bill will not change that or give the Judiciary any new powers.  It will have exactly the same powers after this Bill is passed as it has now.  The civil servants clearly know this.  I do not get it.<\/p><p> These sections do not make sense.  The provisions are arbitrary, which is unbelievable.  They provide that if someone commits a sexual offence that carries a sentence of five years and then goes on to commit another sexual offence within ten years of conviction, a presumptive minimum sentence applies.  What if an offender rapes somebody ten years and five days after the first offence?  If all we are doing in this legislation is sending a signal, as the Minister of State said, what kind of signal does it send to a victim when we treat the violent assault she experienced less seriously than we would have treated it if it had happened ten days previously?  That is the import of this legislation.  What if we were talking about a child victim of sexual abuse whose abuser was convicted of abuse of another child 12 years previously?  According to the bizarre logic of this Bill, the abuse suffered by the current victim would be less serious than it would have been if the abuser had committed it when the victim was two years younger because in such circumstances, the abuse would have fallen within the scope of this Bill.  That is the reason we have judicial discretion and the reason it is preferred in these matters to the blunt instrument of legislation and the kind of arbitrary cut-off point we have here, which has no logic to it whatever.  It is crazy.<\/p><p> What message are we sending?  Let us be generous and imagine that the Bill is seeking to right the wrongs of the past when we saw shocking sentences handed down for the worst crimes.  I believe that is the motivation of the Minister in this scenario and that it is the effect of terrible wrongs done in the past when terrible sentences were handed down for very serious crimes.  However, in constructing a Bill which provides that the suspended proportions of the sentence are not counted in calculating the minimum for the second offence, the Minister is not fixing that problem either.  The message in this Bill to those who got away with a suspended or partly suspended sentence for a first offence because of what the Minister of State correctly described as the deep-seated problems in our judicial system in dealing with sexual crimes is that they will have the slate wiped clean.  Nothing is changing in that regard.  Thankfully, judicial discretion will still apply and the hope would be that a judge will bear this in mind when an offender who has committed an offence previously and got away with it lightly comes before the court.  The point is that this Bill will not fix that as it excludes such offenders from its provisions.  <\/p><p> We have to move away from a model of criminal justice legislation that is knee-jerk and emotional to one that is evidence led.  That is what we tried to do yesterday at the committee and we saw how the media misrepresented it to get a headline.  We all know that sex sells papers.  A system that hoovers up people and spits them out again and does not deal with the greater societal problems is not doing anybody a favour.  It is not doing society or the victims a favour and I believe it sends out a bad signal.  The signal I want to send out is that this legislation will not work, will not help, is not based on evidence and is a knee-jerk reaction, which is what we have to move away from.  That might be a difficult comment to make, and all the political parties may disagree with that, but it is right.<\/p><p> We are talking about caring for victims of sexual crime.  It was only recently that a second sexual abuse and violence, SAVI, report was sanctioned.  We have a huge problem with sexual violence in our society but the Government reduced the funding for the Rape Crisis Network by half.<\/p><p> The final point I will make is critical.  It was also made by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, in response to the Private Members' Bill that gave rise to this legislation.  The IPRT stated that \"mandatory sentencing regimes are proven to be ineffective in reducing crime, are extremely costly to the Exchequer, and divert resources and attention away from where they are most needed.\"  It also set out a number of tangible measures that could make a difference in respect of dealing with sexual violence in our society.  These were the restoration of funding to victim support services; investment in child protection services; investment in crime prevention, detection and prosecution; investment in prison treatment services and regimes; and well-resourced post-release supervision and monitoring in the community.  The Bill, which I am sure was well motivated, will not achieve anything and it would be wrong to put it on the Statute Book.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018112900002#M01500","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543501800,"counter":1570,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Wallace want to contribute?

We heard yesterday that recidivism in this area was much lower than we had thought.  In 2013, the Irish Prison Service conducted a study on re-offending which found that the offence groups with the lowest rates of re-offending were homicide, at 26.2%, followed by sexual offences, at 28.2%.  While it is obvious that the rate of re-offending would be low in cases of homicide, the re-offending rate for a sexual offender is also low compared with a crime like burglary where the re-offending rate stands at 79.5%.  We are concerned that this legislation is based more on anecdotal evidence than empirical evidence.  It is more likely fuelled by a crime reporting element in the media who whip up a frenzy at every chance they get.  We do not often make positive statements about the media but I want to read a short quote from an article written by Michael Clifford this week.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>... policy is supposed to be made on the basis of research and evidence which points towards a better way of doing things.  Among many politicians - and many elements of the media - research in this area is to be avoided in case it unearths inconvenient truths.<\/blockquote> <p>He was referring to this very subject.<\/p><p>I have asked some members of the legal profession what they think of mandatory sentencing and there is not much goodwill towards it.  When it was introduced about 20 years ago it was a knee-jerk reaction to a drug problem that was not resolved by this approach.  Instead, it helped to fill up the prisons and drive up the cost to the State of looking after people who had been carrying drugs of one form or another.  The Law Reform Commission has done some serious research on that issue and I want to highlight a couple of points it made in its report.  It noted the need to ensure that the provisions achieved their stated objectives and facilitated a reduction in crime.  They did not do so, however.  The report also stated that many of those coming before the courts were low-level drug users rather than high-level drug barons and that we end up throwing the foot soldiers in jail, rather than addressing the real problem.  It pointed out that the aims of deterrence, punishment and rehabilitation are not being met by this approach and that the principles of consistency and proportionality are being ignored by mandatory sentencing.<\/p><p>So-called experts or people who do research, and Mick Clifford touched on this in his article this week, are sometimes frowned upon but we ignore them at our peril.  Anyone who tuned in to yesterday's committee proceedings would have been incredibly impressed by the lady from Limerick University who has done a good deal of research in this area.<\/p><p>I certainly do not agree with the notion that we should ignore these people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018112900002#N00300","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543501800,"counter":1573,"content":"<p>I will open the discussion up to other members after the Minister of State has responded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018112900002#O00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1543501800,"counter":1574,"content":"<p>I note that Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace have indicated their opposition to sections 4 and 5.  The sections set out presumptive minimum sentences for repeat sex offenders and form the key provision of this Bill, as provided for by the House on Second Stage.  In opposing these sections the Deputies are essentially opposed to the core principle of the Bill.  These provisions will apply only in very limited circumstances where serial offences have been committed.  If an offender has been convicted of serial sex offences and received a sentence of at least five years and goes on to commit another within a further ten years, the presumptive minimum sentence will apply.  Many sex offenders manage their own release from prison through the Probation Service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and do not go on to commit further crime.  However, some do offend again and by putting in place these provisions, the Government recognises the impact of sexual offenders on individual victims and on society as a whole.  It ensures that appropriate measures are available for the Judiciary when sentencing, to ensure these crimes are dealt with efficiently and appropriately.<\/p> <p>  There are very few instances where a mandatory or minimum sentence is specified in legislation.  There is a mandatory sentence for murder, which is life imprisonment, and for a number of serious offences such as crimes involving drugs or firearms.  Using the minimum sentence is intended to reflect the impact on society as a whole.  These provisions have been proposed by the Government as a reflection of the impact of serious sexual offences on victims and to ensure the seriousness of these crimes is reflected in how judges can deal with them.  These laws address serious sex offences.  I have met victims and the purpose of bringing forward this legislation is based on the evidence put in front of me by these people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018112900002#O00300","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1543501800,"counter":1575,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is not the first Independent Member to have an interest in justice legislation but, unlike the others, he has a good chance of getting agreement in certain areas.  The substantive part of the legislation is about amending the Punishment of Incest Act 1908.  After the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act was enacted last year we had the anomalous position whereby men convicted of incest were subject to a term of imprisonment of life but this did not apply in respect of women.  Sections 2 and 3 of this Bill propose to harmonise that situation.  The inappropriate sentence of life imprisonment has been reduced to ten years and it applies to both men and women so there is equality in that regard.<\/p> <p>  We are discussing the points made by Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly against sections 4 and 5 of the Bill, which are the Minister's part of the legislation.  Sentencing is an extremely complicated area and politicians sometimes try to simplify it by introducing legislation.  A recent serious offence, the kind which the Minister wants to see dealt with vigorously, involved a woman, Leona O'Callaghan, who gave up her anonymity.  She was a complainant in a serious crime in which she was the victim of rape and the person accused was convicted of her rape.  That person was already serving a 15-year sentence for raping another girl and, when his sentencing came up, the judge was well aware of this.  The judge gave him a sentence of 17 years' imprisonment, which is very lengthy, but the Minister is proposing that the judge impose a sentence of at least ten years.  My concern is that, when judges have to impose ten years, they start at that level but a person convicted of rape, such as in the case of Ms O'Callaghan, deserve a very lengthy sentence.  Along with other people, I believe Ms O'Callaghan was satisfied with the sentence handed out to her rapist but she was concerned over another area of sentencing law to which we do not give consideration here, namely, that his sentences will not run consecutively but concurrently.<\/p> <p>  I agree with much of what Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace said to the effect that mandatory sentencing is very arbitrary.  It takes away the discretion of a court.  We all assume judges impose light sentences but they do not.  They have imposed many serious sentences for rape and other serious sexual offences in recent times and we have to stop the story getting out that the courts do not treat sexual offences seriously.  People get very lengthy sentences for rape and serious sexual offences.<\/p> <p>  We supported this legislation on Second Stage, though I did not have an opportunity to speak, and I will support it here, though I have some concerns.  It has been through the Office of the Attorney General, and that fact gives me some concern.  I have two issues.  We have to be very careful not to identify sex offenders as completely separate from other criminal offenders.  The Oireachtas asserts its disapproval of criminal activity through the sentences we say should apply.  Murder gets a mandatory life sentence but no other crime does.  If a person is convicted of murder and commits another serious offence afterwards, we would not contemplate forcing them to serve a life sentence.  The Oireachtas has decided that there should be a set period of imprisonment for some offences, as set out in the Schedule, with five years for some offences and ten for others, and that is how we set out our disapproval of certain actions.  We need to be careful about this.  The Minister could also be asked why these provisions do not also apply to all other serious offences.<\/p> <p>  We also need proper sentencing guidelines.  The guidelines, in the form of decisions of the criminal section of the Court of Appeal, are there to be looked at and convicts can have an understanding of what type of sentence they will get from the courts by looking at the thresholds set by the Court of Appeal.  However, we would benefit from the courts setting out sentencing guidelines in respect of these and other offences so that there is greater clarity.  No matter what guidelines we have, or what amount of harmonisation we aim for, there are always going to be different circumstances.  The victim will be different, as will the accused, and their circumstances will vary.  By bringing in mandatory sentencing we are taking away from the ability of the court to exercise its discretion.<\/p> <p>  I will not support the calls to repeal these sections but the points merit further consideration.  The way to do it is by enacting the Judicial Council Bill and getting the judicial guidelines up and running.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018112900002#O00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1543501800,"counter":1576,"content":"<p>I will take other members before Deputy Clare Daly because they have not had an opportunity to contribute.

I agree with much of what Deputy O'Callaghan outlined so I will be reasonably brief.<\/p> <p>  The first point I would like to make is about whether the Judiciary decides to follow legislation that contains provisions relating to minimum sentences.  I do not think that is a reason to oppose legislation.  It raises a question about the Judiciary choosing to ignore legislation that contains such provisions.  It does not raise a question as to whether there should be legislation of this sort.  That is part of a larger debate for another day.<\/p> <p>  I share many of the reservations about the bluntness or effectiveness of guidelines relating to minimum sentences.  Overall, the legislation is moving us in the right direction.  I agree with what the Minister is trying to do.  There is more benefit in going forward with it than in removing sections 4 and 5, which would effectively gut the legislation.<\/p> <p>  Essentially, when everything else is stripped out, what we have here is a difference in viewpoints that are genuinely held by different people about how to tackle something.  From what I understood from Deputy Clare Daly's contribution, I do not think she would be supportive of any type of guidelines regarding minimum sentences and would leave it all to a process of judicial decision based on general sentencing guidelines.  I worry about the impact on sentencing of these much called for and much wanted sentencing guidelines for the Judiciary.  The passing of legislation that provides for minimum sentences is one of the strongest sentencing guidelines the Judiciary could be given.  However, we are informed, on more than one occasion, that the Judiciary chooses to ignore such guidelines.  In that context, we could be faced here with a situation whereby a very nice set of sentencing guidelines are not followed.<\/p> <p>  I will support the Bill.  I will not be supporting the removal of sections 4 and 5.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018112900002#P00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1543501800,"counter":1578,"content":"<p>To respond to that last point, it has been shown elsewhere that, where guidelines are in place, it is not simply that the judges read them.  There is transparency and knowledge about the sentences being handed down across the board.  There is more information about sentencing.  Judges are better educated and better equipped as to what the standards are and what is expected of them.  There is more transparency in standards as to what are considered mitigating and aggravating factors.  That would be valuable.  I look forward to the Judicial Council Bill proceeding to Committee Stage in the Seanad in the near future.  I think it will bring about a significant change in sentencing policy that is measured and that will make a real difference.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the provisions that are specifically opposed, I take on board many of the points that Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly made.  I do not support mandatory minimums.  I would draw a distinction for presumptive minimums because it preserves an element of judicial discretion that I think is important.  Judges have exercised that discretion in areas in which presumptive minimums exist.<\/p> <p>  On the face of it, and in the abstract, what has been outlined here seems a relatively fair approach to sentencing.  When somebody who commits a serious offence within a reasonable amount of time of committing another relevant offence that is also quite serious - making him or her a repeat offender - the kind of approach that is outlined is very often the approach that a judge would take.  Having said that, there are points that have been made which I will consider.  I will not oppose the sections at this point, but I will keep an open mind as matters progress.<\/p> <p>  I am very wary of mandatory minimum sentences.  Presumptive minimum sentences are somewhat different.  It takes two or three readings of the formula outlined here in order to properly understand exactly what is proposed.  Time will tell what effect that will have, but we will certainly have to keep an eye on it.<\/p> <p>  The most significant reservation I have is one that I would like the views of both Minister of State and the Minister for Justice and Equality on, and perhaps there will be an opportunity for that on Report Stage.  Where there is a clear indication for what the sentence for a second offence might be, there is a disincentive for the accused to plead guilty.  I am slightly concerned at that because if the prospective sentence for the second offence is already relatively clear, it seems possible that an accused's lawyers will suggest there is no point in pleading guilty.  If a guilty plea is not entered, that means the complainant will potentially be brought through a court process, and the trauma involved, that would otherwise be avoided.<\/p> <p>  I will not be opposing the section at this point, but I would like the Minister and the Minister of State to address the point I have made.  I will keep an open mind until Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018112900002#P00300","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1543501800,"counter":1579,"content":"<p>There are a lot of points to which to respond.  The first is that I feel my contribution and that of Deputy Wallace are very much in defence of the Judiciary in some ways.  I think Deputy O'Callaghan's example showed very clearly that judges are more than capable of taking previous crimes into consideration when they are giving their sentencing decisions.  Although there have been some appalling judgments given in cases of sexual offences and other instances, Deputy O'Callaghan's point that things are slowly beginning to change is fair.  It is absolutely not happening quickly enough.  We know that rape is the least likely of all violent crimes to go to trial.  Some 85% of alleged rapes go unpunished.  The figures suggest that for every 100 women who allege they have been raped and who get to trial, only eight will get to see a judgment in their favour.<\/p> <p>  There are major problems.  Deputy Brophy stated that there is a complete difference between mandatory minimum sentencing and judicial guidelines.  Judicial guidelines are a process of research, evidence-based education of judges and all interested groups.  They have been proven to be incredibly effective in guiding judges in sentencing.  Time would be better spent on this area, which is evidence based and worthy, and the Judicial Council Bill, which would deal with rogue judges who come out with some wacky, appalling and awful judgments, although they are a minority, but there is nothing we can do now without that Bill.  Instead of the Department dealing with those issues which would achieve what the Minister wants to achieve, it has been spending time on this, which the Minister acknowledged will apply in very limited circumstances - I might even say probably none.<\/p> <p>  On that basis, one could ask why are we bothering to oppose it, if we believe it is going to have no impact.  I do not believe it will be applied, to be honest, but I think we have a responsibility to challenge it because it should not be on the Statute Book on that basis.  The reason I say it does not even do what it says on the tin is because the Bill specifically states that if a judge feels it is disproportionate to impose one of these presumptive minimum sentences, he or she can do what he or she likes.  Judges can do what they like now as well so nothing is changing.<\/p> <p>  I would like to see the logic of this formula.  I want to talk through what we are talking about here.  We are not only talking about rape and so on.  I appreciate that rape is not the only crime involved and that sexual assault, child sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault and incest are all covered too.  However, the Bill only deals with crimes that attract sentences of five years or more.<\/p><p>If a person committed an offence but received a sentence of less than five years - the offence could have been bad, given the sentencing in sexual offences cases - that person will not fall within the remit of the Bill.  They will be out of the equation to begin with.  I would like that logic to be explained to me.  The Bill states that where someone was convicted on indictment of an offence specified in the Schedule - rape, sexual assault, child sexual abuse and so on - and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least five years, the Bill will not apply.  If that person is subsequently convicted of another scheduled offence committed within ten years of the first conviction, a presumptive minimum sentence will apply to the second conviction.  The sentence for the second offence has to be at least three quarters of the maximum sentence that can be imposed for it.  If the maximum term is life imprisonment, the minimum sentence should be at least ten years.  The Bill states any suspended portion of a sentence will not apply.  If a person was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of seven years for an offence, three of which were suspended, and commits another offence, they will not fall within the remit of the Bill, as they will have only served four years of the sentence.  The matter is complicated.  Sentence lengths and the reasoning are arbitrary and I have not heard a reason for it.  It is unworkable.  If I was a judge trying to calculate the formulas, I would just do what I would anyway.  I would look at it and say the person did something before and should not get away with it this time and increase the sentence.  What are we doing?  I support the bits about incest, which are fine and on which we all agree.  The matter was supposed to have been cleared up earlier, but these bits should not have been added.  I know that the Minister of State is sincere in his motivation, but we should not be engaging in this process.  It is completely wrong.  <\/p><p> It is not me who is going on about mandatory sentencing but the Law Reform Commission in the strategic review of penal policy.  Every organisation that has looked at this issue has stated we should be moving away from specifying it in legislation.  We should give judges discretion in dealing with all of the nuances in addressing these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018112900002#P00400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543501800,"counter":1581,"content":"<p>I will make a number of points.

I am not sure drawing up legislation which appears to be at odds with much of the empirical data and the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and the Department of Justice and Equality is the route we should be going down, as legislators.  I have often heard the Government tell us that the courts are independent in carrying out their functions and that sentencing in individual cases is a matter for the Judiciary.  Why would we impose presumptive minimum sentences in sexual offences cases?  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan made a brilliant case for our argument, but the confidence and supply agreement does not allow him to vote with us.  He is in the courts on a regular basis and knows what is going on.
