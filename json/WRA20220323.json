In Budget 2020, in light of the challenges arising from Brexit uncertainty facing the industry, the marginal rate of compensation at prices over &euro;1.32 (VAT inclusive) was doubled up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre.

Examples of key recent developments include:  <\/p>  <p>  - Budget 2022 incorporated a range of measures to support citizens with the rising cost of living.  These measures included increases to weekly social welfare payments, targeted measures with increases in the living alone allowance and the qualified child increase and a &euro;5 increase in the weekly rate of fuel allowance, with that increase implemented immediately in October.  The weekly income threshold for Fuel Allowance was also increased by &euro;20 which enables more people to qualify for this support.<\/p>  <p>  - Further measures were recently announced to help mitigate the effects of rising energy costs.  As part of these measures an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment.  This lump sum payment, in addition to the Budget increase, will mean low-income households will see an increase of 41% this fuel allowance season when compared to last season. <\/p>  <p>  - This year, 58% (&euro;203 million) of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million will be spent on dedicated energy poverty retrofit supports and local authority retrofits.

In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year.

The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 11 March 2022, almost 311,000 premises have been surveyed or have survey underway, with over 157,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties. NBI has also advised that premises are connected in 16 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow and almost 60,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 22 counties.  In County Westmeath pre-works are underway in the Deployment Areas of Athlone and Delvin and main works are underway in the Deployment Area of Mullingar, with almost 6,000 premises under construction and over 1,000 premises now available to pre-order.  I am advised by NBI that it expects the premises referred to in the Question to be passed and available for connection in H1, 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Westmeath through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.  <\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 11 March 2022, 523 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Westmeath 6 BCPs have been installed to date including Clonkill Hurling Club, which is approximately 5.5km from the premises referred to.

The Deputy may be aware that work on the latest NTA Review of the national maximum fare is well underway, and fuel costs are a major contributor in considering fare increases.  The objective of the Review is to determine whether changes need to be made to the current level of maximum fares in response to market changes facing the taxi industry as well as changes in annual taxi operating costs.  The NTA has confirmed that it is endeavouring to conclude the review process as quickly as possible in 2022 whilst still ensuring that all steps, including a consultation process, are appropriately completed. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the rising cost of fuel, the Government announced on March 9th last, a temporary reduction in the excise duties charged on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil.

Taxi drivers are eligible for double the normal grant when they scrap an older, more polluting or high mileage vehicle and make the switch to electric. By scrapping and switching, up to &euro;20,000 can be available for a new, fully electric SPSV and if the taxi is a wheelchair-accessible electric vehicle, the supports rise to &euro;25,000.  A driver can apply to combine both the eSPSV grant scheme and the WAV grant scheme up to a maximum of &euro;32,500.<\/p>  <p>  The take-up rate for this Scheme was exceptionally high in 2021: almost 600 drivers successfully applied for grants, with over &euro;11 million paid out as well as &euro;4 million in provisional grant offers.

In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were on employment supports on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times.  If a mortgage applicant has any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application they should in the first instance contact their lender directly.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are also general consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit to consumers.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a Central Bank regulated mortgage lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  <\/p>  <p>  The CMCAR further provides that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on regulated lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code states that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved and provide these reasons on paper if requested.  <\/p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender and it is not possible for me to give instructions to lenders on such matters.  However, if a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with the way a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for a mortgage or the drawn down of a mortgage, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, they can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300073#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":125,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300073#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[15180\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300073#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has engaged a company (details supplied) in respect of the services it provides from 2011 to date in 2022;

Where previously, bodies had to be explicitly listed in the legislation for FOI to apply to them, in the updated legislation, any entity that meets a broad set of criteria is subject to FOI by default.  At present, approximately 600 diverse organisations are subject to FOI, across the civil and public sector. The criteria are generally concerned with governance and control of the entity.  <\/p>  <p>  However, it is important to be clear of the full extent of the reach of FOI.  Often what is referred to as \"state funding\" of an organisation in fact comprises of remuneration for services provided to a state body.  Where this is the case, the FOI legislation provides for access to records, even where they may be physically held by a private company or body, where they relate to a service to provided to a public sector body that is subject to FOI.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the reach of the FOI legislation as it is presently structured is comprehensive in terms of state entities, and the legislation can in appropriate cases go beyond this in order to ensure that functions performed by state entities cannot be \"contracted out\" so as to avoid FOI.  In this context, there are at present no specific plans to expand the already broad scope of the FOI legislation.<\/p>  <p>  However, I have initiated a review of the FOI legislation and related issues which is ongoing in my Department.  An initial public consultation took place in late 2021, with almost 1,200 submissions from all sectors.  A document setting out the key themes identified by this process will be published in the coming weeks, which will be followed by a further chance for all interested stakeholders to have their say.<\/p>  <p>  The review will provide an opportunity to plot a course for FOI policy as well as in general \"doing transparency\" more effectively and in a manner that is fit for today's world and workplace.

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.<\/p>  <p>  The Department additionally consults with school patron bodies in order to identify areas with pressures on enrolments.<\/p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through:<\/p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the  capacity of a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to ongoing demographic analyses, the Department continues to liaise with Local Authorities in respect of potential longer-term requirements for educational provision across the country, through the review of the County Development Plans, preparation of Local Area Plans and other relevant statutory planning processes.<\/p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required. The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage as well as language of instruction, i.e. Irish or English, of new schools. Parental preferences, as well as other considerations such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area (including Irish-medium provision), are key to the decision-making process and to whether at post-primary level a school would take the form of an Irish-medium Gaelchol&aacute;iste or whether, if English-medium, the school would include an Irish-medium unit or &ldquo;Aonad&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Most new post-primary schools must have a student enrolment capacity of 600 &ndash; 1,000 students.

These grants may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities.<\/p>  <p>My Department has also ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, www.spu.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency and they are based on solid energy research projects. Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance than required by the current Building Regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging.<\/p>  <p>  All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements. Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website www.energyineducation.ie, which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).<\/p>  <p>  In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools needs so as to reduce energy costs and carbon and not just applied for the sake of having renewables. It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications. This has been assisted in previous years with the wall and attic insulation programme and the water conservation programme.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach.<\/p>  <p>  This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.  <\/p>  <p>  The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan. <\/p>  <p>  The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme.<\/p>  <p>The Energy in Education website portal and advice programme (Joint programme between SEAI and Dept. of  Education) also assists schools reduce their energy consumption and empowers participating schools and pupils to learn the benefits of sustainability. www.energyineducation.ie.

However, following the onset of the pandemic, the CSO&rsquo;s &lsquo;COVID-19 adjusted&rsquo; monthly youth unemployment rate &ndash; which included all those in receipt of the PUP &ndash; increased dramatically, peaking at almost 70 percent in May 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Following the phased reopening of the economy over the latter half of 2021, most young people closed their PUP claims and returned to work, with the CSO estimating that there were approximately 307,000 young people in employment by Q4 2021 &ndash; significantly more than before the pandemic. This recovery resulted in a sharp downward trend in youth unemployment rates.<\/p>  <p>  While a slight increase was observed in the &lsquo;COVID-19 adjusted&rsquo; measure of youth unemployment in December and January following the temporary reintroduction of public health restrictions, it has since begun to fall again. February figures indicate the standard youth unemployment rate is 11.1 percent and the &lsquo;COVID-19 adjusted&rsquo; measure is 12.7 percent.  This will continue to be monitored closely.<\/p>  <p>  While it is welcome that the youth unemployment rate has reduced and returned to pre-pandemic levels, it is critical to continue to minimise potential scarring effects amongst young people who permanently lost their jobs during the pandemic, and to support young people who face difficulties or higher barriers to entry to the labour market.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, my Department has a series of targeted employment supports under Pathways to Work 2021-2025, the Government&rsquo;s employment services strategy. These include expanding the JobsPlus scheme and enhancing the incentive to recruit young jobseekers by increasing the youth age limit from 25 to 30 years, and ring-fencing places on the Work Placement Experience Programme, Community Employment and T&uacute;s schemes for eligible young people.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the Further Education and Training sector to provide access to training, upskilling and reskilling opportunities. These are likely to be of particular relevance to young people seeking to enter the labour market for the first time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300078#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions","counter":366,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300078#WRH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[15379\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300078#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the extent to which she expects to be in a position to address the pensions issue for persons that have gaps in their contribution record for any reason with a view to ensuring the availability of a payment including pro-rata payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":368,"content":"<p>The State Pension (Contributory) is a PRSI-based pension, financed by contributions made by current workers and their employers, and paid to pensioners, at a rate based upon their PRSI record when working.  A person is required to have a minimum of 520 paid reckonable PRSI contributions in order to qualify for the State Pension (Contributory).  As the actuarial value of the State Pension is currently estimated at approximately &euro;380,000, it is reasonable to require people claiming a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years of paid contributions over the term of their working life. <\/p>  <p>  Where a person enters the social insurance system over the age of 56 they will not be able to make sufficient social insurance contributions to be awarded a State Pension (Contributory) on reaching 66 years of age because it has a minimum contribution requirement of 520 contributions (i.e. 10 years).  In such cases a level of social insurance refund may be applicable.<\/p>  <p>  Subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State Pension (Contributory) also being satisfied, the State pension system already provides significant recognition to those whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, often to raise families or in a full-time caring role.<\/p>  <p>  This is provided through the award of credits and\/or the application of the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme (under the Yearly Average method for payment calculation) and\/or the application of HomeCaring Periods (under the Aggregated Contribution Method, also known as the interim Total Contributions Approach). <\/p>  <p>  Details of these are &ndash; <\/p>  <p>  - Credits &ndash; PRSI Credits are awarded to recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit) where they have an underlying entitlement to credits.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid Carer&rsquo;s Leave from work.<\/p>  <p>  - The Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme - The scheme, which was introduced with effect from 1994, is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for State Pension (Contributory).  The Scheme, which allows periods caring for children or people with a caring need to be disregarded (from 1994), can have the effect of increasing a person's Yearly Average.<\/p>  <p>  - HomeCaring Periods &ndash; HomeCaring Periods may be awarded for each week not already covered by a paid or credited social insurance contribution (regardless of when they occurred) to a maximum of 20 years.  HomeCaring Periods can only be used under the Aggregated Contribution Method (also known as the Interim Total Contributions Approach) of pension calculation. <\/p>  <p>  Since April 2019, all new State (Contributory) Pension applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Yearly Average and the interim Total Contributions Approach, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.  The elements which make up each method are set out in legislation. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that if a person does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for State Pension (Contributory), s\/he may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) is paid, generally, where a pensioner has an adult dependent (e.g. a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant who is financially dependent upon him\/her), who does not have enough contributions to claim a maximum rate State Pension (Contributory) in his\/her own right. The payment rate for the IQA is up to 90% of a full contributory pension.  The most advantageous payment for a pensioner will depend upon their individual circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment.  The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  Once it completed its work and fulfilled its obligations, the Commission was dissolved.  The Commission's Report was published on 7th October 2021.  The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers and submissions made to the Pensions Commission are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.   <\/p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.  It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard - including the full transition to a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) model, phasing out of the Yearly Average approach, allowing a person to continue paying PRSI contributions past State Pension Age to improve their social insurance record for State Pension (Contributory) purposes and measures to enhance pension provision for long-term carers (in excess of 20 years). <\/p>  <p>  The Government agreed in October 2021 that the Commission&rsquo;s report and recommendations would be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and also to the Commission on Taxation and Welfare for its views.  The Committee published its views on the 2nd February 2022 and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare submitted its comments on the PRSI related recommendations at the end of February.  The various views will be considered carefully as part of the Government&rsquo;s deliberations over the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials are currently examining each of the recommendations and are consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions on any specific recommendation.  In this regard, I intend to bring a holistic recommended response and implementation plan to Government in April.  <\/p>  <p>  As the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland, the State Pension is very effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300078#WRH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments","counter":369,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300078#WRH01700"},{"type":"question","counter":370,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[15380\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300078#WRH01800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the extent to which waiting times for payments in respect of means-tested applications compare with contribution related payments; the extent of progress in reducing waiting times for means-tested payments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":371,"content":"<p>The following means test based schemes are assessed in terms of operational performance:<\/p><p>- State Pension (Non-Contributory)<\/p><p>- Jobseeker's Allowance<\/p><p>- One-Parent Family Payment<\/p><p>- Supplementary Welfare Allowance Total<\/p><p>- Carer's Allowance<\/p><p>- Disability Allowance<\/p><p>- Household Benefits<\/p><p>The following schemes which are based on PRSI contributions are also assessed:<\/p><p>- State Pension (Contributory)<\/p><p>- Widow(er)'s Contributory Pension<\/p><p>- Jobseeker's Benefit<\/p><p>- Maternity Benefit<\/p><p>- Paternity Benefit<\/p><p>- Invalidity Pension<\/p><p>- Illness Benefit<\/p><p>- Occupational Injury Benefit <\/p><p>The attached tabular statement below outlines the agreed target and metric for each scheme, along with the average targets achieved in February 2022.

They are officers with the power to make a decision on a social welfare claim made under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.<\/p>  <p>  In order to make a decision in respect of Illness Benefit, the Deciding Officer takes a number of different factors into consideration, including legislation, information provided by the customer, their GP's opinion, and the opinion of the Department's Medical Assessor.  Illness Benefit is a scheme designed to provide support to those who cannot attend work in the short term due to illness. <\/p>  <p>  To qualify for a payment under the terms of the Illness Benefit scheme a person must be under pensionable age, satisfy prescribed PRSI conditions and be certified by a doctor as being incapable of attending work due to illness.<\/p>  <p>  Based on the type of incapacity submitted by their doctor and the duration of the claim, claims in payment may be selected for review to determine continued entitlement to an Illness Benefit payment. In such cases the following process applies:<\/p>  <p>  A form issues to the customer asking them to provide an update on their condition\/circumstances by way of a self-assessment. Upon receipt, the Deciding Officer may decide that continued payment is warranted or to refer the case to one of the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors for their consideration<\/p>  <p>  If a case is referred to a Medical Assessor a medical report form issues to the customer&rsquo;s doctor for completion. The Medical Assessor considers the form completed by the customer&rsquo;s doctor and may decide to carry out a further medical review either by way of a telephone assessment or an in person assessment with the customer.<\/p>  <p>  If the Medical Assessor's opinion is that the customer should be capable of work, Illness Benefit Section provides the customer with a further opportunity to forward additional evidence\/observations on the findings of the Medical Assessor. <\/p>  <p>  The Deciding Officer considers all of this information when making a final decision. The customer, if they are not satisfied, can appeal the decision of the Deciding Officer. <\/p>  <p>  I trust the above clarifies the position for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300078#WRH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":385,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[15385\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300078#WRH03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when assessing if a person is permanently incapable of work for the purpose of an application for invalidity pension, if due regard is had for the age, experience and qualifications of the applicant when making a final decision; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":386,"content":"<p>Invalidity Pension (IP) is a payment for people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and for no other reason and who satisfy the pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions. <\/p><p>A person is regarded as being permanently incapable of work if;<\/p><p>For the period of 1 year immediately before the date of application the person had been continuously incapable of work and a Deciding Officer (DO) or an Appeals Officer (AO) is satisfied that the person is likely to continue to be incapable of work for at least another year,<\/p><p>OR<\/p><p>A Deciding Officer (DO) or an Appeals Officer (AO) is satisfied that the likelihood is that the person will be incapable of work for life.<\/p><p>When making a decision Deciding Officers are bound by the Social Welfare Acts and Regulations.

This report stated that there were 449,442 recipients of the State Pension (Contributory) at the end of 2020, a rise of 18,218 (or 4.2%) compared to the previous year.  It also showed an increase of 152,447 (51.3%) in State Pension (Contributory) recipients in the 9 years since 2011.  Please see the table below for more information on the number of State Pension (Contributory) recipients and beneficiaries for 2011 to 2020.<\/p><p>The number of State Pension (Contributory) recipients continued to increase during 2021.  My Department&rsquo;s administrative records indicate that there were 468,734 recipients at the end of 2021.  It is clear from my Department&rsquo;s statistics and records that the number of State Pension (Contributory) recipients has increased significantly over the past decade.  <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s report was published on the 7th October 2021.The Commission&rsquo;s Report established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed. It set out a wide range of recommendations including enhanced pension provision for long-term carers, gradual increases to the State Pension Age, aligning retirement ages in employment contracts with the State Pension Age, PRSI base broadening measures, and allowing a person to continue paying PRSI contributions past State Pension Age to improve their social insurance record for State Pension (Contributory) purposes.<\/p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.  The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers, infographics and submissions made to the Pensions Commission are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.<\/p><p>The Commission carefully considered the scale of the fiscal sustainability challenge facing the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, based on analysis from a range of sources, including the Department of Finance and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, demographic projections from the Central Statistics Office, and material from the Commission&rsquo;s public consultation process.  KPMG updated the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund (published in 2017) in order to have up-to-date projections of shortfalls in the Social Insurance Fund. <\/p><p>The Commission and its Technical Sub-Committee analyses indicate that:<\/p><p>- The number of working age people is projected to increase by 9% from 2021 to 2051 &ndash; increasing from 3,243,500 to 3,549,700. The number of people aged 65+ is projected to double from 2021 to 2051 &ndash; from 743,100 to 1,562,500 (CSO).  Demographic projections show that the coming decades will be marked by a transition towards a much older population structure.  Accordingly, Ireland&rsquo;s population is ageing.  <\/p><p>- Thankfully, people are living for longer and are healthier than previous generations.  A man aged 65 has a life expectancy of 18.3 years, while a woman aged 65 has a life expectancy of 21 years (CSO figures for 2016).  Life expectancy has increased by approximately 5 years in the last two decades and is expected to increase by a further 3 years in the next two decades to 21.9 years for a man aged 65 and 24 years for a woman aged 65 by 2041.  This shows that the duration of State Pension payments has been increasing steadily over time and is projected to increase further.<\/p><p>- The ratio of the working age population to the older population is also projected to change.  In 1991, there were 5 working age people for every pensioner.  At the moment, this ratio is about 4.5 working age people to every pensioner.  By 2031, this is projected to fall to 3.5 working age people to every pensioner and by 2051, to 2.3 working age people to every pensioner.  The projections show that there will be a relatively smaller proportion of working age people in the coming decades financing State Pension payments for an increasing number of pensioners.<\/p><p>These projected demographic changes indicate significant increases in the number of future State Pension (Contributory) recipients which will impact on State Pension related expenditure.  Analysis carried out by KPMG for the Pensions Commission projected that, on a no policy change basis, the Social Insurance Fund will have an annual deficit of &euro;2.3 billion by 2030.  This will increase to reach &euro;13.4 billion annually by 2050 and &euro;21.1 billion by 2071.  KPMG also found that by 2045, expenditure on the State Pension (Contributory) alone will exceed projected Social Insurance Fund income. <\/p><p>In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, this Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  The views of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare will be considered as part of the Government&rsquo;s deliberations over the coming weeks.  My officials are also examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions on any recommendations.  I will be bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government in April. <\/p><p>It would be a strategic risk not to plan and provide for projected demographic changes, not least in terms of income adequacy for older people.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is very effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300078#WRH04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":404,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[15391\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300079#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the total number of persons currently in receipt of the State (non-contributory) pension;

To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government announced a package of measures in February, which will have a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country.

This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during the lifetime of the NDP as follows:<\/p>  <p>  (1) Modernisation: Much of the existing early learning and childcare infrastructure that was previously delivered by large scale capital programmes is now in need of upgrading and modernisation in order to be fully compliant with new regulations and more recent guidelines, as well as to maximise energy efficiency. This investment will prioritise follow-up funding for buildings that were funded through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP), with funding also available for previously non-funded infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  (2) New Capacity: Ireland is approaching the limits of capacity, with shortfalls for early learning and childcare places already evident in some areas and for some cohorts. The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase.<\/p>  <p>  In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.<\/p>  <p>  (3) First 5 Initiatives: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future. First 5 envisages a range of innovative initiatives for the early learning and childcare sector, including piloting Family and Early Childhood Centres and piloting outdoor early learning and childcare provision, piloting meal provision. Each of these initiatives have capital requirements.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, access to affordable early learning and childcare is inherently linked to creating an equitable society, sustainable communities and a thriving economy. Early learning and childcare provision is therefore considered under the National Development Plan, along with housing, schools and health facilities as an integral part of national infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  Further information on the Department&rsquo;s NDP allocation and the application process will be communicated to the sector in the near future.

","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":526,"content":"<p>The Nursing Home Support Scheme (NHSS), commonly referred to as 'Fair Deal', is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care. The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Accordingly, the NTPF does not discuss publicly the details of negotiations with individual nursing homes. Neither Ministers nor the Department have a role in individual price negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also provided significant specific supports to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, was established as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. &euro;134.5 million was made available under the scheme from March 2020 to June 2021. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing. <\/p>  <p>  The Department published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. This review was conducted by the NTPF with input from stakeholders and external experts. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system. These are now being taken forward by the Department and NTPF. Given the size and scope of the NHSS, which is expected to cost the State more than &euro;1.04 billion this year, any changes must be delivered carefully and with due consideration to their impact and any unexpected consequences.<\/p>  <p>  The department is also taking forward the 9 recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs, which was published in December 2021. The purpose of the VFM Review was to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private\/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300081#WRL02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":527,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300081#WRL02800"},{"type":"question","counter":528,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[15131\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300081#WRL02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there have been additional resources allocated to the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS,, to help deal with the sharp increase in referrals to the service in Galway, especially in children being referred for ADHD; if there are plans for additional resources for complementary treatments for ADHD other than medicinal treatment to be allocated to CAMHS such as psychotherapy and behavioural therapy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":529,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300081#WRL03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disease Management","counter":530,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300081#WRL03100"},{"type":"question","counter":531,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[15163\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300081#WRL03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to implement a specialised unit facility that will have a multi-disciplinary team to deal with Huntington&rsquo;s disease in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":532,"content":"<p>As this question is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300081#WRL03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Claims Agency","counter":533,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300081#WRL03400"},{"type":"question","counter":534,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[15167\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300081#WRL03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 457 of 21 February 2022, the breakdown of values across each of the years since 2003; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":535,"content":"<p>The State Claims Agency (SCA) has a statutory remit to manage personal injury claims on behalf of Delegated State Authorities including the Health Service Executive.

We are working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.<\/p>  <p>  Recent developments in relation to general practice, in particular the 2019 Agreement on Contractual Reform and Service Development, have helped to re-establish general practice in Ireland as an attractive career choice.  The additional investment, which will amount to &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented, provides for an increase in capitation fees, improved maternity and paternity arrangements as well as enhanced supports for rural practices. In addition, targeted funding of &euro;2 million will also be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas.<\/p>  <p>  Several efforts to increase the number of practising GPs have been undertaken in recent years. The number of entrants to GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, with further increases planned. Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible\/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the 2019 GP Agreement includes a commitment to undertake a strategic review of GP services within the lifetime of the Agreement, to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee to consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to: <\/p>  <p>  - girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and <\/p>  <p>  - women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.<\/p>  <p>  If NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300083#WRN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cannabis for Medicinal Use","counter":602,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300083#WRN00800"},{"type":"question","counter":603,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[15393\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300083#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the date on which the Medical Cannabis Access Programme clinical review will take place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1565","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":604,"content":"<p>At the end of 2021, the Department commenced preparatory work on a review of clinical data that supports the prescribing of cannabis products for conditions that would be included in the Medical Cannabis Access Programme.

Aid Measure (BEAM) was to provide temporary exceptional adjustment aid to farmers in the beef sector in Ireland. The scheme was subject to the conditions set out in EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019\/1132. BEAM was funded by a combination of &euro;50 million EU exceptional aid and &euro;27.8 million Exchequer support and was provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers had been facing as a result of market volatility and uncertainty in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Under the scheme, aid was paid on adult cattle slaughtered between 24 September 2018 and 12 May 2019, at a rate of &euro;100 per animal subject to a maximum of 100 finished animals per herd.  Aid was also paid on suckler cows that calved in 2018, at a rate of &euro;40 per animal subject to a maximum of 40 sucklers per herd. <\/p>  <p>Applications for BEAM were accepted from the 19 August 2019 with the deadline for applications extended to midnight on 20   September 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Payments under BEAM commenced in December 2019. Payments totalling &euro;77.86m issued to 33,478 participants under the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  One of the conditions under which funding was granted by the EU was that there had to be an element of re-structuring built into the scheme as set out in Article 1 (3) of EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019\/1132. Accordingly, in applying for BEAM, participants agreed to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on their holding by 5% for the period 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021 as compared with the period 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019. There was also a significant cohort of eligible farmers that chose not to apply to the scheme, on the basis they did not want to comply with the conditions. <\/p>  <p>  Following engagement with the EU Commission regarding flexibility around the deadline for meeting the 5% reduction, I introduced an option for farmers to choose an alternative reduction period of 1 January 2021 - 31 December 2021. This was to give farmers every chance of meeting the requirements of the scheme. Some 16,000 farmers opted for this deferred reduction period before applications for deferment closed on 21 June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2021, following the ending of the original reduction period on 30 June 2021, it was identified that some 19,000 participants had met the scheme commitments set out in section 7.0 of the BEAM Terms and Conditions and thus exited the scheme successfully without recoupment.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 5,300 of the 16,000 who opted to defer subsequently met all their BEAM commitments within the allotted timeframe, including the 5% bovine nitrates reduction in the original reduction period.  My Department therefore, removed them from the later reduction period.<\/p>  <p>  A further 3,627 participants who had not opted to defer did not meet some or all of the scheme commitments set out in section 7.0 of the BEAM Terms and Conditions. The total value of these overpayments was &euro;5,277,820 with &euro;3,377,804.80 returning to the EU and &euro;1,900,015.20 returning to the Exchequer in line with the ratio under which they were initially paid. <\/p>  <p>  A total of 234 of the 3,627 participants recorded a Nitrates reduction of between 4% and 5% which resulted in between a 20% and 80% recoupment as provided for the in the scheme Terms and Conditions. The total value of these partial recoupments was &euro;168,560.<\/p>  <p>  This left approximately 10,300 BEAM participants in the deferred reduction period.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2022, following the ending of the deferred reduction period on 31 December 2021, it was identified just over 2,800 had met their scheme commitments set out in section 7.0 of the BEAM Terms and Conditions and they exited the scheme successfully. <\/p>  <p>  This left 7,470 participants who did not meet some or all of the scheme commitments necessary to avoid a recoupment of some or all of their payments under the scheme. The total value of these recoupments was &euro;12,596,536 with &euro;8,061,783.04 returning to the EU and &euro;4,534,752.96 returning to the Exchequer in line with the ratio under which they were initially paid. <\/p>  <p>  282 of the 7,470  participants recorded a Nitrates reduction of between 4% and 5% which resulted in between an 20% and 80% recoupment as provided for the in the scheme Terms and Conditions. The total value of these partial recoupments was &euro;287,976.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, almost 22,000 of the 33,000 in the BEAM scheme have met the scheme commitments and they exited the scheme successfully. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300084#WRO05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":696,"content":"<p>Question No. 229 answered with Question No. 228.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":697,"content":"<p>Question No. 230 answered with Question No. 228.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":699,"content":"<p>Question No. 231 answered with Question No. 228.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":700,"content":"<p>Question No. 232 answered with Question No. 228.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":701,"content":"<p>Question No. 233 answered with Question No. 228.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":702,"content":"<p>Question No. 234 answered with Question No. 228.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":703,"content":"<p>Question No. 235 answered with Question No. 228.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":704,"content":"<p>Question No. 236 answered with Question No. 228.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":705,"content":"<p>Question No. 237 answered with Question No. 228.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nitrates Usage","counter":706,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300085#WRP00900"},{"type":"question","counter":707,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[15492\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022032300085#WRP01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 1999, 2000 and 2001 of 19 January 2022, if the information regarding chemical fertiliser provided for the years 2014 to 2021 will be provided per month for each individual year in tabular form; if he will confirm the quantity of chemical fertiliser produced within the State in each of the years 2014 to 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":708,"content":"<p>The table below sets out imports of chemical fertiliser per tonne by month for the years 2014 to 2021 (Source CSO Statistics). <\/p><p>Ireland is a relatively small market in respect of fertiliser sales and their usage compared to many of our EU neighbours.
