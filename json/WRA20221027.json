The proposal focuses on establishing a system within company law and corporate governance to address adverse human rights and environmental impacts arising from companies' own operations, their subsidiaries' operations and their value chains.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset, I wish to state that Ireland is supportive of the objective of the proposed Directive which should promote responsible business conduct and is seeking to ensure that the proposals strike the right balance by providing effective protections whilst ensuring that the measures to be implemented by companies are clear, proportionate, and enforceable.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal will apply to large companies, both EU and non-EU. Ireland considers that these thresholds are appropriate. I am aware of some criticism that the proposal only includes approximately 1% of EU companies. However, it should be noted that this cohort of companies accounts for about 50% of the annual turnover of all companies within the EU. Rather than a focus on the number of companies, it is important to ensure that the right companies are in scope i.e. those companies who have the potential to have significant adverse impacts on human rights and environmental matters and through their actions have the ability to effect real change on such matters in their value chains.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, suppliers of those companies, many of which will be SMEs, would also be impacted as large companies conduct due diligence on their suppliers. I am also mindful of the regulatory burden placed on small and medium sized companies. Research on regulatory burdens and compliance costs indicates that where a large company may spend one euro per employee to comply with a regulatory duty, a medium-sized enterprise might have to spend around four euros and a small business up to ten euros. As 92% of Irish companies are micro-enterprises employing less than 10, and a further 6.8% of businesses employ between 10 and 49, one-size-fits-all regulatory compliance requirements can place these firms at a disadvantage to large multinational companies.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal has the potential to be far reaching and it is vital that we get it right. Good progress has been made in the discussions to date at EU level but further work is needed to clarify aspects of the proposal, ensure that the practical implications are well understood and that the obligations on companies are reasonable and effective. By way of example, there has been relatively little discussion on financial sector aspects of the proposal and clarification has been sought on the interaction of the proposal with the suite of existing regulation in the financial sector. Fundamental Issues relating to scope and definitions remain and are currently under discussion.<\/p>  <p>  There is considerable interest in the proposal across a wide range of interests and my Department has been actively engaging with stakeholders including civil society organisations and business representative organisations since the proposal was published. Officials in my Department have met with members of the Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights and with the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders the latest of which was two weeks ago. I myself will also be meeting with both groups in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to actively engage in detailed discussions at EU working party. It is considered that more time is needed for these discussions in order to achieve the clarity and legal certainty that is needed to ensure that companies&rsquo; obligations and stakeholders&rsquo; rights are clear. My Department will conduct a public consultation in the coming months once sufficient progress has been made in these discussions.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Member States have progressed national initiatives in this area. However, legislative initiatives in this area are best progressed at EU level in recognition of the complex, international nature of many supply chains and to ensure harmonisation, promote policy coherence and avoid the risk of fragmentation within the EU single market. For these reasons, Ireland is supportive of introducing legislation on these matters on a cross EU basis rather through unilateral domestic legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I am ambitious for this proposal and am keen to ensure that the final Directive that is agreed is a &ldquo;game changer&rdquo; and positions the EU to the fore, globally, in relation to responsible business conduct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700064#WRB04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1602"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700064#WRB04500"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[53897\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700064#WRB04600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will provide an update on IDA activities in County Mayo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>The IDA Ireland has frequent engagement with client companies and stakeholders in County Mayo, with regular interaction, including in person when beneficial.

The Plan contains a set of objectives and related actions to be delivered by end 2024 that seek to support and develop the enterprise ecosystem in the South East and are complementary to existing Government initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, through Enterprise Ireland (EI), regional enterprise development funding has been made available to assist locally-led innovative projects in the South East. In total, the region has secured &euro;8.7m in approved funding for eight projects under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) and Regional Enterprise Scoping Scheme (RETS) and for eight projects under the Regional Enterprise Innovation Scoping Scheme (REISS).<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) act as a &lsquo;first stop shop&rsquo; providing information and advice to businesses within their locality, as well as bespoke enterprise development programmes to encourage a strong enterprise ecosystem.

The FDI performance in the region has been strong over the past five years with employment among IDA clients increasing by 25%. The IDA&rsquo;s Regional Development Strategy is supported by a dedicated South East Regional Development team based in Waterford. The team engages with a wide range of stakeholders to help strengthen the region&rsquo;s offerings to win new FDI. This includes influencing, developing, and enhancing solutions such as key reference sellers, property solutions, utilities, skills, infrastructure, accessibility, place-making etc. to better influence potential new investors.  The IDA partner with a wide range of influencers and stakeholders in this regard on a continual basis both at a regional and national level.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that through the South East REP, Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices, and the work of IDA Ireland, we are well-placed to deliver the development, investment and job creation that the South-East deserves.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion regarding the setting up of a South East economic forum similar to the Western Development Commission, I addressed this issue during the meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the 5th October. That is, that I think the jury is out on whether having a regional body of that nature is hugely successful. Notwithstanding this, however, as I said at Committee, I would be interested in objectively assessing whether the region requires any additional targeted interventions.

Enterprise Centres are primarily focussed on providing spaces for start-ups, providing training, collaborative spaces, aiding innovation and supporting digitalisation.<\/p>  <p>  A key feature and strength of the Regional Enterprise Plans is that they are developed using a &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; approach, developed by regional stakeholders, including local authorities, who are keenly aware of the growth opportunities and vulnerabilities in their region, and of the benefits of working collaboratively to enhance their enterprise ecosystem.  Implementation of the Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024 is underway by Steering Groups in each of the nine regions.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that as part of the Digital Europe Programme (DIGITAL), the European Commission and EU Member States will establish and co-fund a network of European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs). These hubs will support digital transformation in SMEs and public sector organisations by encouraging the adoption of the latest advances in the three DIGITAL key technologies of Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence and High-Performance Computing. EDIHs will serve as &ldquo;one-stop-shops&rdquo; providing access to technical expertise and experimentation, as well as innovation services, and the training and skills development necessary for successful digital transformation. <\/p>  <p>  The European Union is investing over &euro;700 million to co-fund the EU-wide network of hubs.

This includes a c.&euro;14 million funding allocation to almost 200 projects via the Connected Hubs fund, enabling successful applicants to add additional capacity to existing remote working infrastructure in digital hubs and Broadband Connection Points throughout the country.  The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme also both support the establishment of digital hubs.  <\/p>  <p>  In May 2021, my colleague, Heather Humphreys TD, Minister for Rural and Community Development, launched the National Hub Network. The Network includes a range of digital hubs catering for a wide variety of remote and co-working needs. <\/p>  <p>  I have been advised that DRCD officials have been consulting with digital hub managers across the country, with local authorities and communities, and with other department and external stakeholders, to better inform the future strategic direction of the National Hub Network and the connectedhubs.ie platform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700065#WRC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living Wage","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700065#WRC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[53831\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700065#WRC03000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"his views on the living wage recommendation proposed by the Living Wage Technical Group.","asker":"1467","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":118,"content":"<p>We want to reward work and ensure that work pays more.

The Plan not only aimed to recover employment lost during the pandemic but to promote new employment opportunities through increased labour market activation and by accelerating the provision of training, reskilling and upskilling opportunities.<\/p><p>According to the latest available national figures, from the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s Labour Force Survey, employment levels reached 2.55 million in Q2 2022. We now have more people employed in our country than ever before, while the latest monthly unemployment rate stands at 4.3% - levels not seen since 2005. These results are a testament to the hard work and resilience of the Irish people and enterprise. The rate of growth since the beginning of 2021 has been remarkable. Since Q1 2021, the number of people in employment has grown by 324,000 (14.5%).<\/p><p>It has been especially welcome to see a strong recovery in the Accommodation and Food Service sector, with employment in this sector increasing by 68% since the start of 2021. The impact of the pandemic was not equal across sectors, and those in the Hospitality sector were significantly affected. Our strong policy interventions during the pandemic &ndash; rapidly rolling out the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme and Pandemic Unemployment Payment &ndash; appear to have minimised any long-term labour market scarring in the sector.<\/p><p>Much of the recent increase in employment has been driven by record levels of female labour market participation. There is currently a record-high 1.19 million women in employment &ndash; an increase of 164,400 since the start of 2021. As well as continued funding increases for early learning and childcare, interventions through <i>Making Remote Work<\/i>, our national Remote Work Strategy and <i>Pathways to Work 2021-2025,<\/i>have assisted in addressing obstacles to labour market inclusion for women.<\/p><p>In its ongoing engagement with enterprise and public service stakeholders, my Department and its agencies have nevertheless been made aware of labour shortages in certain sectors. My Department has worked to signpost businesses towards the training, labour market activation and EEA recruitment programmes and supports available through the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, its agencies, and the Department of Social Protection, in order to address their staffing needs.<\/p><p>Some of these shortfalls are due to pre-existing structural shifts, which have been accelerated by the impact of the pandemic. The digital and green transitions, and their associated behavioural changes, are altering the economy and leading to permanent changes in our labour market and business models. Not all jobs will return as we recover from the pandemic, while embracing these transitions will open up substantial new employment opportunities, as well as potential skills mismatches as these opportunities initially emerge.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan commits to supporting the transition of Ireland&rsquo;s economy and workforce to the new digital and green economies. In order to support businesses in securing talent with the right skills, the Government continues to roll-out thousands of additional re-skilling and upskilling opportunities through the National Training Fund to steer employees and employers through the resulting sectoral and labour market transitions. <\/p><p>My Department and its enterprise agencies help inform the targeting and content of these training interventions, through membership of the National Skills Council, Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, National Training Fund Advisory Group and Regional Skills Fora, as well as through broader collaboration with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and their agencies.  <\/p><p>My Department also operates an employment permit system which is highly responsive to areas of identified skills needs and labour shortages across the economy- including those which impact on the provision of public services- where such skills and expertise cannot be sourced from within the EEA at that time. The system is, by design, vacancy led and managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupation lists. These lists are usually subject to twice yearly evidence-based reviews, taking account of labour market research, a public consultation and contextual issues such as Brexit and COVID-19. <\/p><p>Up to the end of September, my Department had granted 31,076 permits. Just over four fifths of these permits were granted for the recruitment of staff across Information and Communication activities, Health and Social Work, Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing, Financial and Insurance Activities, Accommodation and Food Services and Construction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700065#WRC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Development","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700065#WRC03600"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[53741\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700065#WRC03700","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if his Department has a policy in relation to the industrial promotion of the military arms industry in Ireland and if so, if ethical considerations are taken into account  in deciding policy.","asker":"1575","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[53742\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700065#WRC03800","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if his Department has issued guidelines to the agencies under the aegis of his Department in relation to supporting the lethal arms industry in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":126,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 67 together.<\/p><p>Successive Irish governments have followed a policy of military neutrality, which is characterised by non-membership of military alliances. <\/p><p>Irish neutrality goes hand in hand with our promotion of international peace and stability.

Therefore, market and sectoral diversification remains critical to the sustainable growth of Irish owned companies. <\/p>  <p>  Diversification has been a key focus of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s work in recent years, and considerable progress is being made on the market and sectoral diversification of Irish-owned enterprises.  In 2021 Enterprise Ireland saw exports by Irish owned companies it supports increase by 12% to a record &euro;27.29bn.  This is the highest ever level of growth for Enterprise Ireland-backed companies in export value and growth was experienced across all territories.  Exports by EI client companies to the Eurozone increased by 10% last year, totalling &euro;6.04bn and accounting for over one-fifth (22%) of total exports. The next largest market was North America, which saw a 14% increase, bringing total exports to &euro;4.87bn and this market now accounts for 18% of total exports from EI supported companies. Despite the uncertainty caused by the changed trading relationship between the UK and Ireland, exports by EI client companies to this market totalled &euro;8.43bn. This was a rise of 15% with the UK accounting for almost one-third (31%) of the export trade of EI client companies.<\/p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success in growing exports has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth and, in this regard, Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700065#WRC05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1602"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700065#WRC05400"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[53597\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700065#WRC05500","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the targets for delivery of IDA supported jobs in County Monaghan for 2023.","asker":"1451","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>2021 was a record-breaking year for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) employment, with total employment in IDA client companies now standing at 275,384, up over 29,000 on 2020.

My department is working closely with officials at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) and local authorities to establish the nationwide network of BCPs. BCPs are publicly accessible facilities, typically community centres and sports clubs, in predominantly rural and isolated areas. These facilities offer onsite internet access for a variety of community uses, including skills training and STEM activities for children and young people, eHealth initiatives and remote working. 282 of 300 BCP sites are now live, with the remainder scheduled for completion this year.<\/p><p>My Department also operates a number of funding schemes and initiatives that focus on supporting remote working through the development of digital hubs (including BCPs) as long-term, digitally-enabled community assets.<\/p><p>In May 2021 I launched the Connected Hubs network together with the connectedhubs.ie platform. The Network includes a range of digital hubs that caters for a wide variety of remote and co-working needs. The Connected Hubs platform offers a suite of booking, hub management and e-commerce applications to members of the Network. <\/p><p>The Network also facilitates the sharing of innovation, experience and best practices across the community, leading to collaboration and knowledge dissemination between urban and rural hubs and BCPs. This partnership between cities, towns and villages has had a transformative impact on all involved.<\/p><p>To date, approximately 295 hubs from across the country have joined the Connected Hubs Network. This number is growing all the time meaning we are well on track to meet our target of 400 remote working hubs nationwide by 2025. <\/p><p>Our Rural Future commits to investing significantly in remote working infrastructure to provide an opportunity for more people to live in rural communities regardless of where their employer is located. To date over &euro;100 million has been invested by my department in the development of remote working facilities through programmes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. Successful projects are developed in collaboration with local authorities and communities with many projects seeing vacant and derelict buildings in rural towns and villages converted into remote working hubs.<\/p><p>This includes an allocation of approximately &euro;14 million in funding to almost 200 initiatives via the Connected Hubs 2021 and 2022 calls. Connected Hubs funding calls were open to all hubs (both urban and rural) irrespective of where they were in the country - this allowed for additional remote working capacity to be added to digital hubs and BCPs nationwide.

The policy recognises the opportunity for rural rejuvenation that remote working presents and the potential of remote working hubs as key economic assets for our rural towns and villages.<\/p><p>My Department operates a number of funding schemes that focus on projects supporting remote working through the development of digital hubs, including the development of Public Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) as long-term, digitally-enabled community assets.<\/p><p>In May 2021 I launched the Connected Hubs network together with the connectedhubs.ie platform. The Network includes a range of digital hubs and BCPs that cater for a wide variety of remote and co-working needs. The Connected Hubs platform offers a suite of booking, hub management and e-commerce applications to members of the Network. The Network also facilitates the sharing of innovation, experience and best practices across the community. These supports serve to maximise benefit to member hubs, hub clients, employers, local communities and the wider economy. <\/p><p>To date, approximately 295 hubs have joined the Connected Hubs Network. This number is growing all the time meaning we are well on track to meet our target of 400 remote working hubs nationwide by 2025. <\/p><p>Over &euro;100 million has also been invested by my department in the development of remote working facilities through programmes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. Successful projects are developed in collaboration with local authorities and communities with many projects seeing vacant and derelict buildings in rural towns and villages converted into remote working hubs. This includes approximately &euro;14 million in funding to almost 200 projects via the Connected Hubs fund, enabling successful applicants to add additional capacity to existing remote working infrastructure in digital hubs and BCPs throughout the country.<\/p><p>In addition to the Connected Hubs Network, my department is working closely with officials at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) and local authorities to establish the nationwide network of BCPs. BCPs are publicly accessible facilities, typically community centres and sports clubs, in predominantly rural and isolated areas.

My Department has not undertaken an analysis of price increases which are unrelated to any particular issue, but it actively monitors price developments through these price indices and regularly engages with the CSO. <\/p><p>A combination of issues was responsible for the initial rise in prices since mid -2021, including the rapid recovery in the domestic economy following the COVID-19 shock, international supply chain bottlenecks partly related to China&rsquo;s zero COVID policy stance, and base effects relating to weak price trends in 2020. <\/p><p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to a further pick-up in the rate of inflation. These geopolitical events have put exceptional upward pressure on gas and oil prices, and in turn electricity prices. These rising energy prices have been largely responsible for the rise in overall inflation (headline inflation) since early 2022, and in more recent months this has spilled over to core inflation (headline inflation minus energy prices). Headline inflation, measured by the CPI, rose by 8.2% between September 2021 and September 2022. Core inflation, measured by the CPI excluding energy products, rose 5.5% over the same period. In January 2022, headline inflation rose by 5.0% from January 2021, while core inflation rose 3.1% over the same period &ndash; much closer to the 2% overall inflation target. However, the rate of inflation as measured by the CPI has been decreasing since July, with the CSO reporting no change in the overall monthly inflation rate from August to September.<\/p><p>The impact of rising prices is not unique to Ireland, but an issue facing all major economies around the world. For instance, in September 2022, the annual inflation rate was 9.9% for the euro area, 8.2% for the US, and 10.1% for the UK. Ireland imports over 70 per cent of our energy use and the Government cannot fully insulate individuals and businesses from developments in international energy markets that are outside of our control.<\/p><p>However, the Government has been proactive in  putting in place measures to remedy the fallout from higher rates of inflation through introducing a &euro;505 million package in February of this year, including measures such as a lump sum payment of &euro;125 on the fuel allowance to 390,000 recipients,  temporary 20% reduction in public transport fares applicable from April 2022, a reduction of the drug payment scheme to &euro;80, and the working family payment increase announced on Budget Day 2022 was brought forward from 1 June to 1 April. The Government also approved an Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Scheme payment of up to &euro;200 to be made this year to an estimated 2.1 million domestic electricity account holders and a lump sum payment of &euro;125 for those in receipt of the fuel allowance, and there were also increases in the allocation of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare to ensure childcare prices do not rise. <\/p><p>Furthermore, in September this year a significant package to help businesses and households with the rising cost of living and doing business was announced as part of Budget 2023. This package includes measures to help with the cost of energy, for example. An electricity credit of &euro;600 to be applied to all household&rsquo;s electricity bills and a &euro;1.25 billion Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme which will provide qualifying businesses with up to 40% of the increase in electricity or gas bills - when compared to last year - up to a maximum of &euro;10,000 per month.  Other measures in the cost of living package include: a new Growth &amp;amp; Sustainability Loan Scheme, which will make up to &euro;500 million in low-cost investment loans of up to 10 years available to SMEs, with no collateral required for loans up to &euro;500,000 and an increase in the Standard Rate Cut Off Point by &euro;3,200 to &euro;40,000.<\/p><p>My Department are also raising awareness around energy efficiency, helping businesses reduce the amount of energy they use and improving take-up of existing schemes already in place such as the Green4Micro programme and the Climate Toolkit for Business. Other financial assistance includes the SEAI Community Grant, SEAI energy audit vouchers and grants for microgeneration. The Local Enterprise Offices also act as a &lsquo;first stop shop&rsquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance, and act as a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service for all government supports available to business owners throughout the country. Further information on the available business energy assistance can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website: Energy supports - DETE (enterprise.gov.ie)<\/p><p>Finally, the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council published the 'Ireland's Competitiveness Challenge 2022' report last month setting out a range of recommendations that address both immediate competitiveness issues and more medium- and long-term challenges. The Government will publish its response to these recommendations in due course. The Government will also keep the energy situation under constant review, and we will continue to examine what measures are possible to manage the impact of rising energy prices. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700070#WRH00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":344,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700070#WRH00700"},{"type":"question","counter":345,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[53926\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700070#WRH00800","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will provide details of any funding received by a company (details supplied) from Enterprise Ireland or other agencies in the auspices of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1522","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":346,"content":"<p>Enterprise Ireland has worked closely with the company in question since 2019 when it was transferred from the Cork LEO which had supported it since its establishment in 2017.

Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced).<\/p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four.<\/p>  <p>  EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges is designed to incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above and  in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that this new BIK charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020. I am satisfied that this has provided a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700071#WRJ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Prices","counter":432,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700071#WRJ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":433,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[53912\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700071#WRJ03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will make provision for small group water schemes (details supplied) in the temporary business energy support scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[53847\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700071#WRJ03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will remove data centres from eligibility for the temporary business energy support scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":435,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[54047\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700071#WRJ03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if Approved Housing Bodies are eligible to apply for support under the temporary business energy support scheme.","asker":"1467","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":436,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173, 175 and 176 together.<\/p>  <p>  Details of the new Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme (TBESS) are set out in Finance Bill 2022.

The TBESS will be available to tax compliant businesses carrying on a trade or profession the profits of which are chargeable to tax under Case I or Case II of Schedule D where they meet the eligibility criteria. The scheme will be operated on a self-assessment basis.<\/p>  <p>  Payments will be made on the basis of 40% of the amount of the increase in eligible electricity or natural gas costs between the bill amount which is the subject of the claim and the bill amount in the corresponding reference period in the previous year. Payments are generally subject to a monthly cap of &euro;10,000 per trade, increasing to a maximum of &euro;30,000 in certain circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme will operate by comparing the average unit price for the relevant bill period in 2022 with the average unit price in the corresponding reference period in 2021. If the increase in average unit price is more than 50% then the threshold has passed and the business is eligible for support under the scheme. A business who has not seen an increase of 50% over the period will not be eligible for the scheme. This means, for instance, larger corporates who have the purchasing power to enter into favourable forward pricing arrangements and have not seen an increase of 50% of 2021 prices, will not be eligible for support under the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Sporting bodies that carry on certain activities which would be chargeable to tax under Case I or II of Schedule D but for an available exemption are included in the scheme.

The design and implementation of the broadcasting levy is matter for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland as an independent regulatory body.<\/p>  <p>  The Online Safety and Media Regulation (OSMR) Bill, which is currently before the Oireachtas, will dissolve the BAI and established a new body, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, to oversee the regulatory framework for broadcasting, video-on-demand services and online safety set out in the Bill. <\/p>  <p>  The new body will be funded by a levy which will be placed on all regulated entities, including broadcasters, which will ultimately replace the broadcasting levy. Specifically, section 7 of the OSMR Bill will substitute a new section 21 of the Act, which will provide the legal basis for Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n to prepare and impose the levy or levies.

In terms of the issue in question, this is a matter of which I am well aware and it represents an area that our National Cultural Institutions are closely engaged with. <\/p>  <p>  Increasingly in recent decades, the National Cultural Institutions' curatorial responsibilities have required a consideration of the ethical implications and the evolving sensitivities regarding the acquisition and exhibition of historic artefacts. The exploitation of specific communities or the expropriation of their cultural artefacts is a profound concern, whether it occurred in the past or in more recent times.<\/p>  <p>  The National Monuments Act 1930 to 2014 and the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 provides for the licensing of exporting Irish historic artefacts. The National Museum of Ireland (NMI) actively follows up on reports of unlicensed export of archaeological objects from the State, on behalf of the State, and has been involved in the successful retrieval of such material. Important collections of archaeological objects, recovered through unlicensed metal detecting and subsequently illicitly exported from the jurisdiction, have been retrieved by the NMI working in cooperation with law enforcement agencies.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the enactment of the relevant legislation, and as is the case in many countries, objects from Ireland were often legitimately acquired by antiquarian collectors and ultimately entered the collections of other museums through onward sale or donation. This type of activity dates from a time which predates the current legislation which regulates the discovery, possession and sale of archaeological objects.<\/p>  <p>  Many Irish objects that belong to collections in overseas museums have been loaned to museums in Ireland for specific exhibitions. The NMI maintains close links with museums that hold Irish artefacts and has often borrowed such material for exhibitions. The institutions collaborate and share research and, in many cases, share the NMI's ethos, that is to care for, protect, and to research and disseminate knowledge in relation to collections that are in its care.<\/p>  <p>  Two recent examples are objects on long-term renewable loan to the NMI, currently on display in the Treasury exhibition at the NMI in Kildare Street:<\/p>  <p>  - the house-shaped shrine from the River Shannon at Keeloge Ford, in the Collection of the National Museums of Scotland<\/p>  <p>  - the Aghadoe Crozier, found in Co.

The 394 new special classes sanctioned for 2022\/23 is broken down by 261 at primary level and 133 at post primary level. The 394 additional classes will provide 2,364 places for children with special educational needs who require a special class placement. Of these new classes sanctioned for this school year, 60 of them were sanctioned in Cork, with 38 at primary level and 22 at post-primary level. <\/p>  <p>  In 2023, there will be a significant investment in the expansion of the National Council for Special Education, with a total full-year investment of &euro;13 million, in over 160 additional staff. This investment is being undertaken so that the NSCE can respond effectively, compassionately and quickly to the increased need in our education system so that children and their families are fully supported and achieve the best possible education outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  For 2023, budget funding provides for a further 370 special classes to open, taking the total number of special classes to over 2,900 in 2023.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is engaging intensely with the NCSE in relation to the forward planning of new special classes for the next school year 2023\/2024.

This means that, for the first time since 2017, the programme has been significantly expanded to an additional 322 schools. Those schools are now gaining access to targeted supports to address educational disadvantage. This will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180million.<\/p>  <p>  Schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics-based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. It also takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners. <\/p>  <p>  It is possible for two neighbouring schools to have a different profile in terms of proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds and the relative weighting of disadvantage apportioned in each. The designation of neighbouring schools to different DEIS bands does not mean that there is no educational disadvantage present in one school, but that the concentrated level of educational disadvantage of the two schools is different. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last, it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700073#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":525,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700073#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":526,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[53959\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700073#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will directly intervene in the cases of two school transport routes (details supplied) where children are left without a means to get the school; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Home tutors are engaged by the parents\/guardian of the child who is to receive tuition and the tutor has no contractual relationship with the Department of Education.  <\/p><p>In accordance with instructions from the Revenue Commissioners, payments under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme are subject to statutory deductions at source.

Accordingly, it is a condition of the scheme that parents\/legal guardians recruit a tutor who is qualified in the sector in which tuition is being provided, and is registered with the Teaching Council for the duration of the approved tuition, up to and including issue of final payment. Where all efforts have failed to secure the services of a teacher qualified to teach in the sector concerned, the Department may consider the engagement of a person who is registered with the Teaching Council and has a primary degree (minimum Level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications) in a relevant area, e.g. Psychology.<\/p><p>The scheme is governed by annual Circulars, which are released during the summer each year.

The Assessment Officer makes the determination as to whether or not a child or young person meets the definition of disability contained in the Act and the HSE Assessment Officer co-ordinates and completes the Assessment Report.<\/p><p>Following on from a court ruling in October 2021 there is now a legal obligation on the education system to <b>assist<\/b>the HSE as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Assessment of Need Process (AON). <\/p><p>The Department of Education and NCSE have worked intensively to ensure the process put in place adheres to legal obligations arising from the HSE&rsquo;s AON process and is one that is rooted in existing good practice in schools. Under the Disability Act (2005) the NCSE is obliged to <b>nominate a person<\/b>with appropriate expertise to assist in the education assessment process. <\/p><p>Where the child is enrolled in a school the Education of Persons with Special Education Needs Act (EPSEN) 2004 names the principal as the person the NCSE should contact. <\/p><p>Assessment in education is an evaluation of a child&rsquo;s <b>education<\/b>need.<\/p><p>Identification of education needs is central to the way schools operate. Schools provide for the inclusion and participation of all students and provide an education which is appropriate to a student&rsquo;s abilities and needs.<\/p><p>In that regard, it is important to note that schools routinely identify students&rsquo; needs. This is embedded in school practice. This aligns with the obligations on schools arising from the Education Act 1998.  They use a range of assessment practices as part of the <i>Continuum of Support<\/i>process.  The Continuum of Support framework enables the school to identify, address and review progress in meeting the academic, social and emotional needs of the pupil, as well as physical, sensory, language and communication needs. <\/p><p>Schools have been provided with a range of resources to ensure that the education needs of all students, including those with a disability or other special education needs, are identified and supported.  The Department of Education issued <i>Guidelines for Primary and Post Primary schools (2017) <\/i>as to how they should identify and provide for the special education and learning needs of students<i>.  <\/i><\/p><p>Information derived from the schools&rsquo; assessments in education are recorded in a &lsquo;Student Support File&rsquo;. In line with best educational practice, the Student Support file details a student&rsquo;s education needs as identified by the school.  The information contained in the Student Support File is used in completing the educational component of the AON form which is returned to the HSE via the NCSE. <\/p><p>The Department of Education and the NCSE are conscious of the workload on schools and on school leaders and, in that regard, an extensive consultation process on the educational component of the AON was undertaken prior to its introduction.  This process involved schools, advocacy groups, management bodies and unions.  The Department of Education and the NCSE worked with a small number of schools on a draft of the documents required as part of the HSE&rsquo;s AON process. The schools provided valuable feedback on the form and guidance documents which was used to inform the documents which have been issued to schools. <\/p><p>The Department of Education and the NCSE have put in place a suite of supports to assist schools in completing the educational component of the HSE&rsquo;s AON process.  These include:<\/p><p>- Detailed guidance,<\/p><p>- Short video for use by schools setting how to comply with the process; <\/p><p>- Email support,<\/p><p>- Dedicated support line &ndash; this line is staffed by education professionals who will assist schools in completing the process.  <\/p><p>I think it is important to note that this remains a HSE process.

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months. <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here.

The correspondence was in the context of Housing for All &ndash; A New Housing Plan for Ireland, and in particular Action 19.9 which sought to activate State owned vacant properties for residential development.  Under Action 19.9, Government had mandated that all Departments (including public bodies under their aegis) to examine their existing portfolio of properties and consider if they have any properties that are not required, and may be suitable for residential housing, that should be put on the market. We are advised by the HEA that in respect of Universities no properties were identified in response to that request. It is important to note that the questionnaire did not collate material on either derelict or vacant buildings not suitable for residential housing. The Department does not hold this information.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of student accommodation, we have met with all the publicly funded HEI&rsquo;s to explore options within their remit for the provision of additional student accommodation. We are open to liaising with providers on individual options for the activation of supply of student accommodation including potential refurbishment of vacant buildings. <\/p>  <p>  My Department officials and I have engaged and continue to engage on an ongoing basis with the Minister and Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the wider higher education sector and relevant stakeholders on student accommodation issues including within the context of the advancement of the Government's Housing for All policy.<\/p>  <p>  I received Cabinet Committee support this week on outline proposals to increase the supply of student accommodation, including proposals relating to a new model whereby for the first time the State would assist directly in bridging the gap between development costs and rental affordability in relation to the provision of additional student accommodation.

While it is not possible to give an exact timeframe, the office will be in touch as soon as a decision has been reached.<\/p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. <\/p>  <p>  Applications are processed in chronological order by date received, and though it is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.<\/p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date.<\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose.

This is a fundamental exercise of State sovereignty, which is necessary to protect the security of the State and to prevent illegal immigration. The exercise of powers in this area is at all times subject to the law and to respect for individual rights.<\/p>  <p>  The Border Management Unit (BMU) of my Department has responsibility for frontline immigration duties at Dublin Airport only. Other ports of entry are the responsibility of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), including the border with Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Immigration officials conduct passport checks on arrival to ensure passengers are properly documented in accordance with Section 11 of the Immigration Act 2004. If a person indicates or is identified as being in need of international protection, they are admitted to the international protection process.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that in the first nine months of this year, 3,705 people arrived undocumented in Dublin airport. While these passengers should have presented documents at their point of departure, they were no longer in possession of those documents when they reached the immigration desks at Dublin airport. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the establishment of an applicant&rsquo;s identity and nationality is an important feature of every immigration process and this is especially so in the context of persons who enter the Irish State for the purposes of making a claim for international protection. Each application for international protection is examined in detail on its individual merits, taking all factors into account. All applicants are carefully interviewed and their cases are individually assessed by experienced caseworkers. The circumstances of each individual case is assessed having regard to both the subjective elements (the applicant&rsquo;s own account or personal history) and objective elements (up-to-date information on the applicant&rsquo;s country or place of origin).<\/p>  <p>  All decisions are made in accordance with relevant legislation and Ireland follows the guidance of the UNHCR and the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA) in relation to claims for international protection.<\/p>  <p>  In the first nine months of 2022 out of a total of 5,662 persons refused leave to land, 4,969 persons indicated an intention to claim asylum to the Border Management Unit in Dublin airport. This figure includes those who may have had valid documentation.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, based on subsequent investigations to establish passenger identity, it is clear that a proportion of undocumented arrivals who claim asylum upon arrival in Ireland hold status in another member state and are likely to have travelled here on a convention travel document.<\/p>  <p>  On 18 July 2022, the Government decided to temporarily suspend Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Council of Europe Agreement for the Abolition of Visas for Refugees. The temporary suspension came into operation from noon on 19 July 2022. At the same time, a revised Visa Order was introduced to require visa required refugees travelling to Ireland from participating Member States to have an Irish visa. It is too early to determine the impact of the suspension on application numbers.  However, this will be closely monitored by the Department in the coming weeks and months.<\/p>  <p>  This is not a decision that the Government has taken lightly. We are committed to upholding our international and EU obligations towards asylum seekers (international protection applicants) and refugees. However, where there is evidence that there may be exploitation within such systems, the Government must act swiftly to mitigate the risks, both to maintain the integrity of our immigration and international protection systems and to uphold public confidence in those systems.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is examining the factors which may have contributed to the significant increase in applications for international protection and will continue to take all necessary steps to manage the international protection process efficiently and effectively, as part of the broader whole-of-Government response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700076#WRO03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Properties","counter":723,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700076#WRO03300"},{"type":"question","counter":724,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[54056\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700076#WRO03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of vacant and derelict buildings respectively by county in the ownership of the Probation Services, the Irish Prison Service and her Department in tabular form.","asker":"1453","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":725,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Agency <\/b><\/th>       <th><b>Vacant Buildings<\/b><\/th>       <th><b>Derelict Buildings<\/b><\/th>       <th><b>Location<\/b><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Irish Prison Service<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>Cork and Dublin<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Department of Justice<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Probation Service<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>Cork<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>I wish to further advise the Deputy that my Department, including the bodies under its aegis, have reviewed their portfolio of buildings and details in relation to unoccupied buildings have been provided to the Department of Housing in relation to Ukraine and to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Land Development Agency in the context of Housing for All.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700076#WRO03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence","counter":726,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700076#WRO03600"},{"type":"question","counter":727,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[54078\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700076#WRO03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if her attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) which indicates a 7% increase in 2021 on the numbers contacting centres;

It is the successor plan to <i>Ireland&rsquo;s National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020<\/i>, known as iNAP1.<\/p><p>Both plans adopt a One Health approach and align to the five Strategic Objectives as outlined in the WHO Global Action Plan (2015) and the requirements of the European Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) (2017).<\/p><p>The goal of the One Health concept is to encourage multidisciplinary collaborative efforts across different sectors such as human health, animal health, agriculture, and the environment to achieve the optimal health outcomes for people and animals. It advocates a &ldquo;whole of society&rdquo; approach, recognising that the health of people is connected to the health of animals and the environment. It has been acknowledged globally that a One Health approach is the most effective way to address the global AMR challenge. This is promoted by both the WHO and the European Commission.<\/p><p>Strategic Objective 5 of iNAP2 is to promote research and sustainable investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions. There are 33 actions across the human health, animal health and environment sectors under this objective. There is also an overarching One Health Action related to research, OH15: Promote research in the context of addressing AMR through an Ongoing One Health approach through research partners to fill research gaps. iNAP2 and these actions are available to view online at www.gov.ie\/amr.  <\/p><p>The Department of Health encourages cross-discipline research and this work is supported by the Health Research Board (HRB). The HRB is a State Agency under the Department of Health. The HRB support and fund health and social care research and provide evidence to inform policy and practice. The Joint Programming Initiative AMR (JPIAMR) is a global collaborative organisation and platform, engaging 28 nations to curb antimicrobial resistance with a One Health approach since 2011. The goal is to shape cohesive and coordinated AMR funding and actions that maximise on resources and reduce duplication of research. Since joining JPIAMR in 2017, Irish researchers have been partners in four transnational projects and eight Networks funded via JPIAMR, in the areas of transmission, surveillance and the environment, across five separate funding calls.<\/p><p>Irish participants (supported by HRB, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Environmental Protection Agency) were partners in a further seven networks in 2018 (6) and 2020 (1), with funding of &euro;50K. In 2022, there were four successful partners in the &ldquo;Diagnostics and Surveillance Networks&rdquo; call, with funding of &euro;50K.<\/p><p>HRB also plan to participate in the &ldquo;Development of innovative strategies, tools, technologies, and methods for diagnostics and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance&rdquo;: two-stage research projects call launching in January 2023, to facilitate Irish applications to this scheme. Since 2019 the HRB has also directly funded programmes in the region of 10 AMR related projects, valued at over &euro;5M. <\/p><p>In line with iNAP2, the Department of Health will continue to work with partners and stakeholders to encourage and support cross-discipline research on AMR. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700076#WRO04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":739,"content":"<p>Question No. 278 answered with Question No. 277.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":740,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700076#WRO05000"},{"type":"question","counter":741,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[53911\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700076#WRO05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will examine a matter (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":742,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.<\/p><p>Under the rules of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board Superannuation Scheme, any proposed discretionary increases require the authorisation of the Minister of Health.

It is imperative that nursing homes manage potential cost pressures in line with their regulatory and contractual responsibilities, maintaining their quality of care so that residents&rsquo; lived experience and comfort is not affected. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has provided substantial supports to the nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. Over &euro;144 million has been claimed by nursing homes under the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) since its introduction in 2020. The Government has now agreed to extend TAPS to the end of the year by maintaining the availability of Outbreak Assistance support.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2023 saw an additional &euro;180 million of funding for services for older people for winter 2022 and into 2023, building on unprecedented increases of recent years. This will bring investment in these services to over &euro;2.4 billion in 2023, including nearly &euro;12 million of new developments. Prior to Budget Day I stated that my priority was to secure additional funding for Budget 2023 to ensure the continuation of all services to a high standard. Long-term residential care will be supported through additional funding for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) to maintain services and manage inflationary increases.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a significant fund of up to &euro;100m has been allocated this year to support community based service providers who are such an essential pillar in the provision of Health services across country. This fund is being made available in recognition of the challenges being faced by the sector in delivering and maintaining key health and social care services against a backdrop of increased inflationary pressures affecting energy, heating and related costs. These organisations are funded through the HSE to deliver a range of health and social care services on behalf of the HSE to communities around Ireland. This includes residential, day and ancillary services for people with a disability, older people, mental health services, palliative care services, addiction services and other health and social care services provided in the community.<\/p>  <p>  The details of the plan are being finalised. It is proposed that the inflation support fund will be administered by the HSE utilising the mechanisms in place for funding eligible organisations in receipt of Service Level Arrangements and Grant Aid Agreements. These arrangements are already in place with organisations that provide key health and social care services for people in Ireland. It is proposed that payments will be made to eligible organisations in the final quarter of 2022 to meet the pressures of this coming winter. Many eligible organisations may be already operating within a context of increased inflationary pressures.<\/p>  <p>  For providers of long-term residential care who participate in the nursing home support scheme, funding will be allocated through the established mechanism of the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme. Precise details of the scheme are being finalised and will be communicated in the coming days.<\/p>  <p>  To address strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group (SWAG) was established in March 2022 and published a report on 15 October outlining 16 key recommendations spanning the areas of recruitment and retention, pay and conditions and overall sectoral reform. I strongly endorse the Group&rsquo;s recommendations to address the critical shortage of care workers in Ireland and a dedicated Implementation Group will start to progress these immediately.<\/p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home, local market prices, historic prices and overall budgetary capacity. <\/p>  <p>  The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009. The NTPF has statutory independence, and there is no role for Ministers or the Department of Health in these negotiations. The Department of Health published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system which are now being taken forward by the Department of Health and the NTPF. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700077#WRP02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies","counter":771,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700077#WRP02300"},{"type":"question","counter":772,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[53971\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700077#WRP02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide the minutes of the meetings held to date by the national working group developing policy and lists on aids and appliances for the year 2021 and to date in 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1514","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":773,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[53972\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700077#WRP02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide any memos related to the establishment of the national working group on aids and appliances.","asker":"1514","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":774,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 289 and 290 together.<\/p><p>The release of documents is most appropriately pursued through the Freedom of Information (FOI) process.<\/p><p>Details on how to make an FOI request to the Health Service Executive can be found at the following link: <\/p><p>www.hse.ie\/eng\/services\/yourhealthservice\/info\/foi\/making-a-request\/. <table>    <tr>       <td>Making a Request - HSE.ie<br \/><br \/>Making a Request under the 2014 Freedom of Information Act.

Over &euro;144 million has been claimed by nursing homes under the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) since its introduction in 2020. The Government has now agreed to extend TAPS to the end of the year by maintaining the availability of Outbreak Assistance support.<\/p><p>For providers of long-term residential care who participate in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, funding supports to help meet increased operating costs due to inflation will be allocated from the &euro;100m health sector fund announced in Budget 2023 and will be delivered through the established mechanism of the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme. Precise details of the scheme are being finalised and will be communicated in the coming days.  <\/p><p><b>Implementation of Policy Reviews<\/b><\/p><p>To address strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group (SWAG) was established in March 2022 and published a report on 15 October outlining 16 key recommendations spanning the areas of recruitment and retention, pay and conditions and overall sectoral reform. I strongly endorse the Group&rsquo;s recommendations to address the critical shortage of care workers in Ireland and a dedicated Implementation Group will start to progress these immediately.<\/p><p>Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home, local market prices, historic prices and overall budgetary capacity. <\/p><p>The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009. The NTPF has statutory independence, and there is no role for Ministers or the Department of Health in these negotiations. The Department of Health published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. <\/p><p>The Review of the Pricing System for Long Term Residential Care Facilities was carried out under the oversight of a steering group with representation from various departments and agencies. The group made four recommendations:<\/p><p>-  Recommendation 1: formal assessment of using a formulaic approach in the pricing system as set out in Section 4 of the Report.<\/p><p>-  Recommendation 2: formal assessment of amending the approach to the assessment of &ldquo;Local Market Price&rdquo; to reflect prices within other nursing homes within a certain distance of the nursing home rather than within the same county.<\/p><p>-  Recommendation 3: NTPF to engage with nursing homes and their representatives in relation to enhancing the internal NTPF Review process.<\/p><p>-  Recommendation 4: amending the process for allowing for high dependency residents when the necessary systems are in place.<\/p><p>A steering group has been established to oversee the delivery of the recommendations; this group has met on a regular basis since publication of the review. <\/p><p>The delivery of recommendations 1-3 primarily sit with the NTPF. As per the recommendations of the review, the NTPF is reporting periodically to the steering group on progress in implementing the recommendations. It is recognised, however, that recommendation 4 has dependencies going well beyond the scope of the pricing review. This recommendation is therefore being addressed within the broader context of the reform of older persons' services., with appropriate links established between the pricing review steering group (including shared membership) to ensure that appropriate links are made between this recommendation and the others.<\/p><p>The terms of reference for the group include a final report to be submitted to ministers, reporting on delivery of recommendations 1-4 set out above and making any further recommendations as appropriate.<\/p><p>A Value for Money (VFM) Review on Nursing Home Care Costs has also been carried out under the direction of a Steering Committee with an independent chair. The VFM Review sought to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private\/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector. The review was published in December 2021 and can be viewed by following this link: www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/3859f-a-value-for-money-review-of-nursing-home-care-costs\/ <\/p><p>Among the issues raised were the pay costs of staff in nursing homes, the dependency levels of residents, energy costs, and medical supplies charges to the NHSS. The report found that the cost differential is largely driven by variances in staff-to-resident ratios and the skill mix in public and private nursing homes. However, the review also found that establishing like-for-like comparisons was complex and not always possible, especially when considering differences in dependency levels.<\/p><p>The VFM Review made nine recommendations which the Department continues to take forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700077#WRP03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":782,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700077#WRP03400"},{"type":"question","counter":783,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[53995\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700077#WRP03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has identified a timeline for updating the Dental Act 1985, as committed to in the national oral health policy in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1590","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":784,"content":"<p>I am aware that the Dentists Act 1985 needs to be updated to align with other healthcare profession regulatory legislation.

Other services such as allied healthcare professional services may also be made available to persons with limited eligibility.

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18m targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone. <\/p>  <p>  A Policy Directive was issued by the Minister to the independent Licensing Authority to give effect to these measures. The Policy Directive directed the Licensing Authority to insert a condition to this effect into the licences of affected vessels. <\/p>  <p>  A Judicial Review to the High Court was taken by two applicant fishers challenging the validity of the Policy. On 6th October 2020, the Judge held in summary that the High Court&rsquo;s final order should be, among other matters, a declaration that Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and\/or of no legal effect. The breach of fair procedures as referenced above related to a failure with obligations to consult with the applicants in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the consultation process and in particular by failing to consult with them a second time once a preferred option had been identified. A stay on the order was refused by the High Court on 10th December 2020. <\/p>  <p>  I appealed the decision of the High Court to the Court of Appeal. I also sought a stay on the order of the High Court. The Court of Appeal reinstated the Ministerial Policy Directive on 19th March 2021, when the Court was persuaded that the balance of justice leaned in favour of the State and granted a stay on the order of the High Court up until the hearing of the substantive appeal in June. Following a full hearing by the Court of Appeal on 22nd June 2021, the Court decided to temporarily extend the Policy Directive excluding large vessels from trawling in inshore waters within 6 miles of the coast, save for a restricted sprat fishery. <\/p>  <p>  On September 23rd, 2021, the Court of Appeal refused my application to further continue the stay. This refusal means that the decision of the High Court stands and the Policy Directive is no longer valid, meaning vessels over 18 metres in length overall have resumed trawling in the waters inside 6 nautical miles. These vessels also no longer require an authorisation to fish for sprat inside 6 nautical miles. <\/p>  <p>  The Court of Appeal issued an unapproved judgment on 19th July last and my Department is at present considering the implications of the that unapproved judgment in consultation with its legal advisors.

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18m targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone. <\/p>  <p>  A Policy Directive was issued by the Minister to the independent Licensing Authority to give effect to these measures. The Policy Directive directed the Licensing Authority to insert a condition to this effect into the licences of affected vessels. <\/p>  <p>  A Judicial Review to the High Court was taken by two applicant fishers challenging the validity of the Policy. On 6th October 2020, the Judge held in summary that the High Court&rsquo;s final order should be, among other matters, a declaration that Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and\/or of no legal effect. The breach of fair procedures as referenced above related to a failure with obligations to consult with the applicants in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the consultation process and in particular by failing to consult with them a second time once a preferred option had been identified. A stay on the order was refused by the High Court on 10th December 2020. <\/p>  <p>  I appealed the decision of the High Court to the Court of Appeal. I also sought a stay on the order of the High Court. The Court of Appeal reinstated the Ministerial Policy Directive on 19th March 2021, when the Court was persuaded that the balance of justice leaned in favour of the State and granted a stay on the order of the High Court up until the hearing of the substantive appeal in June. Following a full hearing by the Court of Appeal on 22nd June 2021, the Court decided to temporarily extend the Policy Directive excluding large vessels from trawling in inshore waters within 6 miles of the coast, save for a restricted sprat fishery. <\/p>  <p>  On September 23rd, 2021, the Court of Appeal refused my application to further continue the stay. This refusal means that the decision of the High Court stands and the Policy Directive is no longer valid, meaning vessels over 18 metres in length overall have resumed trawling in the waters inside 6 nautical miles. These vessels also no longer require an authorisation to fish for sprat inside 6 nautical miles. <\/p>  <p>  The Court of Appeal issued an unapproved judgment on 19th July last and my Department is at present considering the implications of the that unapproved judgment in consultation with its legal advisors. Further submissions to the Court have been provided.<\/p>  <p>  As this matter continues to be sub judice, I am not in a position to comment further until the matter can be resolved before the Courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700079#WRR02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":897,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700079#WRR02800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":896,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700079#WRR02700"},{"type":"question","counter":897,"qnumday":331,"qnumall":"[54138\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700079#WRR02800","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the extent to which funding made available prior to or in the course of the recent budget is likely to benefit urban and rural community development; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":898,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[54139\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700079#WRR02900","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the number of applicants for assistance towards urban\/rural community development in the past twelve months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":899,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[54140\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700079#WRR03000","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the extent to which to she can make further provision arising from Budget 2023, to assist with urban\/rural community development; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":900,"qnumday":339,"qnumall":"[54142\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700079#WRR03100","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the number of headings under which she proposes to assist towards rural and community development at local level in the coming year; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":901,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[54143\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700079#WRR03200","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the degree to which supports from her Department in the past year have assisted rural and community enterprises throughout the period; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":902,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 331, 336, 337, 339 and 340 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department supports rural and urban communities across the country through programmes such as the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, the LEADER Programme, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the CLAR programme, the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme and the Community Enhancement Programme.

The policy recognises the opportunity for rural rejuvenation that remote working presents and commits to establishing a comprehensive and integrated national network of 400 remote working hubs by 2025. <\/p><p>Last year I launched the National Hub Network together with its online booking platform, connectedhubs.ie. It is a single network that provides users with information on the location of, and facilities available at, remote working hubs throughout Ireland. The network includes a diverse range of hubs and services, thus facilitating companies of different sizes. <\/p><p>There are currently 295 remote and co-working facilities across the country on-boarded to the connectedhubs.ie platform. This number is growing all the time meaning we are well on track to meet our target of 400 remote working hubs nationwide by 2025. <\/p><p>To date my department has also invested over &euro;100 million to support the establishment, improvement and sustainability of hubs. For example, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme both support the establishment of digital hubs. <\/p><p>Approximately &euro;14 million in funding was allocated to almost 200 projects via the Connected Hubs Call in 2021 and 2022. This allowed for additional remote working capacity to be added to digital hubs and Public Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) throughout the country. A list of successful applicants is available on my Department's website. <\/p><p>In addition to facilitating online bookings and payments, connectedhubs.ie is also a platform for collecting and disseminating data, not least around the types of hubs available in Ireland. The data drawn from the connectedhubs.ie will contribute to future decisions pertaining to the support that my Department will provide to the sector in future.<\/p><p>To date my focus has been on establishing the Network, on achieving this initial critical mass and on raising awareness of the Network to relevant stakeholders, including SMEs\/business owners and new hub users. Following strong progress on the establishment phase of the project, my focus has now shifted to the next stage of development. To this end, officials at my department and their colleagues across government departments will begin drafting of a National Hubs Strategy.<\/p><p>I have always been clear that balanced regional development, sustainable and thriving communities, and indeed the wider national economy will all benefit from workers and employers embracing the remote working revolution. Hubs, whether enterprise or community focused, draw employers and employees to areas of innovation and opportunity, including rural communities. <\/p><p>I am pleased to say that the connectedhubs.ie team have for some time been developing a corporate service to engage with and support corporate clients interested in using our nationwide Network to accommodate their employees, but also to gain access to the vast pool of talent that Ireland has to offer, whether those talented people live in our cities, towns, villages or rural parishes. I believe that this work represents significant opportunities for employers of all sizes to leverage the National Hub Network directly. <\/p><p>I am committed to ensuring that the National Hub Network will continue to make a central contribution to the achievement of the Government's vision for rural Ireland, as set out in Our Rural Future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700079#WRR04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":918,"content":"<p>Question No. 339 answered with Question No. 331.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":919,"content":"<p>Question No. 340 answered with Question No. 331.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":920,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700079#WRR05012"},{"type":"question","counter":921,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[54144\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102700079#WRR05025","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the extent to which she has received new applications for support from rural and community-based groups which might be affected by inflation or cost of living increases; the extent to which she envisages support for such applicants in the coming year; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":922,"content":"<p>The Government is aware of the challenges facing community and voluntary organisations and the charities sector in meeting the high cost of energy currently and is committed to supporting the sector in meeting these costs.<\/p>  <p>  Not-for-profit and voluntary organisations in the Community and Voluntary sector are woven into the fabric of community life across Ireland, but they are vulnerable to the impact of increased energy costs.<\/p>  <p>  The recent budget made &euro;10m available to put in place a support scheme for community and voluntary organisations and the charities sector.  <\/p>  <p>  The framework for delivering this assistance is currently being developed by my Department to ensure access to support in a timely manner.
