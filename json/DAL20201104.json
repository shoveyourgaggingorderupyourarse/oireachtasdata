that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to maintain a multiannual investment programme in flood relief measures to protect flood risk communities;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the objective of the European Union (EU) Floods Directive (2007\/60\/EU) is to establish a framework for the assessment and management of flood risks to reduce the negative consequences of flooding on human health, economic activities, the environment and cultural heritage in the EU;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the EU Floods Directive (2007\/60\/EU) crucially requires all member states to fully assess whether all water courses and coast lines are at risk from flooding, to quantify the overall risks and map the associated flood extent, assets and humans at risk in these areas and to take adequate and coordinated measures to reduce such flood risks;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that flooding has far reaching negative and devastating impacts, such as emotional stress, the loss of individual homes, farms and businesses, severe associated health related issues and dramatic declines in economic competitiveness of impacted communities and regions;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that while there has been significant social, infrastructural and economic damage caused by recent and repeated flooding across all regions, rural Ireland has been disproportionately impacted;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the essential and basic maintenance of Ireland&rsquo;s rivers and streams is not occurring;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that it is increasingly clear in Ireland that the current approach to flood insurance is not fit for purpose, and as such, the Government must provide proper consultation for homeowners and businesses who through no fault of their own have been flooded, as little or nothing has been done so far to address this issue and ensure urgent improvements to the current and future availability and affordability of flood insurance;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the issue of flooding in Ireland is expected to increase in the coming years, this is evident by the current major flooding and the reoccurring flooding over the last 15 years;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that there is a significant misunderstanding displayed by certain agencies about the &lsquo;once in 100 years&rsquo; flood, as it means a one per cent chance of severe flooding every year;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the issue of flooding along the Shannon catchment is likely to worsen, both through frequency from year-to-year, and the volume of water that is spilling over banks, gathering on people&rsquo;s land and threatening or destroying their homes;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the number of staff available to the Office of Public Works (OPW) has reduced significantly in the past few years and this is one of the primary reasons ongoing flooding is occurring in specific areas;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the Irish Government has failed to drawdown any available funding from the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF), created as a relief fund to support regions impacted by severe floods across the EU, since 2009 where &euro;13 million was allocated to Ireland from total allocations of some &euro;5.5 billion, meaning Ireland is now the third lowest recipient of support under the scheme despite many severe flooding events here in recent years;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the existing flood alleviation measures in rural Ireland have proved grossly inadequate and ineffective in safeguarding communities from flood damage and heavy rains;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the response of the OPW and local authorities&rsquo; Crisis Management and Severe Weather Assessment teams; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that addressing the damage caused by persistent and repeated flood damage will place substantial and unsustainable financial burdens on local authorities, farms, microenterprises, small to medium-sized enterprises and households; and<br \/><br \/>calls on the Government to:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; provide immediate and ongoing financial assistance to local authorities nationwide, to enable the timely delivery of local flood relief projects and schemes, to clear rivers, streams and drains aimed at preventing damage to businesses and private homes in towns and villages of impacted areas;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure that local authorities have sufficient autonomy to facilitate the removal of silt or other obstructions, including but not limited to, over-hanging trees and branches  along rivers, due to their destructive impact on flooding and consequentially on homes and businesses;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; increase the threshold of the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection funding scheme, available to local authorities, from &euro;750,000 (maximum currently) to &euro;1 million for each project and to fast-track the processing of applications in order to alleviate the current delays associated with progressing valid submissions under the programme's economic, social and environmental criteria;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; urgently fast-track and deliver the development of the planned 150 flood relief schemes that form part of the Government&rsquo;s &euro;1 billion investment in flood relief over the lifetime of the National Development Plan to 2027, provide an annual review or update to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the implementation of the investment programme, in order to secure  accountability, assess implementation and keep all impacted local citizens and communities fully up to date;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; immediately introduce a &lsquo;ring-fenced&rsquo; current and capital funding scheme for each local authority to increase roadside operatives (employees) and contractors, with the requisite capital allocations to clear, sustain and maintain drains, gulleys, dykes and water courses;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; immediately introduce a &lsquo;ring-fenced&rsquo; budget to each local authority to allow for cutting back road-side verges, hedges, and fences in rural communities, in the interests of flood risk prevention and road user public safety;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; immediately introduce a proper compensation package for businesses and homeowners negatively impacted with property damage or destroyed by flooding, as the current humanitarian-aid scheme omits private homes and businesses with insurance, despite some businesses having to cover their own excess of up to &euro;10,000 per annum;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; immediately apply (as applications must be received by the Commission within 12 weeks of the date of the first damage caused by the event) for emergency funding under the multi-billion-euro EUSF to support Irish regions impacted by recent flooding across the country;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; intensify efforts to collate data on Ireland&rsquo;s flooding crisis, as continuing to blame it on climate change alone is much too simplistic and idle a policy, given that across Europe, rivers are drying up in some areas, and also getting stronger, with more forceful currents in others;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; immediately increase the number of staff available to the OPW and other relevant bodies tasked with ensuring adequate levels of drainage, flood management and prevention;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure the OPW carries out programmed maintenance on rivers and streams to prevent the build-up from trees, rubbish and other such debris;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; immediately critically review and publish the effectiveness of the strategies adopted by the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, the Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs) and the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group for the reduction of flood risk, publish the findings and  determine whether a new single authority is needed to address issues on the Shannon (currently the OPW and the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) manages dams such as Parteen weir, while the North-South body, known as Waterways Ireland have responsibility for the rivers);<br \/><br \/>&mdash; implement significant reforms of regulations governing hedge and vegetation cutting,specifically where these materially impact the capacity of local authorities, landowners or farmers to manage and reduce flooding risks;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; put in place preventative measures for when tides are dangerously high and adopt a revised Coastal Zone Management Policy that is more integrated and more forward looking than is currently the case;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; undertake a programme to cut trees and roadside hedges along power lines, to prevent them falling onto power lines during storms, which has been shown to cause major power outages for prolonged periods;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; explore, and where possible, encourage the use of river dredging as part of a suite of measures to reduce the risk of flooding, due to the bed of silt, or clay, lying at the bottom of some rivers that has a significant impact on the water levels;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; end the short-term, stop-gap approach, to flood insurance immediately, and move to a more sustainable flood insurance approach by:  \t&mdash; significantly increasing efforts to address the underlying risks now and in the future, as this will help to ensure the affordability and availability of insurance; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; increase transparency and provide clarity to citizens and stakeholders so that insurance companies cannot hide behind inaccurate, market-fixing or unsubstantiated data by implementing sanctions on such providers; &mdash; prioritise the availability of insurance for homes and businesses adversely affected by flooding or heavy rains;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; allow farmers and landowners take the build-up of gravel and silt out of rivers as previously carried out by farmers over many generations;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; allow farmers and landowners to remove branches or trees from rivers or streams, at any time of year, without the threat of any prosecution for doing so;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; urgently proceed with clearing the remainder of the Flesk and Laune rivers, to protect the safety of residents and businesses in Killarney and Killorglin, together with similar works to be carried out on the Maine and Gweestin rivers in mid-Kerry and Castleisland areas; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; expediate significant capital allocations to at risk towns across the country, such as Kenmare and Bantry, for flood remediation measures, while also ensuring short-term alleviation measures, such as clearing out under all bridges, occurs. <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank Mair&eacute;ad McGrath and Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill for their help in putting together this motion and my Independent colleagues for allowing it to be put forward.  Flooding is hitting every area but in recent months west Cork has been savaged by severe floods that have cost tens of thousands of euro of damage to property.  My Independent colleagues agreed to this motion, but I can assure the House that in places like Kerry, Tipperary, Limerick and Offaly, flooding is equally relevant.<\/p><p>I take this opportunity to also thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, for visiting west Cork on numerous occasions, once taking time out from a family holiday to do so.  The floods struck at a time of the year when nobody expected them and the Minister of State took time away from his family break to visit west Cork.  That was greatly appreciated and I welcomed the opportunity to accompany him at that time as there were issues of concern in west Cork, other than the serious flooding issue, that needed to be discussed.  I also thank the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, for visiting west Cork to see private and businesses properties that had been destroyed and to engage with the community.  I am, however, somewhat disappointed - given his responsibility for public expenditure and reform - that no proper funding was put in place following that visit because he did see first hand the devastation to businesses, be it in Rosscarbery, Skibbereen, Rathbarry, Connonagh, Leap, Bantry or Bandon.  The humanitarian aid was the best package available.  I will comment further on that later.  All of the ministerial visits to west Cork were important for us, as public representatives, and for members of the public, who welcomed the opportunity to air their serious concerns.<\/p><p>We hear about floods being an act of God.  Some people say that they are related to global warming.  In many cases, flooding occurs due to pure and utter neglect.  We often also hear that flooding occurs once in every 100 years.  As many areas in west Cork were flooded on two occasions in the space of a month or two, all of those reasons go out the window.  Global warming gets the blame for many issues and it gets governments throughout the world off the hook.  I have met many of the groups involved in this area.  I met them with the Minister and I also met individuals in places like Rosscarbery and so on.  Rivers need to be cleared out and laws need to be changed to allow the local authorities to do that work, particularly in the Rosscarbery area.  In regard to Skibbereen, the Minister of State saw at first hand the business and private residences beside the Eldon Hotel and Cahalane's Bar that were destroyed.  While that project had been allocated a great deal of funding it was not finished.  At the end of the day, the issue was that a culvert had not been opened because it could not be opened.  There were red alerts issued and council staff were not allowed out to work.  This was about rainwater, not roofs falling down onto the street.  Unfortunately, businesses like the Eldon Hotel were destroyed.  To date, those businesses have not received any funding.  The same applies in respect of other businesses along the route in question.<\/p><p>Businesses are being hit by the Covid pandemic and by flooding.  West Cork has been truly hit in recent times.  I recently visited Rathbarry and I met many local people who told me that they believed the area was being flooded because there were no workers clearing roadside drains, culverts and so on.  Drains and culverts fill up with muck and dirt that needs to be cleared out.  The local people believe that the cause of this is the savage ripping up of roads.  The same situation applies on the Glandore Road.  In Connonagh and Leap, the people told me the issue is silt in the river.  Some people refer to it as muck but it is properly known as silt.<\/p> <p>It is simply that the rivers were not cleaned out.  The houses were flooded on two or three occasions.  The flooding went up to 4 ft, 5 ft or 6 ft in people's homes.  That is nothing short of neglect.<\/p> <p> Bantry has been struck twice in recent times, most recently a week and half ago.  When I was in the back of the car as a child, my father regularly had to move the car to stop the flood water from coming in when we were around Bantry because it would destroy the car.  We are now in 2020 and it is the same story.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, is saying that a major amount of work needs to be done.  At the end of the day, the works are not being carried out.  If the works are not being carried out, the flooding continues.  We will go down and there will be another flood and another announcement.  It does not make any difference.  The bottom line is that people&rsquo;s businesses and homes are being destroyed because works that need to be carried out are not being done.  Some of this work is quite simple but more of it may need a big investment.  Areas like Bantry and Skibbereen deserve investment.  I respect that there is investment going into Bandon.  I know there was an issue with flooding there again this year because some of the works have not been completed.  Money has gone into Skibbereen.  There is no point announcing moneys for an area if it ends up being flooded again.  We have proven that in Skibbereen.  As I have said, the culvert was the biggest issue there and it destroyed many properties.  There was little or no compensation.<\/p> <p> This has been going on for many years.  In my time in the council in west Cork, I tried to get the river in Ballylickey cleared out.  It completely destroyed the homes there.  The people living along that line are terrified.  That was in 2014.  We are now in 2020.  I have been listening to promises since 2014 that the river in Ballylickey will be cleaned out.  Apparently, it is on the verge of getting some funding.  As things stand, when major bad weather forecasts are coming, I get phone calls from the residents down there.  I took the former Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, and Shep the dog down to see the houses there.  Nothing happened.  It was not good enough.  They sat him inside in their kitchens and showed him pictures of how far up the walls of their houses the flooding had come, but nothing happened.<\/p> <p> The bottom line in most cases is that rivers need cleaning.  It is a simple thing.  In this situation we desperately need more roadside workers.  It is the only way we are going to get our water tables cleared.  Do we have to go back in time if we want to go ahead in this country?  When we had plenty of roadside workers, none of these issues were arising.  We can go back to global warming but that is the bottom line.  The people in Connonagh told me that when they cleaned out the river years ago, there was no problem whatsoever.  The same thing happened in Ballylickey in the 1960s.  They cleared out the river once.  They do not have to go at it every year, but it needs to be done once every ten or 15 years.  We decided to put in place laws and everything else to leave things as they are.  Unfortunately, people end up losing significant amounts of money and property, and businesses end up being closed down.  The OPW needs to have the rivers cleaned of the silt, the gravel, the muck, the branches and the trees.  Farmers must be allowed to do this.  It might be an opportunity for farmers because they are the landowners who are living with the rivers on the side of their own ground.  They should be allowed to clean out those rivers.  There should be no time limit or any kind of environmental excuse to stop people from doing this.<\/p> <p> I spoke last night with representatives of businesses in Skibbereen who did not get humanitarian aid.  Every sort of excuse has been given.  If one has insurance, or if one has a private house, one will not get humanitarian aid.  I have dealt with people who had no insurance because they could not afford to insure their properties, and they have been refused humanitarian aid.  In my view, for every ten humanitarian aid forms that are given out, just one or two applicants get it.  There needs to be a stand-alone package for people in the communities of Bantry, Skibbereen, Rathbarry and Rosscarbery whose homes have been destroyed.  Such a package would at least enable them to access some funds to repair the damage that has been done to their properties.  I ask the Minister of State to look into this because the humanitarian aid scheme is not working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400003#A00200","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604484600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>As a member of the Rural Independent Group, I am delighted to be involved in this motion.  I thank the hard-working staff in our offices, including Mair&eacute;ad McGrath and Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, for all the great work they have done with this motion.<\/p>  <p>  I am very aware of flooding issues in my constituency of Laois-Offaly.  The River Shannon causes flooding issues in areas like Banagher, Lusmagh, Shannonbridge, Shannon Harbour, Clonmacnoise and other surrounding areas.  The River Brosna causes flooding in Riverstown and Birr.  In County Laois, the River Owenass has caused much destruction to businesses and properties in Mountmellick in recent times.  I am aware of this issue.  We need urgent action.  It cannot be left any longer.<\/p>  <p>  A far greater degree of clarity is required on when the strategic programme of maintenance and removal of constrictions or pinch points on the bed of the River Shannon at the callows region between Athlone and Meelick Weir will commence.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has confirmed to me that progression of these works will be subject to full environmental assessments and that planning consent is required before they can proceed.  I sincerely hope the environmental assessments are not a cop-out.  We have to ensure this is not a desktop review.  There must be consultation with farm owners, landowners and property owners about this because the EU habitats directive is often enforced in a very unbalanced way and is abused and misused.  We do not need any excuses.  We need action, pragmatism and common sense to be enforced to ensure measures are put in place.<\/p>  <p>  I have some specific questions arising from our motion that I want to put to the Minister of State this morning.  I wish to seek clarity from him.  Perhaps he can respond to my questions in written form, or directly to me this morning.  Is the conveyancing of the River Shannon still going to take place, as agreed in 2019?  Was planning permission sought in respect of the conveyancing of the River Shannon?  Can he provide me with an update on this?  Will work on two pinch points, at Shannon Grove and Derryholmes, be prioritised because landowners are telling me that is where the real problems are along the River Shannon?  Will flood defences be put in place in Mountmellick?  We have heard about them but when will they be put in place?  I ask for an update on that.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the many groups that have been very active on the flooding issue over the years.  The Save Our Shannon group, which is based in west Offaly but also has members in Athlone and Galway, has done fantastic work to highlight this whole issue.  We need to ensure, out of fairness, that we are hearing what they are saying to us and that actions are taken here.  I appeal to the Minister of State to accept this motion.  We are listening to the people on the ground, the farmers, the property owners and the business representatives who are appealing to us, as political representatives, to bring all of the issues raised in our motion to his attention.  We are appealing to him to take them on board.  We will work constructively with him.  We need to ensure we have a commitment from him.<\/p>  <p>  I also ask the Minister of State for a definite start date on work on the pinch points, particularly those I have mentioned along the River Shannon at Shannon Grove and Derryholmes.  We need to definite commitments on those.<\/p>  <p>  As I want to be positive here this morning, I acknowledge the existing provision of &euro;1 billion in the national development plan to deal with flood relief issues.  It is an indication of some commitment.  Again, we need to see action.  People are disillusioned and disheartened.  It is very distressing for people.  It causes great upset when their homes, lands or businesses, which they have worked hard all their lives to build up, are destroyed by floods.  Let us ensure we put an end to that and we put proper measures in place.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to accept what we are saying in the motion.  We are in touch with the people on the ground constantly, as is the Minister of State.  I ask him to embrace what we have set out in the motion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400004#B00200","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604485200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to talk about this very important topic.  The situation is very serious.  I ask the Minister to listen to us as we are on the ground and we know what is happening.  There is nothing more horrible than when a house gets flooded and the water comes in the door or comes up the toilets, and the mess that leaves behind is never forgotten by the family it happens to.  It has happened a lot in our area.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad that, in one instance, after several deputations, many motions and my request to the then Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, to come to Glenflesk, he duly responded and he gave us a small amount of money, &euro;160,000 or so, to clear the bushes on a section of that river.  We were told by Tobin Consulting Engineers and by the CFRAM study that to do that work would only reduce the level of the river by 10 mm.  Until then, 16 houses were being flooded and the national primary road, the N22, was being flooded.  That work was carried out in 2019 and in all the floods we have had since then, even recently, no house was flooded and the road was not flooded.  Nonetheless, sections of work remain to be done.  The rest of the river from Gortacoosh and on to the lakes at Muckross has to be done, as well as the area coming out of the lakes and back along the river all the way to Castlemaine harbour. <\/p>  <p>  I will give one example of the situation.  The family at the very reputable Lake Hotel in Killarney had their premises flooded and it had to be refurbished and restored at a savage cost.  Their position is still the same.  The Laune river has been narrowed with bushes and with silt building up, and that work needs to be done urgently so what happened to them in 2015 and 2016 will not happen again.<\/p>  <p>  Kenmare, close to my own area, has been flooded, including businesses such as the Quill family business and the Horseshoe bar, and people in the square are under constant threat any time it rains.  There is a fall away from this square, and issues need to be rectified, such as removing a sewer that is blocking the iron bridge.  There is a fall to the bay and that work needs to be done.<\/p>  <p>  It is common sense.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to Kenmare and listening to those located in the square, which I appreciate very much.  Sneem village is being flooded and if there is any shower at all at the Inny bridge west of Waterville, that place is flooded.  There are also places like Castleisland and the small rivers around it.  The problem is that the local farmers and landowners are not allowed to take one spoon of silt out of the rivers, but then the town gets flooded.  The main river out of Castleisland needs to be cleaned out, given it was done in the 1960s and has not been done since.  Ongoing maintenance work is needed and it would not take millions to do this work.  It is only common sense.  There are plenty of excavators and all kinds of technical equipment for taking levels, so there should be no reason that this work is not carried out immediately.  As I said, work needs to be done at White Bridge on the Flesk river near Killarney, given that a caravan park there has been destroyed on many occasions. <\/p>  <p>  We then come to the small but important things.  The section man on the road was keeping the inlets open and ensuring the drains were kept open, but that is not happening.  This means floods are going into people's yards and in their front doors, and the road is now the river in many instances because the drains and inlets are not opened.  This is very simple, common-sense work.  We have no need for all these reports and assessments.  It is common-sense work.  If the Minister of State visited these places, he would see what needs to be done.  There is surely enough equipment in the country to carry out the work, and the manpower as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400005#C00200","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1604485200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;calls for:<br \/><br \/>- further progression of the whole of Government approach that is delivering returns to managing the flood risk and coastal change for rural Ireland;<br \/><br \/>- an examination of the current regulatory requirements to be carried out; and<br \/><br \/>- the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with responsibility for the Office of Public Works to undertake a consultation through the Oireachtas committee structures on how best to deliver flood relief measures into the future given the challenges of climate change.&rdquo; <\/blockquote>  <p>The motion put down by the Deputies is to question the scope of and progress being made by the Government to address the flood risk in rural Ireland.  I want to assure Deputies that I am very familiar with the devastation that can be caused by flooding for individual homeowners, businesses, landowners and communities, particularly in rural areas.  Since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, OPW, I have visited a number of areas affected by recent storms and flooding, including Kenmare, Skibbereen, Bantry, Clifden, Dunmanway and Kilmallock.  I acknowledge the Deputies who were present for those visits and the support they gave.  I have witnessed at first hand the damage caused, and I have met and spoken with the people and business owners directly affected.<\/p><p>The Government has a very strong record in regard to managing flood risk in rural Ireland through a whole-of-government approach.  I attended the last meeting of the interdepartmental flood policy co-ordination group and I was impressed by the extent of measures already in place and being progressed to avoid construction in flood-prone areas, protecting at risk communities and responding to reduce the impacts of flood events.<\/p><p>I want to address some elements of the motion put down by the Deputies relating to river maintenance.  In summary, the Deputies are calling for local authorities to have the powers, autonomy and ring-fenced funding to clear rivers, streams, gullies and drains; to remove obstructions along rivers; and to cut back roadside verges and hedges.  The Deputies want to encourage the use of dredging and ensure that farmers and landowners be allowed to remove branches or trees from rivers or streams, and take the build-up of gravel and silt out of rivers.  They are also calling for the OPW to carry out programmed maintenance on rivers and streams.<\/p><p>Statutory responsibilities for channel maintenance are clearly defined for both the OPW and the local authorities.  Funding and statutory powers set out by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage allow local authorities meet their responsibility for the maintenance of some 4,600 km of drainage district river channels and address local flooding issues, including verge cutting, tree cutting and cleaning of gullies.  Local authorities are an important source of guidance to landowners for the maintenance of rivers and watercourses on their lands, including tree cutting and silt removal.  I assure the Deputies that I will work with my ministerial colleague in regard to the powers and funding from his Department to local authorities to ensure they can adequately address river and roadside maintenance and also in regard to regulations guiding landowners&rsquo; maintenance of watercourses on their lands.<\/p><p>The OPW is responsible for the 11,500 km of river channel, including approximately 800 km of embankments, which form part of the arterial drainage schemes completed since 1945.  The annual maintenance programme by the OPW protects 260,000 ha of agricultural land.  While there are significant environmental issues to be addressed, the OPW does consider river dredging where it can be effective in reducing flood water levels. <\/p><p>The Deputies are calling for the Government to fast-track the delivery of the planned 150 flood relief schemes; make changes to the OPW&rsquo;s minor mitigation works and coastal protection scheme; and, informed by a review, consider a new single authority to address flooding issues on the Shannon, an issue I addressed in the House last night.<\/p><p>The catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme is informing the Government&rsquo;s approach to managing flood risk.  It was the largest study ever undertaken in the State of our risk from significant flood events - the 100-year floods.  Its output, the 29 flood risk management plans, gave the Government the evidence to progress some 150 flood relief schemes in addition to the 46 major flood relief schemes completed, which together will protect 95% of at-risk properties.  These additional schemes are being funded, as Deputy Nolan said, with &euro;1 billion as part of the Government's National Development Plan 2018-2027.  This level of funding reflects how motivated the Government is to protect people, properties, businesses and communities from flooding risk.  In just two years, this funding has allowed the OPW to accelerate, from 33 to 92, the number of schemes being brought through to planning, design and construction.<\/p> <p>The OPW staffing levels delivering flood risk management have increased by 22% since 2017.<br\/><br\/>Delivering flood relief schemes takes time to ensure that we design them appropriately and effectively, do not cause flooding elsewhere, and meet the regulatory requirements.  I accept that progress on this can be slow.  Even after consent is granted, schemes are still at risk of judicial review, as we are seeing with the Morrison&rsquo;s Island scheme in Cork.  I have met Claire Nash, a restaurant owner in this area, who has invested significantly in her business.  She told me that her premises was flooded in both 2009 and 2014 and that she still cannot get flood insurance.  We are now two years on from having submitted the scheme to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for planning permission and, in the meantime, homes and businesses remain exposed to repeated flooding time and again.  I issued an appeal during the week, which I reiterate now, in respect of the Morrison's Island scheme.<br\/><br\/>The current regulatory framework is such that progress by my office in advancing its programme of activities is significantly impacted by a broad range of regulatory requirements which must be addressed and complied with.  Like all individuals, agencies and companies, we have to comply with the requirements of environmental and planning legislation and these are simply outside the control of the Office of Public Works.  That said, I and the OPW are actively engaged with other Departments to ensure that required flood measures are delivered to communities in the shortest timeframe.  To that end, it is my intention to bring to Government a memorandum detailing the progress of the roll-out to date of flood relief schemes and the policy areas on which we believe further interdepartmental work will be needed.  There will be a particular emphasis on the areas of planning and environmental compliance.<br\/><br\/>Since 2009, funding of &euro;39 million under the OPW&rsquo;s minor works scheme is protecting 7,100 properties across more than 580 projects.  Two thirds of these are outside of the CFRAM study areas.  The scheme is a valuable source of funding for local authorities to address local flooding issues.  For example, while the OPW does not have statutory maintenance responsibility for the Flesk and Laune rivers, referred to by the Deputies in their motion, the OPW has approved &euro;240,000, or 90%, of the costs for a project at Flesk River, Glenflesk.  This is improving conveyance between Curreal Bridge at Glenflesk to Gortahoosh Bridge and Loo Bridge.  While funding available under the scheme, following a review, has recently increased by 50% to &euro;750,000, I am glad to give consideration to increasing this threshold to &euro;1 million, something I had already commenced before the motion was tabled.<br\/><br\/>I spoke in the House yesterday evening on the River Shannon Management Agency Bill 2020.  I announced during that debate that I am undertaking an examination over the coming months of the Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination and working group&rsquo;s legislative landscape, including a review of the current regulatory environment, to inform the establishment of this group on a statutory basis.<br\/><br\/>I turn now to the parts of the motion put down by the Deputies regarding humanitarian assistance, flood insurance and emergency response.  I pay tribute to the local authorities and to my own staff in the OPW for their response to severe weather emergencies, including flooding.  The EU Solidarity Fund is intended for overwhelming disasters following very severe and catastrophic events.  I am advised by my Department that any application based solely on damage identified by local authorities would not meet the damage threshold of 0.6% of GNI.<br\/><br\/>The Government&rsquo;s once-off voluntary homeowners relocation scheme is providing humanitarian assistance to those affected by floods in 2015 and for which there are no viable engineering solutions.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">, <\/font>is introducing a scheme to work with those worst affected farmers.<br\/><br\/>I have seen at first hand how flooding creates extreme hardship, in particular for those who do not have flood insurance.  The Government&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance schemes provide funds to homeowners, businesses, voluntary and community organisations that are impacted by a flood event.  I intend to work with my colleagues, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Social Protection, in regard to the criteria for these humanitarian schemes.  However, Deputies will acknowledge that if these schemes were extended to cover the uninsured excess in policies, it is very likely that the excess in all flood policies would move to exclude any amount covered by the State, effectively making the State the first line insurer.<br\/><br\/>In return for its investment in flood relief schemes, the Government expects protected homeowners and businesses to be able to access affordable flood insurance cover. However, through the OPW&rsquo;s memorandum of understanding with Insurance Ireland, we are already seeing the level of insurance cover increasing in protected areas from an average of 77% in 2015 up to 93% today.  However, the level of cover in areas protected by demountable defences remains stubbornly low.  I will be working with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to try to resolve the concerns expressed by the insurance industry about demountable defences and will explore how greater transparency to flood insurance can be achieved.<br\/><br\/>I want to address the parts of the motion addressing climate change and a coastal strategy.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has reported that for a 1.5&deg;C rise in temperature, the global mean sea level could rise by up to approximately 1 m by 2100.  Projections of more intense Atlantic storms could potentially increase surge events and wave heights.  Met &Eacute;ireann has also projected that in Ireland, the autumns and winters to come will be wetter, with a possible increase in heavy precipitation events of up to 30%.<br\/><br\/>The impact from sea level rises and more intense storms increases the risk of coastal erosion.  The Government has established a cross-departmental group to address this cross-sectoral issue.  I, along with my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, attended the first meeting of this group and we intend working with it over the coming months.<br\/><br\/>In the time allowed I have given just some detail of the work completed and under way by the Government that is comprehensively managing Ireland&rsquo;s flood risk and coastal strategy.  I will work extremely hard to ensure that the greatest possible progress is made on the delivery of a very ambitious programme of investment in flood defence and flood risk management measures.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge the motion.  I hope the Deputies see the benefit of the amendment I put down.  I ask them to work collectively with me in the coming months to try to see what measures we can implement.  If there are regulatory or legislative amendments they believe they can bring forward in the interim, I will certainly consider them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400005#C00300","speaker":"1494","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604485800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

This means rising sea levels, increased wave action, potential winter rainfalls and intense rainfall events.  Other factors are changes in land use through house building and other building developments.  These are factors that we cannot control.  However, what we do have control over is calling on the Government to be held accountable.  It must make a commitment to provide an update on the implementation of the investment programme.  That will give transparency to impacted local citizens and keep them fully updated.<\/p>  <p>  In its 2018 report the OPW stated that it will continue the minor works scheme as long as the funding is available.  As a builder, I know how important it is to do maintenance.  Unfortunately, the commitment by the OPW is less than credible as it only hires seasonal staff during the summer months.  They are laid off during the winter at a time when they are essential.  That is one of the primary reasons ongoing flooding is occurring in specific areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned earlier all the places he visited, including Kilmallock, in County Limerick.  After lobbying his office, and he was present, some works, although not all, have been carried out in Kilmallock in County Limerick.  I welcome that.  However, I went to Gotoon in Kilmallock yesterday to find out that the sandbags are still in place.  The people are still afraid that they will be flooded because all the works have not been carried out.  I am calling on the Minister to keep the OPW workers working all year round.<\/p>  <p>  Maintenance has a lot to do with the issue we are discussing here today.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said, and he is correct, that many of the roads in our counties are becoming rivers.  I will mention Kilmallock one more time.  There are people who are not living on a flood plain whose houses were flooded due to the road becoming the river and the culverts were not opened.  Who is responsible?  These people cannot get insurance again.  Who is responsible?  The Government is responsible.  No one other than the Government is responsible.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned Abbeyfeale previously to the Minister.  I visited a person, as has the Minister, who had to spend &euro;70,000 to protect their house from falling into the river.  That house was given planning permission by Limerick County Council at the time.  The land was sold by Limerick County Council, yet this person had to spend &euro;70,000 to protect the house from falling into the river.<\/p> <p>I visited Abbeyfeale to find out that the yard, adjacent to the four other houses, is now falling into the river.  They have called on the Government and they called on the previous Government to help them with the erosion that has been caused by flooding and the lack of dredging of rivers to make the water veer away from these houses, but this has not been done.<\/p> <p> I believe that the Minister of State is competent in his position, but I am asking him to make sure that the OPW keeps its employees all year round.  I am also looking for extra money for the local authorities so that they have a crew all year round to make sure that the gullies and all the drains are cleared so that the water does not flow down the road and into people's houses that are not on flood plains.  A lot of this is maintenance and I call on the Minister of State to make sure that there are enough employees and that they are there during the summer and the winter.  I ask the Minister not to give me the excuse that they cannot travel the land, because they can travel the rivers to do what they are doing.  The machinery and the workers are there.  All we need is an investment in maintenance all year round.  The amount of water that will be taken off our roads will be evident after one year of doing this and it will stop the decay of our roads.  We need to get the water off the roads and into the proper gullies and dykes, and to get them all cleaned out, and not have the farmers being brought to court for trying to clear rivers to save their properties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400006#D00500","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604486400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his proactive approach to this problem.  I know he is acutely aware of how serious it is and that he is extremely personally determined to help and assist around the country.  I will be looking to him to help County Kerry in particular.<\/p>  <p>  The horror of flooding and what it means for businesses and families is immeasurable.  I will give the example of a great local employer in County Kerry, started by the late Paddy Quill, namely, Quills Woollen Market.  The shops are located throughout Kerry, but unfortunately in Kenmare, for instance, its business has been very adversely affected on many occasions by flooding in the square, as have the residents of Scarteen Park.  Many homes have been flooded on many occasions and the same has occurred in Sneem.  There is a relief scheme, namely, the Kenmare drainage scheme, which in process, but I want to see it expedited and the work starting on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment those in the local Kenmare area office under the stewardship of Kieran O'Halloran and the great Jackie Horgan, our local foreman, and all the people who, in the middle of the night, have so diligently gone into businesses to try to help and assist in keeping the water out.  I want to cite those as examples.  The same situation has occurred in Killorglin.  In the area office there, Brian Hickey and Patrick Fleming, our local foreman, along with all the other council personnel, whether they are in Killarney, Glanbehy, Waterville, Cahersiveen, Listowel, Tralee and throughout the county, work diligently like a fire brigade, and along with the fire brigade, to solve the problem as it arises and minimise the damage.<\/p>  <p>  What we have to plan ahead and stop those types of occurrence.  How do we do that?  We do that by planning and putting in the investment.  I thank and compliment the OPW, for instance, in Killarney, the great people who work there in Castlemaine and Killorglin and other parts of north Kerry, all of the OPW staff and the private contractors who work for them.  What they need, and what they are relying on us to do, is to deliver the schemes and the funding.  We, in turn, are looking to the Minister of State and the Government to take this matter seriously and to give it the attention it deserves.<\/p>  <p>  We have a situation that has arisen over many years now, which is that in the past it was absolutely no problem for a farmer to go into a river and take gravel out.  There was nothing wrong with doing this and it was not damaging.  The ironic thing, when we talk about our fish stocks, is that we had far more salmon and fish in our rivers 20 and 30 years ago, when we were taking gravel out of them every day, than now.  Today, one would have a better chance of robbing a post office and getting away with it than going to a river and taking gravel out of it.  It would nearly be treated as the same type of offence.  Now that one cannot go near a river to take a scoop of gravel out of it, there are far fewer fish in the rivers.  Therefore, the farmers cannot be blamed for doing anything to the fish stocks.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment and thank the fisheries board and the personnel that I deal with in County Kerry because when I have gone to them to tell them that gravel needs to be taken out of a river, they work with the farmer.  I want that to be more encouraged and I want farmers to realise that it is not a criminal offence to go to a river and remove gravel from it.  I want this to be actively encouraged.  I cite the example of Lauragh, an area in my constituency.  I work with people there on a daily basis.  What I see happening there is as follows.  There is one particular river that is flowing at a higher level than the road.  With the first bit of a rise in the water level or a flood, the water is out on the road.  How can the council personnel do anything about that?  They cannot.  What we need to do is to encourage the digging out of the gravel at the base of the river, where it can be taken out in a proper fashion, working in conjunction with the officers of the fisheries board who are charged with protecting our rivers and our fish stocks.  We should all work together and not avoid each other.  When I think of areas like Bonane, outside of Kenmare, where there have been very serious flooding problems in the past and farmers have had lands devastated, fences knocked and animals carried away in floods, again we can work together to do a proper job.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for listening to us when we called for humanitarian assistance and to do so in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400007#E00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1604486400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Thomas Gould.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400007#E00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1604486400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>In 2012, there was extensive flooding in Glanmire in Cork.  On the night of the flood, I was contacted by distraught residents who told me about the damage that was being done to their homes and their businesses.  I travelled down on the night to find that there were no sandbags and there was no support from the Government.  Water was rushing through people's doors, destroying their homes and their lives.  I then drove to Cork City, where I went to a depot and got sandbags and travelled out to support the residents and do what I could, along with the fire brigade and council workers who were trying to save people's homes.  That was in 2012.  Those same homes in Glanmire and Meadowbrook are still not secure to this day, even though there was another announcement made in September 2020 about works being done, which was welcomed by Deputies from the area, who form part of the Government.  They should not forget that for years, Glanmire has been promised flood protection works, namely, in 2012, 2015 and 2018.  In 2018 here was an announcement of &euro;8.5 million with work to start in 2019, which was delayed in 2019 for a year until 2020.  In September 2020, we were told that the works would take place in 2021.  It is not good enough.  It is this Government, under Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, that has left Glanmire wide open to possible flooding.  The people of Glamire are sick and tired of announcements and promises.  They want the work done and they want it done now.  Will the Minister of State to give a guarantee here today that the people of Glanmire will see that work completed before next year?<\/p>  <p>  In 2010, the draft catchment flood risk management plan for Cork was published.  This included work for Blackpool, which is one of the most historical areas of Cork City, but also, unfortunately, one of the areas most affected by flooding.  As a councillor for the area, I witnessed numerous floods that have destroyed Blackpool over the years.  For years, announcements have been made on the protection of Blackpool and the surrounding areas, but still, to this day, Blackpool is not protected, the flood protection measures have not been completed and we have heard the same old announcements for far too long.<\/p> <p>I am sick and tired of reading and hearing about OPW reports on what will be done.<\/p> <p> The neglect of Cork North-Central, one of the most historic constituencies in the State, by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael has been shocking.<\/p> <p> I thank the Rural Independent Group for tabling this motion.  I welcome it because it is badly needed.<\/p> <p> I wish to comment on flood insurance cover.  I am dealing with residents, homeowners and business owners who have no cover.  Yesterday, we heard about the large profits being made by insurance companies.  In his contribution, the Minister of State touched on this issue but offered no solutions.  Will he get insurance companies to provide cover for homeowners and businesses that do not have any currently?  The Minister of State cited an entrepreneur in Cork, Ms Claire Nash, whose business was flooded in 2009 and 2014.<\/p> <p> Flooding has been a major issue and we need action now.  We are sick of promises and announcements.  We want to be constructive and to see things done, but for far too long, areas like Glanmire, Blackpool and Cork city have taken the brunt of flooding.  This situation is not good enough and needs to be stopped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400007#E00400","speaker":"1453","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604487000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Rural Independent Group for tabling this motion.  That we had a similar debate last night reflects the importance of this issue for many people across the country.  Yesterday, we spoke primarily about the difficulties in the Shannon region.  The main issue is managing water levels on the Shannon and making sure that works are performed at the appropriate times and there is a body to oversee them and ensure they are done properly and in a co-ordinated fashion.<\/p>  <p>  I will use this opportunity to bring the Minister of State's attention to a number of other areas, the first of which is Dromahair in north Leitrim.  The River Bonet flows across north Leitrim and into Dromahair.  On 29 June, Sharon and Michael Gethins's house was under 2.5 ft of water.  A flash flood caused devastation, with many neighbours and lands across the area flooded.  In fairness, the OPW has done a great deal of work on the river, but it continues to leave parts of it untouched because it is not responsible for them.  It does not go near the part of the river that flows through the village of Dromahair.  Anyone who walks there can see the rubble, including tree trunks, and overgrown vegetation.  They are not being dealt with.  In many instances of flooding around the country, it is normally just one or two small areas that need attention in order to relieve the rest.<\/p>  <p>  There are issues in the Drumcliff area of north Sligo.  Problems arose there around the end of June last year, with flash flooding and houses practically destroyed.  In one case, debris was washed down a river and blocked an eye of a bridge entirely.  It had three eyes originally, but now there are only two.  The county council has stated that removing the blockage poses it environmental issues.  In fairness, the Minister of State mentioned last night how there were many problems with getting approval, given the environmental issues involved.  Sometimes, floods leave debris behind and it is treated as if it is some kind of national asset that we should hold onto.  A little common sense needs to be brought to bear and this matter must be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The main issue in most areas is trying to get the correct body to do the work.  The OPW is responsible in some cases but not in others and there are whole areas where it does not deal with flooding.  Many areas of Leitrim and Sligo used to have river drainage boards.  They were dissolved, as was the funding that had been going to them.  That left a major problem.  The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell river drainage board operated for many years.  I was a member of it.  It worked under Cavan and Leitrim County Councils to provide drainage and funding for same.  Minor works were done to keep drains open and rivers flowing across vast areas of land.  The same situation obtained in many areas.  Funding was removed and councils were made responsible, but they were given no money.  If one now wants to have rivers drained, the county manager asks from what road that funding will be taken.  There needs to be a recognition of this significant problem.  Not only must the previous drainage boards be re-established within local authorities, but new ones must be established because the problem in many areas is that there is no one responsible.  If we can do that, we will move this situation forward a great deal.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of insurance arises regularly and I have spoken to many people about it.  A couple of months ago, I spoke to someone whose house, despite being on high ground, happened to be in a townland where an area had flooded previously.  No insurance company would give the person a quote.  Obviously, when companies put the application into the system, a red flag was raised because of previous claims for flooding in the townland and they would not offer quotes.  The house would not flood unless it was like the flood that lifted Noah's ark.  It is on a hill, yet its owners could not get insurance.  They had to get someone from an insurance company to come out, look at the house and take photographs before they could get a quote.  A bit of common sense needs to be applied, but there is an issue with insurers.  They do everything they can when there is a flood to wrangle their way out of paying and assisting people.<\/p>  <p>  All of this comes down to ensuring that we are on the side of the people on the ground, including the farmers whose lands are flooded and the people whose properties have been destroyed by flooding, and that we work collectively.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's work.  We all want to work with him on resolving the problem.  He accepted at least a portion of our proposal yesterday to have an overall authority for the River Shannon.  However, greater responsibility needs to be taken for all parts of the country where there is flooding, be they small tributaries of larger rivers, lakes or lowlands.  The only bodies responsible currently are local authorities even though they have no funds to deal with them.  This matter needs to be addressed urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400008#F00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1604487000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Rural Independent Group for tabling this important motion.  I wish to examine the impact of a level of flooding that used to occur only once every 100 years but now occurs every couple of months.  I know this best because I live in County Mayo.  At one time, only certain areas there were subject to flooding.  Now, however, more areas become flood zones whenever there is a storm or rain.  The people affected are living in fear of every storm and rainfall, but they should not have to.<\/p>  <p>  I will discuss what happened to the Mayo local authority's outdoor staff.  I am sure it happened in other local authorities as well.  Staff numbers have been cut time and again down the years, meaning that basic services and maintenance like cleaning rivers and drains and necessary minor works have not been undertaken because there has been no one to do so.  This has happened at the expense of local people.  The cost of removing staff who were doing a valuable job was never considered.<\/p>  <p>  Farmers and other landowners are not allowed to undertake basic maintenance.  In areas of special designation in particular, they are prevented from doing the practical things that would prevent flooding.<\/p>  <p>  There has been too much talk about some schemes.  For example, the scheme in Crossmolina has been talked to death, yet there has not been proper consultation.  In many situations, local landowners, businesses and homeowners know what needs to be done.  Where Crossmolina is concerned, they know that the River Deel did not overflow years ago.  Silt has been allowed to build up over the years and is constantly causing flooding.  There needs to be better consultation with local people who know what the solutions are.  I am not taking away from the fact that design and planning are necessary, but far too much money is being spent on design, planning and consultants.<\/p> <p>The Government's &euro;1 billion investment over the national development plan up to 2027 is very welcome but there has to be accountability around it with regard to who is in charge and where they are.  Who is accountable?  What monitoring and measuring is being done on the implementation of these plans?  Where is the money being spent?<\/p> <p> The money to local authorities also needs to be ring-fenced to do this so we are not constantly in a crisis management situation.  When I leave home on a Monday or a Tuesday morning I never know if I will be able to get here or not.  I live on the Mullet Peninsula and the road is constantly flooded at Bundoola when the whole peninsula is cut off.  People trying to access hospitals or to get out just do not know what is going to happen.  We are in the lap of the gods every time.<\/p> <p> There needs to be work done and it needs to be speeded up.  Everything is happening too slowly.  We then have situations like that in Westport where money was allocated four years ago and yet the work still has not been done.  Carrowholly has also continued in the same way where the work has not been done.  On-the-ground staff need to be appointed and we need accountability and tracing of the works that need to be done.  When the work is done, those places need to be taken out of the flood risk areas so if people want to sell their homes the values of the homes are not completely depleted also.<\/p> <p> We want to work with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, and with others in getting solutions to this, but we need to see much more action, and quicker.  We need to consult, listen to and feed back to the people on the ground about flooding.  It is not right that communities are living in fear of the next downpour. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400008#F00300","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604487600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Since 1995 my town of Midleton has been flooded 11 times.  In 2015 and in 2016 the Main Street was destroyed with more than 400 houses and 180 businesses affected.  I have listened to a number of speakers here and I believe it is down to resources, local staffing and local knowledge.  The lad with the shovel and the JCB for the country rural road is gone.  I also have an issue that we do not really know who is responsible for cleaning gullies anymore.  Is it Irish Water or the county councils?  Who is it?<\/p>  <p>  On flooding, planning and reports, it is grand to be making promises.  Midleton, in particular, has been waiting for the 2023 flood relief scheme that was supposed to start.  If it starts then I would certainly welcome it.  In the past three weeks parts of Midleton have been adversely hit by flooding once again.  Youghal was affected by flooding even though some remedial works were carried out there.<\/p>  <p>  I have mentioned this to two other Ministers in the last term here.  A CFRAM study in 2013 identified the problems along with solutions to alleviate those problems, but unfortunately that report was shelved and the works were not carried out.  The costs to alleviate the flooding were estimated in the range of &euro;25,000 at the time.  When the predicted one-in-100-year event happened it affected nearly 200 houses.  However, a one-in-100-year event can happen every two weeks or twice in a week.  There is a bit of misinformation out there in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  When I raised the issue of local flooding at that time, and the impact it has on families, it really aggrieved me that this particular study had given information that there would be more than 1.5 m of water deposited in one specific area where there are two semi-detached houses and a bungalow.  The water actually went to the fascia board and soffit.  That could have been prevented.  One family lost their family home and will never be back in that house again because it has flooded twice.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward this motion today.  We have to go back to the local knowledge and the common sense approach that the locals know their own areas.  They know the pinch points in rivers, they know where the problems are and they know where the trees will be or where the land is boggy.  It is devastating for families.  Consider the estate in Midleton called Lauriston, which unfortunately is adjacent to a rugby club that is adjacent to the disused railway.  The river banks broke, the water went through the railway line and channelled through the stone, which practically wiped out the whole area.  We were going to those people and saying that we did not know what was going to happen and that we did not know what the residents' insurance companies were going to do.  Another affected housing estate, Forest Hill, is on a hill.  I rang the insurance company and was told the area was a flood risk.  It is located on a hill equivalent in the height to where I stand now at the back of the Chamber compared to where the Minister of State is currently sitting.  That is the difference in the height levels.  We need to have a joined up approach on the insurance aspects also.<\/p>  <p>  I am not here to knock.  It is about everybody working together but I just wanted to flag the fact with the Minister of State that some studies have already been done and the information is there.  It is about resourcing the local authorities in the areas to carry out these remedial and preventative works.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of years works in Fermoy thankfully have worked, Mallow is fairly good and I have I mentioned the works done in Youghal.  Midleton, however, has many issues at the moment.  I have spoken with the area engineers on this.  They are appealing for help and funding.  The one thing we are very lucky with is the community spirit.  The Civil Defence, the Garda and the emergency services all pulled together.  If we can pull together in times of emergency surely as a body we can sit down in a committee and pull together  to prevent this.  Let us be honest, we live on an island that is covered by water.  Water is thrown on top of us.  If we do not come up with a collective plan, it is never going to work.  I appeal to the Minister of State to agree to the motion today.  I ask that he does not kick the can down the road and that he let us work together and work for everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400009#G00200","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1604487600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I welcome the motion, which the Labour Party will support.  I thank the Minister of State for specifically making reference to Cork.  There has been much rhetoric in Cork and many harsh words from both sides with regard to this issue.  People have become very entrenched and it has gone to the law.  That is people's right if they want to do that.  I ask that calmness be restored on the issue in Cork.  I believe that people everywhere acknowledge that the works have to be done but there is a contrast in how it should be done, whether we go for demountable walls and a mix of other types of solutions, or whether we go for the tidal barrier.  It would be very useful to have the perspective of the OPW around the potential cost of a tidal barrier.  We have heard a range of figures but I am not aware that active consideration is being given to that or whether a price has been put on that.<\/p>  <p>  Business people and residents in Cork affected by flooding want a solution.  I acknowledge the Minister of State said he would not meet with the Save Cork City people.  I am not asking the Minister of State to do that but some mechanism needs to be found to bring all sides together.  This is something that my own party colleagues, such as Councillors John Maher and Peter Horgan, have called for.  They are on public record on that.  We just need a bit of calmness.  The rhetoric needs to be toned down.  Public officials who make public utterances on this issue need to be mindful of the fact that they serve all the people of Cork and all the views.  There is a legitimate question mark over whether the consultation process was actively engaged in after the fact, or whether there was a proper and due analysis of that consultation process.  I am not saying there was not but there is a question mark in the minds of people in Cork on whether there was an active engagement on that.  I ask the Minister of State to have due consideration to that issue also.  He is in a powerful position because he has management of the purse strings.<\/p> <p>That gives him weight and heft in the debate regarding Cork city.  I ask him to use his good offices to seek some sort of intervention, for an honest broker to come into proceedings to mediate a solution between the two sides before the debate becomes even more entrenched.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State also spoke about insurance costs.  I met with his predecessor, the former Minister of State, Deputy Canney, a number of years ago about this issue.  At this point there is a strong evidence base for the effectiveness of demountable flood defences in towns like Mallow, which is my home town.  I live a stone's throw from the Blackwater.  I have witnessed the efficacy of demountable flooding structures as they pertain to the Munster Blackwater, particularly for the towns of Mallow and Fermoy.  They work and there is an evidence base for that.  We have to take on the insurance companies that are not insuring residents and businesses in this area.  They are not applying the principle of fairness.  Where there is an evidence base and it is incontrovertible that the demountable walls work, there should be no issue in procuring insurance for one's premises.  I appreciate the Minister of State's statement that he is looking at this issue but it has been going on for too long now and we are always being fobbed off by the insurance sector.  Even though there is a strong evidence base before them, they continue to refuse to insure properties in areas where there are demountable flood defences.  I ask the Minister of State to redouble his efforts in that regard.<\/p> <p> A minor works scheme application was made in 2018 regarding flooding issues at Castlemartyr, County Cork.  We are now on the cusp of 2021.  I ask the Minister of State to take a look at the Castlemartyr issue again and to correspond with me on it if possible.  The Minister of State spoke about the efficacy of minor flood works schemes last night.  Where there are outstanding applications for such schemes, I ask that he consider giving them a degree of urgency.<\/p> <p> I posed a parliamentary question to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about the coastal protection scheme and Roches Point in Cork.  I acknowledge that the Green Party councillor Liam Quaide raised this issue previously and Paschal Sheehy of RT&Eacute; did a very good piece on it on 25 October.  There is a terrace of 11 coast guard cottages in Roches Point, dating back to the 1830s, where flooding is still taking place.  I understand that no application for works has come before Cork County Council.  That is something on which I as a local public representative will follow up.  If that application comes in from Cork County Council, I ask that the Minister of State gives due consideration to protecting Roches Point.  It is a wonderful place.  Its people are resilient and it is a key point within our county.  It would be great if this matter was given some priority and was progressed by the county council.<\/p> <p> In respect of Glashaboy and Blackpool in Cork, some concerns have been expressed about whether the length of the proposed culverts would have an environmental impact on flora, fauna and biodiversity in that area.  On foot of me raising the issue here, could I correspond further with the Minister of State about it or could his officials correspond with people in Blackpool who have concerns about whether culverts are the most effective way of dealing with that issue?  We will adhere to expert advice but these concerns nonetheless need to be addressed.  Glashaboy and Glanmire have had some degree of forbearance and I ask the Minister of State to progress that issue as well because it is vitally important for the residents of the area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400009#G00300","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604488200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward this motion.  I do not agree with all aspects of it but I welcome that it is highlighting the issue of flooding impacting families, communities and businesses across Ireland.  Last weekend we had the first of the winter storms, Storm Aiden, but west Cork has already been hit by wave after wave of flood events.  Bantry in particular has been flooded multiple times, but so many other towns and areas have been affected as well, including Skibbereen, Dunmanway and Rosscarbery.  The list goes on and this happened over the summer as well.  Families and businesses in these areas are deeply concerned about the risk of more floods as the winter storm season starts.  As the motion states, flooding has far-reaching and devastating impacts across a range of factors from the economic to the emotional toll.  Flooding is desperate at the best of times, never mind in the midst of one of the hardest years for communities and small businesses.  It is imperative that they are supported and that immediate action is taken to address the underlying issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to develop a two-pronged strategy that addresses the underlying issues and the immediate needs.  Policies that cause climate change, building on flood plains, poor maintenance of infrastructure, poor management of agricultural land and a lack of forestry all contribute to the increase in flooding.  We need to address causes as well as building defences.  Our planning, land use and agricultural policies need to reflect this reality.  We need to start looking at issues more comprehensively.  We need to adopt a watershed approach to river flooding which takes an integrated view of the whole river system.  Flood management projects must be rolled out alongside afforestation, habitat restoration, water quality improvements and better planning.  In coastal areas, wetlands and beaches need to be preserved and protected.  Over the summer, I was moving back and forth between local authorities, the EPA and the National Parks and Wildlife Service trying to ensure the law was being enforced for beaches such as Long Strand and the Garrylucas marsh.  We need a commitment for action in these areas.  We need to prioritise and use natural flood management measures strategically.<\/p>  <p>  For a people who claim to value the land, we do not value nature-based landscape solutions.  Forestry, bog restoration, planting hedgerows and sustainable urban drainage are essential and established cost-effective solutions.  When larger projects are necessary, they must happen in a timely manner and in consultation with local communities.  Too often, decisions are made for communities leading to unnecessary delays and objections, whereas a more participatory approach would help address local concerns at the outset.  Our flood management planning needs to adhere to the Aarhus Convention and EU directives on public participation to enable individuals, groups and small businesses to be involved in the decision-making process.  Local people have a deep understanding of the problems and potential solutions in their areas.  If the OPW took a more inclusive and proactive approach by involving the public in many of these issues, planning delays, reviews and objections would be avoided in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  As this motion states, the Government needs to accelerate its planned flood defence projects.  Currently, Bantry, which floods regularly, will not have the culverts to prevent fluvial flooding until at least 2022 or 2023 and the flood relief scheme for tidal flooding is not expected to be finished until 2027.  Those schemes are under way.  According to information provided to me by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the proposed schemes for Castletownbere, Inishannon and Schull are not even at the design and planning stage yet and are scheduled to be completed by 2027.  This is incredibly worrying for those communities.  In the meantime, the Government needs to put in temporary infrastructure and targeted supports.  If the square in Bantry is going to keep flooding for the next seven years, the county council should be funded to provide flood gates, at the very least, for premises and small businesses, as well as other small-scale but necessary interventions.<\/p> <p>As the motion states, the current approach to flood insurance is not fit for purpose and the Minister for Finance needs to work with the industry to come up with a solution for this.  While the emergency humanitarian scheme is welcome, it needs to be reviewed.  In response to a parliamentary question, the T&aacute;naiste informed me that 27 businesses from County Cork applied for the scheme relating to flooding events in August.  Of those, 17 have been successful, which is great, but four were unsuccessful and six are pending.  We need that system to be accessible to everyone who needs it.  Of the completed applications, almost one fifth are rejected.  A case in Bantry related to a technical requirement.  These places will flood again and again.  We should have systems that work for everybody and not against some.  Every business affected should get support.  The process needs to reflect the reality on the ground.<br\/><br\/>The motion also references the predicted increase in flooding events both in terms of frequency and scale in the coming years.  This increase, needless to say, is due to climate change.  Any action to address flooding must also include clearly defined, enforceable and just climate action.  Ireland has repeatedly failed to meet its moral and legal obligations to reduce emissions.  By this year, we were supposed to have achieved a 20% reduction in emissions on 2005 levels.  However, the Government's annual transition statement projects it will be in the range of 5% to 6%.  The current focus on efficiencies over achievements and placing responsibility on individuals rather than big industries has failed.  If we are serious about addressing floods and keeping people on the land, we need climate action.<br\/><br\/>People in rural areas, farmers and fishing communities understand the situation.  They know that change is inevitable and they have always responded to these challenges.  A just transition needs to be at the centre of all climate policy and rural areas really need that reassurance.  Without proper support and assistance in moving to more sustainable practices, climate action will be punitive, punishing the disadvantaged and those with no choice.  While the Government&rsquo;s climate action Bill is welcome, it is already clear that it has serious issues, with shortcomings on climate governance, accountability, target ambition and a glaring insufficiency with regard to just transition, which is important for rural areas.<br\/><br\/>Experts speaking before the Joint Committee on Climate Action, such as UCC's Dr. &Aacute;ine Ryall and Maynooth University's Professor John Sweeney, have highlighted issues with vague language and the absence of accountability in the Bill.  These criticisms are especially relevant given the Supreme Court's unanimous climate case ruling that the Government's unlawful national mitigation plan was deficient in detail on reaching targets.  I can only hope that the current Government has learned from this and will introduce the necessary detailed and precise legislation, which has accountability and a just transition at its centre.<br\/><br\/>Communities are going to experience flooding.  Homes, shops and business will be damaged.  This motion rightly demands action to mitigate these occurrences, and in the meantime to provide the necessary support for communities.  We need small-scale interventions now, not next year.  We need guarantee schemes and supports while we wait for large projects.<br\/><br\/>This motion has the right intention but I certainly do not agree with all aspects of it.  It is worth highlighting that it calls on the Government to, for example:<\/p><blockquote>\t&mdash; immediately introduce a &lsquo;ring-fenced&rsquo; budget to each local authority to allow for cutting back road-side verges, hedges, and fences in rural communities, in the interests of flood risk prevention and road user public safety; <\/blockquote> <p>The motion contradicts itself.  Damaging hedgerows is not in the interest of flood risk prevention.  If anything, we need to look at planting more.  The fewer roots there are in the ground, the less the soil is able to hold the water.  That is the basic science.  I am, however, in favour of its intent to address flooding and support rural communities.  People simply cannot continue to go through the trauma of flooding without more support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400010#H00200","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604488800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Rural Independent Group for its vision in bringing forward this motion.  I will start by referring to my own constituency, Galway East, and the Gort lowlands, Portumna, Kinvara, Loughrea, Athenry and Claregalway.  We have had flooding right across the constituency.  We have a unique landscape in Galway East, with many turloughs.  Much work has happened in the last four years to alleviate this problem.  The scheme at Dunkellin is coming towards a conclusion.  It is a drainage scheme that was on the cards for 40 or 50 years.  The Claregalway scheme is also nearing completion and it is showing its worth with regard to the money spent and the value obtained.  Many local people now have an assurance that the winters will not be as fearful as they once were.<\/p>  <p>  The Gort lowlands were in the public eye in 2009 and 2016 and continue to be.  We have had visits by the President, by taoisigh and by different Ministers.  When I came into the OPW, the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, and I put in place a collaboration between Geological Survey Ireland and the OPW to come up with some solutions.  I am glad to report that we now have an engineering scheme that is environmentally and cost beneficial.  That scheme is being brought to the next stage, which is full design and construction.  I said when I met the Minister of State that I think it is a scheme we will have to keep our eye on to make sure that it is done in a speedy manner and that we get relief for people in Gort and south Galway who have suffered torrential hardship over many years.<\/p>  <p>  Two other schemes are close to my heart.  One is at Portumna, where we need a scheme to protect Portumna and the boating area to make sure the businesses located there are protected and do not move out.  I know that is a project in planning and Galway County Council is beginning to move ahead with it.  The flood defence scheme for Kinvara is also important.  The local area has had a number of flood events.  Galway County Council is bringing forward a scheme for that area under the minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There are a few general issues I would like to raise with the Minister of State.  We met a number of weeks ago to discuss them but I would like to put my views on the record of the D&aacute;il.  There are a few things that I know we need to focus on from my time in the OPW.  The minor works scheme, which was introduced by Martin Mansergh when he was Minister of State, is a fantastic scheme.  It is of benefit to local authorities to put in applications for small and medium-sized projects costing up to &euro;750,000.  However, local authorities have to come up with 10% of the funding for these projects.  In these times, maybe we should reduce that to 5% rather than 10% because local authorities, especially in Galway, do not have the resources at the moment.  It flies in the face of trying to get the works done.<\/p>  <p>  I introduced a home relocation scheme in 2016.  That was a once-off scheme but we must look at that scheme again now to determine how we can put it in place whenever it is needed rather than having to review the scheme or bring forward a new scheme again.  At the time, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine undertook a feasibility study of a farmyard relocation scheme because a number of farmyards, especially in Galway, were totally flooded.  People had to move their stock out for months.  There was significant hardship to the families and animal welfare was threatened too.  Miche&aacute;l Cahill endured this.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine stated in a reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Naughten in May 2019 that it was looking at the feasibility of the scheme.  Maybe it is something we could take up with the Department.<\/p>  <p>  People have mentioned flood insurance.  Insurance companies look at flood risk maps and if there is any hint of a flood risk in the area, it is a negative for insurance.  This is wrong.  They should look at the history of insurance claims for flooding in the area.<\/p> <p>Maps are indicative; they are not the full facts.  That is something that must be emphasised when the Minister of State is talking to the insurance representatives.<\/p> <p> Channel cleaning creates problems throughout the country.  There are many anomalies and much confusion.  In some cases channels are in the charge of the OPW while other channels or rivers are in the charge of the local authority.  Then there are the channels which are under the charge of neither but are the responsibility of the riparian owner.  The farmer is usually the riparian owner.  Farmers are willing to carry out works, but there is a huge amount of paperwork to be done.  We must develop a scheme for the rivers similar to the local improvement scheme.  The local authorities could carry out the work and the local farmers could put a small amount of money into it, perhaps 5% of the cost.  Everybody wins in that case.  The local authority has the expertise to do the consents and to talk to Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, and the National Parks and Wildlife Service to ensure that everything is being done correctly.<\/p> <p> Another charge that is made is that when channels are being cleaned out the machinery and buckets being used do not have such an impact that they will get the silt out of the river.  It is a very light clean.  That is something we must work on with IFI to ensure we can do something meaningful, rather than just have a machine tagging along.  Channel cleaning is one of the major things we have neglected over the past 40 years.  There was a massive amount of drainage work carried out in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, but then we let it sit.  Now we have inherited a problem that must be dealt with.  The OPW should provide some funding from the &euro;1 billion available for projects.  Small projects such as cleaning the channels every two or three years will have more of an impact than spending millions when a problem has spilled over into communities.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister of State for his time when we met recently.  I have many ideas that I will share with him.  I also urge him to visit Gort in south Galway and Portumna and to meet the people there so he can get a good sense of what is being done in Galway.  I compliment Galway County Council on the fantastic work it has done in making applications for up to &euro;3 million in funding for minor works schemes over the past few years.  It is important that the Minister of State encourages the local authorities to make the applications because the local authorities can get the work done speedily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400011#J00200","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604489400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this.  I come from Galway city and represent the city and the county.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is present, is well aware of the problems in Galway.  The latest one was in Clifden in early September when the Owenglen river surged unexpectedly and severely.  It caused severe flooding damage.  The rain was unexpected and the flooding was sudden and severe.  We can list the number of people and properties affected.<\/p>  <p>  I have with me a report of the flood policy review carried out when Tom Parlon was the Minister of State in 2002.  It is a detailed report on the flood measures that must be taken.  The problems were highlighted 18 years ago.  We have moved to a completely different level since then.  I am not here to give out.  I am saying that we must work together.  We have no choice.  We are facing both a biodiversity emergency and a climate emergency.  I welcome the motion, although I do not agree with it in its entirety.  I certainly agree with what the Rural Independent Group is trying to bring to our attention, but the elephant in the room is climate change.  I will return to the local matters relating to local authorities and maintenance, which I agree with, but the climate change challenge and our emergency declaration have brought this to a new level.  Now we have to be grown up adults, because that is what the children are begging us to do, and state the challenges we face.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works has done a brilliant job.  I am one of its greatest admirers.  It has worked for many years to produce various plans.  Politicians were kept quiet when that was taking place.  That process is complete and now it is rolling out the projects it has identified and providing resources.  We must have an adult conversation on that.  The national plan for the next ten years has provided for a certain amount of money, but the D&aacute;il has been talking about monopoly money in the past few years.  I want to know what is needed so we can protect our communities, the money that is necessary and the timescale to roll it out.  Most importantly, what is the driving force?  Who is now driving this?<\/p>  <p>  As has been mentioned, the local authorities have been starved of funding.  There is a blame game taking place all the time.  I have visited the county councils, as all Deputies have, and am told they do not have money.  We are also being told they are cutting back on services.  The Rural Independent Group made a point about ongoing maintenance.  I live in The Claddagh.  I am lucky in the sense that where I live is slightly higher than other houses and I have not been affected by flooding, although my office has.  Other houses, however, have repeatedly been subject to flooding.  There is the insurance problem and the maintenance problem on the streets.  Let us take that practical problem.  I use a bicycle and I cycle through floods.  I praise the council because its workers come out when one calls them, but there are ongoing problems because of a failure to tackle the source of the problem.  On the one hand we are encouraging cycling and walking, yet we are flooding people.  However, that is minor.  My inconvenience is minor compared to what households suffer when houses are flooding and they cannot get insurance.  I welcome the Minister of State's confirmation that he is disappointed that progress with the insurance industry has not been as good with regard to the demountable solutions.  They appear to be an integral part of the solution and if the insurance industry is not going to proceed with us on that, God help us.<\/p>  <p>  Galway has been flooded many times.  There has been a debacle over what looks like a long tube in the Spanish Arch.  It has been subject to puncture and I have no idea of the cost involved.  It is being replaced.  We are in that type of debacle with regard to what the solution is.  I have the presentation to the council in 2018 and, as I will stick to my time, I will not go through it.  It identified the areas in Galway, including my area, the Claddagh basin, The Long Walk, Salthill, the Dock Road and down by what is called the swamp, appropriately, but known as South Park.  That is where walls of 1.2 m will be built.  Obviously, it will cause consternation.  What we need is open communication with people, a recognition that works must be done to protect us and to identify the best works while bearing in mind that Galway is a tourism city.  It is dependent to a massive extent on tourism.  The Claddagh basin is a protected structure, as are parts of The Docks.  How do we marry these two issues and do it in the most open and accountable way possible?<\/p>  <p>  I have a difficulty.  I worked at local authority level for 17 years.  The Wolfe Tone Bridge is the last bridge where one can see the powerful water from the Corrib going through.  Three reports were done on that bridge.  The first two told us that there was an urgent need to impose weight restrictions to stop heavy vehicles crossing it.  We never got sight of any of the reports but the third report told us that, suddenly, we did not need weight restrictions on the bridge.  I am cynical and I suspect it was because it was impossible to impose restrictions on the most important bridge in Galway.  However, this bridge is in trouble.  It has been cited as a bridge that requires work to be done on it.  I use that as an example.  It does not inspire me with confidence when we get two reports telling us to do something and the third report does not.  Now we are into a phase where Galway is referring to consultants.  With Clifden it went to consultants to get the solution to what happened with the Owenglen river.<\/p>  <p>  We must tell people openly and honestly that we have a problem here because of climate change.  There is also a problem because we neglected it for donkeys' years.  We left the OPW struggling and we ran down and denuded our local authorities.<\/p> <p>We took away their staff and expertise and we set up Irish Water, which is another story.  Now we have a climate change committee in Galway County Council and I am told it does not have staff.<\/p> <p> I am a blunt speaker and I appreciate bluntness.  I will work with anyone who is straight and blunt with me for the greater good.  That is what we need here.  If Galway County Council is struggling - we know it is one of the worst funded councils - how can it possibly tackle climate change or flooding on the roads if it does not have staff?  We have the local issues and not enough staff and then we have the bigger issue of how to deal with climate change in the best way possible to bring most, if not all, people on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400012#K00200","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604490000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400013#L00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1604490000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

What is very clear from this morning's debate is the devastating impact flooding has on citizens, on a local, regional and national scale, and in communities both urban and rural.  It is also clear that all Members of the House share a common goal of minimising the impacts on people into the future, while at the same time recognising that with climate change, the causes of flooding will likely become more severe over time.<\/p>  <p>  Following this morning's debate, nobody can deny that the scope and complexities of this issue are far-reaching.  Every action and decision needs to carefully consider a range of issues, to avoid having unintended impacts that are cause for regret in years to come, while at the same time putting our communities first.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, has set out clearly this morning the significant progress the Government has made, and continues to make, in addressing the flood risk across the country, including a very strong focus on rural Ireland.  He has outlined the continued commitment to delivering flood relief measures into the future, and to developing and delivering a coastal change management strategy to deal with the threats to the coast, in particular from climate change.<\/p>  <p>  The evidence and funding that is informing the Government's work, through the catchment flood risk assessment and management programme, and the Government's ten-year programme involving the investment of &euro;1 billion in flood risk management, are testament to that.  The hugely significant programme of investment on the capital flood relief programme, adding an additional 151 flood relief schemes to the 46 already completed, shows the Government's commitment to invest in, and improve, communities all around the country that are threatened by flooding from both rivers and the sea, both large and small.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, has also outlined the many other cross-departmental initiatives and actions under way to improve and implement Ireland's flood policies in preventing future flood risks and preparing for the more extreme floods.  In that regard, this morning's debate highlights the need for all Departments to continue to work together, to build on the work already done and to yield ever-increasing levels of protection and resilience for all our people into the future.  With these clear objectives in mind, the Government has committed to further progressing the whole-of-Government approach that is delivering returns to managing the flood risk and coastal change for rural Ireland.  It has advocated that an examination of the current regulatory requirements be carried out.  The Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW has set out his intention to undertake a consultation on how best to deliver flood relief measures into the future, given the many challenges in our path, notably that of a changing climate.<\/p>  <p>  I conclude by again thanking the Members of the House for their thoughtful and considered contributions and by re-emphasising the commitment of the Government to addressing flood risk and the impacts of flooding around the country for all citizens, not just those in towns and cities.  This is set out in the whole-of-Government approach to flood risk management nationally, and the Government is fully committed to implementing this policy.<\/p>  <p>  I also point to the significant work being carried out by the Department in Athlone.  I look forward to welcoming the Minister to Athlone to see at first hand the alleviation measures that have been carried out in the town, and also the significant amount of work that has been done by the staff of the OPW and the local authority on the ground.  I also acknowledge the further significant work to be done in Carrickobrien and rural areas in order to protect those vital communities from flooding risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400013#L00400","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1604490000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Ministers of State, Deputies O'Donovan and Peter Burke, for sharing time with me.  I also thank the Rural Independent Group for tabling this motion and giving us the opportunity to discuss it.  I am pleased its members are present to hear my contribution.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, for his contribution last night and again this morning when he clearly outlined his Department's position and the progress made, including the increase in the number of schemes from the previous total of 33 to the current figure of 92, and the 22% increase in staffing numbers.  It was very welcome to hear his undertaking to an examination in the coming nine months of the Shannon flood risk State agencies co-ordination working group, including a review of the current regulatory environment to inform the establishment of this group on a statutory basis.  It is also welcome to hear that my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, is introducing a scheme to work with the worst affected farmers, including consideration of the relocation of farmyards as an option.<\/p>  <p>  I work with various flood action groups, and in conjunction with the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke; the Minister of State, Deputy Troy; and Deputy Cowen on the Save our Shannon group.  They spoke at length to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, last night about various pinch points.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, is from Limerick, I am from Portumna and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is from Athlone.  As Ministers of State we have a vested interest in ensuring a focus is put on the Shannon.  I fully appreciate that we cannot solve anything overnight, but we all know that this November the levels in the Shannon are quite high.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, to do everything within his remit to deal with the issue.  It would be greatly appreciated if he could have a conversation with the ESB to address the water levels.<\/p>  <p>  I will work with the Minister of State and give him whatever support I can from Portumna and the constituency of Galway East.  I will also work with my Oireachtas colleagues within the constituency, Deputies Canney and Cannon, to ensure there is support across parties and across the Government.  As Deputy Connolly said, certain things are above politics and flooding and water are among them.  Where we can have straight talking and working together, this is what needs to be done.<\/p>  <p>  I was very taken by the honesty and openness in the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan.  We know him for that.  I have seen him as a straight talker for the past four years.  He stated: \"The current regulatory framework is such that progress by my office in advancing its programme of activities is significantly impacted by a broad range of regulatory requirements which must be addressed and complied with.\"  He is going to bring a memo to the Cabinet outlining the current programme of works that are ongoing, but where he finds there are obstacles it is very important that he is straight with us and tells us what is happening so that we know what to tell people on the ground, in terms of whether the Minister of State is working on an environmental or planning issue.  Where consensus is needed in order to progress projects, we must ensure that happens.<\/p>  <p>  Not only am I involved in the Shannon flood group, I am also involved in the N65 action group, which brings us over two different provinces and two different counties.  In Portumna, when water floods on the N65 the road must close.  It is a national route that brings us all the way to Rosslare.  When the road is flooded it means that people from Tipperary cannot come to Portumna and people from Galway cannot go to Tipperary.  Sometimes that might be welcome during the hurling season but definitely not due to flooding.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Canney spoke about flood defences for Kinvara.  When the high tides arrive and floods affect Kinvara they hit Galway at exactly the same time, in at the Spanish Arch.  Last year we ended up with a number of families being marooned.  The high tide flooding is a new occurrence in Kinvara.  It goes out as quickly as it comes in but it leaves serious damage and destruction along the way.<\/p>  <p>  There has been progress on the south Galway and Gort lowlands project.  We have seen the wonderful impact of the Dunkellin drainage scheme, which involved an investment by the OPW of &euro;8.5 million.  The relief that work has been given to the people of Craughwell is what the people of south Galway are now seeking.  The simple reason is that when the rain falls in Derrybrien it comes down at such a pace off the Slieve Aughty range.  The reason it comes off is because all the forestry is gone off that range.  In the past, some of the water was held on the leaves but that is no longer the case.  The water comes right down onto the people of Kilbeacanty and into Peterswell, down into Cartymore and Kinvara where it leaves a trail of destruction.<\/p>  <p>  Like my other colleagues in east Galway I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, to come and see it, but I do not want him to come when the flooding is at its height because we have had so many people come in the past.  I would like him to come and meet the people when we do not have the flooding.  He must tell us exactly what the Department's plan is, and how we can assist him because people are tired of chat after an event.  People want to have the conversation and the Minister of State should bring them with him.<\/p> <p>People want to come with the Minister of State on this journey and we want to see solutions.  There is no point in me jumping up and down when we have an emergency looking to put in the diggers in Kinvara.  I would prefer to know our pathway and our flows in advance of that.<\/p> <p> I wish the Minister of State well in his work because it is a challenging time from a climate and biodiversity point of view.  I compliment the work the OPW does.  My dad worked for the OPW for 42 years, meaning I have a real vested interest in it.  The men and ladies in the county council on the ground do significant work and are always there when we need them.  The Minister of State is proactive.  He needs to get out in front of this, allow us to come in behind him and support him.  That is the sort of Minister of State he is.  It would be really welcome, not just in Galway but right across the whole Shannon catchment area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400013#L00500","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604490600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>The next group is the Regional Independent Group with ten minutes.

I am not deaf.  Or am I?  There are other Members here too.  It is not just you, Acting Chairman.  Other Members have referred to us as everything.  We were bad enough to be tied in with a cabal that Shane Ross had before the last election.  We were mixed up with them.  We have a clear identity.  We are rural people and proud of it.  We are representing rural Ireland and urban Ireland, of which we are proud.<\/p>  <p>  I wish the Minister of State very well in his Ministry and I thank him for responding to areas, especially during the summer in Bantry and west Cork, which I visited.  I saw the Cosy Cabin pub and the damage and devastation done there.  We look forward to working with the Minister of State as we know he is progressive.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Canney.  When he was Minister of State, he came to my own area in Clonmel and other areas to look at issues there.  We need to get this moving.  We have talking about this and CFRAM reports.  Consultants take up most of the money.  There might be &euro;1 billion in the plan but the consultants will take at least half of that.  Consultants are needed to pick a bush or clear an eye in a bridge.  It is silly.<\/p>  <p>  I have to take issue with Deputy Cairns from west Cork.  When I saw the flooding in Bantry, I saw the beautiful the old mill wheel at the river.  A child or a blind person could see that it was blocked.  There was only 2 ft of space for water to go into.  The culverts must be cleaned.  The road inlets must be cleaned, as must the trees and bushes which obstruct the water flow off the roads.  I am not a climate change denier but I am for common sense.  Not a bush would meet one on two roads.  We have a river in Goatenbridge where Knockmealdown Active does great work with canoes and kayaking.  One cannot go down the river, however.  It is like a treasure hunt to get around the trees as they are blocked.  It is silly.<\/p>  <p>  I want to salute the work of Tipperary County Council, under Walter Doherty and his team.  When we had huge floods in Ardfinnan, they were out working might and main with families to keep the water out of houses.  I salute our newly appointed Garda Sergeant Niall O'Halloran, and all the community, who work together so hard, as well as the overseer in Ballymacarbry, County Waterford, Guy Roe, and his team, and Lanny Walsh, and John O'Meara in Cahir.  They are at the front line but we do not have enough of them.  The real problem is simple.  There is no maintenance of the roadways, of the inlets or of the watercourses.<\/p>  <p>  When I was a young county councillor back in 1990, I put a motion forward to Tipperary County Council that we do an inventory of every water gully, culvert, invert and drain.  We would have them forever as a result.  Some of them have been lost because they were blocked by farmers and construction when they should not have been.  If we had an inventory map, we could argue the point.  Under the Roads Act 1993, we have powers to put water in off the roads into lands.  We have to get Deputy Cairns's water off the roads to keep the roads.  Once one gets water on the roads, one can get frost on the road and it disintegrates with huge damage to cars.  I am surprised with that kind of talk that Deputy Cairns is against our part of the motion for cutting the bushes.  Is it okay to take the eyes out of people?  Is it okay to block the roads with the water flowing down the road instead of inside the ditch?  It is nonsense talk.  She should get on the wellies and go out to understand what is going on in these situations.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW did a great job in Clonmel with a 97% success rate.  It is pure nonsense and folly, however, if we are going to let the river build up every year.  Every bit of dirt that comes off this building and any building today goes down into the gullies and is washed into the river.  It is the same for farms or anything else off the roads.  This keeps rising.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Canney talking about putting the silt back into the rivers.  The silt must be taken out because otherwise the rivers choke.  All the schemes in the world will not keep the water out of Clonmel because the river will rise over it.  It is a simple thing.  If I fill this half empty jug of water here with stones, it will overflow.  It is as simple as that.  I am not an engineer or an expert but I am not an eejit either.  I have worked in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Farmers and landowners know this.  My God, do the people in the houses know when they are up to their elbows in water and sewage.  I have seen people with high waders going into their houses, including John Maher in Ardfinnan, Tommy Myles and others.  That happens time after time.  At this time of year when the flood weather season comes, people cannot sleep at night.  People got the special doorways off the OPW.  They are a help but no help when the sewage comes up the pipes.  When I walked down the street in Bantry, I saw gullies and tarmac lifted up.  That tells one that the water cannot get away.  Water will find its own level anywhere and everywhere.  We have to have common sense.<\/p>  <p>  I know of a family in Fethard, Dympna and John O'Donovan, whose house is in a place that gets flooded.  They have been dealing with the OPW for the past four years, begging for a relocation scheme or money to put the house up.  In Carrick-on-Suir, the family who own Treacy Fuel built a house on silts, like in Denmark.  They did not get a bob for it because they did not wait for the scheme to do it.  It is shameful.  These people are showing leadership but the OPW is too slow.  The schemes are too slow and too bureaucratic.<\/p>  <p>  We do not get enough money.  The River Aherlow floods at the Killaldriffe Bridge at Kilmoyler.  Will the Minister of State come down to Tipperary where I can show him two or three places where flood schemes have been done successfully and where they are badly needed?  There are schemes in my own village of Newcastle and near Dolan's SuperValu in Cahir.  Deputy Canney saw those great schemes when he was a Minister of State and had them pushed along.  More of them should be streamlined, however, and we should be able to do it differently.<\/p>  <p>  I want to thank our own local community employment scheme supervisor, Se&aacute;n Byrne.  The men in that scheme helped with sandbags to deal with flooding in the school recently.  If one does not keep the drains cleaned, one is going to get flooding.  With the sink in the bathroom, if the drain gets blocked, it will flow over.  It is not rocket science.  We do not need consultants.  We do not need people with engineering degrees coming out of their ears.  We need common sense.  When we had the men on the ground in the county councils and the OPW, these things were done.  Sadly, we have no men.  We have all pen-pushers now while outdoor staff have been reduced to a skeleton.  The areas they have to cover are massive.  If they sat into their trucks and drove them for the day, they would not drive across their areas, not to mind work them.  That is the problem.  We should have made that inventory of watercourses.  In legal cases, we could have proved the point.  They were there on the map but now they are gone and the damage is enormous.<\/p>  <p>  With clear felling, which involves timber being harvested and taken away by machines, the damage caused by water flowing down afterwards is reckless.  Then we have fellows who want to object to everything.  We saw it in Cork.  I saw schemes going on and a judicial review.  I accept people have rights.  However, we must balance rights with common sense too.  We must balance rights with the loss of property.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance loves a drop of water.  I have heard cases today of people on high land.  I have it too in Kilsheelan.  They would not be flooded even if Noah's Ark sank.  The insurance company drew a line through it because they are racketeers and gangsters.  They have never been touched by this or previous Governments.  There has been review after review of the industry.  Now with the pandemic, they will not insure people for this, that or the other.  They just take money and use the small print to get out of every claim.<\/p>  <p>  It is no fun having a house or a business flooded.  It is less fun when they flood annually.  I agree there is more rain.  I am not denying climate change.  We need to maintain the watercourses we have and make new ones.  However, we need the man on the ground with the shovel.  I am a machinery man myself.  We need the man with the shovel to do the small, tidy and neat work.  When the farmers were working, all the drains in the fields were cleaned at this time of the year.  October was the month for it.  The water did not come onto the roads as a result.  Our roads are being abused.  We have a finite amount of money to keep the roads.  A county engineer told me that one passage of a fully laden truck is the equivalent of 30,000 cars.  The trucks of the conglomerates and the milk tanks are large but they have to go.  We need to think wisely and be strategic.  Above all, we need to have human schemes.  These material schemes are not working.<\/p>  <p>That publican I visited cannot avail of the scheme due to technicalities and other reasons.  It is futile to put schemes in place and invest money when we do not do the necessary work of providing drainage and clearing rivers.  As Deputy Healy-Rae said, there were more fish in rivers when they were cleared.  I thank Inland Fisheries Ireland, Mr. Alan Cullagh and his brother and others who worked with me in Tipperary.  They are understanding and they want to work with the farmers.  Farmers do not want to damage the environment.  They want to drain their land and allow for fast-flowing rivers.  The port in Waterford, where the River Suir runs into the sea, used to be cleaned every ten years.  It has not been cleaned now for 30 or 40 years.  Silt is rising continually.  There is not very much common sense in this place.  It seems to be a scarce commodity.  Bureaucrats take over and we have no men on the ground to do the work.  Sin mar a deir s&eacute;.  T&aacute; gach rud faoin url&aacute;r<\/p> <p> It is time for common sense.  Our motion represents common sense and I utterly reject the Minister of State's attempt to delay this again through his amendment.  He is trying to kick it down the road for another time.  That is not usually his approach.  It is not the way he operates.  I have watched him since he came in here.  I wish him well in his role, but we do not want this amendment.  We want simple and plain action now.  We do not want big schemes and grand designs.  Look after the little things.  The late Albert Reynolds, a former Taoiseach, said, \"It&rsquo;s the little things that trip you up\", but if they are tended to properly, they will not trip us up.  Let us let the people who want to clean rivers and streams get to work.  We do not need the ecology watchers.  Deputy Cairns said that some are going around watching the jobs that are being done.  Let us look after the people, not watch them and penalise them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400014#M00900","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1604491200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1604491200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time at 9.50 p.m. today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400015#N00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1604491200,"counter":50,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400015#N00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1604491200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Yesterday afternoon the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that he accepted Deputy Leo Varadkar's version of events regarding his leaking of a confidential document to his friend when he was Taoiseach.  Yesterday evening Deputy Leo Varadkar, now T&aacute;naiste and leader of Fine Gael, came to the D&aacute;il to give his explanation of why he leaked this confidential and sensitive document to a personal friend and political supporter in April 2019.  His defence fell apart.<\/p>  <p>  We learned that the scenario that played out is more serious than any of us could have imagined.  Deputy Varadkar's core alibi, that he was operating a strategy to get the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, on board in the public interest, was blown out of the water.  The claims the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, made on radio, that the T&aacute;naiste's leak was part of an ongoing process of engagement with that organisation, are simply not true.  The Minister for Justice misled the public because there was no such process of engagement between the NAGP and the Department of Health.  There was direct engagement when Deputy Leo Varadkar's friend, the president of the NAGP, requested and was given a confidential document.  Similarly, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, claimed on RT&Eacute; news that the T&aacute;naiste's actions were not so serious after all because no amendments had been made to the leaked confidential document.  This is also absolutely untrue.  The truth is that the document leaked by Deputy Varadkar was not the final document and amendments were made by the time the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, voted on the contract on 19 May 2019.  As such, the T&aacute;naiste's claim that he was acting in the public interest has been exposed as absolute spin.  This was a dig-out for a friend and a political ally whose organisation was in free fall and who needed the information contained in the contract to try to fight for his organisation's survival.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that the T&aacute;naiste's leaking of this document was a one-off event and that it was not part of a pattern of behaviour.  He said the T&aacute;naiste had assured him that something like this had never happened before and that he accepted that assurance.  However, on the floor of the D&aacute;il yesterday evening, the T&aacute;naiste admitted very clearly that he has broken Cabinet confidentiality in the past.  The Taoiseach clearly was not aware of that.  He is aware of it now.  I want to know if he has asked the T&aacute;naiste about this.  Can he establish what information the T&aacute;naiste has leaked before?<\/p>  <p>  We also discovered on the floor of the D&aacute;il that the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, had also been approached by the T&aacute;naiste's friend looking for the same document.  Was the Taoiseach aware of this fact or did the T&aacute;naiste fail to give him the full facts?  Will the Taoiseach tell us what on earth is going on here?  It seems that members of Fine Gael in the Government are providing the public with wrong information and perhaps providing the Taoiseach with no information.  The truth is that this is a very Fine Gael thing - government by who one knows.  Thousands of struggling families are wondering if the reason they did not get an extension to their mortgage break is because another Fine Gael friend and former Minister of State, Brian Hayes, now represents the banks.  I have no doubt that people in businesses being ripped off on insurance costs will scratch their heads and wonder when they see another former Fine Gael Minister of State and friend, Michael D'Arcy, the Minister of State who was supposed to take on the insurance industry, jump ship and become a lobbyist for big finance.  This is the politics of the cosy club, of favours for friends.  I want to know what the Taoiseach is going to do about it, because the story is not over.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach promised yesterday that all documents relating to this matter would be released.  That needs to happen immediately.  We need the full paper trail.  Will the Taoiseach speak to the Attorney General to establish, for the avoidance of doubt, that the then Taoiseach did not in fact break the law?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400015#N00500","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1604491200,"counter":52,"content":"<p>When I spoke to the House yesterday evening, I made it very clear that I believe that what the T&aacute;naiste did when he was Taoiseach was not best practice, was inappropriate, was the wrong way to deal with that issue and was the wrong thing to do.  To be fair to the T&aacute;naiste, he had no issue with coming before the House.  He has come into the House, addressed the issue and answered questions for a quite considerable period of time.  He explained in detail what happened and his motivations behind what happened.  He accepted that his actions were an error of judgment and he has apologised.  As far as I am concerned, the fact that he has acknowledged that it was an error of judgment and that he has apologised is important.  He dealt with the issue at some length yesterday.  That is important.  I accept his acknowledgment of an error of judgment and his apology.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is not as Deputy McDonald has portrayed it in the sense that the contract with the GPs of Ireland, all of whom are independent contractors at the end of the day, involves very significant improvements, not just to the lot of GPs but to chronic disease management for General Medical Services, GMS, patients, something all Members of this House have been pushing for.  It was a significant advance in that regard.  The essentials of the agreement were out there as soon as the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, published a press release stating it had reached an agreement with the HSE and the Government which included the reversal of cuts under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Acts, the provision of &euro;80 million for chronic disease management in the community, better value in prescription of medicines, and provision for disadvantaged communities.  All of that was outlined in considerable detail in the IMO document.  That is the big picture.<\/p> <p>This was not some sort of private commercial project that would benefit a person materially or monetarily.  Clearly that is not the case and that should be acknowledged.<\/p> <p> The Deputy keeps raising the issue of whether the law has been broken.  I have made my own assessment in that regard but I am not a lawyer.  Equally, I have no intention of embroiling the Attorney General or anybody else.  The Attorney General advises the Government with regard to its agenda.  The clear agenda of the Government is to make sure we can bring society through a global pandemic that has enormous implications for people's health, lives and livelihoods.  The Government wants to deal, once and for all, with climate change and the existential challenge of climate change effectively and in a transformative way.  It wants to invest in housing and to deal with homelessness and the capacity of young people to afford to buy their homes and to provide a far greater degree of social housing next year and in the years thereafter.  Above all, the Government wants to invest in education, ensure we keep schools open and work with school communities to do that.  That is what the Government is about.  It is also about transforming North-South relations through the shared island initiative.  Those are the issues that I, as Taoiseach, am focused on and driving forward.<\/p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste came before the House yesterday.  In my view, he was accountable to the House for the actions he took when he was Taoiseach of the previous Government.  On the issue of documentation, yesterday I read out a letter yesterday that was copied to the Department of the Taoiseach during the time of the previous Government.  It related to GMS issues and not the specific issue at hand.  I asked the Secretary General of my Department to trawl through the Department and that is the one that has come through at this stage.

This has been another damaging episode for this short-lived Government.  By extension, the past few days have been damaging to politics.  We had the spectacle of a senior member of the Government being exposed for engaging in what can only be described as grubby activity for grubby purposes by leaking a confidential document to a rival union while the Government was engaged in ongoing negotiations with a licensed union.  The Taoiseach stated that the T&aacute;naiste described it as an error of judgment.  It was an error of judgment, but it was also wrong.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the actions of the T&aacute;naiste last year were wrong?  Will he ask the T&aacute;naiste to admit that publicly?  There were many weasel words yesterday.  The T&aacute;naiste's actions were either wrong or right.  Does the Taoiseach accept they were wrong?  Will he ask the T&aacute;naiste to admit that?<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is engaging in weasel words himself by talking about the essentials of the agreement.  Very minor elements of the deal were included in the press release, which comprised a five-page document.  The document that was leaked was a 108-page document.  There was an awful lot more there that was in negotiation and subsequently agreed.<\/p>  <p>  What added insult to injury was the fact that the T&aacute;naiste ludicrously dressed this all up as him somehow having a legitimate objective and, laughingly, claimed that he was honouring Government commitments.  This insults people's intelligence.  I think most people saw this episode for what it actually was.  It was patently untrue for the T&aacute;naiste to make that claim.  He engaged in a deliberate distortion of the truth.<\/p> <p>Very regrettably during the last couple of days this distortion was then repeated by a succession of Fine Gael Ministers - although the Taoiseach must accept they are his Ministers as well - going on the airwaves and trotting out cynically crafted spin lines.  I heard the Taoiseach repeating some of those which I think is beneath him.  It has been very damaging to public trust in politics.  I ask the Taoiseach to take steps to restore that trust and get the T&aacute;naiste to admit what this actually was; it was wrong.  Will the Taoiseach undertake an immediate review of the code of conduct for officeholders?  Those members of the Government are required to honour the existing code.  However, it seems it is okay with the Taoiseach for members of his Government to personally interpret that code as it was okay, it seems, for the T&aacute;naiste to personally interpret that message that this was a confidential document and not for circulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400016#O04000","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604492400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>No, that is not a correct interpretation of where I stand regarding the code of conduct.  As far as I am concerned, there is an obligation on all members of the current Government to adhere to that code in the spirit and in the principle of that code.  I hold strongly by that.  I have made it very clear that I regard what the T&aacute;naiste did in the last Government was not best practice.  It was inappropriate and it was wrong.  It was the wrong way to do things.  I have said that.  I think the T&aacute;naiste has accepted that and he has apologised for an error of judgment on that.<\/p>  <p>  The agreement was a &euro;210 million agreement.  The Deputy knows there is a separate issue on this in terms of the approach of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to all of this.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has very negative views of collective agreements with independent contractors and has taken actions over these types of agreements in the health service for quite some time.  That has not been highlighted in the context of this.  Be that as it may, in my view the essentials were out very early in terms of this.  Of the &euro;210 million, about &euro;120 million was for the reversal of financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts and about &euro;80 million for the chronic disease management.<\/p>  <p>  I have the statement from the IMO.  As the Deputy knows, there is significant detail in that document, which is dated 5 or 6 April.  It goes right down to maternity leave, contribution to locum costs and so on.  There was considerable detail at that stage.  As to the necessity to send it on to the NAGP, in my view it should have been published earlier in its entirety.  I think most people in this House called for the early publication of that agreement with GPs, because it involves very significant public money and involves investment in our health services.  Into the future, it seems to me that collective agreements of this sort with independent contractors will be more difficult because of the application of competition law and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.<\/p>  <p>  I am very clear on this and have been.  I think it was important that the T&aacute;naiste addressed the issue in the House and took questions on it at some length.  He acknowledged that he would not do this again and that it was an error of judgment on his part, but he did it from his perspective for the best of reasons and motivation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400017#P00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1604492400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>An error of judgment is not the same as saying that something was wrong, and the Taoiseach's deputy also knows that; he made that point.  The Taoiseach is also engaging in this distortion.  That agreement was not signed off by the IMO until 16 April and was not published by the Department for another month.  The code of conduct applying to a Taoiseach specifies that officeholders should respect confidences entrusted to them in the course of their official duties.  Patently it is clear that the T&aacute;naiste, when he was Taoiseach, did not do that.  I am asking the Taoiseach to address this problem.  It seems that the T&aacute;naiste is of the view that that code is open to personal interpretation, which should not be the case.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has a responsibility to restore some element of trust in Government negotiations.  In the coming months and years, unions, employers and social partners will be asked to engage with the Government in negotiations.  Can they trust the Government in those negotiations?  It seems that from the actions of the T&aacute;naiste last year they cannot do that because he interprets things to suit himself.  The Taoiseach needs to take action now to restore trust.

They are hoping the Taoiseach or representatives from his office and the T&aacute;naiste can make it to hear about their plight.<\/p>  <p>  One very important development is that KPMG in an action that I regard as bullying and trying to demoralise these heroic, brave, decent, hard-working mostly women workers, is threatening to walk away from the liquidation process, offering them an even more insulting &euro;500,000 when an already insulting &euro;1 million was previously offered.  It is suggesting that if the workers do not take this, nothing will be left for creditors, meaning even the State could lose out.<\/p> <p>That should make the Government sit up and act in a way that it has so far failed to do to intervene for these workers, since Debenhams is effectively threatening the State as a creditor.  All this is based on spurious claims which are being discussed at the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the failure of the Government to implement the Duffy-Cahill report and the way that companies like Debenhams hide assets which should be used in this case to pay a decent redundancy to workers.  The online business and other Debenhams assets have been hidden even though Debenhams stood in court in April and said that an online business worth at least &euro;30 million was an asset of the Irish company, which it is now claiming is an asset of the British company.  All this is contrived to deny these workers a just redundancy and now, possibly, to rob Revenue and the State of money.  Will this finally prompt the Taoiseach to engage with the Debenhams shop stewards to force the liquidator to sit down with those shop stewards to secure a just settlement where the actual, real assets of the company are used to give them the just redundancy and save them from having to stay on the picket line for the coming winter months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400017#P02000","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604493000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I have said numerous times in the House that the staff in Debenhams have been treated very unfairly and appallingly in this very protracted dispute by the company.

KPMG was approached to enter talks on behalf of Debenhams to try and resolve the outstanding claims.  Those talks, which were being facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, unfortunately broke down on Monday.  I will contact colleagues in government to see where we take this now in terms of the situation which has emerged.  I am not satisfied with that.  I acknowledge the stance that the workers have taken to protect themselves.  The Government has constraints with the legal framework on how liquidations are managed in the courts, which we must respect.  I hoped these exploratory talks under the aegis of the WRC might lead to a pathway to resolve the issue once and for all.  It has not borne fruit but my view is we should try to resurrect it.

We accept that the current system is not for purpose and we are committed to changing it.  That will take some time.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has accepted the expert advisory group report and we are committed to publishing a White Paper by the end of this year, informed by the recommendations of that group.  The White Paper will set out how a replacement for the direct provision system will be structured and the steps required to achieve that restructuring.  Following the transfer of this function to his Department on 14 October, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will progress the matter and make any decisions around future accommodation provision.  The Minister for Justice will address the recommendations relating to the international protection application process, including how to better engage with applicants who fail in obtaining asylum status or permission to remain.  In addition, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will engage with the report's recommendations on accommodation.  That will be challenging because it will mean significantly more construction of housing and own-door facilities, over and above what is in the existing housing programme.<\/p>  <p>  The process around the White Paper provides a mechanism to consider how these challenges can be addressed and dealt with.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is already taking action to introduce immediate reforms to the system, as recommended by the advisory group's intermediate report in June.  These reforms include a formal system of vulnerability assessment that will ascertain whether those needing accommodation when applying for international protection have vulnerabilities that must be taken into account when allocating accommodation, determining the accompanying services they need, monitoring the accommodation and services provided to those accommodated in our centres against the national standards that will come into effect in January 2021, and providing a means for people in the international protection system to open bank accounts and to provide access to driver licences.  All of these reforms will be progressed in tandem with steps to ease access to employment in terms of the applicable timeframe following people's arrival into the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400019#R00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1604493600,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I urge the Taoiseach to look up the excellent work of Catherine Griffin.

These deaths were not only tragic, they may have been avoidable.  So far, 50 people have died this year.  This means that by year end the number of people experiencing homelessness who have died on our streets will have doubled in 2020.  Does the Taoiseach agree that this alarming increase in deaths requires urgent intervention at Government level?  Has the Taoiseach brought this matter to Cabinet, and if not will he do so?  It is my own strong view that an urgent intervention is required and that this has to include an acceleration of the programme for Government commitments.<\/p>  <p>  The Government must enable local authorities to end the use of congregated or dormitory-style accommodation and to expedite expansion of the Housing First model.  It is clearly time now to introduce adult safeguarding reviews.  I believe there is agreement across the House on the solutions but we lack urgent action.  The challenge of all of this is not new, but the significant increase in deaths should be a cause for alarm for every single one of us.  In my constituency there is a proliferation of congregated homeless accommodation, but there is no wrap-around service in these settings for those with addiction or mental health issues.  This lack of support has an impact on the entire community.  Services are overstretched and waiting lists mean that people fall not just through the cracks but through chasms.<\/p>  <p>  It is unacceptable that we do not have a system of adult safety reviews in place for when a person who is experiencing homelessness dies as a result of violence, addiction or suicide.  Those who die are usually known to the services and yet no effort is made to understand how these same people met untimely deaths, despite these interactions.  We have to learn from these tragedies so we can minimise them in future.  We are aware that people who experience homelessness are at much greater risk of harm, addiction and significant mental health problems, and yet there is still no coherent State response for this small group of people who desperately need us to step up.  Will the Taoiseach prioritise these matters and bring them to Cabinet with the intention of delivering a whole-of-government strategy to tackle the increasing number of people in homelessness who meet avoidable deaths?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400023#V00300","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1604496000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I want to ask the Taoiseach about the Land Development Agency.

There is, however, absolutely no statutory basis to the Land Development Agency, LDA.  I do not know why on earth that councillors in D&uacute;n Laoghaire or anywhere else would vote to hand over public land, which could be used for public and genuinely affordable housing, to an agency that does not have a statutory basis but which seems, essentially, geared up to privatise parts of public land.  This is supposedly to deliver some public and affordable housing but in reality could be a back door to privatising parts of those many public sites that should be developed for public and genuinely affordable housing.  We also have no idea what genuinely affordable housing will be via the LDA.

My sympathies do go out to the families and all those connected to those who have died, and especially the people who were homeless who passed away in recent times and over recent weeks.  Our focus and priority is homelessness and the prevention of homelessness, with a holistic approach to dealing with the homelessness situation that involves not just housing but also the health services.  When I was the Minister for Health and Children I was involved in making sure there were health services on the ground and in the centres along with those who were providing homeless services at the time.<\/p> <p>We are committed to Housing First and to making sure it is actively pursued, but also to developing a fully holistic integrated approach involving health, housing and other services to help those with addiction challenges, for example, which is very important.  We also need to make sure there are supports in place when people are allocated housing provision.  That is something to which we remain committed.  I have spoken to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on this issue and I suspect there is no correlation between legislation pertaining to evictions and what has happened with deaths.  Deputy Paul Murphy made that point but I do not think that is the case.<\/p> <p> The eviction ban remained in place throughout the summer for anyone who was under any pressure as a result of Covid and when we were not in level 5.  After going back into level 5, the original eviction ban that applied during the first lockdown has been reapplied because one can legally do that in the context of a comprehensive lockdown like level 5.  It is constitutionally unsound outside of such a severe lockdown.  Those are the legal facts which the Deputies continue to deliberately ignore to develop a propaganda war against the Government on this issue.  We are committed to helping deal with the homelessness issue.  The Government has been in place for four months now and it is going to continue to prioritise this issue.<\/p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett asked about the statutory basis for the Land Development Agency.  We need more housing.  The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in less housing because of the first lockdown and so we kept construction going during level 5 because we need to build houses.  We need affordable houses, social houses and houses built in the private sector as well because we are not building enough houses.  Due to the first lockdown we will come in below target at the end of 2020 for the number of house builds the previous Government had targeted.  Every effort is being made to pull back and to achieve as close to that target as we can.<\/p> <p> I have worked with the Minister on the matter of the Land Development Agency and prioritised it as Taoiseach.  I want this agency to be put on a proper statutory footing.  It has gone to the Government and there are complex issues involved but they can be dealt with and addressed.  I have engaged with the Attorney General, who is engaging with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to get this legislation through.  If we are genuinely supportive of the need to end homelessness, we must support projects.  There are people on councils who have opposed every project since time began, it seems to me, and will continue to do so.  They will always find a reason.  We need to support projects now.  I have no issue with social housing on public lands.  We should pursue that but giving statutory underpinning to the Land Development Agency is designed to achieve that across the board.  That should happen and we should let it happen.  Let us get housing built. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400023#V00700","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","time":1604496600,"counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400024#W00200"},{"type":"question","time":1604496600,"counter":190,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[33529\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400024#W00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he has met with the Attorney General to discuss the position held by the Data Protection Commission as expressed in its observation on the data protection impact assessment commissioned on the legislation on mother and baby homes.","asker":"1501","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1604496600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Following discussion of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes on 28 October last, the Government issued a statement on the matters of recent public concern and the next steps proposed by the Government.

This concerns me because we were led to believe that there was engagement on this matter with the Attorney General.  Time and again the Taoiseach and his Ministers come in here and tell us that the advice of the Attorney General is whatever it may be on the day, but can we really believe them?

Does the State now have the authority to instruct them to release all the records?  When will the Minister reconvene the independently appointed collaborative forum for former residents of mother and baby homes to advise the Government on how to respond to issues of institutional abuse?

I held an online public meeting which was attended by hundreds of people, many of whom had suffered horrific abuse and who were very angry.  Their anger can only have been magnified by the information that has emerged since then that the Minister misled the House about the advice from the Attorney General.  There was no advice.  The suggestion was made that GDPR did not apply under the condition that it might jeopardise the work of this or future commissions, but that was not a basis under GDPR.  Why did the Minister claim he got this advice from the Attorney General?  Why did he claim something that simply was not true, when GDPR did not do as he suggested it did?  He wrongly suggested that it applied in a certain way.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, what was expressed by the survivors and those who had a stake in this matter was how angry they were that they were not consulted, were not part of the process and were not at the centre of the Government's considerations on how to deal with this matter.<\/p> <p>Even with the matter of the proposed archive, what is said by the survivors is that this is the place that the narrative will be set about their lives and histories.  They want to determine that narrative, not somebody else, and not so-called experts.  They want to determine the narrative about their lives and histories.  They want to have a real stake and involvement in how that archive is operated.  Even now, after the admission following the Data Protection Commissioner's intervention in the debate, the Taoiseach or the Minister said that the right to people's information and history is not absolute.  That is worrying.  The Government misled the House about GDPR and then said that a person's right to identity and history is not absolute.  All of that adds to the suspicion of a group of people who have been robbed of histories and identities and been abused.  There needs to be an admission that what was said was wrong and the needs, wishes and direct involvement of the survivors of the process, and the people whose identity and history are at stake, need to be at the centre of how we deal with this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400024#W00600","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604497200,"counter":195,"content":"<p>In the course of the debate on the legislation, the Minister was advised that his position was wrong.

It alarms me that the House was misled and that there were repeated public policy statements about sealing an archive for 30 years, which were clearly unlawful, and that it was echoed repeatedly as the position of the Minister, the Government and therefore the State.  This is concerning because it is the latest evidence in a long litany of evidence of the capacity of the State, despite everything that happened and that we know, to be in denial and to visit further suffering and cruelty on citizens whom it has failed badly.  The belated recognition that GDPR rights are real and will be honoured and vindicated by the State is good but I share the concern about the limitation of those rights.  Will survivors have a right to all of their personal information?  When I say all of their personal information, I include administrative files that tell the story of the institutions in which those individuals found themselves.

I initiated the inquiry into the industrial schools as Minister for Education.  Many people did not expect that would happen.  I was the first to do it despite many survivors having gone to successive Governments before that without any satisfaction.  Likewise, we introduced and started inquiries into the church in relation to sexual abuse.  I initiated the inquiry into Ferns, for example.  The then Minister, Senator McDowell, initiated an inquiry about Dublin and the then Minister of State, Barry Andrews, initiated the Cloyne inquiry, without fear or favour.  A previous Government initiated this inquiry into the mother and baby homes, which was designed to reveal and open up the story.<\/p><p>It is disingenuous and wrong of the Opposition and Deputy McDonald to suggest that someone was trying to undermine people's rights or to seal off archives.  That is the opposite of the intention of setting up a commission of inquiry in the first instance.  The same applies to the Magdalen laundries, which the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, initiated an inquiry into.  It was to open it up.  GDPR applies to all records since it is a European law.  People can apply for access to their data in all records under GDPR.  That is adjudicated on, as Deputy Barry knows.  The 2004 Act relates to certain people giving evidence so that we could find out what was going on  in those institutions, when people wanted to avail of confidentiality clauses so that they could be protected.  There is a good article by Patsy McGarry in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>which lays that out.  He made the point that the provisions of that Act enable us to find out much more and to have these inquiries in a more expeditious and effective way.<\/p><p>It is important that the Deputies opposite acknowledge their failings too.  They deliberately misrepresented the 2004 Act.  I could imagine the debate that we would have in this House this week if it was discovered that, having been told by the commission of inquiry that if he did not legislate, the records would be destroyed, rendered useless and redundant, the Minister did not act to legislate, and the uproar and furore that there would be in the House.  Those were the bona fide reasons the Minister brought in that legislation.  The Deputies need to show humility too because some of the assertions made in that debate were wrong and the Minister's bona fides were wrongly undermined.  He has no interest in closing off any archive, yet he was presented as such.  That was wrong and did not do public debate any good.  It did not help to ease the anxieties and genuine concerns of survivors, which should be all of our primary concerns.<\/p><p>The commission of investigation has compiled a database of all the mothers and children who were resident in the main mother and baby homes.  They said to the Minister that it is clear that this database would be of considerable assistance to those involved in providing information and tracing services under existing legislation.  They said the database would effectively have to be destroyed.  As the information compiled in the database is all sensitive personal information, the commission would be obliged under existing legislation, prior to the Minister introducing the Bill, to redact the names and other identifying information about the residents of these homes before submitting it to the Minister.  That is not what we wanted.  The commission stated that this would have the effect of rendering the database useless, and of course that is not what we wanted.  That is why the legislation was introduced.  I accept that it was in a hurry.  It was to make sure that by the time the commission's report was sent to the Minister, we would have protected the records for the survivors so that they could access them under GDPR, yet that was horribly misrepresented.  The Minister accepted that he should have consulted with the groups and he accepted some fault regarding communication, but in my humble opinion, it still should not have been misrepresented and distorted to the degree that it was that weekend.

First, the processes, custom, practice and expected standards applied to interactions between the State and others should be understood, respected and adhered to.  That means, for example, handing a confidential document to one of one's buddies because one is the Taoiseach and can do so, is not a solid foundation on which to build any type of robust process that will be trusted and can deliver for one and all.  The second matter that must be recognised is the reality of deep, structural inequalities in our society and the reality of low pay.  Entire sections of the Irish economy are low-wage jobs and often insecure employment, with all that flows from that by way of housing insecurity, fuel poverty and the other things we know, or at least should know.  Social dialogue must have as its objective not just a mechanism to tread water or to rehash the same age-old positions, but at its core a desire to land on social justice.  If it is not about that, one wonders about the value of engaging in it at all.<\/p>  <p>  In that vein, I want to bring two matters to the Taoiseach's attention.  They have been raised with him previously and, in fact, were raised by me and other Deputies yesterday.  One is the ongoing pay issue for front-line student nurses.  I am at a loss as to and do not understand why the Minister for Health is taking so long to resolve this.  No right-minded Government sends people into the trenches on the front line without pay, yet that is what is being asked of student nurses during a pandemic.  It is unconscionable.  These nurses have traditionally relied on part-time work in private nursing homes just to make ends meet, but that practice, rightly, is to be discouraged because of the risk of Covid-19 and our concern to keep people in congregated settings safe.  Why is the Minister for Health dragging his heels on this matter?  When will it be resolved for once and for all?  I note that the HSE has been unhelpful in this regard.  It has taken a quite entrenched position.  Be that as it may, it is ultimately for the Government to resolve the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Second, I wish to raise again the testing and tracing staff and the need to ramp up our capacity.  The essential point is that one cannot ask anybody to be on a zero-hour contract.  A Government that talks about social dialogue must be committed to social justice as its end.  Such a Government could not tolerate the type of sharp, abusive practices that zero-hour contracts represent.  If the State is making use of the services of an agency that engages in such sharp practices, the agency should be dropped.

There are many angles to that discussion, but one is the attitude the Government takes to negotiating with trade unions or representative organisations.  A huge contrast was glaringly apparent, and this is directly related to the issue of social dialogue.  At around the same time that the then Taoiseach was sending back channel packages to his mate in the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, he was refusing repeated requests from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, former Deputy Ruth Coppinger and others to engage with the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, the ambulance paramedics.  The then Taoiseach said explicitly at the time that one could join whatever union one wishes to join, but it does not have to be recognised.  The HSE does not have to recognise it.<\/p>  <p>  The then Taoiseach refused the requests to instruct the HSE to engage with the ambulance paramedics and said - this is relevant to the evidence the T&aacute;naiste gave yesterday - that the Government engages with the trade union movement through ICTU.  That was the Government policy.  I do not agree with that policy.  I believe it should engage with the organisations by whom workers choose to be represented.  Clearly, however, the then Taoiseach did not abide by that policy.  He operated a back channel to his mate in the NAGP, but would not extend the same courtesy to the ambulance paramedics, who are still denied recognition by the HSE.  What does the Taoiseach think of that in terms of double standards and not being willing to recognise the chosen representatives of a group of workers, in this case ambulance paramedics?<\/p>  <p>  I wish to make a second point.  On 20 October, I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of student nurses and the failure to pay them.  They were given healthcare assistant pay in March and April, rightly, for the major role they were playing in the dangerous environment of Covid-19.  The Taoiseach said that they should get the pay they got in March and April and that he would follow through on it.  Nothing has happened since then.  When I asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, last night about paying these student nurses, he essentially made it clear that it was not the Government's intention.  These student nurses are, in many cases, holding hospital wards and health workplaces together in the context of Covid-19, in which massive numbers of employed staff are out of work because of extraordinarily high levels of infection with Covid-19 among nurses and healthcare assistants.  It is unacceptable that we continue to exploit them when they are holding workplaces together on the front line in dealing with Covid-19.  There is much anger among student nurses about this.  The Taoiseach should follow through on the commitment he made to me on 20 October and ensure that the exploitation of student nurses ends and that they are given the respect and remuneration they deserve for the role they are playing in the fight against Covid-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400026#Y00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1604497800,"counter":205,"content":"<p>First, I am a strong believer in social dialogue and I am working with our social partners on the challenges facing society in areas such as housing, climate, education and health services.<\/p> <p>That is something that I want to strengthen during my time as Taoiseach.  These issues concerning how we could strengthen social partnership in the future were explored in the recent meeting we had with ICTU and IBEC.  My officials will work with the partners on how we can enhance and strengthen the existing LEEF programme and approach to make sure we can advance that agenda.  That very much speaks to the issue of social justice and also to the area of low wages.  I accept that the Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the gaps and disparities in income terms between different sectors of the economy.  The T&aacute;naiste has identified this.  The aim of working towards a living wage is in the programme for Government.  It is something that will form part of the agenda of the Government, notwithstanding the very difficult circumstances that we are in, with the implications of the pandemic and so forth.<\/p> <p> I have raised the issue pertaining to student nurses with the Minister.  I do not conduct the negotiations between the HSE and the INMO.  There have been negotiations and my understanding is that they are ongoing.  There are issues on both sides.  I urge that they would be resolved.  Nobody wants to exploit anybody in any situation.  I hope we will see a resolution of that and a positive outcome to the negotiations that are currently ongoing.<\/p> <p> In the context of the social dialogue and the remarks made by Deputy McDonald, one has to be fair all round.  The current public service pay talks will commence with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, leading them.  Public service agreements were reached under the previous Government and the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, was centrally involved in them.  There were no breaches during those talks.  My firm view is that the forthcoming engagement with the unions on pay issues will be robust and challenging but will be conducted in the normal way, as previous talks have been, with respect to both sides in terms of the confidentiality that applies to such talks and the teasing out of issues by the various parties to the talks.<\/p> <p> I take Deputy Boyd Barrett's point on NASRA.  He said he does not agree with the ICTU position.  ICTU has a very strong view about new unions emerging, splits from unions, and multiple unions creating difficulties in terms of efficiencies and the effectiveness of negotiations.  I have a bit of a conflict myself in this regard.  I was reared in a different environment and my late father broke ranks with the then Irish Transport and General Workers Union, ITGWU, and founded the National Busmen's Union, NBU.  He was a founding member of the NBU in Cork and was involved in much industrial activity in terms of strikes and other such actions.  He always strongly defended the actions he took at the time but, latterly, he also understood the need for balance and some coherence in the representation of workers in various sectors, in terms of how one pursues one's rights to pay, pension entitlements and so on.<\/p> <p> However, I understand the point Deputy Boyd Barrett makes.  Regarding the GP contract, because of the independent contractor status of GPs, it is in many ways one that must ultimately be adopted by each individual GP in terms of whether he or she signs on for the offer that is presented by the HSE in that regard.  My view is that if one has too much fragmentation in unions, that can be very negative too.  Historically in Ireland, we had too much fragmentation and that resulted in a lot of unnecessary industrial action and strife when unions were competing with each other to win membership and in so doing undermined workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400026#Y00400","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604498400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>NASRA is not doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400027#Z00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1604498400,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I am not talking about NASRA in that context.

Based on the advice of survivors and human rights lawyers, I and other Deputies opposed aspects of the Bill and proposed changes to help those affected access their personal information.  I welcome the change in approach taken but it is unfortunate that this did not happen at the outset.  The delay caused immeasurable unnecessary distress for so many.<\/p>  <p>  Three main things, among others, were being sought - first, that the Minister retained a copy of the mother and baby homes commission archive, to which he agreed; second, that an explicit guarantee that GDPR requests would be permitted, and the Minister has in essence confirmed this since the Bill was passed; and, third, the publication of an extensive index to the archive as this finding aid is necessary for people to access their personal information.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has yet to confirm the latter part, however.  The Minister still has questions to answer on this.  I had requested time to discuss this in the D&aacute;il this week but, unfortunately, instead we had to spend hours talking about the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s misunderstanding of what the word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; means.  The day after the D&aacute;il passed this Bill, we learned that the Government went against the advice of the Data Protection Commission&rsquo;s assessment.  Yesterday, we learned that the Minister was depending on legal advice from Department officials and not the Attorney General until the week of the Bill.  These are serious questions that remain unanswered.  I am asking for time to be secured in next week&rsquo;s schedule to address these matters.  It is the least people deserve and the Attorney General needs to meet with the collaborative forum to advise it as to how this happened.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, in response to incredible public pressure and the #RepealTheSeal campaign, there has finally been acknowledgement of the right of survivors to access their information under GDPR, which I very welcome.  I also welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s confirmation to me earlier today that all survivors of institutional abuse will be able to access their personal data, not just relating to the mother and baby homes commission but also the Ryan report and the McAleese archives.<\/p>  <p>  However, I think I am justified in treating these announcements with a degree of caution.  The Government&rsquo;s record on dealing with this over the past few weeks and, indeed, decades has been incredibly damaging.  People will understandably find it hard to trust that these promises will be kept.  Even with the Minister&rsquo;s recent announcements, people are already worried about what information will be redacted from documents and other bureaucratic barriers.<\/p>  <p>  It is absolutely essential that the Minister ensures the proactive and full compliance with GDPR for survivors and all relevant persons.  This process has to be underpinned by person-centred legislation and a nuanced understanding of the legitimate rights of so-called &ldquo;third parties&rdquo;.  The Minister must define this in terms of duties of proactive disclosure and protection of identity rights.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, the Minister promised extra resources to ensure GDPR is implemented,  for which we are all grateful.  It is crucial he engages experienced data protection law experts, preferably, including international expertise, to assist his Department and the Government in giving people their information.<\/p> <p>The Department needs to be prepared to provide individuals with access to its copy of the commission's archive, assist Tusla in remediating its practice, and instruct all other holders of historical abuse information.  It is urgent that the Minister brings in independent experts because trust in the Department's legal knowledge in this field is understandably very low.  These experts would be able to work with the Minister and the Data Protection Commission to create the necessary systems.<\/p> <p> The Minister has promised extra resources to ensure the general data protection regulation, GDPR, is implemented.

I acknowledge the importance of the issue of access to the commission's archive, which is due to be deposited with my Department at the end of February 2021.  I am committed to implementing fully the right of access under the GDPR for those who wish to access their personal information from that date.  I can confirm that my Department will provide appropriate guidance for individuals in good time to assist persons wishing to access personal information from this archive when it transfers to my Department.  I have committed to continued engagement with the Data Protection Commission to ensure that the rights of all citizens to access personal information about themselves under data protection legislation and the GDPR are fully respected and implemented.  The recent clarity provided by the Attorney General is very helpful in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter Bill 2020 was brought forward by the Government to provide urgent and critical legal clarity on the protection and future use of a database compiled by the mother and baby homes commission during the course of its five-year investigation.  The Bill was brought forward to preserve invaluable information, not to put it beyond reach.  Of critical importance in this debate is the development of future legislation on rights of access to birth information.  Future information and tracing legislation yet to be developed will provide a statutory basis for access to these records and will reduce the necessity to apply for the information in the form of subject access requests.  I have committed to introducing legislation to the Oireachtas on this point in 2021.  I have discussed the proposals for legislation on this with the Oireachtas Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to state that the records of the commission will not transfer to my Department until the end of February 2021.  This is to allow the commission time to consult all those who gave their stories to the confidential committee to ensure their wishes in respect of the inclusion of their names in the record are respected.  That was another amendment which I introduced in the context of this legislation.  I understand that the commission has compiled an extensive archive for which it will provide an index, which will be most helpful in providing access to the material.  Copies of records that were provided to the commission will be returned to the Department, along with many other records from a multitude of sources, when the commission deposits its records with me in February 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Department digitised and captured a significant number of these records in the course of making its discovery to the commission.  Not all contain personal information, but there is an immediate and resource-intensive task ahead in cataloguing and indexing all relevant records to assist in the effective management of subject access requests and related records management responsibilities.  This is a significant issue which requires dedicated resources and expertise to develop a workable and GDPR-compliant corporate solution.  As I have indicated, it is my intention to prioritise additional resources to this issue and it is anticipated that significant additional resources will be needed to manage current demands and those that will be made once the full archive has been deposited with the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400029#GG00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1604499300,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

However, it also seems that he was let down by his Department, or as the <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>put it, &quot;left holding the bag&quot;.

It must recognise the deficiencies in the Department, even if the Minister cannot acknowledge them publicly.  The Minister must immediately bring in experienced data protection law experts, including international expertise, to report to him as the data controller.  This is an opportunity to start a new chapter in how the State treats survivors of mother and baby homes and of other forms of institutional abuse in Ireland.  The mother and baby homes commission report will be published shortly.  That will be a difficult time for everyone affected and a time for self-reflection as a society.  It is so important that we get it right.  I would like the Minister to respond in writing on the potential for the Attorney General to meet with the collaborative forum to discuss goings-on in recent weeks.

I have engaged with survivors this week, including today, and I will continue to do so.<\/p>  <p>  There will be a range of new responsibilities on my Department in light of the clarification the Attorney General has provided.  I welcome these responsibilities but we must provide resources for them, which we are in the process of doing.  We must also understand how we as a Department can fulfil those responsibilities in a way that is fully compliant with the GDPR.  My first port of call in that regard will be the Data Protection Commission, which is the official advisory body on this and had flagged issues which helped to advance this matter dramatically.  I am very happy to engage with international experts as well.  Several names were suggested to me by the Adoption Rights Alliance when the Taoiseach and I met with that body on Friday of last week.

As a parent of young children I can really appreciate how important it is that our children are back at school and that we maintain a safe system that will allow them to stay there.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will be aware of the issue I am raising because I have written to her about it several times.  In fairness, she has corresponded with me on it several times.<\/p> <p>It concerns Greystones Community College.  The Minister will know it is a brand new secondary school which had its first intake in August of this year.  It had been planned that the secondary school would share accommodation with Greystones Community National School on a temporary basis in a new primary school building, but that building failed to open in September, as the Minister is aware.  The school was built by Western Building Systems.  I am sure the Minister can imagine the disappointment of children cycling or walking past a school every morning but not being able to go into it and not understanding why.<\/p> <p> When the school building failed to open, the primary school stayed in its temporary accommodation at Greystones Rugby Club, where it has been for the past five years.  At least it had a place to which it could return when it experienced the disappointment of not being able to move to the new school.  However, Greystones Community College, which is a brand new school, did not have anywhere to fall back on.  The management of the school did what it could.  The students have been housed in Greystones Lawn Tennis Club, which is totally unsuitable accommodation.  The students are in changing rooms and tennis club meeting rooms.  It is totally unacceptable.<\/p> <p> The Minister will know that all Deputies representing Wicklow have contacted her on this issue.  To be fair, I credit all of those Deputies because we are trying to work together to seek a resolution on this issue.  I appreciate the efforts made by the Department so far, but the school needs clarity.  It is not acceptable for the school to be in its current accommodation week to week and not know where it is going.  It is a very difficult time for children at the moment and we need to create as much of a sense of normality around school as possible, rather than their being in a situation such as this whereby they do not know where they will be after Christmas.  The students, parents and management need a clear understanding of where the school will be after Christmas.  Where will it be after Christmas?  What steps will be taken by the Minister's Department to resolve the issue around the school building?  When are the children of the schools likely to end up in the building?

The Department will progress this as necessary over the coming weeks in consultation with the schools and the ETB.<\/p>  <p>  The building project to deliver a permanent new 1,000 pupil school for Greystones Community College is planned for the designated post-primary site at Charlesland, as was referenced.  My Department is committed to delivering this site for the new post-primary school for the Greystones and Kilcoole area of County Wicklow and work is ongoing to achieve that as soon as possible.  Discussions are ongoing with the landowner with a view to acquiring the site.  As the Deputies will appreciate, any site acquisition process may be lengthy and there may be complex issues which need to be addressed during negotiations, technical assessments or conveyancing.  At all times, my Department must strive to obtain best value for the Exchequer while seeking to complete the acquisition as quickly and efficiently as possible.  The project to deliver permanent accommodation for the school is to be delivered under my Department's design and build programme.  As soon as there is sufficient certainty in respect of completion of the site acquisition, the architectural planning and design stage will be completed and, following grant of planning permission, the project will be expedited to tender and construction stages.  <\/p>  <p>  On the letter referenced by Deputy Whitmore, that letter was not forwarded to my Department by the contractor.  However, the Department has had sight of the letter.  There are several inaccuracies in that communication.  Notwithstanding that, there has been ongoing communication between my Department and the contractor.  Certain information was provided by the contractor at the end of September.  In October, the Department informed the contractor that further information was required.  That was provided at the end of October and is currently being adjudicated on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400030#HH00300","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1604499900,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response, but it did not give me much information beyond what I have received already from her Department or others who have received communications from her Department.

As I have discussed these issues with him before, I ask him to be sympathetic and to focus on solutions to the matter I am about to raise.  We are all aware of how critical high-speed quality broadband is to our daily lives.  That has been exacerbated during the pandemic and the recent lockdowns, which have now run for the best part of the year.  Following Government advice - it is absolutely the right thing to do - people are working from home <i>en masse<\/i>.  Certainly, through level 5 and the hard lockdowns, people are encouraged, advised and mandated to work from their homes.  They are doing so.<\/p><p>People are attending courses of study online.  Almost all third level courses are being conducted remotely and for a large period of the year second level was also being delivered as an online service.  With social contacts, household visits etc. banned, people are interacting with family members at the weekends or at other times through Zoom meetings and other online interactions, keeping in touch with the family and extended family.<\/p><p>Various cultural, heritage and information events have all gone online.  Any kind of conference, seminar or activity has gone online as well as essential Government services, including Revenue, healthcare, social welfare advice, online planning etc.  Pretty much everything a citizen wants to do or has to do for their daily life is now online.<\/p><p>In many ways this is a good thing.  It provides an opportunity to move to a different way of living and perhaps post-pandemic we will embrace that, cut out commuting etc. and begin to move to this.  That is a medium-term consideration for which this is even more essential.  Right now, there is an immediate need to address these matters.  To do all those things we need high-speed quality connection.<\/p><p>I represent north Kildare and I have no doubt this issue is replicated across the country.  I make no apologies for representing my constituency and the people I serve.  I am speaking today on behalf of the people in rural east Kildare - places like Rathmore, Kilteel, Eadestown, down to Tipperkevin, right along that west Wicklow-east Kildare belt, nestling in the foothills of the Wicklow Mountains, 17 miles from Leinster House, straddling the County Dublin border.  A place called the Four Roads is one step from Dublin and yet signal speeds are less than 1 to 2 Mbps download and virtually non-existent for upload.<\/p><p>This community is a very resourceful one.  It had 320 residents when it was last surveyed by the residents themselves.  They are used to solving their own problems in the way that rural communities do.  They are a highly capable educated professional community, including many engineers and IT people who have done their own analysis and investigation and tried to solve this problem.  They have been very proactive and have managed to an extent in the past.<\/p><p>However, with copper cables getting speeds of 1 to 2 Mbps, they are struggling as they try to run businesses from home, log in from home or do professional services from home where they need to upload and download files of significant sizes.  Students are trying to study.  I mentioned other services a moment ago.  It also is a black spot to get a 4G signal and in parts they cannot get a mobile signal.  This is not in the back of beyond; it is 17 miles from Leinster House straddling the Dublin border with a very high density of professional persons, people trying to solve these problems for themselves.  At this stage they cannot solve it for themselves.  They need urgent Government intervention.<\/p><p>I believe the solution is tantalisingly close.  The Blessington exchange runs up one side and the Naas exchange runs up the other side.  It would not be so difficult to connect them to one or the other.  I prevail upon the Minister to attempt to move this forward as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400031#JJ00500","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1604500500,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I share the Deputy's interest in the importance of this area.  The national broadband plan, NBP, contract was signed with National Broadband Ireland, NBI, in November last to roll out a high-speed and future-proofed broadband network within the intervention area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in over 544,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools.<\/p><p>The national broadband plan will ensure that citizens throughout the entire country have access to high-speed broadband services and nobody is left without this vital service.

Investment in County Kildare under the national broadband plan will amount to &euro;53 million.<\/p><p>I am advised by NBI that, as of 4 November 2020, almost 122,000 premises across 25 counties have been surveyed.  Of these, 2,818 premises have been surveyed in County Kildare, with approximately 1,500 in east Kildare.  For this purpose, east Kildare has been interpreted as from Kilcock to Naas to the border with Wicklow.<\/p><p>Surveys have been completed in Killashee, Oughterard, Naas rural, Rathmore, Kill, Kilteel, Carnalway, Gilltown, Ballymore Eustace, Bodenstown, Naas urban, Newtown and Donaghcumper.  NBI is now developing network designs to deliver the new fibre-to-the-home network to these premises.  Surveys are due to start in Leixlip, Maynooth and Celbridge in the first quarter of 2021.  NBI crews have started initial works for the network build in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Cavan, with the first fibre-to-the-home connection expected around December 2020 in Carrigaline.<\/p><p>Further details on specific areas within rural east Kildare are available through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates.<\/p><p>Broadband connection points, BCPs, are a key element of the national broadband plan, providing high-speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll-out of the fibre-to-the-home network.<\/p> <p>As of 4 November, 187 sites have been installed by NBI and the high-speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education for schools.  Sixty BCPs around Ireland have now been connected with high-speed broadband.  Although no current locations are in east Kildare, new locations are being sourced and can be progressed through the broadband officer in Kildare County Council and the Department of Rural and Community Development.<\/p> <p> Rathmore National School and St David's National School will be connected for educational access as part of this initiative by the end of the year.  My Department continues to work with the Department of Education and Skills to prioritise other schools with no high-speed broadband for connection over the term of the NBP.<\/p> <p> While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network.  The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to putting in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible.<\/p> <p> The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens throughout Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities.

Covid has also affected the national broadband plan.  The contractors who were due to arrive from the UK have been unable to come.  We ourselves and National Broadband Ireland are looking to see how it can catch up and whether the programme can be accelerated, which would be to the advantage of the company and the State.  That will not be easy, especially with the ongoing Covid restrictions and the ability to get people to work. People are also out of work because of Covid.  This is creating constraints.

The reason I listed all the areas which are being surveyed is because that work of assessing how to get to each house is critical.  That will help the national broadband plan be very specific and up to date on mapping the particular houses, areas and so on.  The key project is to take that survey and turn it into a works delivery plan.  I cannot give false promise that all that will be completed this year or next.

I do not know where we would be without either of them.<\/p>  <p>  Rural Ireland faces challenges all of its own.  The LEADER programme aims to address these issues, and it does a brilliant job, but the recent budget let them down.  The current LEADER programme for 2014 to 2020 ends on 31 December and it is expected the next LEADER programme will not begin until 2023, leaving a two-year gap.  The Irish Local Development Network and the South Tipperary Development Company tell me that this remains unaddressed.  Their three central concerns about budget 2021 were that it provided no funding for a new LEADER project in 2021, that no funding had been identified for the delivery and administration of the LEADER programme for 2021, and that no interim national rural development plan had been announced for the period between 2021 to 2023, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  A total of &euro;44 million was allocated for LEADER in the budget.

There is concern about the ability to pay staff as no funding has been identified for the delivery and administration of the LEADER programme for 2021.<\/p>  <p>  What happens to the LEADER programme in 2021 and 2022?  The programme for Government states that the government will \"prioritise a state-led rural development programme to bridge the gap between the wind-up of the existing LEADER programme and the implementation of the new programme\".  If the Minister argues that the overhang from current programme means there is no need for a new interim programme until later in 2021, he is effectively saying that there is no clear provision for LEADER programme providers or staff engaged in the delivery and administration of the LEADER programme.  He may say that as the transitionary phase of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, has not been determined, that prevents him from acting now.  However, budget 2021 provides for the delivery of schemes under the Common Agricultural Policy through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, notwithstanding the absence of EU regulations in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister confirm the delivery of an interim national rural development plan for 2021 to 2023?

This was in addition to the programme preparation and administration costs of the LAGs.\u00a0 As of 1 November, 3,530 projects with a value of more than &euro;139 million have been approved for LEADER funding by the LAGs.  A further 341 projects requesting more than &euro;21 million in funding are at various stages in the approval process.<\/p>  <p>  Due to delays at EU level, the next LEADER programme will not commence until 2022 at the earliest.\u00a0 The programme for Government includes a commitment to prioritise a State-led programme to bridge the gap between the current LEADER programme and the next.\u00a0 The objective of this transitional programme is to allow locally led rural development projects to continue to be delivered using the LEADER model until the new EU programme commences.  The duration of the transitional period at EU level has not yet been agreed.  Therefore, we are planning for the transitional programme to run for an initial period of 12 months, with scope to extend it if necessary, to align with the outcome of the discussions at EU level between the Commission and the Parliament.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The total allocation for the LEADER programme next year is &euro;44 million.

We have the power to effect change in regard to both Covid-19 and the economy.  Neither prospect is easy but, with continued effort, we can and will overcome the challenges facing us.<\/p><p>We confront the pandemic from a position of strength, based on the solid budgetary and economic foundations we have built in recent years.  We can borrow today and into the future to fund the supports needed to help our society.  Ireland has rightly earned credibility, respect and support for our economic performance in recent years and the improvements in our national finances.  We are now two weeks into level 5 restrictions under the Government's plan for living with Covid-19.  It has been a very hard time for very many people but we are pulling together and adhering to the public health advice in order to protect lives and livelihoods.<\/p><p>The Government is providing support in many ways, through its policies in regard to business, changes to our taxation system and vital schemes to protect households, businesses and jobs, namely, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.<\/p> <p>It is helpful to put numbers on the record in respect of the support being provided through these programmes.  As of 3 November, 40,800 employers were registered with the employment wage subsidy scheme while 330,000 individuals were in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment as of the week beginning 2 November.  At the end of September, some 70,000 businesses had availed of tax debt warehousing, with &euro;2.1 billion now warehoused.  With further support for the launch of the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, due later in the week, there have been more than 2,200 registrations for the scheme as of lunchtime today.<\/p> <p> These policies have been an essential lifeline for businesses, families and individuals and have mitigated the effects of the pandemic on the livelihoods of our citizens.  In my budget speech, I said that the health of the country and the health of the economy are interdependent.  The better our public health, the stronger our economic health.  We need to continue to get the balance right.  If anything, pandemic responses and our efforts to support our economy have widened our public policy response into areas that would have been unheard of earlier in the year.  <\/p> <p> One such response, the employment wage subsidy scheme, continues to play a vital and unprecedented role in supporting businesses through the current crisis.  As I mentioned in my budget speech, this is currently set to continue until 31 March 2021, although I have been clear that there will be no cliff edge after that point.  It will continue across next year.  The Government will decide on the form of its extension when economic and health conditions are clearer, guided by what the economy requires to support its expected recovery at that time.  Deputies will be aware that, in anticipation of the move to level 5 restrictions in mid-October, the Government decided to align the rates of subsidy available under the employment wage subsidy scheme with those provided for under the pandemic unemployment scheme, up to &euro;350 per week.  <\/p> <p> The changes to this scheme will apply until the end of January.  Their objective is to minimise the risk of movement from the wage subsidy scheme to our pandemic unemployment payment during the period of the enhanced restrictions.  The intention is to legislate for these rate enhancements in the Finance Bill 2020.  I will bring forward the necessary legislative text as an amendment on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> In my budget speech, I reaffirmed the Government's commitment to the 12.5% rate of corporation tax and our continued commitment to a corporate tax regime that supports economic activity and that is transparent, sustainable and legitimate.  Tax measures announced on budget day included an expansion of the tax warehousing provisions to include the balance of 2019 income tax and 2020 preliminary tax obligations for self-assessed taxpayers whose income has been adversely affected by Covid restrictions as well as the excess temporary wage subsidy scheme payments received by an employer which are due to be repaid to Revenue.  <\/p> <p> A range of other vital measures are included in the Bill to support businesses across the economy.  These are targeted at the agricultural, tourism, film, housing and start-up sectors.  The Bill also provides for the announced temporary reduction of the VAT rate for the hospitality and tourism sectors from 13.5% to 9% with effect from 1 November.  This rate applies to catering and restaurant services, tourist accommodation, cinemas, theatres, museums, historic houses, open farms, amusement parks, certain printed matter and hairdressing.  <\/p> <p> One of the key new measures announced on budget day was the Covid restrictions support scheme, which is designed to assist those businesses whose trade has been significantly impacted by, or temporarily closed as a result of, the restrictions set out in the Government&rsquo;s plan for living with Covid-19.  The scheme applies where Government restrictions prohibit or reduce access to a business's premises by customers, as is currently the case throughout the country.  Qualifying businesses can apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a cash payment to assist them and to provide targeted support during their time of need.  Registration for the scheme is now open and first payments will issue by the middle of this month.<\/p> <p> While Covid-19 is clearly the most urgent threat we face, we must not let it distract us from the broader challenge of climate change.  The Bill contains important changes to taxation to respond to this great challenge.  It implements the programme for Government commitment to increase carbon tax by &euro;7.50 from &euro;26 to &euro;33.50 per tonne of CO2 and to provide for a trajectory of increases out to 2030.  The increase in budget 2021 applied to auto fuels from budget night and will apply to all other fuels from 1 May 2021.  The additional revenue raised will be used to fund public expenditure measures to meet the goals set out in the programme for Government.  The Bill also makes provision for the transition of our CO2-based vehicle registration and motor tax regimes to the new, more robust worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure emissions test from January of next year.  As a result, our vehicle registration tax, VRT, regime will be based on emissions performance levels which are much closer to performance levels in the real world than is currently the case.  Further measures include the extension of the nitrous oxides, NOx, emission regime and the accelerated scheme of capital allowances for energy-efficient equipment.<\/p> <p> I will now take the House through the Finance Bill from the beginning but I hope that Deputies will appreciate that it is not possible to cover every single section in the detail normally required.  Further detail is, therefore, set out in the explanatory memorandum published with the Bill. <\/p> <p> Section 1 is one of a number of interpretation sections.  Section 2 increases the universal social charge, USC, thresholds in line with the increases in the national minimum wage applicable in 2020 and 2021.  This will ensure that the 2% rate remains the highest rate of USC that is charged on the income of full-time workers earning the minimum wage.  It also extends the reduced rate of USC for full medical card holders under 70 years of age whose individual annual income does not exceed &euro;60,000 until the end of the 2021 tax year.  Section 3 provides that pandemic unemployment payments are to be treated as an emolument to which Chapter 4 of Part 42 of the principal Act applies.<\/p> <p> Section 4 provides an exemption from income tax for certain payments made by or on behalf of the Health Service Executive to a carer in respect of what is generally referred to and commonly known as a home sharing host allowance.  Section 5 gives effect to the budget announcement that the dependent relative tax credit is to be increased from &euro;70 to &euro;245.  Section 6 provides an exemption from income tax for certain payments made by or on behalf of the Health Service Executive in respect of mobility allowances.  Section 7 extends the enhanced help-to-buy relief programme.  Section 9 increases the earned income credit.  Section 10 extends the sea-going naval personnel credit to 2021 and increases the value of this credit.<\/p> <p> Section 11 provides for the Covid restrictions support scheme.  Section 12 provides for the extension up to 31 December 2023 of the scheme under which accelerated wear and tear allowances are available for capital expenditure incurred on the provision of certain energy-efficient equipment.  Section 13 provides for the modernisation of the professional services withholding tax scheme, an underlying feature of which is the use of electronic means for the transfer of information, data and returns and some other technical amendments.<\/p>  <p>The commencement of the provision will be subject to ministerial commencement order.<\/p> <p> Section 14 provides for an amendment to the emissions-based capital allowances regime for expenditure incurred on business cars.  This provision will generally apply to expenditure incurred from 1 January 2021.  Section 16 makes a number of changes relating to encashment tax, including exempting companies which pay corporation tax and increasing it from 20% to 25%.  Section 17 provides that all intangible assets acquired from budget night are fully within the scope of balancing charge rules.<\/p> <p> Section 18 extends the period that the regional film development uplift will be available at the highest rate of 5% by one year.  Section 21 provides for the extension of the knowledge development box relief and section 22 makes amendments to address the situation whereby the same foreign currency transferred between bank accounts held by the same person has the potential to crystallise a chargeable gain or an allowable loss without an accompanying economic capital gain or loss.<\/p> <p> Section 23 makes a change that provides that the requirement for an individual to have owned a holding of at least 5% of the ordinary share capital for a continuous period of three years in the five years immediately prior to the disposal is being changed so that the shares can qualify for relief if they were held for a continuous period of three years at any time prior to the disposal of those shares.<\/p> <p> Section 25 confirms the budget increases in the rates of tobacco products tax and minimum excise duty for cigarettes by 50 cent on a pack of 20 cigarettes.  Section 26 provides for ten annual increases to rates of the carbon component of mineral oil tax.  The rate increases are based on charging an additional &euro;7.50 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions each year, as noted earlier.  Sections 27 and 28 provide for annual increases to the rate of natural gas carbon tax and solid fuel carbon tax concluding in 2030.  Section 30 waives the excise duty due on the renewal of on-trade intoxicating liquor licences in the licensing year 2020 to 2021.<\/p> <p> Section 32 provides for changes to the vehicle registration tax, VRT, charging structure under the new worldwide harmonised light duty vehicles test procedure, WLTP, European emissions measuring system.  This section also adjusts the nitrogen oxide element of the VRT charge.  Section 33 amends section 135C of the Finance Act 1992 by adjusting the amount of relief given to certain electric vehicles.  Section 34 gives effect to the motor tax changes for cars that are taxed on the basis of carbon dioxide emissions, as announced in the budget and mentioned earlier.<\/p> <p> On VAT, section 36 aligns the definition of immovable goods with the definition applied for the purposes of the VAT directive of 2006.  Section 37 provides for the 9% VAT rate and section 38 provides that the flat-rate addition for farmers is increased to 5.6%.  Section 42 amends the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 to provide for the temporary zero rating of certain goods used in the delivery of Covid-related healthcare services.<\/p> <p> Section 46 amends section 31C of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, which imposes an additional charge on certain share transactions.  Section 47 extends the relief for the consolidation of farm holdings and section 48 extends the period allowed for a partial refund of stamp duty where land is developed for residential purposes.<\/p> <p> Section 50 amends section 126AA of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 relating to a fixed annual levy of &euro;150 million imposed on certain financial institutions.  In order to maintain the yield for the year 2021, the levy is increased from its current rate of 170% to 308% of the DIRT paid in the 2019 base year.  Section 51 extends the termination date for consanguinity relief.  A number of miscellaneous sections are also included.<\/p> <p> Section 56 makes several amendments to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to facilitate improvements to the tax appeals process.  Section 59 allows the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations which require debit and credit card issuers to make returns in respect of online credit or debit card payments to non-resident businesses.  Section 60 makes a number of amendments to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act 2003 arising from the post-Brexit migration of shares and securities in Irish registered companies from a central securities depository, CSD, in the United Kingdom to a CSD in Belgium and the future settlement of trades in those shares and securities in that CSD.<\/p> <p> Section 61 provides for the inclusion of certain proprietary directors within the employment wage subsidy scheme from 1 September 2020.  Section 62 makes provision for warehousing of excess temporary wage subsidy scheme payments received by an employer which must be refunded to the Revenue Commissioners.  Section 63 section provides for warehousing of income tax payable through self-assessment and includes the balance of income tax due for 2019 and preliminary tax for 2020.  Section 67 provides that where a taxpayer appeals an assessment, and in connection with that appeal, makes a payment to Revenue and subsequently wins the appeal, the taxpayer will not be entitled to interest on the amount repaid.<\/p> <p> As is customary with the Finance Bill, there are still a small number of matters under consideration that I may bring forward as amendments on Committee Stage.  I hope the debate on the important provisions contained in the Bill can be conducted in the normal constructive way.  I will always listen to other viewpoints and consider any suggestions put forward during our debate in the context of additional Committee Stage amendments.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400033#LL00900","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604502900,"counter":248,"content":"<p>In finishing his speech, the Minister indicated his hope that the Bill could be discussed and scrutinised in the normal constructive way.  I agree with part of that sentiment, as there has always been constructive engagement, although we might disagree sometimes on parts of the contents of the Bill.  The reality is that this year there will not be normal scrutiny.<\/p>  <p>  In all the time I have been here dealing with finance Bills, this will be the biggest challenge because of the question of the pandemic, the settings and restrictions placed on us.  It is something we have dealt with in committee today in trying to figure out how to scrutinise this legislation in a proper and fitting manner.  First and foremost, we are legislators and the most important thing we do is pass laws that affect people right across the State.  We clearly have the intention of affecting them positively but that is not always the case, so it is important that there is proper scrutiny.  That will be challenging, given the issues facing us this year.  I hope some of the proposals I make can be considered so we can have proper scrutiny and time to consider all matters.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Finance Bill 2020.  I will speak to the circumstances and context in which the Bill comes before us before getting to certain aspects of the Bill in itself.  We will not be able to deal with all of it and it is not possible to discuss every section of the legislation on Second Stage but I hope we will have the opportunity for proper scrutiny of all the provisions on Committee Stage and later on.<\/p>  <p>  It has now been three weeks since the Government announced budget 2021 and it came at a time of great challenge for our people, our economy and our country.  As I stated three weeks ago, it came at a time of great uncertainty because we were faced with the challenges and damage caused by Covid-19.  Budget 2021 was a primary response to that challenge.  Since the pandemic began, Sinn F&eacute;in committed to engage constructively with the previous and current Governments in the best interests of the people while holding the Government to account, which is the job of Opposition.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in has done so since the outbreak of Covid-19.  This was evidenced by my engagement with the Minister and his Department as the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, was introduced.  At the time, I argued for greater levels of wage subsidy for low-income workers to protect incomes and enhance the take-up of the scheme.  I also argued that an administrative change could be made by the Revenue to ensure that women returning from maternity leave, in particular, would be eligible for the scheme.  These changes have come to pass and I welcome them and the fact the Department and the Minister were open to making these changes.<\/p> <p> On 1 September, the Government introduced the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  It is a scheme beset with deficiencies, which I have raised since its announcement.  This scheme reduced wage supports by up to 50% and excluded a cohort of the lowest paid workers.  It was clear from the time of its announcement in July, that the EWSS would be insufficient to protect jobs and support businesses while the threat of the virus remained in our communities.  Sinn F&eacute;in, as the Minister knows, was relentless in calling for the scheme to be amended, with higher levels of wage support for workers and their employers to avoid the loss of jobs.  We also made particular reference to the inevitable impact of public health restrictions as they increased.  The same was also true regarding the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, with the Government having cut the level of payment in previous months for thousands of workers who had lost their jobs as a result of public health restrictions.  These cuts were unjustified, and the future scheduled cuts are also unjustified.<\/p> <p> They failed to recognise the level of income loss across the State or the continued threat posed by the virus.  On 19 October, as the Government announced its decision to move to level 5, these cuts to the PUP and the EWSS were reversed, and a top payment of &euro;350 per week was reintroduced.  This was common sense and recognised that the previous cuts were ill judged while the threat of the virus and further restrictions remained.  It was also a vindication of Sinn F&eacute;in, with the Government implementing policy decisions we had been calling for in the previous weeks and months.  <\/p> <p> We welcome those policy decisions made by the Government.  Those changes were necessary.  The impact of Covid-19 and the level 5 restrictions on jobs in our economy has been seismic.  It has also had an unequal impact, however.  This is demonstrated by the increase in PUP claimants and income tax receipts recorded to date in 2020.  According to figures published by the Department of Social Protection yesterday, almost 330,000 people will receive the PUP this week.  That represents a 60% increase in PUP claimants from the beginning of October.  These figures confirm the unemployment crisis facing young people, low-income workers and those in the sectors most exposed, such as tourism and hospitality.<\/p> <p> The fiscal monitor published yesterday demonstrates the disproportionate impact that public health restrictions have had on low-income workers.  Income tax receipts up to the end of October have been almost flat compared to the same period in 2019, if we disregard the &euro;275 million deduction factored in by the Revenue as a result of the Covid-19 restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  These income tax receipts reflect the disproportionate level of job losses among those on low incomes.  We face an unemployment crisis, and without adequate income supports thousands of people would face an income crisis.  Supporting them is not just economic good sense, it is a moral imperative.<\/p> <p> As the Minister is aware, the PUP was introduced on 13 March as an urgent needs payment under section 202 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  Section 13 of the Finance Act 2018 amended section 126 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to provide that urgent needs payments under section 202 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 would be exempt from taxation.  While the PUP was put on a statutory footing on 5 August, for the five months from its introduction in March that payment was not subject to tax as an urgent needs payment.  Section 3 of this Bill seeks to retrospectively tax a payment which was exempt from tax by law.  Regardless of the amount of tax involved, this is an unprecedented move by the Government and one it has failed to justify.<\/p> <p> Given that this Government has found itself in hot water for dubious interpretations of the law in recent weeks, I am unconvinced by the argument the Government has put forward to retrospectively tax a payment that was, by law, exempt from tax for five months.  Furthermore, it is hard to understand why the Minister is expending energy to retrospectively tax those who lost their jobs during this pandemic, and as a result of this pandemic, on dubious legal grounds.  It speaks to a Government that is simply out of touch and it sets a precedent that we should not go anywhere near.  It is simply wrong.  Under law, this payment was exempt from tax for months as a result of the Finance Act in 2018, but now we are deciding to go back in time, rewinding the clocks and going to make this payment taxable.<\/p> <p> There are measures in this Bill to be welcomed, some of which are long overdue.  Section 9 increases the earned-income credit to &euro;1,650, equalising the tax credit for the self-employed with that of PAYE workers.  This is a welcome change and one that is long overdue, with the commitment having been made more than four years ago by the previous Fine Gael Government.  Section 4 provides an exemption for income tax for payments made by the HSE to those in receipt of more mobility allowances.  This is a positive move, which Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes.  Similarly, the increase in the dependant relative tax credit, provided for in section 5, is also a welcome development.<\/p> <p> Other provisions in this Bill, however, are not welcome and will have a negative impact on workers and families, with a disproportionate impact on low-income workers, lone parents and rural households.  Sections 26 to 28, inclusive, provide for locked-in increases in the carbon taxes every year until 2030.  These provisions will result in a 39% hike in the carbon tax next year alone, followed by further increases year-on-year.  Without affordable alternatives, a carbon tax will not reduce emissions.  It is only possible to incentivise people to use alternatives if they exist.<\/p> <p> At present, alternatives such as electric vehicles and home retrofitting are least accessible to low-income households.  If households are unable to afford these alternatives, they will simply spend more money on heating their homes, cooking their food or running the car.  That is the reality.  Only last month, my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, received information that because of Covid-19 restrictions 8,000 homes are waiting for upgrades under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme.  The Government has sought to justify the increase in carbon tax as a just transition, comparing it to welfare increases announced on budget day.<\/p> <p> We must bear two points in mind, however.  First, tens of thousands of households do not qualify for the fuel allowance but are struggling to get by at a time of great financial insecurity.  Second, many of the social protection measures, such as the PUP, have clearly been flagged as temporary and not permanent.  The increases in carbon taxes are permanent, however.  This Bill seeks to lock-in year-on-year increases in carbon taxes until 2030.  These are increases which the Department of Finance has classified as aggressive.  There is no such provision in the Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Bill 2020 to lock-in year-on-year increases in social welfare payments until 2030.  It remains the case, therefore, that in the midst of an unemployment crisis it will be low-income households that will be disproportionately impacted.  This is the wrong time to increase carbon taxes.  It is the right time to pause such increases.  Sinn F&eacute;in will challenge this decision on Committee Stage of the Bill.<\/p> <p> These measures and their impact are compounded by sections 33 and 34, which provide for changes to motor tax and reliefs given to certain electric vehicles.  These changes, as the Minister knows, will disproportionately benefit wealthier drivers, while penalising those unable to afford an upgrade to low-emission or electric vehicles.  This is demonstrated by the fact that many high-end, low-emissions vehicles will be significantly reduced in cost due to the changes in the lowest rate of vehicle registration tax, VRT.  These measures enable a transition, but one that caters for high-income earners while making it more difficult for low-income earners.  A just transition must be based on prioritising access to alternatives to an increase in carbon taxes for the most vulnerable.<\/p> <p>The Finance Bill fails to meet that objective.<\/p> <p> Covid-19 and the public health measures introduced to contain its spread have devastated jobs and businesses throughout the State.  We know that these restrictions have been a hammer blow for the hospitality and tourism sectors especially.  In our submission to the July stimulus debate Sinn F&eacute;in argued to reduce the rate of VAT to 9% for the hospitality and tourism sector.  The reasons were straightforward and we argued that it should be immediate.  With fewer restrictions in the summer it was essential that businesses that were so badly affected in the first round of restrictions in the spring were able to generate as much revenue as possible through trading in the summer.  These small businesses could have absorbed this reduction in VAT onto their balance sheets as a margin of support for businesses facing a temporary demand shock, allowing firms to maintain their cash margins with a lower level of demand.  Unfortunately, the Government rejected this proposal and I believe it will acknowledge that it was a missed opportunity and a costly one for many of these businesses.  Section 37 provides for a reduction of VAT to 9% for the hospitality and tourism sector, effective from 1 November until the end of 2021.  That is the right thing to do.  I welcome that the Government has implemented this proposal, although late in the day.<\/p> <p> Section 11 provides for the Covid-19 restriction support scheme announced on budget day.  The scheme is available to businesses that have suffered a turnover loss of more than 75% as a result of Covid-19 restrictions, with qualifying businesses receiving cash payments equivalent to 10% of their previous average weekly turnover, capped at &euro;5,000.  The scheme is not going to operate as a grant.  Instead it will be a cash flow support, providing an alternative credit for trading expenses, which will reduce the expenses that can be claimed by these companies in the future.  This would mean higher taxes or more tax to be paid on their profits.  While we leave that aside, Sinn F&eacute;in had called for an enhanced grant scheme for Covid-impacted businesses.  While we did that, it is not provided for, and we will monitor this scheme in the months ahead.<\/p> <p> I am sharing time with Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell.  There are many other things I would like to discuss in this Bill, and we will get an opportunity to do that on Committee Stage if appropriate time is given, if the right arrangements are put in place and if the Bill passes Second Stage here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400035#NN00200","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604504100,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ar an mBille Airgeadais ach admha&iacute;m go bhfuil imn&iacute; orm faoi ch&uacute;pla rud sa Bhille seo.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute;imid &aacute; phl&eacute; seo le linn ama eisceacht&uacute;il agus le linn paind&eacute;ime, ach mar sin f&eacute;in, caithfimid d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na ruda&iacute; at&aacute; go f&iacute;or m&iacute;chothrom sa St&aacute;t seo.<\/p>  <p>  There was one thing in this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill that I admit has caught me by surprise, which is the subsidies for NATO military forces for the exemptions they will receive from 2022 from VAT excise for services and goods.  It will be interesting to hear what that actually entails.  When I read \"NATO\", at first I wondered if I had read it correctly, as in whether this is the same organisation that was set up to check the Soviet Union, which does not exist anymore?  Why would it now need exemptions come 2022?  Nevertheless, there seems to be a will that the taxpayers of Ireland, a neutral country, would provide tax subsidies to foreign military forces from an organisation that our country is not even a member of.  I would love to know the benefit of giving such a tax subsidy to a military force.  I am very interested to see what kind of cost-benefit analysis was done for the State on this.<\/p>  <p>  We are aware that there are already massive costs to the State from the exemption of fees for US military flights.  According to Shannonwatch, between 2003 and 2019 the cost incurred by the Irish Aviation Authority in exempting fees for en route services for military and other flights was &euro;46 million, the lion's share of which is accounted for by US military flights.  Furthermore, in 2016 it was reported that the cost of having the Garda and the Army protect US military planes at Shannon Airport was almost &euro;1.5 million a year.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, wrote to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who confirmed that US and other military aircraft traversing Irish airspace or indeed landing in Ireland do not pay air traffic control charges. I would like an explanation as to why Irish taxpayers are now being asked to further subsidise conflict, war and aggression.  Where does the drive for this initiative come from?<\/p>  <p>  Another aspect of the Bill that concerns me, and which I also referred to on budget day, is that the Government, much like its predecessors, seems to have a housing strategy that continues to rest on the private developer-led model.  This has led us to into the housing crisis we face today.  It has made housing unaffordable for many and has led to sky-high rents and an unprecedented homelessness crisis.  The concessionary measures outlined in the Finance Bill are just the further expression of this.  Two measures in particular stand out.  These are the extension of the disastrous help-to-buy scheme and the loosening of the requirements for developers to avail of the stamp duty refund scheme for residential development.  The former scheme, which increases the tax relief for first-time buyers from &euro;20,000 to &euro;30,000, has been inflationary for house prices and it has been poorly targeted.  Effectively, it is a subsidy to developers and no doubt this is why the Government has chosen to extend and increase it.  It helped to push up property prices, much to the delight of developers I am sure.  There were instances where its introduction pushed up house prices in certain locations by almost &euro;10,000 practically overnight.  That is not much use to those who are trying to get onto the property ladder for the first time.  Figures have shown that more than 40% of the help-to-buy recipients already had the deposit saved, and therefore it did not help in this regard.  One would have thought that the Government would have been concerned about this.  A person would have been forgiven for thinking the Government would scrap a scheme where almost half of the help-to-buy recipients did not require what the scheme was intended to do, which was to help.<\/p>  <p>  Another gift to developers has been the stamp duty refund scheme for residential development which allows a refund mechanism to reduce the effective stamp duty rate for qualifying developments to 2%.  This is on the condition that these developments are completed in a timely manner within two years.  What do we see in this Finance Bill?  That requirement has now been pushed back to two and a half years.  The developers can avail of the effective 2% rate even if they are now 25% slower in terms of the completion rate.  The message is very loud and clear.  Instead of giving ever more concessions to private developers, it would be better for the State to break from this neoliberal model and develop a large stock of public housing assets.  This is what people need.  This is what people in homeless services right now need.  This is what people trying to get onto the property ladder need.  This is what the Government needs to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400037#PP00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1604504100,"counter":252,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is very welcome to the Chamber this afternoon.

The Minister has heard that on far too many occasions for his own liking, but sometimes these old clich&eacute;s and tropes can have an element of truth to them.  I believe this to be the case this year. With additional spending of more than &euro;17 billion, it takes a chancer to claim that nothing good whatsoever came from budget 2021, which is evidently untrue.  Sadly, it took a pandemic to invest more in hospital beds and in an overburdened health service that has been crying out for more funding, more targeting of funding, and improvements in delivery of services.  Much of what was in the Minister's October budget speech and reflected in the Finance Bill sees this Government hand out a series of sticking plasters to hold together creaking public services, with little or no systemic change flagged or planned.  The opportunity to use this public health crisis and the unprecedented financing opportunities that are available at this time to create a better, fairer and more socially democratic Ireland has been missed.  There is little sign in the Bill of a new direction for Ireland or what we might term a new social contract for the emergence of a different, more egalitarian, post-pandemic society and economic model.  It is very much a case of business as usual.<\/p>  <p>  I note the ESRI's commentary in the budget and the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, analysis, but the truth is that the failure to hike weekly social welfare rates will mean that for the second year in a row, Ireland's most vulnerable, those on small fixed incomes and those who depend on the State for their income, will have seen no cash increase paid to them.  While it is not strictly a matter for this Bill, it is a point worth making.  There are necessary tweaks in the Bill and some recent legislation to cover Brexit-related matters, but one of the biggest Brexit-related harms will be the cost of basic essentials for ordinary households that depend on the State for their incomes.<\/p> <p>Such cost increases for normal, day-to-day goods such as foodstuffs, utilities and so on have a regressive impact, with the poorest families paying more.<\/p> <p> However, inequality is not just about income.  It is also about opportunities.  Budget 2021 and this Finance Bill will increase wealth inequality and widen the opportunity gap between those who have a little, those who have some, and those who have a lot.  We heard much talk in recent weeks about what was in the budget but the conversation about what was not in it was closed down very quickly in the political system and the media moved on from it.  We should talk about what is not in the budget or in this Bill if we are to have a proper conversation about how to recast society and help it change direction into the future.<\/p> <p> For example, neither the budget nor this Bill do anything about public childcare, which is perhaps the most economically and socially prudent investment of them all.  The evidence from across the world is clear that a high-class investment in affordable and high-quality State childcare more than pays for itself, with up to a tenfold return cited in some studies.  Under the Labour Party's vision of a new social contract, we would have supported families to ensure every child has a fair start.  We would have invested &euro;60 million as a first step to develop a universal public childcare service and an additional &euro;30 million to ensure every childcare worker is paid a living wage of at least &euro;12.30 an hour.  Our childcare workers have been on the front line of Covid-19, caring for our children throughout this crisis, and they have been treated shamefully.  They were on poverty wages both before and during the crisis and they will remain on poverty wages after this legislation passes through this House.<\/p> <p> Childcare is one example but I could go on to speak about the progressive changes this Bill could have helped deliver.  It could have reoriented how we do public and affordable housing, how we advance climate action and a just transition properly through a more progressive tax policy, and the promotion of greater investment in and use of public transport to help bring about the step change we need.  It seems the Green Party has failed to make any substantial impact on this Bill, given the opportunities available.  Many of the provisions in this Bill would have happened anyway in the Green Party's absence.<\/p> <p> This Bill will result in the extension of bad, or at least questionable, policies that will cost the Exchequer a lot of money and which will disproportionately favour people who have more to their names than most.  There is little or no objective reason for these policies to remain in operation.  One such bad policy is the help-to-buy scheme.  This Bill enables the extension of the scheme, which the ESRI has called \"poorly designed\" and which the Parliamentary Budget Office has shown has a deadweight loss of over 40%.  In other words, this policy has been proven to promote activity that would have happened anyway but the State chooses to subsidise it in any case.  This is not a housing policy.  It is a developer's policy that drives the cost of housing further beyond the means of most people who dream of owning their own home.  Announcements were made in the budget about a greater level of spending on subsidising private landlords via the housing assistance payment, HAP, and a reduction of stamp duty for large developers, as referenced earlier, rather than considering more investment in affordable housing on public land, which we require as a society.<\/p> <p> Once again, no-strings-attached VAT giveaways are being given to sectors addicted to precarious pay and poor working conditions.  The lowering of the VAT rate will cost in excess of &euro;400 million in one year, but like the staycation subsidy, it is another poorly designed scheme with a suspect value.  The Minister knows well that a VAT cut for the hospitality sector will benefit higher earners and consumers who have more discretionary income to spend.  This is the same cohort whose savings have shot up over the past six months.  They are not spending, not because they are short of cash but because of the pandemic.  We do not have a demand problem in this country, but we do have a public health problem.<\/p> <p> The Minister and his officials know as well as I do that the VAT cut introduced in 2011 very quickly outlived its usefulness soon after the date on which it was introduced.  It did not go towards boosting the pay packets of low-paid workers and neither did it go towards making a meal out or a hotel room any cheaper.  It was ultimately used, a few years after it was introduced, to boost the bottom lines of some very big and profitable hotel groups and fast food chains.  As the Minister is determined to bring the VAT reduction in and it is already in place, this Bill should be amended to make the VAT rate cut contingent on the engagement of hospitality employers with a joint labour committee.  That has been the law of this land since 2012, under a system both I and the Minister voted to introduce as Members of this House.<\/p> <p> This time last year, my party called for the development of a wage support scheme similar to the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, for industries that would find themselves at risk in a no-deal Brexit.  It took the pandemic for such a scheme to be rushed through.  I welcome that the TWSS was introduced as it was very beneficial for businesses and workers.  However, this Bill entails little reform of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  While I welcome the increase in subsidy rates since the start of the level 5 lockdown, this does not go far enough.  We need to return to an income-linked scheme like the TWSS, which the Labour Party has called for with our new ObairGhearr scheme, based on the successful German short-time work scheme, to ensure workers do not lose out and that they are upskilled.  Such a scheme would ensure State-subsidised workers do not lose out and are protected from economic dismissals or attempts to use the crisis as cover for cost cutting.  It would also make employers, with the support of the State, provide tailored training plans to their individual workers as a condition of entry onto the scheme.<\/p> <p> This is the best kind of long-term support we can provide as a State to make our SMEs more productive and competitive.  This is not only possible, but is actually happening right now across Europe, in the Netherlands, Denmark and France, to name but a few countries.  Similarly to those countries' schemes, the scheme we would like to see developed would exclude companies with bad taxation records and companies which pay big dividends to shareholders in the middle of a pandemic while on State support, give excessive pay packages or bonuses to executives or engage in share buy-back schemes.<\/p> <p> More generally, tax policy changes included in budget 2021 and provided for in this Bill are projected to result in a net revenue loss of approximately &euro;231 million in a full year, while the tax base is also set to narrow.  This will make little sense to workers on wage subsidy supports or the pandemic unemployment payment, who will still be hit with a tax bill on the support they received during the crisis, as referenced under section 3 of this Bill.  This comes on the back of many people facing a Covid-19 interest penalty on payment breaks for mortgages and loans.  Will the Minister consider addressing this issue and giving people the same kind of tax breaks, tax warehousing and so on that the Government is providing to large businesses which are in difficulty because of this pandemic, under the same principle?  Will he show the same kind of mercy to people on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, or who benefited from the wage subsidy scheme, who will find themselves with a tax bill based on the incomes they received through those State supports?<\/p> <p> In our alternative budget, entitled A New Social Contract, we have shown how &euro;1.8 billion could have been raised by targeting growth-friendly wealth and assets but, unfortunately, this Government has chosen to look the other way.  We know from reports published yesterday that because of the situation in which we now find ourselves, a &euro;930 million shortfall in corporation tax receipts has been forecast for October.  The Minister has recognised that himself.  It is very worrying indeed that there is an overdependence on corporation tax from a small number of companies in this country.  That is not sustainable and that is why we need to have a mature adult conversation about ensuring our tax base is not further narrowed, in order that we can obtain the kinds of resources we need to operate top-quality, high-class public services in the modern day.<\/p> <p> Chapter 1 of the Bill includes proposals to address USC issues as they relate to the increase in the national minimum wage of 10 cent an hour.  This matter, along with issues relating to PRSI thresholds, have been addressed in most years since 2015 to ensure any rises in the national minimum wage find their way into the pockets of those who require those increase most, namely, the workers, and to ensure there is no cliff edge PRSI effect on employers.  I am disappointed that a Government which has expressed a wish to achieve a living wage has chosen not to go further than the meagre proposition made by the Low Pay Commission. <\/p> <p>The proposal in section 10 to extend the naval personnel seagoing credit is welcome but we need to go much further to enhance pay packets and improve the terms and conditions of the members of our Defence Forces.  I know that project is under way and we need to focus on it as a country, and to recognise the important contribution that members of the Defence Forces make to State security and to our State more generally.<\/p> <p> Chapter 4 of the Bill contains significant measures relating to the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  This may be a minor issue but I want to raise it with the Minister.  I was contacted yesterday by an on-course bookmaker from my constituency who informs me that his business and other similar businesses are excluded from the scheme based on the fact that they do not have bricks and mortar rateable premises.  This misunderstands the nature of the business and that quite an expense is involved in paying for their pitch on racecourses throughout the year.  These are operations that Horse Racing Ireland would have data and information on.  I ask the Minister to look at this to see if access to the scheme could be provided for such businesses.<\/p> <p> I imagine other Members of the House were contacted by Chambers Ireland regarding a possible anomaly in the operation of the CRSS system.  It highlighted an important issue relating to businesses that form part of a supply chain for the tourism and hospitality sector.  Due to level 5, these businesses have lost all or most of their revenue.  Section 4.2.4 of Revenue's guidelines states that even if a business meets all of the other eligibility criteria for CRSS, it will not qualify for the scheme unless access to the location, for example, a warehouse, is restricted under Government guidance.  These businesses, which are predominantly closed at the moment or running at a low level of activity because of the level 5 restrictions, need support to remain open to support the economic recovery when it comes.  The relevant provision of the Finance Bill is in section 485(3)(b)(i) to be added to the principal Act.  Chambers Ireland has been in contact with the Revenue Commissioners in this regard and I wanted to raise it with the Minister so that he can consider it before Committee Stage to see if this problem can be addressed.<\/p> <p> Period poverty is a serious issue for many women.  My colleague, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, has done significant work campaigning in this area.  Sanitary towels and panty liners have a 0% VAT rate and section 44 of the Bill will see menstrual cups, pants and sponges included too.  That is a welcome development and I give credit to the Minister and his officials for making those important changes.  Has the Minister considered calls to reduce VAT on condoms in the interest of positive sexual health?  I know a case was made to the Minister by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, in that regard at a point last year and I would like to hear the Minister for Finance's view on that.<\/p> <p> I have been contacted in recent weeks by retail representative groups and I am anxious to see if the Minister will consider introducing measures in the Finance Bill to modify the small benefit exemption gift card initiative in order that the benefit remains in the State.  I submitted a parliamentary question a few days ago and received a response yesterday.  The response was a little disappointing.  It seems that the Minister does not have any plans to change the small benefit exemption scheme at present to ensure that those resources remain in the State and are spent here.  It may be the case that the Minister is restricted from doing that but I would appreciate if the Minister would put his position on that matter on the record of this House.<\/p> <p> Is the Minister aware of an independent report, about which I provided details in a recent parliamentary question, detailing the benefit of the existing retail export scheme on supporting tourism in Ireland?  I know the Minister plans to make changes in that regard in the Brexit omnibus Bill.  I have been contacted by many businesses in areas across the country that depend on international tourism and are concerned about the impact of this proposition.  If changes are made to the thresholds, they could put those businesses that are in difficulty under greater risk in future.  I would appreciate if the Minister would look at that on Committee Stage of this Bill.  I look forward with continued engagement with the Minister to finesse and add nuance to this Bill in, as Deputy Pearse Doherty said, a complicated time.  It will be difficult to have the kind of engagement that Deputies would like to have and would generally have in the context of such significant legislation.  The Minister can be assured of my co-operation and the co-operation of all Members of this House to get the best possible deal for the people of this country in a difficult time in our history, and to do the best we can for the people we represent at this anxious and challenging time for businesses and citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400037#PP00300","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604505300,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I support the Finance Bill because I believe it reinforces the Government's support for the economy against the challenge of the Covid-19 pandemic and the continued risk of a no-deal Brexit.  The Finance Bill 2020 sets out the legislative provisions to give effect to the tax measures announced in budget 2021.  Clearly the pandemic continues to provide us with an unparalleled economic and social challenge, but we must also affirm our determination to support the economy and society more broadly, especially those sectors which have been really adversely hit by Covid-19, with the restrictions now at level 5.  The Bill shows commitment to tackling climate change with a real course of action with carbon tax, and changes to motor tax and the vehicle registration tax regime, which are both aimed at encouraging motorists to make greener choices.<\/p>  <p>  The new Covid restriction support scheme will provide much-required support to businesses that have had to close or significantly reduce trading as a result of the move to level 5 throughout the country.  I note that the scheme is costing the Exchequer &euro;80 million per week as we are now at level 5.  That sounds like a lot of money but it is better to spend that kind of money to keep places trading and in some way buoyant as they negotiate these tough, turbulent weeks of level 5 restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to see the VAT reduction from 13.5% to 9% for the hospitality and tourism sector.  This will give a 4.5% margin which should be an extra take for people involved in bars, restaurants, hotels and many tourism enterprises.  One person told me that if they get back to some semblance of normalcy, if could mean a margin of &euro;8,000 to &euro;10,000 in capital for their business per annum.<\/p>  <p>  LEADER funding is administered by local development companies throughout the country.  They feel that adequate provisions were not made for them in budget 2021 and they have been in contact with my office to say that no funding for LEADER projects for 2021 was earmarked in the budget, nor was funding identified for delivery and administration of the LEADER programme, which is onerous.  I pay tribute to Doreen Graham and her team at Clare Local Development Company for all that they have delivered in the county over the years.  The final thing they will say is that there is no interim national rural development programme in the programme for Government.  They want to have more detail and it would be good to hear that.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise two other points.  One relates to aviation.  I was delighted that Shannon Airport received &euro;5 million of capital investment in the budget.  It is much-needed money at a time when Shannon Airport is on its knees financially, with virtually no planes in the skies and Aer Lingus and Ryanair pulling back from the airport over the winter months.  There was unassigned money in the budget relating to aviation transport and I ask that some of that be activated.  We need to look at public service obligation routes, including guaranteed routes out of Shannon Airport to the mainland of the UK and onwards to continental Europe.  As we negotiate Brexit and all that it will bring on 1 January, that connectivity in Shannon Airport, which is the most geographically peripheral airport in western Europe, will be all the more important.  We urgently need to activate some of that funding.  At the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks this morning, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said he would bring proposals to the Cabinet, and I ask the Minister for Finance and his colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to do everything possible to capitalise the efforts required to save the aviation sector.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise the issue of Moneypoint power station in west Clare.  It is a giant of our economy.  It contributes approximately one quarter of all commercial rates in County Clare, which shows how significant it is.  When I come to Dublin, by the time I reach Naas, there is commercial premises after commercial premises.<\/p> <p>There is quite a large spread of commercial activity, but Clare is very reliant on a number of giants.  Clare wants to get more just transition funding.  It has been provided to the midlands and is worth approximately &euro;11 million, as the midlands prepare to adjust from peat burning to non-carbon production of energy.  That &euro;11 million supports employment, training and other transitional supports.  Something similar must happen in west Clare given that by 2025, Moneypoint will not be burning coal any longer.  Hopefully, it will be transitioning to carbon-free fuels.  However, during this phase of ambiguity the west Clare economy certainly needs to see just transition funding coming to the area to equip the workforce.  Some of them may lose jobs and some have already lost them.  There are many other people in the local economy who will be adversely impacted by the wind-down of coal burning in Moneypoint in 2025.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400039#RR00200","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604505900,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I have been inundated with individuals and groups over the last few weeks telling me how this budget has affected them.  The general consensus is that it is a bad budget for rural people and certainly for older people.  Older people have been left behind.  In an &euro;18 billion budget, the Government could not find any money, even a small amount, for pensions and for those who are most vulnerable to a pandemic.  There is certainly no money to progress towards a living wage and lift thousands out of poverty, nor is there money to establish a hardship fund to tackle the isolation older people are experiencing.  They were told to cocoon, and then were promptly forgotten by the Government.  That is grossly unfair.<\/p>  <p>  A double income family, with each member on the average industrial wage, gained a massive &euro;5 in the budget, only to have many multiples of that amount taken back through carbon tax.  The community employment, CE, supervisors appear to have been forgotten again for another year.  Rural dwellers are being crucified by carbon tax - so much for just transition.  There is no mention of renters in the budget.  Government policy that has an over-reliance on the housing assistance payment, HAP, to help its landlord friends has led to long housing lists, couch surfers and, unfortunately, an increase in the incidence of rough sleeping.  Winter is here and urgent action is required if we are to prevent more deaths occurring.  Five homeless people have died in the last two weeks.  That is five too many.  These people were more than statistics.  They were real living human beings and we must do more in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I often say to people that members of the Government must have nobody belonging to them who has experience of our public housing list or the health service.  If they did, they would have fixed both long ago.  The people who come to my door are crucified.  The situation is inhumane; animals have been treated better.  The system is broken and I ask the Government to fix it.  If it cannot fix it, it should give the job to somebody else who can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400040#SS00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1604505900,"counter":258,"content":"<p>This Finance Bill gives effect to the budget provisions.  It is before us at what is unquestionably a very important and challenging time for our country.  The Bill arrives in the middle of a global pandemic that has placed immense strain on our society, both in human and economic terms.  We must recognise that.  Nobody is suggesting that the crafting of the budget and the Finance Bill has been an easy task.  It has not been easy, by any means.  It has posed major challenges.  Lives have been lost, families have been separated, people have lost jobs and Ireland is still grappling with the challenge of Brexit and the unknown future that will arise as a result of that.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that this Bill should not be an attempt to return to the type of Ireland we had prior to Covid-19.  It will not be enough to weather the storm and return to the Ireland that was.  Before the Covid pandemic Ireland was dealing with the consequences of a decade of underinvestment, lack of access to housing, economic inequalities and lack of opportunities.  All these challenges remain, and many have been worsened by the effects of the current crisis.  The old normal will still be as difficult and divisive if we do not improve our society at the same time as we try to protect it.  We must invest in surviving the worst effects of the Covid pandemic, while keeping people healthy and safe.  That should entail providing economic security, protecting both mortgage holders and renters, and keeping businesses alive.  There must be a clear commitment to provide the necessary funding to ensure the people of Ireland can get through the pandemic with the right healthcare.  It must also support incomes and communities.<\/p>  <p>  We must invest in the sectors that are being decimated by the pandemic, ensure that they survive and offer hope of a social and economic revival.  As the Social Democrats have said over recent weeks and in the context of the budget, this must be a budgetary strategy that is not only about survival but also about revival.  The revival as we emerge from the pandemic must be to an economy that is not only job rich but also one of quality jobs, with a priority on investing in public services and social goods that will benefit all.  We must invest in a fairer future.  This pandemic is a once-in-one-hundred-year event, and the budgetary approach must respond accordingly.  We must be ambitious.  It is important that there is a commitment to borrow sufficiently to ensure we survive the pandemic until a vaccine or treatment emerges, and the sectors and businesses impacted can be revived.  They were all mainly viable before the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we return to a situation in the longer term of dealing with deficit reduction, but that should not be on the agenda in the short to medium term.  I must express concern at comments that were made in the Minister's Budget Statement about deficit control in the shorter term.  That should not be on the agenda.  We should use the very favourable situation at European level.  The market is potentially very beneficial to Ireland if we take an expansionary response and an approach of borrowing to invest.  Certainly, earlier in the year there were worrying signs from the Government that a conservative approach would be taken to the major crisis the country is facing.  I am glad that position changed as the months passed.  However, I still am concerned about a mindset that focuses on deficit control, by talking about it and trying to put it on the agenda for some time at the end of next year.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, we can borrow at minimal rates and, in some cases, negative rates.  That is continuing, mainly thanks to the changed policy approach of the ECB.  We should maximise the potential of that borrowing situation.  Earlier in the year, it was said that we would frighten the markets if we borrowed too much.  There is no indication that this is happening.  Obviously, the firepower that has been put there by the ECB is critical, but the markets also recognise that if one invests for growth, there will be good returns on borrowing.  That is a key issue.  Taking any type of conservative approach at this stage, which will result at some point in the next couple of years with a level of austerity, is not in our interest.  It is not in our interest from a human perspective, and it does not make sense economically either.  It also does not give any confidence to the markets.<\/p> <p>The markets and investors want to see that there is a clear strategy in place to invest in growth and that must be the approach.<\/p> <p> Equally, we must take an approach that is about putting people's well-being, both socially and economically, to the fore of everything that is being done.  In that regard, one does have to express some concern about the approach that was taken in the budget.  It was an enormous budget with a total value of &euro;18 billion, which undoubtedly provided significant supports to business.  That was welcome.  However, at the end of the day when people looked at their own personal situation, many asked what the budget actually did to change their circumstances.  There was very little in terms of support to individuals and families in the budget and in the Finance Bill.<\/p> <p> The approach should have been to avail of the opportunity to invest in public services.  That must be an overriding strategy of the Government.  It makes sense from many perspectives.  It is about creating the kind of inclusive, modern, progressive society that we could achieve in this country if we were prepared to invest properly in public services.  Unfortunately, that has not been the approach taken by this Government or the previous one.  There is still that two-tier approach to the provision of public services.  It is very much a Fine Gael kind of approach, which is about public services being for low-income people and the poor and everybody else pays their way.  That is a very regressive approach to public services.  It results in a very divided society where there are high levels of inequality and where a lot of people do not feel they have a stake.  In such circumstances, people on low incomes, who are poorer, have great difficulty accessing public services.  I refer to the provision of affordable housing, social housing, healthcare, transport services, various community services or adequate policing services.  People have a right to expect all of those critical public services in their lives and when they are not adequately resourced it does mean that people are excluded and left behind.<\/p> <p> We talk about the squeezed middle, or whatever cohort the Minister wants to talk about.  More and more, people who are not in the low-income category, who are in decent jobs and who are paying their way tax-wise, see very little return for that.  Increasingly, they feel they have to pay for everything.  That is not what an inclusive society is about.  It is not what a progressive society is about either.  Unfortunately, there is that mindset, in particular in Fine Gael, that does not see the advantage in having universal, properly funded public services.  The approach should be to achieve the kind of social democratic model where public services are available on a universal basis to everybody.  Such an approach creates an inclusive, equal society but it is also the type of approach that creates a sense of solidarity among people.  There should be a social contract whereby one pays a fair share of tax and, in return, one gets good quality public services.  In our lifetime we have never operated that kind of social contract in this country.<\/p> <p> Not only does taking that approach create a more equal society and greater solidarity, but ensuring that we have good quality public services for housing, childcare, healthcare or whatever other aspect of public services, makes the country much more competitive.  Given that there are such pressures on people's incomes, that they have to pay so much to access healthcare and for childcare, and that housing is such an enormous drain on family incomes, that fuels demands for wage increases and, in turn, makes us less competitive.  It is a vicious cycle that has been created.  For all of those reasons - socially on the grounds of equity and economically - it makes sense to have universal public services.  The Minister has still not accepted that.<\/p> <p> It is most disappointing that after all this country has come through over the past decade or so, those lessons have not been learned.  Following an engagement with senior people in Fianna F&aacute;il and in Fine Gael in the aftermath of the election, one of the reasons that the Social Democrats decided that we were not going to be a part of this Government was because those lessons did not seem to have been learned.  The housing problem is the most stark example of how lessons were not learned.  Everybody knows the action that must be taken by the Government is to drive down the cost of housing to make it affordable.  We should be a in a position &ndash; it is possible &ndash; to build houses on publicly owned land.  We have large tracts of publicly owned land in the Dublin area and also throughout the country that should be built on for affordable and social housing.  We should be able to build decent three-bed houses for approximately &euro;250,000.  That is the cost price.  That is the kind of intervention that is required by the Government in order to drive down the cost of housing.  It is about taking on the vested interests whose sole objective it seems is to maintain high house prices.  That has significant implications right across society and the economy.  That nettle has not been grasped.  We see yet again the Government repeating the mistakes of the past.<\/p> <p> I question the lauding of the extension of the help-to-buy scheme.  That is a very expensive measure that is not targeted and it fuels an increase in the cost of housing.  We have seen that from how it has operated in recent years.  It fuels the cost of housing and does nothing to achieve reform.  It incentivises a continuation of the kind of dysfunctional housing market that we have here.  That is one of the most disappointing aspects of the approach the Government has taken, which is provided for in this Finance Bill.  Are we going just to keep repeating those mistakes or are we going to learn lessons and do things differently?  Unfortunately, this Finance Bill will make very little difference to individual lives, family incomes and budgets.<\/p> <p> The other area it is important to highlight in the Bill is taxation.  From a macro-economic point of view, it is very good that the tax take has not been affected too much by the pandemic, but that in itself tells a tale.  It tells us that we have a two-tier job situation where the majority of people who have lost out as a result of jobs losses due to the pandemic are people who were in very low paid and insecure jobs.  We keep on talking about the essential workers in nursing homes, hospitals, retail and distribution and all of the key areas; they are the people who have lost out.  They are the people who have been hurt most and they are the ones who are on the lowest incomes.  When we are lauding those essential workers, part and parcel of doing that is for the Minister to put his money where his mouth is in that regard.  It should be about recognising the essential nature of the work that so many people in this country do, not just by a round of applause but by ensuring the Government will work to achieve decent levels of pay and security in employment.<\/p> <p>The budget and this Finance Bill is disappointing in that respect.  We are still caught in a situation where we are not prepared to take that step towards a living wage.  We are still expecting people to live on a little over &euro;10 an hour.  What is that about?  The Minister has to get his priorities right on this.  He must ensure some level of equality across society.  It is not possible for people to live on that kind of minimum income.  It is not possible for them to do that when having that income excludes them from accessing so many services.  There needs to be a complete change in mindset.  The programme for Government talks about moving towards exploring and considering all of these.  One measure the Government is committing to over its lifetime is a living wage.  It lacks ambition to a huge extent, taking that kind of approach.<\/p> <p> There are many measures the Minister could have taken in raising revenue.  He ignored them completely, however.  That may have been on the basis that he was prepared to borrow so much.  That is fine and nobody is objecting to that.  There were also, however, opportunities to create a greater sense of fairness in terms of people's contribution.  Obviously, corporation tax is a key area in that respect.  A rate of 12.5% is one which people, in the main, are disputing.  There is a major difficulty, however, in terms of fairness and perception, as well as lack of contribution to the economy with many companies paying only a fraction of that 12.5% rate.  The Government should have moved to introduce a minimum rate of corporation tax which should have been applied across the board in establishing a level of fairness with many multinational companies based here being seen to make a fair contribution to our economy.  The Minister should have moved to a minimum level of 6%.<\/p> <p> The continuation of the special assignee relief programme, SARP, tax relief displays a mindset which is about giving preferential treatment to a small cohort of people who are high earners.  There really is no defence in continuing with that scheme.  Again, it is that mindset that some people are worth an awful lot more than others.  These are already high-earning individuals.  There is no justification for giving them preferential tax treatment.  Again, it just fuels that sense that the country is not being run in a fair manner and the tax system does not operate in a fair manner.  The opportunity should have been taken to end that scheme.  So much more could have been done.  It was a missed opportunity to create that kind of fairer and more inclusive society that we had the chance to do with the kind of borrowing involved.  It could have been used to invest in people as well as in services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400040#SS00300","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604507100,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Will the Minister accept two amendments to the Finance Bill 2020?  Both are closely related.  The first relates to an amendment to the provisions of the capital gains tax legislation to ensure that in a particular instance of partition or severance of land, that property owners would not be liable for a charge.<\/p>  <p>  On the partitioning of land for a site, under the law as it stands, the relief provided for a parent transferring a building site to a child is defeated by the capital gains rules on the partitioning of an asset where the land is held as a tenancy in common or a joint tenancy.  Section 603 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 grants an exemption of the capital gains tax were a parent transfers land up to one acre to a child to enable him or her to build a principal private residence, as long as the site is not valued at more than &euro;500,000.  This makes sense and it is only natural that a parent would want to give a site to a child.<\/p>  <p>  However, this exemption does not stand if the land is owned jointly, either as a tenancy in common or a joint tenancy.  In order to transfer a site to child to build a home, two joint owners would first have to petition the land.  This is where we face an issue.  Under section 534 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, the joint owners are exposed to capital gains tax once they partition their land.  The tax bill in such cases can be significant and certainly enough to beat the entire purpose of transferring the site to begin with.<\/p>  <p>  I suggest addressing this by amending section 603A of the Taxes Consolidation Act by the insertion of a new subparagraph to ensure that when a parent acquires a site for onward transfer to a child it will not trigger a capital gains tax charge for either of the joint owners in these specific circumstances.  I have drafted an amendment to achieve this required outcome.<\/p>  <p>  My second amendment relates to the severance of a joint tenancy.  In this instance, capital gains tax is applied to a property held as a joint tendency that undergoes severance.  Even in a situation where there is no sale of assets and the two people continue as normal after this technical change to land, the owners can be made liable for capital gains tax.  This is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  To put this in context, I will use a hypothetical situation.  A brother and sister, Sean and Julia, acquired 38 acres of farmland for &euro;300,000 in 2014 as joint tenants.  In 2018, they decided to divide the land equally between them to pursue different farming interests which constitutes severance of the joint tenancy.  The market value of the land at the end of 2018 was &euro;400,000.  The &euro;100,000 difference between 2014 and 2018 valuations would be subject to capital gains tax.  This means that both Sean and Julia would be subject to pay capital gains on &euro;50,000 each.  We should not be expecting two people to pay capital gains tax on a property from which they have not yet profited.  There is no material benefit to them.  They still own the land.  They are not selling it.  However, because of this severance under the Act, they are expected to pay for profits they have not actually made.  In this situation, both Sean and Julia are disposing of a lesser interest in a larger part of land for a greater interest in a smaller piece of land.  This constitutes a part disposal of an asset for capital gains tax purposes.  Sections 537 and 557 of the Taxes Consolidation Act are relevant here.  There is no immediate financial gain to this.  Will this technicality be addressed in this area to avoid unfair and unjustified hefty tax bills?<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for listening to these proposed amendments.  I sincerely request him to take these issues on board.  They are a common-sense approach to take two specific areas with little or no impact on the Exchequer.  For families who are affected by these two measures, they can have severe financial impacts.  I earnestly request the Minister to take those two amendments on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400042#UU00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1604507100,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I welcome the reversal to the cuts to the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme which Sinn F&eacute;in had been seeking.<\/p>  <p>  On behalf of my constituents in north Kildare, I am raising overarching concerns about the Government's financial priorities in this tricky time ahead.  Covid-19 leaves the world in uncharted waters.  I am worried that with this Government it is the poor and the barely hanging on who will be cast adrift first.  I am especially worried because these are people who do not have an in with the Government.  They have no personal access, no pull, nothing to be shared with them.  Over the past several months, people have seen clearly how the Government operates.  In deciding when to open up after the initial lockdown, it put the desires of lobbyists and party public relations over the public interest and public health.  It ignored the Chief Medical Officer's advice and then the T&aacute;naiste went on to disparage that advice on national television.<\/p> <p>Now we are back in lockdown, this time for a longer period.  Small businesses and ordinary people are paying the price.  This Government continues to operate on the basis of access and entitlement for the favoured few, starting with its own members, over the needs of the public.  Unless one of the favoured few falls foul of the Government there is no bargepole long enough to put distance between them, as we all witnessed last night in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p> The Government has had a Damascene conversion to mental health.  Mental health features heavily in almost all the calls to my office on housing, debt and other financial matters.  All I hear about is people on the edge, who cannot cope, who are on medication for depression or are worried about their children.  In light of the Minister's financial priorities I am worried for all of them.  Cuts and charges are to be inflicted on those to who can bear them the least.  I refer for example to carbon taxes.  There is enough here to keep people awake at night, but apparently not the people in the D&aacute;il.  What will this Bill do to protect and rescue these people, like Fianna F&aacute;il rescued Fine Gael last night?  We hear that Fine Gael's party leader always delivers.  Will the Minister follow suit and deliver for the outsiders in my constituency of Kildare North?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400042#UU00300","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604507700,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I am something of a political nerd when it comes to finance Bills.  I am fascinated by the way they provide a mechanism to transfer the wealth generated by society and by working people into the hands of the very wealthy in an opaque manner, year after year.  For the most part, working people do not know the details of how they are being robbed of the wealth they collectively produce.  I play a game with the finance Bill every year in which I try to find the tax relief that will benefit the rich.  I then try to find the sneaky tax that will punish the poor.  It is a game I strongly recommend people who care about injustice in society learn to play.  They would learn a lot by examining these opaque mechanisms through which the very rich and big business rob the poor.  They do so by not paying a fair contribution in tax on the enormous wealth they acquire through profits generated by working people, working people who have to pay their taxes because they are taken directly out of their pay packets every week.  Many of the very wealthiest people, who own some of the biggest and wealthiest companies, effectively write their own tax bills.  Year after year, finance Bills provide a mechanism for the wealthy to avoid paying tax, either through omission, by failing to discontinue tax reliefs given in previous years, or through proactive moves.<\/p>  <p>  I want to talk about specific instances of that phenomenon.  I should mention some of the highlights, most of which were mentioned in the main budget discussions.  If for no other reason, we will be opposing the Finance Bill 2020 because of the carbon tax.  It is the latest in a long line of regressive taxes which punish ordinary people, often on the grounds of protecting the environment as in the case of bin charges and the attempt to bring in water charges.  In fact they are just ways of regressively taxing working people for things that are not their fault but the fault of other people.  That is what the carbon tax does.  The net effect of the &euro;7.50 increase in carbon tax this year will cost ordinary people about &euro;60 or &euro;70 a year.  Increasing carbon tax by &euro;60 or &euro;70 every year up to the targets proposed will slowly chip away at the income of ordinarily people, disproportionately hitting the poorest as a substitute for taxing the polluting corporations that do the real damage.  We do not want to tax them.  In fact we go out of our way to make sure they do not pay taxes by providing them with a multiplicity of tax breaks.<\/p>  <p>  Because we will not do that, we tax people who live in council houses they are not even allowed to retrofit.  Such people cannot do anything to reduce their energy bills until the local councils decide to retrofit their homes, but they are going to be punished with additional energy costs to keep their houses warm.  People are going to be punished for the fact that they cannot afford electric cars.  A wealthy person can afford a brand new electric car, but someone who does not have the money for that will be punished for it year after year on a progressive basis.  That is one reason we will be opposing the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The employment wage subsidy scheme is another major issue.  We welcomed and supported the measures to support people's incomes and maintain their relationships with their employers.  There is an interesting contrast with the case of Debenhams workers.  We are looking for &euro;10 million for them to get their two plus two.  We cannot get it because it is too much to ask, it will set desperate precedents etc.  However, Boston Scientific, a major multinational company that produces medical equipment, was fully operational during the pandemic but it benefited from the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme.  This company is hugely profitable but fiddled around with its manufacturing process to meet the required 25% reduction in turnover and benefited from the scheme as a result.  A range of quite profitable companies are benefiting.  I support any Government measure to keep people employed and maintain their relationship with their employers, but there should be oversight over companies' cash reserves, their ability to contribute and any top-ups they are making.  Are the CEOs and executives of these companies paying themselves massive salaries?  Are they operating offshore in order to avoid tax?  Those oversights were not imposed on many very profitable and wealthy companies that benefited from the subsidy schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Returning to my favourite game, I notice a couple of tax benefits for the rich.  One was mentioned earlier.  Section 48 provides a partial refund of stamp duty where land is developed for residential purposes.  This extends from 24 months to 30 months the period in which construction must be completed for a developer to benefit.  In layperson's terms that is a tax benefit for land hoarders and speculators, people who are already profiting very handsomely from our inflated housing market.  That market benefits developers while the lack of public and affordable housing has the wider social effect of a housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  I do not really understand this section 23, which provides for capital gains tax relief for individuals who dispose of assets of a qualifying business or shares in a qualifying company if they have owned them for three years in the five-year period before their disposal.  I will not go into all the detail.  We can do that on Committee Stage.  However, that seems like another tax giveaway for the haves instead of the have-nots.<\/p> <p>That can be added to the litany of tax reliefs and allowances that allow very big corporations, some of the wealthiest corporations in the country which have seen their profits double in the past ten years from approximately &euro;80 billion gross profit in 2008 to approximately &euro;180 billion gross profits before tax deductions in 2020, to pay tax on only approximately &euro;90 billion of those profits.  They avail of tax loopholes for the other &euro;90 billion.  The loopholes include things such as the research and development tax grant, intra-group transactions and tax relief around amalgamations, which is another big one.  Many of them are detailed in a very interesting list I have before me which is produced by Revenue.  I wave it about every year.  It lists all of these tax reliefs which amount to approximately &euro;20 billion or &euro;30 billion per year.<\/p> <p> A tax relief I have highlighted for the past few years is that relating to intra-group transactions.  That is how big multinational corporations essentially write down their tax bill by stating they owe money to another subsidiary of their company money and therefore do not have to pay tax on those profits.  Interestingly, that heading on this little Revenue list has changed and disappeared.  I suspect that is because I keep highlighting it.  It has gone from the list and been merged into a few other headings.  It is worth pointing out that Pfizer has 27 subsidiaries in Ireland, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson has 23, Merck has 23, Abbott Laboratories has 13, Thermo Fisher Scientific has eight, Gilead Sciences has seven, Boston Scientific has six and Eli Lilly has six.  There are loads of companies that have a network of subsidiaries through which they organise their tax affairs basically by paying each other loans and money and royalties and all the rest so that they end up paying little or no tax.  I do not have time to go into all of the details but I think it is a scandal.  Every single year at budget time the House should be examining every single one of these tax reliefs, looking at who benefits from them and assessing what benefit, if any, is actually going to society.  I think we would find they are of very little benefit to society.<\/p> <p> I will conclude on section 481 tax relief.  I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, because he has genuinely listened on this issue and made genuine changes relating to the section 481 tax relief from which film production companies benefit to the tune of approximately &euro;80 million each year, in addition to the approximately &euro;20 million they get from Screen Ireland.  That adds up to &euro;100 million per year, or &euro;1 billion over the past ten years, that has gone to the film industry, but how many people have actual permanent jobs of any description in the film industry?  There may be 50 such jobs if we are lucky.  At one stage, the people who get all this money appeared before an Oireachtas committee and stated there were 17,000 jobs.  Members stated that was not true and that there were nothing like 17,000 jobs.  The Department of Finance looked into it and discovered there were approximately 2,000 jobs, all of which were Strumpet City style jobs.  People would go down when the film was set up and ask if there was any chance of a job but be told that film company did not really like them and would not give them a job.  That is how the film industry in this country works.  Nobody working in the industry has a pension or any basic entitlements in terms of continuity of service.  One can work in the Irish film industry and be blacklisted tomorrow, as some people have been because they actually highlight these matters.  Those people get absolutely nothing, but the State hands out very large sums of money totalling approximately &euro;100 million each year.<\/p> <p> Deputies should not get me wrong.  I want money to be put into the Irish film industry.  In fact, I would not like a cent less to go into it.  However, I believe the funding needs to be tied to ensuring there is proper employment, decent contracts, pensions and so on for those who work in the industry and a recognition of their service and the years they have worked in the industry, something that does not currently happen.  In that regard, I point out to the Minister that according to the Revenue figures, several of the big production companies get &euro;10 million to &euro;30 million on a production.  It is probably a breach of the EU rules in terms of reporting state aid not to be sure whether they were given &euro;10 million or &euro;30 million of public money.  That is unacceptable for a start, but those same companies have gone to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in recent weeks and stated that they have no employees, that it is a designated activity company, DAC, that has the employees rather than the company that receives the money from the State.  Despite the reforms the Minister brought in, the companies are still playing the same game of trying to hide behind the DAC and not take legal responsibility for their employees.  That must stop.  I appeal to the Minister to look further into how these companies are saying one thing on a declaration they are supposed to sign to get the relief and saying another thing when they go before the WRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400043#VV00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604508300,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I refer to the proposal in the Bill to tax people who have received the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  The maximum rate for the PUP was &euro;350 per week.  Many people who were on that rate had already taken a big hit to their income.  People who were on &euro;600, &euro;700 or &euro;800 per week saw their wages halved.  The proposal is to tax them on that.  That is wrong.  It is particularly wrong when it comes as part of a Finance Bill and budget which is handing out billions in corporate welfare.  One law for the rich, one law for the rest.  The Minister may argue that it is &euro;524, that people will not have to start to pay until 2022 and they can stretch it out for four years, but that is not the point.  The point is that it is wrong in principle and it should be withdrawn from the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise a point about Debenhams, as I often do.  There is &euro;10 million at stake to settle this dispute.  The workers were at the WRC last Friday.  They were informed by the liquidator, KPMG, that it may walk from the process by 23 December if it has not been resolved before then.  That puts a question mark over a just settlement for the workers, as well as the &euro;20 million in revenue that is due to the State from the liquidation.  The money is owed to the Revenue Commissioners, local councils for rates and so on.  All of this points to the urgent need for the Government to intervene directly and to put money on the table.  That would resolve the dispute, allow stock to be moved out of the stores and ensure workers get their payment.  It would free up the situation and ensure the State gets at least some moneys from the liquidation.  The Government must intervene and put money on the table in respect of that dispute.<\/p>  <p>  While I am on the issue of liquidations and redundancies, it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that next year will be a big year for redundancies, unfortunately.  What the State says in that regard has big implications for workers and the public finances.  Mr. Kevin Duffy and Ms Nessa Cahill appeared before the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment this morning.  I understand there was a meeting of what is described as a stakeholders' forum this afternoon to discuss the programme for Government commitment to improve workers' rights in a liquidation situation and to discuss the Duffy Cahill proposals.  I know that is not the direct responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, who is present, but the question of redundancies and what the State pays very much are his responsibility.  I would like the members of that stakeholders' forum to be identified on the record of the D&aacute;il.  The press statement referred to it being made up of social partners.  I wish to know which groups are involved in it.  Is it made up of IBEC, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Small and Medium Employers association or other groups?  Does the forum have terms of reference?  If so, where are they published?  If not, why not?  Does it have a deadline for completing its work, either by producing a report or making recommendations?  What is that deadline?  When will it meet again?  There is not enough information around the establishment of the forum.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, may not be able to reply to those questions, but he could raise them with his line Minister.  I am putting the issue out there.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and the employee wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, 66,500 companies benefited from the former scheme, according to Revenue information published last weekend.<\/p> <p>By no means were these overwhelmingly small companies or medium-sized businesses but included some of the biggest businesses in the country, such as Brown Thomas, JD Wetherspoon, Zara and Volkswagen with 85% of the wage bill paid.<\/p> <p> One of the companies that got paid under the scheme was Penneys, a company that is set to make &pound;350 million profit in 2020 between Ireland, Britain and a few other international outlets it has.  Penneys wants to reduce the hours of the workers in shops at the moment.  Workers who are on 11-hour contracts but would have been getting 30 or 40 hours of work are back down to 11 hours or close to it.  Workers are having their income slashed while the company is benefiting significantly from the scheme.  That needs to be looked at more carefully.<\/p> <p> Aer Lingus workers have still not been able to get their social welfare arrears for the period from March to September.  In some areas the Intreo offices are accepting the claims, but in most areas they are being refused.  The company has played havoc on this in an attempt to drive people out without having to pay redundancy or to enforce changes to work practices, but the State is complicit by not giving a direction to Intreo as it should.  Aer Lingus management should be called before an Oireachtas committee to answer for what is going on there which is scandalous.<\/p> <p> I wanted to make some points about the capitalist system, but I have only nine seconds left.

As we all know, it is a very difficult time for businesses across the country.  The measures in the Bill are intended to go some way to reinforcing the Government's support for the economy against the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic and the continuing possibility of a no-deal Brexit, which is a very serious risk for the Cork East constituency I represent.<\/p>  <p>  The new Covid restrictions support scheme and measures such as the reduction in VAT will provide much-needed support to businesses that have been forced to close or significantly reduce trading as a result of the move to level 5 restrictions.  Throughout the country businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector, have been feeling the pinch of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Cork East is famous and well regarded for its many hotels and tourist attractions.  It is also the home for the Irish agrifood industry.  They have all taken a serious hit with the Covid pandemic and Brexit.  It is important that the Government is taking proactive action to try to help companies and employers as we try to rebuild the economy in the post-Covid era.  <\/p>  <p>  I greatly appreciate the difficulties that businesses and individuals face in dealing with Covid-19.  In addition to the day-to-day challenges of Covid, they have difficulty with financing and getting accounting practices up-to-date and correct.  Many business owners I am engaging with have found it very difficult to find finance to keep their businesses open.  It is great that the Government has taken proactive action by helping with community banking and credit unions.  In my constituency I know the Minister actively engaged with Midleton Credit Union which is very welcome.  I hope he will continue to do that in his ministerial position.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, will be very good for businesses and provide them with certainty to allow them to plan accordingly when faced with a greater level of restrictions.  Unfortunately, as the Chief Medical Officer told me yesterday when I was questioning him at the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks, we do not know when we will be able to completely move away from restrictions on our everyday life.  However, as I have said many times in this House and elsewhere, we need to introduce measures that give people clarity so that they can plan despite the uncertainty faced throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 represents the single largest investment in the history of the State.  We are making this investment at a time when it is needed most to protect the lives and livelihoods of people and to rise to the challenges of Covid-19.  The CRSS scheme will come at a cost to the taxpayer of &euro;80 million a week during the level 5 restrictions.  This will be up to &euro;480 million until 1 December.  I do not think anybody can come to the House and say the Government is not supporting local businesses and industry on the ground to try to protect jobs.  It will provide grants of up &euro;5,000 a week to businesses that have been forced to close and operate with significantly curtailed restrictions.  I hope the scheme will bring a level of certainty to the businesses hardest hit by these restrictions, such as the consumer-facing sector of the economy, including retail and hospitality.<\/p>  <p>  I have engaged extensively with the Irish Hotels Federation on the supports hotels need to get through this crisis.  Other tax measures included in the scheme, such as the temporary reduction in the VAT rate for the hospitality and tourism sector from 13.5% to 9% with effect from 1 November 2020, are also very welcome.  The VAT rate reduction will ensure that when the sector reopens, people will be encouraged to go and use hotel facilities once again, which will be critical for the recovery of that sector.<\/p>  <p>  I have long been of the opinion that hotels are a safe controlled environment for people to engage in socially distanced activities.  I hope the reduction in VAT will see a similar boom in tourism as we saw in the early part of the last decade which greatly helped us get out of the last recession.  The Departments with responsibility for investing in this area should put in place measures such as the Gathering which we had at the start of the last decade, which was quite an effective measure.<\/p>  <p>  The extension of the employee wage subsidy scheme into 2021 will come as a considerable relief.  This will ensure fewer redundancies and lay-offs.  It is vital that we maintain the link between employers and employees.  This will allow businesses to return quickly when the restrictions are lifted.<\/p>  <p>  The continuation of the commercial rates holiday and tax warehousing also gives employers certainty on cashflow and ensures there is not an increase in additional costs causing debts to grow during lockdown periods.  The hospitality sector is a key component of the Irish economy.  On several occasions I have outlined to the D&aacute;il how important it is to my constituency.  As a collective it is worth up to &euro;7.6 billion and employs over 180,000 people across the country, which is staggering.  It shows how important it is to have a multilateral approach to the Government to get this industry on its feet again once we get through the worst of the pandemic.  Any support we can put in place to protect such industries is timely and welcome.  The leadership the Minister has shown in putting the necessary financial resources in place and taking advantage of the current low interest rate is highly encouraging.<\/p>  <p>  I hope we continue to engage in sustainable investment patterns to ensure we have a robust and future-proofed economy for the challenging times that lie ahead.

With the Covid-19 pandemic, people are told to stay in their houses.  Are they to stay in their freezing homes because they cannot afford fuel to keep them warm?<\/p> <p>These increases will happen every year for the next ten years.  The Government has to bring people along and this measure does not do that.  It is punishment of the weakest.  <\/p> <p> On the help to buy housing scheme, how can young people get interest relief on savings when they cannot afford to save because they are paying enormous rents?  Affordable housing, built by Government and local authorities is needed, not saving schemes that increase the price of houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400045#XX00300","speaker":"1464","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604509500,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I have some questions on the Bill which I hope the Minister will address.  There is a great deal of speculation about a possible vaccine for Covid-19.  Hopefully it will start to bring the virus under control but priority must be given to encouraging the maximum uptake possible, including among young people, when it becomes available.  Vaccine hesitancy is a major issue that will arise.  It will come very much into focus in the coming weeks and months.  An issue that will arise soon is that of indemnity for suppliers of those vaccines.  Will the Minister clarify if indemnity has yet been sought from any of the manufacturers?  There is always a risk with any vaccine.  That risk may be very small, particularly compared to the risk of not being vaccinated, but it must be acknowledged.  However, we are one of the few, if not the only country, in the European Union that has failed to introduce a national vaccine injury compensation scheme for adverse reactions, if they occur.  Sadly, the approach in this country has been to brush this problem under the carpet and to force victims and their families through long years of legal battles which ultimately only benefit the legal profession, not the patient.<\/p>  <p>  Back in the spring of 2002, 18 years ago, I had a meeting with the then Minister for Health, now the Taoiseach, with Margaret Best from Cork.  The then Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, gave a commitment to investigate the feasibility of providing support for parents but especially their children who had been damaged by State-run vaccination programmes.  That ultimately led to the vaccine damage steering groups whose report was published in 2009.  Eleven years later, we are still looking at this issue and still sweeping it under the carpet.  We are still forcing patients to go to the courts to find fault where no fault exists just to get an acknowledgement of what happened them.  That is wrong.  I will continue to raise this until it is addressed.  I would rather not have to raise it in the House as we deal with the roll out of the Covid-19 vaccine.  I will advocate that people should take the vaccine when it becomes available but I will not allow the issue be brushed under the carpet any longer.  I hope that during the process of the passage of this legislation that the funds are put in place to establish such a compensation scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue relates to section 6 of the Bill which refers to providing an exemption from income tax for payments under the mobility allowance.  I welcome that provision but only a small number of people are eligible for the allowance because it was suspended eight years ago.  Only people in receipt of the allowance eight years ago are eligible for this incentive.  The allowance was suspended at the same time as the motorised transport grant, two of only three supports that were available for people with a physical disability who did not have access to public transport.  The third support was the disabled driver scheme which has now been suspended because no new applicants can go into it because they cannot get a primary medical certificate as the Minister for Finance instructed the HSE to suspend processing those on foot of a court decision.  This means that anyone who has a physical disability from this day forward is effectively marooned in their home if they do not have direct access to public transport.  It might be someone who was involved in an accident, say someone who was unfortunately involved in a farm accident, who is marooned because he or she does not have the financial resources to adapt a car or purchase a new accessible car and no scheme is available.  Will the Minister update the House on when primary medical certificates will be issued once again?  What provision is being made in this legislation to address that?<\/p>  <p>  The third issue, which I will raise in more detail on Committee Stage, relates to the supports that must be put in place across the midlands with the closure of Lanesborough and Shannonbridge power stations.  Twelve months ago, during the passage of the Finance Bill, I put forward proposals that were rejected.  The Government has had 12 months to come forward with constructive proposals.  This Bill has no specific proposals for the communities that are being decimated by the closure not only of the two power stations but the 20 Bord na M&oacute;na works sites across the midlands, including in the Minister of State's constituency, that will be wound down as a result of the move from brown to green.  It is a move that I agreed with and worked on with Bord na M&oacute;na but one that was supposed to be a transition over a decade, not 12 months.  I am disappointed that Kieran Mulvey, the Government-appointed just transition commissioner, has been quite critical of the fact that the Government has not sought changes to EU state aid rules.  He told a conference late last month that there is an urgent need to change state aid rules to better support local authorities, businesses and communities in the midlands moving away from reliance on peat production towards the just transition.  He went on to point out that there is absolutely no point in encouraging local communities to think big and come up with innovative solutions if they will be blocked in developing those innovative solutions in creating jobs in their local community because it breaches state aid rules or has an impact on competition rules.<\/p> <p> The European Committee of the Regions produced a report earlier this year which stated that changes are needed to the state aid rules.  However, the responsibility and onus is on the Government to seek those changes for the midlands region in order to support local jobs there.  It is imperative that we have very specific and focused incentives in the Finance Bill to stimulate job creation in that area.  I accept that the issue may not have got the priority it should have because of the Covid-19 crisis, but we are now weeks away from the closure of the power stations to which I referred.  The Government must pull up its socks and provide the types of incentives that are needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400046#YY00200","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604510100,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Fitzpatrick.  At first glance, the Finance Bill looks like legislation for the ultimate Ross O'Carroll Kelly budget.  When one looks more closely, it is clear that a phenomenal number of sectors have been left out of its provisions.  In the case of older people, for example, who are most vulnerable and exposed in this particular crisis, there is not even a tenner a week for them out of an &euro;18 billion budget.  Another group that has been massively stuffed in this budget is student nurses.  They were promised by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, that they would be paid for the work they do on placement during the pandemic.  That has not happened and it is absolutely wrong.  It is unacceptable that nurses, who are most central to our management of the pandemic, very vulnerable to infection and holding the whole process together, have not been looked after in the manner that was committed to by the Government.  I pay credit to Aont&uacute; representative, Paul Lawless, who has been leading the fight on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  A shocking figure has come to light today, namely, that half a million people are now unemployed in this State.  That does not take into consideration the people who are on wage subsidy schemes, who number in the tens of thousands.  These people were made unemployed in large part due to the level 5 restrictions that came into place before the outputs of the level 3 restrictions materialised.  The mantra of the Government from the start has been that we are all in this together.  The Minister of State will have to agree that this is plainly untrue.  Hundreds of thousands of workers and businesses have had their ability to earn an income taken away from them.  Many have had their incomes radically reduced and hundreds of thousands have been pushed into poverty.  The restrictions have imposed a massive cost on many people throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  We in Aont&uacute; believe that politicians cannot represent if they cannot relate.  There is a song by Beck which includes the line, \"You can't write if you can't relate\".  The same is true for politicians.  We cannot represent the people if we cannot relate to the situation they are in.  When a Government is making decisions for the population while its members are themselves immune from the consequences of those decisions, it does not make for good governance.  If politicians do not share in the cost of those decisions, if they are blind to the real experiences of so many people, that is wrong.  In the last economic crash, there was a logical downward pressure on the incomes of elected representatives in line with the rest of society.  On this occasion, however, elected representatives' incomes are going in the opposite direction from the incomes of the people they represent.<\/p>  <p>  I submitted a Bill to the D&aacute;il today which seeks to cut Deputies' salaries by 25% for the period of level 4 and level 5 restrictions and during level 3 restrictions when pubs, caf&eacute;s and restaurants are closed.  If the body politic is going to make a decision to radically reduce the incomes of up to half a million people, even if that decision may, in some circumstances be logical, then we in this House should at least take some of that burden upon our shoulders.  Talk of everybody being in this together has been thrown around like confetti in this House since the start of the pandemic.  It is time we put our money where our mouth is.  I will seek to amend the Finance Bill to allow for the provisions of the Aont&uacute; Bill to be taken into consideration.<\/p>  <p>  Rural Ireland gets bits and pieces of support from the Government, with some money going to this scheme and some money to that scheme.  The truth of the matter is that those schemes are, in many ways, like social welfare for rural Ireland, providing enough to just get by but never enough to strive.  We have a radical problem in this country with a lopsided development that is turning Ireland into a city state.  This budget will in no way address that problem.  The trends we have seen over the past four Governments will continue under this Government unless we start to address that issue.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Ireland is an outlier in European terms when it comes to childcare provision.  The shamefully low investment in the sector was completely ignored and allowed to continue for far too long.  Since the start of the Covid crisis, many childcare operators have had to shut their doors for good and others are struggling to survive.  I urge the Minister to accept our amendments seeking to give the childcare sector the support it needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400047#ZZ00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1604510100,"counter":274,"content":"<p>We are in the middle of a worldwide pandemic and also facing the prospect of a hard border within two months.  Overall, I believe this budget is the right budget for this time and will give us an opportunity to get the economy back on track, once we get over the Covid crisis.  Brexit, on the other hand, will be a more difficult challenge and will, I fear, have longer-term consequences for the country, particularly for Border counties like my own constituency of Louth.  The budget has not delivered answers or solutions in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The devastating effects of Covid on our livelihoods and day-to-day lives are unprecedented.  The last time we were faced with a similar level of economic collapse was during the banking crisis.  At that time, the decision was taken to introduce austerity.  In hindsight, this was clearly wrong and it put too much of a burden on the ordinary people of this country.  I am pleased that the Government has not taken that approach in this crisis.  What the economy needs now is access to money.  Businesses that have been forced to shut their doors during the lockdown must be supported.  In fairness, a number of support measures are in place.  Many of the businesses most impacted are small businesses, often family-owned for two or three generations.  I know from speaking to business owners in Dundalk, Drogheda, Ardee and Carlingford that they are extremely worried about their futures.  They are fully supportive of any measures that will protect the public and they have shown their willingness to put their shoulders to the wheel to support the public health measures.  In return for their support, we must ensure they are given every opportunity to reopen their businesses once it is safe to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The universal social charge, USC, was introduced as a temporary austerity measure during the last economic crisis.  It is time now to put in place a plan for the winding down of this tax.  It has done what it was supposed to do and we need to see it removed from the tax code.<\/p>  <p>  Section 3 of the Finance Bill seeks to amend the tax treatment of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, which will now be treated as income for tax purposes.  This change is wrong.\u00a0 People who lost their jobs through no fault of their own will now face the prospect of having to pay additional tax on their PUP at some stage over the coming year.  That will only cause additional stress and worry for the thousands of people currently receiving the payment.\u00a0 The Government must clarify the tax treatment of this payment in order that the many thousands who are receiving it a have certainty as to their tax liabilities.<\/p>  <p>  Section 11 makes provision, by way of the insertion of a new section 485 in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, for the introduction of the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.\u00a0 This scheme is targeted at businesses that have been significantly impacted by the lockdown restrictions and it has been welcomed by many businesses.\u00a0 However, it is targeted only at businesses operating out of a fixed premises and which have had to close that premises to the public.\u00a0 I have spoken to many tradespeople in the construction industry who are unable to avail of the scheme.\u00a0 They generally work alone or perhaps in two-person teams, going into people's homes.  The Minister needs to look at their situation and\u00a0offer\u00a0them some type of solution.<\/p>  <p>  Section 25 of the Bill confirms a price increase on tobacco products.  I have been a constant critic of the tobacco industry and am of the view that it should contribute more to the health costs arising out of the use of its products.\u00a0 It costs billions each year to treat people who have illnesses associated with tobacco.\u00a0 It is time to charge additional taxes on those companies as a contribution to the yearly costs of treating patients affected by their products.<\/p>  <p>  Section 26 makes provision to increase the rate of carbon tax.\u00a0 For the record, I am totally in favour of carbon neutral activities and fully support any moves to make homes more energy efficient.\u00a0 However, I am totally against taxing each and every person in such an aggressive manner.\u00a0 This tax will affect those most in need.\u00a0 It will impact on the people who do not have the resources to make their homes more energy efficient or to upgrade their cars, if they have one, to a more energy-efficient model.<\/p> <p>The carbon tax will affect these people most and this is unfair.  With regard to electric vehicles, I fully support their use and I hope they become more affordable.  The provision of charging points needs to be improved.  We need to incentivise people to install charging points at their <\/p> <p>homes.  We are way behind in this area in comparison with our European neighbours.  <\/p> <p> I welcome the reduction in the VAT rate to 9% until December 2021 for the hospitality industry.  This has been called for constantly.  Let us be clear, however.  This reduction will be of no value if businesses are forced to close due to the lockdown.  We have to look at this issue and put in place measures to further support the sector.  As I have said, the reduction in VAT is of no benefit if the business is forced to close.<\/p> <p> The recently announced tax credit for staycations, while welcome, is not fit for purpose.  It is too cumbersome to use.  There is too much red tape involved and it is of no benefit to many of the businesses it was intended to help.  As I have said before, we need to get money into people's hands to spend on staycations.  A simple solution would be to give people a voucher to spend in the hospitality sector.  People would then have money in their hands and the hospitality sector could gain directly.<\/p> <p> We should be thankful that the Government did not introduce austerity and decided that supporting businesses to stay open is the correct policy to pursue.  Let us be clear, whatever needs to be done now to keep our economy open, must be done.  If we need to borrow money, that is what we need to do.  If a business is forced to close permanently as a result of lockdown, there is no comeback for that business.  It must be remembered that behind every business are people.<\/p> <p> I offer my full support to the many great businesses in Louth that have made great sacrifices in the name of public health and closed during the lockdown.  They have made very difficult decisions that were not based on income but on human needs.  For this, we must support them in reopening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400047#ZZ00300","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604510700,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I will confine myself to commenting on three aspects of the Finance Bill because of the lack of time available.  I want to ask the Minister about the tax treatment of the pandemic unemployment payments, PUP.  The PUP scheme is very different from ordinary social welfare schemes.  There are different rates, different conditions and so on.  The reason for this is very simple.  We are all familiar with the reasons people find themselves on social welfare in the ordinary course of events but people find themselves on the PUP because the businesses for which they work have been closed by Government decree to protect health.  We all accept this was a necessary move for the Government to make but, nevertheless, these people find themselves in this position because of a Government decision rather than through any fault of their own.  Many of them have suffered a very considerable drop in income and will have considerable bills to pay when and if they finally get back to work.  It is very unfair to include the PUP in a person's total income for tax persons because this means that, when they get back to work and try to restore their financial position and pay their bills, they will also have a tax bill from the Revenue Commissioners.  I realise the Minister will allow them to pay this bill over a period of three or four years but it is, in principle, wrong.  The Government was forced to reverse its reduction of the PUP and to restore it to the original rates.  It is now proposing that, when people get back to work and are at their most vulnerable, they will face an income tax bill.  That is unfair and unjust and should be examined again.<\/p>  <p> There are many arguments both for and against the help-to-buy scheme.  I will not get into the question of whether it increases house prices but the scheme as currently constructed does not, to a large extent, meet one its stated objectives, which is to allow people on lower incomes to purchase houses.  The difficulty is that, because of Central Bank rules on mortgages, the mortgages of those on lower incomes are determined by the size of their salaries.  I am talking about people on &euro;40,000 a year or less, of whom there are hundreds of thousands in this country.  To qualify for the help-to-buy scheme, one's mortgage has to be for at least 70% of the value of the house but people on low incomes will not be able to borrow enough.  They will not get a mortgage equivalent to 70% of the value of a house in most cases.  The difference has to be made up with their own savings, if they have any, or with support from family.  The higher one's salary, the greater one's opportunity to avail of this scheme because, under Central Bank rules, a higher salary will allow one to get a mortgage equivalent to 70% of the value of a house.  <\/p>  <p>  I did a calculation recently based on a person earning &euro;35,000 a year.  The most such a person could borrow would be &euro;125,000.  To get any kind of a half decent house in Limerick one would pay &euro;240,000 or &euro;250,000.  Such a person would therefore fall short of the 70% and would not qualify.  People on much higher incomes, however, would.  One can receive a refund of a maximum of &euro;30,000 of the tax one has paid over the past four years.  The irony is that people on low incomes will not qualify for that amount anyway because they will not have paid that much tax over the past four years.  I ask the Minister to comment on that in his response.<\/p>  <p>  My final point relates to the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  In his budget statement, the Minister for Finance made a very expansive announcement about this scheme but, if one looks at section 11 of the Finance Bill and at the detail of how this scheme will operate, it is by no means as extensive as we were led to believe.  I note that it is confined to businesses that have premises.  Why is that?  Can anybody explain the logic of that to me?  The rates rebate applies only to those who have premises because those who do not obviously do not pay commercial rates.  They are advantaged over what we might call \"the man in the van\".  The way in which this scheme is drafted means they now have a second advantage over the sole trader or small company that does not have a business premises.  That is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  I notice that the Revenue guidelines on section 11 say that a company that supplies a service, equipment or whatever to a number of businesses which have closed down because of Covid will not qualify for this scheme.  Quite frankly, I do not understand the logic behind this.  I spoke to somebody in Revenue and it seems that, if a person is supplying sound equipment for the entertainment industry and all of the local pubs and entertainment venues close down, that person will not qualify.  The logic appears to be that he or she can find other customers.  That is all very well if one is selling hamburgers or something like that but it certainly does not apply if one is selling specific items for which there is a limited number of customers.  It is very unfair.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the CRSS, section 11 states that the scheme will be paid as an advance credit against future trading income.  All of the documentation that has been released by the Government and the Department of Finance has referred to this as a grant.  What does this subsection mean?  Is it an advance against future tax credits such that, when the business starts paying tax again, it will lose some of its credits until such time as it has repaid what it has collected from the State?  This would mean that the more a business collects from the CRSS, the higher its tax bill will be in the future.  If that is the case, the Department of Finance should stop referring to this as a grant as it would, in effect, be a loan against future tax credits.  I was hoping it would be a grant.  On the day of the budget, I thought it was.  If it is an advance against future tax credits and will be clawed back through future tax on trading income, it makes the incentive very limited indeed.<\/p>  <p>  My time is up.  I look forward to what the Minister has to say on those three brief issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400048#AAA00200","speaker":"1492"},{"type":"speech","time":1604510700,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Coic&iacute;s &oacute; shin, bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag caint mar gheall ar ruda&iacute; a bh&iacute; in easnamh sa bhuis&eacute;ad.

There is an absence of day care services, respite nearly ground to a halt, and they had additional spending for personal protective equipment, PPE, heating, groceries and sanitiser.  Many carers in Kerry spoke to me, saying that when they apply for the carer's allowance, it seems there is an automatic policy of refusal on first application.  I am not sure if they are right or wrong.  Carers and the people for whom they care are vulnerable and many may be older and have underlying conditions.  We must do everything we can to support them.<\/p> <p> Much has been said already about the pandemic unemployment payment and making it taxable income.  Dozens of my constituents are distressed because their application for the Covid-19 payment has been declined on the basis of the Department not having any recent record of PRSI contributions made by them in specific classes.  Operational guidelines must be published so that people can understand this.<\/p> <p> In the previous lockdown the staff in my office in Tralee dealt with three people in the Limerick social welfare office.  They were Anne, Gr&aacute;inne and Jim, and I know them well.  They were able to deal with things on the spot.  A new email system has been set up, often taking two full weeks for us to get a reply for people who have had to go on supplementary welfare to get the Covid payment.  PRSI contributions were previously not a problem and this stinks of an attempt to reduce by any means necessary the numbers of people taking the payment.  We cannot get through this pandemic on the cheap but the Finance Bill seems to be trying to do this.<\/p> <p> The Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, seems to have been written for one industry at the expense of another.  Food suppliers in Killarney, who supply hotels and catering facilities, have contacted me as they seem to have been deliberately and precisely excluded.  These are family businesses with good employees over the years and they are wondering what they ever did to upset the Department.<\/p> <p> Bizarrely, in the budget there seemed to be scope for VAT to be reduced across a broad range of goods and services delivered to NATO members and European states engaged in the EU Common Security and Defence Policy.  This effectively amounts to a State subsidy for these activities, and this must be subject to proper scrutiny.  It is an irony not lost on me that the effect of this Finance Bill will be to increase fuel costs for small fishermen while decreasing them for the US military.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400048#AAA00300","speaker":"1488","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604511300,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I will be voting against the Bill, mainly due to the regressive carbon tax measures in it.  The carbon tax is an attack on the people of rural Ireland and the people of my constituency of Cork South-West.  It is an attack on the lorry driver, the agricultural contractors, the fishermen who must fill their trawlers and the ordinary father and mother who go to work every day and take their kids to school.  They are being hit in the pocket at the filling station when they move.<\/p>  <p>  The same politicians from Cork South-West voting for this Bill will be knocking on people's doors at some stage looking for a vote with a smile on their face, saying they did well for those same people.  What did they do?  They are set to destroy those people and take money from their pockets.  They are hurting the same people who must fill the home heating oil at some stage at an extra cost.  They cannot fill the car or buy a bag of coal, which is now an outrageous price.<\/p>  <p>  The days of balancing the books are truly behind us and governments all over the western world are now running expansionary budgets.  The allocation of &euro;5 million in funding for digital hubs and &euro;132 million for the national broadband plan is completely inadequate.  In 2021, many parts of rural Ireland will be without adequate broadband despite opportunities being created for remote working by this crisis.  The budget is a missed opportunity to recalibrate for a society that has changed to remote working, and this could completely transform many parts of rural Ireland into vibrant communities, with consequent benefits.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, like me, probably knows of blackspots all over his area.  In my area there are parts of Bandon, Kinsale, down to Ballinadee and right back to Bantry and Skibbereen where there are broadband blackspots that could be easily solved with a small bit of funding and thought.  It is not forthcoming and the least amount of money is being put forward again this year.  Broadband will be spoken about down the road.<\/p>  <p>  There is funding for Irish Water but there is little or no funding for major projects that must be carried out in Cork South-West.  It is only about what money can be grabbed from us so we can insulate the homes of people in Dublin and beyond.  It is what I can see.  There are projects in Bantry that are in desperate need of progression but no funding is to be set aside for it.<\/p>  <p>  The 600 houses required in Clonakilty will not be going ahead because serious investment in water infrastructure is needed.  I have spoken to developers in Clonakilty who have even been refused planning permission.  It is one of the most vibrant towns in west Cork, and I admit it is great to see it and we should not deny any bit of vibrancy in a community.  These towns need investment in the local community but they cannot get it.<\/p>  <p>  I had a Zoom call with the Bandon business association the other day.  They want the southern relief road to progress the town, which was partially done before people walked away 15 or 20 years ago.  There was talk of doing half of a proposed northern relief road as well.  It seems only half of everything comes to west Cork, or even zero, as there is nothing happening with the northern relief road.  These people need the southern relief road finished.  There must be funding to get towns like this up and running.  There was a big announcement on St. Brogan's school in Bandon, but no sod has been turned yet.  There is a desperate need for a stand-alone community college in Bandon.  It is the kind of investment we need in places like Bandon.<\/p>  <p>  Why are people paying VAT on PPE?  There should be zero VAT on Covid-related PPE, so why is the Government profiting from people who are desperate to protect themselves from illness?<\/p>  <p>  Many businesses want financial institutions to lower card transaction costs, given that most transactions are now cashless.  This is a big issue for smaller businesses, who wish to lower the transaction costs for credit card payments.  I have very little time left but we must also consider putting in place a mortgage moratorium for all businesses affected by Covid-19.  This was discussed before.  It should also apply to homeowners for the months in which they are struggling.<\/p>  <p>  Publicans are losing businesses and the Government shut them with the click of a finger.  They got away with it but when we caused a bit of excitement here, they were reopened.  The Government is happy to have them shut again.  I spoke to a publican the other day who spoke to his bank, which is not willing to give him any grace.  It is game over as far as that bank is concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400049#BBB00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1604511300,"counter":280,"content":"<p>At the outset I will highlight the great concerns I spoke of in my speech after the budget.  One of the first concerns is the absolutely crazy anomalies created by the tax reform group, which was set up by the Revenue Commissioners.  It is actively discussing the raising of further excise duties to compensate for the excise duties that will be lost with the introduction and pushing of electric cars and other vehicles on the public.<\/p>  <p>  I can translate this into very straight and ordinary English.  Any person doing what might be considered the good and right thing, if he or she can afford it, might buy an electric motor car.  The Government is trying to devise ways of increasing excise duty and putting it on electricity bills.  This is where the group is looking to increase excise duties.  This is absolutely crazy.  If what I am saying is incorrect, I would like the Minister to correct me.  If it is not true, he should highlight it.  Unfortunately, I am sorry to say that what I am saying is factual.  It is a Government report and it is trying to dream up ways of hitting people with more excise duties to compensate for the duties it will lose.<\/p>  <p>  This Government has signed itself and future Governments up to the carbon tax, which will affect people living in rural Ireland most.  We do not have adequate public transport and we must rely on our own motor cars to transport us from A to B.  We should always remember that the person living in the Black Valley or Ballinskelligs is as entitled to live as the person who resides in Blackrock.  These people are entitled to go from their homes to their place of work or to an education as much as anybody else.  It costs us more to do that because we must travel.<\/p> <p>We are delighted to keep the lights on in those because they are the very areas this Government and other Governments would like to see shut down.  The Government would be delighted if there were no lights on in Portmagee or in a lot of rural Ireland.  The Government would be happier if that was the case, because it would like to centralise people in towns, villages and cities, despite those areas being unable to cater for the people they have already.<\/p> <p> I have no doubt that in the years ahead electric vehicles will probably be a good thing.  They are not fit for purpose at the moment, however.  It is like the mobile phone I have now.  Current models are elaborate computers, whereas 20 years ago were very basic and were just phones.  It is the same with the current electric vehicles.  Great advancements will be made in the years to come in electric vehicles, and that will be welcome.  We must remember, however, that the green agenda we are forcing onto people is expensive.  I remind people that what this Government and this Bill is signing them up to will result in it costing much more for people to transport themselves from A to B.<\/p> <p> It will also cost people more money to heat their homes.  I refer to buying fuel, such as a bag of coal.  Elderly people, in particular, adore their little open fires.  We must remember there is nothing wrong with having an open fire in one's home.  We were always told that the right thing to do was to keep the home fires burning at all costs.  This Government is now trying to quench those fires to satisfy the green agenda.  That is exactly what we are doing in this Bill.  People need to be told the truth.<\/p> <p> I welcome the VAT decrease to 9% which is included in this Bill for the hospitality and other sectors.  However, we begged the Government to not increase that rate in the first place.  We begged the Government to reduce it, but it would not do that, and then it reduced it when the businesses were already shut.<\/p> <p> I come from the tourism capital of the western world, Kerry.  Killarney town is the focal point of all tourism for all of the world.  It is a leading light.  Sadly, those businesses are now closed, but I look forward to the day when they will be open again.  I want to ensure, however, that the 9% VAT rate will not only be retained beyond the 12 months being proposed, but for much longer.  We must ensure that businesses are allowed to continue to operate.  The Government is clapping itself on the back for making that change, but I will not applaud it because it is being done too late.<\/p> <p> Moving on to the increase in the tax on tobacco, I would be much happier if we lived in a world where nobody smoked.  I do not believe, however, that it is right to penalise people who do smoke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400049#BBB00300","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604511900,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I have been requested to highlight an anomaly regarding wholesalers.  Wholesalers to the catering industry will not qualify for any package.  Even though the Government has said they will, that is not the case according to the Revenue.  That is very unfair.  It is possible for them to stay open, but what are they going to do without customers?  They cannot live on the wind.  Suppliers of fish, vegetables and meat and bakeries that were supplying hotels and restaurants are not functioning at all.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to carers, the extra &euro;10 million the Government has said it would dedicate to them is not enough.  It is not enough for home and respite services, because there are now no day services.  We must compensate for that situation and ensure that these carers, who are already being driven into the ground, can pay for people to help them.  The housing adaptation grant is a welcome part of the local authority grants system in Kerry, but we need to get more funding for it.  It is intended to help people with disabilities who need to adapt their houses, but there is not enough money to go around for all the applicants.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of primary medical certificates for people with disabilities has been suspended since the middle of the summer.  I appeal to the Minister, because people with disabilities are again stranded in their homes.  I am referring to people who get strokes and elderly people who cannot move around and who need to adapt the car or buy a specially adapted car to allow them to go out of their homes for certain things.  There used to be grants to help people in poor circumstances if something went wrong in their home, but that has been scrapped.  That is very unfortunate, because a person with a reasonably good house might need some work to be done on it.  We need more money for home helps and to keep people in their homes for as long as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The closure of beds in Killarney Community Hospital and in other community hospitals will have to be made up in some other way.  Rooms will have to be adapted or rented in hotels to ensure that people who are sick and need attention can go into hospitals and be seen.  We cannot just tell them not to get sick.  When this pandemic started, the Government said that it would be different from the experience of the recession ten or 12 years ago.  The Government said funding would be available at low interest rates, that work would continue and we would work our way out of this difficulty.  I am calling, therefore, for funding for infrastructural schemes such as the sewerage scheme in Kilcummin.  Places such as Kenmare, Curragh, Scartaglin, Castleisland, Brosna and Caherdaniel all need work done to their sewerage systems.  There is no sewerage system in Scartaglin or Curragh and we need funding to realise projects in those places.<\/p>  <p>  I also request funding for the Killarney bypass, because the town can be choked by traffic at times.  The Ring of Kerry road also needs a special improvement grant for the stretch from Caherdaniel to Sneem and then onward to Blackwater Bridge.  I am also calling for funding for group water schemes, which appear to be in trouble with new red tape and guidelines.  The Government reduced the grant for treating water in wells from &euro;2,200 to &euro;1,000.  We also need funding for rural cottages, housing maintenance, a tenant purchase scheme and broadband.  I refer to &euro;3 billion being provided over five years.  When is that &euro;3 billion going to arrive?  We are also bereft of mobile coverage in many parts of Kerry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400050#CCC00200","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1604511900,"counter":283,"content":"<p>This Bill shows how far out of touch the present Government is with reality.  I refer to the reality of rural Ireland.  It shows how little the Government thinks of anyone outside a large city.  The Government wants those people to pay the most for all its projects, but it returns nothing to the counties.  A budget of &euro;18 billion was presented for 2021, but the allocation of &euro;5 million in funding for digital hubs and &euro;132 million for the national broadband plan is completely inadequate.  This was a missed opportunity to benefit people working from home.  Can we imagine what it is like to be asked to work from home and not have access to broadband?<\/p>  <p>  It is then necessary to drive to the nearest crossroads or village to see if it might be possible to pick up broadband.  This is an unbelievable situation.  Let us try to imagine that we are students in college and we must go online for our lectures.  Who would believe there is no broadband available?  The obvious solution in the budget was to provide adequate funding to accelerate the roll-out of broadband.  Imagine the way that could have transformed parts of Ireland into vibrant rural communities, with all the associated benefits for the entire area in which people live.  That was again a missed opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  The increase of carbon taxes in the budget, which affected the haulage industry and motorists, was grossly unfair.  I agree with the report from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, which stated that rural households will be more affected than urban households because they spend a greater share of their incomes on heating fuels and transport.<\/p> <p>I had said earlier in a D&aacute;il debate that one has to incentivise a change in behaviour.  The Government cannot ask people in rural Ireland to change when they have no alternative options.  As Eddie Punch from the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, said, \"If you have a Luas outside your door, you may decide to take it if it is more expensive to drive your car into town.\"  That is all very well when people have alternatives but living in rural Ireland there is no alternative.<\/p> <p> The Government is taxing the people of County Limerick and investing nothing back into infrastructure.  There is nothing for the sewerage plant that has been asked for in Askeaton for more than 30 years.  Nothing is being invested in basic maintenance so people can keep their houses from flooding even when they are not on a flood plain.  If travelling to Dublin from where I live in Granagh, I have to either drive to Newcastlewest to Adare and to Arthur's Quay in Limerick or to Mungret or Annacotty to get on a green bus.  There are no parking facilities for me to park there, so I must get someone to drive me there.  That is when I come up to Dublin on the bus.  When I go back down I also have to get someone to collect me.  That is four journeys but we will get no infrastructure.<\/p> <p> What did the Government do when denying medical certs for drivers who have a disability?  The Government went to the Supreme Court but lost the case when five Supreme Court judges voted against it.  The then Minister for Finance met with the then Minister for Health and cancelled all the medical certs for drivers with disabilities and now there are some 1,700 waiting.  The Government continued the assessments and told them they were on a list, but that list does not exist.<\/p> <p> The Government invests in nothing in rural Ireland.  Rural Limerick and rural Ireland will not stand for it.  I put it to the Minister that the next time he comes knocking on the door in a rural area I hope all the people in Ireland will remember the Government for another Dublin budget and for giving nothing back to the county of Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400050#CCC00300","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604512500,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Last year we all accepted Brexit was the main immediate threat to the economy.  This year, while we still face Brexit, we now have the coronavirus.  We are still unclear what the outcome of Brexit will be, even with an agreement on a trade deal.  It is still the case that the UK is leaving the EU whether we like it or not.  This will certainly bring changes.  It is important we are ready for these changes for citizens and for businesses.<\/p>  <p>  After years of austerity, it is heartening to see that with budget 2021, the largest investment in the history of the State, we are making preparations for all these scenarios.  It might have surprised people, but it is the right thing to do.  We need to make sure we can face the challenges of Covid and Brexit by giving people hope based on realism and on a plan.<\/p>  <p>  As these are my priorities, I am heartened to see the massive investments in health, in housing and especially in education.  I am working with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, on the technological university status for Carlow IT in the south east.  It is money well spent when we invest in our children's future.  I welcome that funding but we need to make sure we access it as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Funding is important for local sports clubs, local community groups, accessing affordable healthcare or medical cards, finding ways to access and pay for education, receiving help to buy a home or accessing social or affordable housing.  We need to look after people so they can have ways and means to access what they need to do.  People need a quality of life and we need to make sure we give this to them in the budget.<\/p>  <p>  Now that Covid-19 is on top of us, it is important we arm our society with the tools to live with it.  We cannot afford rolling lockdowns, so I really look forward to using this time to see where we can help and what we can do.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE and health are a big issue for me.  I am aware that with Covid-19 there are restrictions and so on, but a large number of people are calling my office who are waiting on operations, be it a hip operation or an eye operation.  We need to make sure we invest this budget wisely and that we make sure people are not waiting two and three years for hospital appointments.  That cannot happen anymore.  We need to make sure we deliver on that.<\/p>  <p>  A total of &euro;38 million will be available to implement new measures under the Sharing the Vision, our national mental health strategy.  There is a massive spend on health but it is important we do not forget our mental health.  It is another key area for me in the context of this pandemic.  Again, it is about accessing the services and making sure the money is delivered and filtered down to where it is needed.  We must make sure our most vulnerable people and those who are suffering get these services.  I have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, about mental health and she is committed to the issues.  I firmly believe that.<\/p>  <p>  There is a &euro;3.3 billion spend in housing, which is a huge budget.  While I welcome that, we also have the extension of help-to-buy scheme at an enhanced rate of &euro;30,000 in this budget.  I am concerned about reports I have received regarding the scheme.  I was contacted just last month by a home buyer who was approved in principle for a mortgage for a property in Carlow, which had been advertised at a price close to &euro;300,000 in July.  When that home buyer went about finalising the process and buying the home in question, they were told the price had gone up.  By how much?  It had risen by approximately &euro;30,000.  That cannot happen.  These are the things we need to watch.  We cannot just say that we have these measures, which we all welcome.  We also have to make sure the people and families on the ground get what they deserve or get that &euro;30,000 they should be getting.  This is what we need to make sure to do.<\/p>  <p>  I have always been very vocal on local authorities, and especially Carlow local authority.  A big issue for me is capital funding.  The local authority has always been underfunded by the Government.  We are always struggling and there are always huge cutbacks in Carlow County Council.  The staff and everyone there are doing their best.  We need to deliver now on funding.  The services have been cut and it is even harder to get funding in.  I welcome the nine month rates waiver and that the commercial rates waiver has been extended to December, but this is not good enough.  I can only fight for my own, but the local authority needs extra capital funding.<\/p>  <p>  The threshold to qualify to apply for going on to the local authority housing list needs to be addressed.  People are becoming homeless because they do not qualify for inclusion on the local authority housing list.  They cannot afford a home and yet they cannot go on the housing list.  This is unacceptable.  We need to make sure that when we are investing this &euro;3.3 billion, it is put in the right place.  The urban regeneration and development fund, which I have put in for, is a big project and hopefully we will get the funding from that.  I will fight hard for that.<\/p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;65 million is being made to facilitate energy efficiency improvements to social housing homes and another &euro;60 million will be provided to adapt the homes of up to 10,700 older people and people with a disabilities.  I welcome these schemes but these people are vulnerable and we need to ensure this work is carried out as quickly as possible, especially for elderly people in the winter.  The criteria for these schemes are sometimes not right.  I believe that needs to be looked at with a view perhaps to getting it done quicker.  It can take months for an occupational therapist to assess people.  This is through no fault of the therapists; it is because of Covid.  We need to look at changing those criteria.<\/p>  <p>  I now turn to broadband.  We ask people to work from home because we are at level 5, but we really need to have a proper broadband service in every area, including in my own area of Carlow, Tullow, and Bagenalstown.  We need to make sure it is there, but it is not currently.  Again, people call me about it and they are very upset.  There are two brilliant colleges in Carlow, namely, Carlow IT and St. Patrick's College.  Students are working and studying for their college courses at home and their broadband is very bad.  It needs investment.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the &euro;5 increase in the weekly living alone allowance, although it is not being paid until January.  I am aware the Christmas bonus double payment will be paid early in December.  A budget is a budget, but the most vulnerable people in our society, those people who need it most, need to be able to get what they deserve from this budget, and to access the funding they need, be it through a social welfare payment or a carer's payment, so that they are not fighting and can get whatever payment they deserve.  We must make sure we give them as much as we can.<\/p> <p>Quality of life means so much and people are struggling every week.  Many people are now not working due to Covid and through no fault of their own and many shops are closed.  People are in a different place and we need to make sure we look after them and that they have a proper Christmas.  Santy is coming in December.  We have to make sure the children of Ireland get a proper Christmas and that we do our best to secure the best we can for them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400051#DDD00200","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604513100,"counter":287,"content":"<p>These are not normal circumstances and this is not a normal budget.  We thought we would be dealing with Brexit and we are dealing with this pandemic instead.  The only way I can put it is to say we need to provide people with the supports required.  We need to do all we can and to be seen to do so.  It is straightforward.  It has been noted by many people here that, unfortunately, the carbon tax proposals in the Bill are regressive.  They will impact on those who do not have resources, who have less money and are not wealthy.  They will have a particular impact on those who live in rural Ireland and who do not have a huge number of alternatives.  That is a mistake.  There are no two ways about it.<\/p>  <p>  We welcome the increases in the PUP during level 5 but I will take some time to deal with a few questions.  Others have already spoken about the difficulty and worry people have about the tax liability that may relate to the PUP.  This is another thing that gives people the idea the Government is not backing them and it needs to be rectified.  There is also an anomaly where some people applying for the PUP may not have PRSI contributions due to the fact that they are paid less than &euro;352 per week.  A requirement that is not necessarily stated is that, to gain the PUP at the moment, people need to have made one PRSI contribution in the previous four weeks.  These situations are being dealt with.  People are being given a PUP-related email address and the issues are being worked through but it is an anomaly we could do with sorting.  We could be in this circumstance again at a later stage and we need to get these problems sorted as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I recently engaged with the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, about ensuring small self-employed operators would be able to avail of debt warehousing and getting an extension for filing returns to 10 December.  I welcome that.  It will deal with many cases but there is also another issue.  I have been told today that Revenue has stated it will be pragmatic in dealing with people who are given the surcharge but who may not necessarily avail of this debt warehousing or may not be aware of it.  We need to be very careful with that.  I call on the banks to be more pragmatic with forbearance.  I think the Government is going to have to call them back in.  We are hearing stories of individuals and businesses not being offered the sort of forbearance that is absolutely necessary and they are expected to pay as if their earnings are normal.  In some cases the businesses have been profitable but they are in the circumstances they are in and we need to back up them and our people.  It is as simple as that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400052#EEE00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1604513100,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I welcome the restoration of the full PUP to &euro;350 a week and the restoration of the wage supplement.  This should have been included in the budget but as I noted during the budget debate, it was inevitable that we would move to stricter restrictions very soon.  The proposal to tax the PUP is mean, miserly and unnecessary.  The last thing workers who have been laid off and whose incomes have been cut need is another debt but that is what is being proposed.  The amounts may not be huge but a debt of more than &euro;100 is still a debt.  For that reason, I and my colleague from the Independent Group, Deputy Pringle, will be moving an amendment to oppose this measure on Committee Stage.  We will be opposing part 1, chapter 3, section 3 of the Bill and we ask other Deputies to support us in that.  It is just not necessary to do this, particularly during the situation we are in.  It is one thing to introduce measures, but it is another to be able to access the payment, as has been already mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  A significant number of self-employed people have contacted me who have received replies from the Department of Social Protection stating that it does not have any recent record of PRSI contributions paid by them at the relevant classes.  They have been without payment since 21 October.  That is over two weeks now of waiting for a payment after losing their jobs due to the level 5 restrictions.  This has to be dealt with immediately.  In another case, an 18-year-old hairdressing apprentice applied for the PUP and was refused even though she got it during the first restrictions in March.  I do not know why this is happening.  Back in early August when the &euro;250 PUP was brought in a number of people, including people in the arts and entertainment industry and taxi drivers, contacted me because their payments were being reviewed.  Many of them were brought down to &euro;203 even though they had sent in their tax certificates and it was very clear they were self-employed and should have received the &euro;350 payment.  I made representations for them and sent in the exact same thing to the Department and every single one of the people for whom I sent in representations received the &euro;350.  That is a huge number of people to be restored to the &euro;350 payment.  Normally when one makes representations for people who have lost payments, one in ten or 20 would be reinstated.  When the Government puts in place public policies and supports for workers, those workers should be able to access them easily and not be left without any money for a number of weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The other area where the Government has let down people is that of under-18s who are working but who have not received the PUP, as well as people over 66 who are on pensions.  They should be getting a supplementary payment to bring them up if they are due to be on the &euro;250 a week.  That has not been dealt with and the Government has let down these people very badly.  It is obviously not in this together with them.<\/p>  <p>  The PUP is welcome but the ESRI has stated that 40% of the people who lost their jobs are much worse off now due to financial commitments like mortgages.  That was discussed at the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands this morning and it was said that the mortgage interest supplement should be reinstated immediately to support people in this situation.  The matter of rent supplement was not raised at the committee meeting but that payment should be also advertised more widely.  Many people do not even know they might be entitled to the rent supplement payment.<\/p>  <p>  I am raising these issues because there is no point introducing measures if workers are made jump through hoops to get the payments to which they are entitled.  It is bad enough losing one's job but then to be left for weeks without payment is a double-whammy.  The PUP and the wage subsidy scheme should remain in place for the duration of the pandemic.  The Taoiseach has said publicly that the pandemic mainly affects low-paid workers and he is right about that.  Life circumstances do not change for workers whether they are at level 5 or level 1 and the PUP and the wage subsidy payments should remain as they are from here on in.<\/p>  <p>  The 2021 budget, which this Finance Bill will underpin in law, is a response to the exceptional circumstance brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The pandemic has exposed serious, fundamental and structural problems in Irish society, particularly the underfunding of essential public services.  An opportunity has been lost, not just to dramatically increase the funding available but to carry out fundamental and necessary reforms.  As regards Covid, the bulk of extra spending is going to supports for businesses, the wage subsidy scheme and the PUP.  These supports are necessary but other areas are also crucial to combatting the pandemic.  We need a properly funded and functioning public health service; a functioning test and trace system; to tackle overcrowding by solving the housing crisis; a properly resourced Health and Safety Authority to ensure safety in the workplace; an emergency programme to close down direct provision; and funding to reduce class sizes. <\/p> <p>This Bill and the budget fail in these key areas.  Despite the extra funding to help the health service, there are significant problems with staff recruitment.  The reality is that more funding is required.  Are there emergency places opening in colleges for health workers and teachers?  I know something was brought in with regard to education yesterday.  The testing and tracing has been undermined by a similar failure to recruit the necessary staff.  Those staff were being recruited.  From what we are hearing, the jobs are not paying well.  Their pay and conditions are bad.<\/p> <p> On housing, the key to a solution is a commitment to public housing and public land.  The &euro;500 million for capital expenditure contrasts sharply with the &euro;2.4 billion for current expenditure by the Department, with &euro;1 billion of that going to landlords for housing assistance payments and rental accommodation scheme payments.  There is no commitment to build real public housing to deal with the crisis, and this has been going on for years.  We are in the middle of a pandemic and people are in overcrowded circumstances.  There is no commitment to build public housing on public land.  We know there is sufficient public land to build at least 100,000 mixed tenancy homes, including traditional council housing and cost rental.<\/p> <p> Our education system, particularly in primary schools, has suffered from years of chronic underinvestment.  Covid is now showing up the lack of basic facilities such as a hot water supply, minimal provision for cleaning, and cramped and overcrowded facilities for learning and play.  We have the highest class size in the EU, with one in five pupils having a pupil-teacher ratio of 30:1.<\/p> <p> We entered the crisis with almost 700,000 people living below the poverty line, including 225,000 children.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul commissioned a study which shows that a single adult needs a minimum of &euro;249 a week to get by.  Leaving core welfare rates at their present level means a continuation of widespread poverty, which will undoubtedly increase as unemployment grows due to Covid-19 restrictions.  We are heading towards a 50% jobless rate for workers under 25 years of age.  Under-25s make up 11.7% of the labour force but make up 22% of those on the pandemic unemployment payment.  A high proportion will have been in part-time, low-paid jobs and are therefore on the lower level of the pandemic unemployment payment.  With regard to jobseeker's allowance, 13,000 or 85% of under-25s are on the lowest rate of up to &euro;112 a week.  The National Youth Council estimates that a young person living alone in an urban area, taking rent into account, needs &euro;466 for basic needs.  Some &euro;112 is a quarter of that, with HAP still short of &euro;190 a week for basics.<\/p> <p> This Government had an opportunity with the budget and the Finance Bill to try to address the fundamental issues facing ordinary people in this period and into the future.  We know that the ability to borrow at almost 0% interest was an opportunity to begin to address the problems in public healthcare, affordable housing and access to quality education where it matters the most, at primary level, and to tackle unacceptable levels of poverty.  It is an opportunity that has been missed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400052#EEE00300","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604513700,"counter":290,"content":"<p>At this stage, Opposition Deputies are used to going through the Finance Bill, which follows the budget, with a fine-tooth comb.

There has been no evidence to show that the relief has done anything except push up prices for people who could already afford homes.<\/p><p>The Finance Bill should not include section 3 on taxing the Covid payments.  Section 3 proposes to amend section 126 of the principal Act, regarding tax treatment of certain benefits payable under the Social Welfare Acts.  This has been a difficult year for people and businesses in Donegal and across the country.  We are coming up to the time of year that means so much for a lot of businesses, and due to coronavirus restrictions, many of these businesses have had to close their doors to the public.  Now is exactly the time that the Government should be trying to keep as much money in the local economy as possible.  Many businesses in Donegal and elsewhere are still trading online during lockdown, and the public can support them by shopping local.  There is a great risk of many small local businesses closing permanently and devastating local economies.  By not taxing the pandemic unemployment payment, the amount that people can spend locally will be increased and can go some way to supporting local businesses and economies to survive.<\/p><p>I, like many other Deputies, have been encouraging people to support Irish businesses this Christmas.  Local businesses can provide many of the same services as multinational giants like Amazon, while also saving jobs in local communities.  When we shop local, we are supporting our neighbours, local jobs and local communities, whereas shopping on Amazon is just adding to Jeff Bezos's trillions and supporting a huge corporation with notoriously bad working conditions for many of its workforce.<\/p><p>The coming weekend of 6 to 8 November is #BuyDonegalWeekend, an initiative of Donegal County Council in collaboration with businesses across the county, to highlight the range of Donegal products available.  The Letterkenny Chamber has been getting out the message, &quot;Shop Local - Stay Local&quot;, to encourage people to shop locally online during lockdown. I encourage people to visit the websites and social media accounts of our local businesses to see how they can shop with them online during lockdown.  Local authorities and agencies are trying to help local businesses and have explicitly said that removing this tax liability would be a way for the Government to support those efforts.<\/p><p>Section 3(2) states that some provisions shall be deemed to have come into operation on and from 13 March 2020 and section 3(3) provides for retrospectively applying the law from 5 August 2020.  It is reported that approximately 600,000 people will be affected by this underhanded tax change.<\/p><p>The Finance Act 2018 stated that urgent needs payments paid under section 202 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 were included under tax-free income.  The political journalist, Gavan Reilly, has produced some very informative Twitter threads on this issue.  The Minister's Department&rsquo;s statement to Virgin News stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tSection 202 was used as a vehicle of convenience from March last to get payments out quickly ...  However, this does not mean that the PUP is an urgent needs payment. <\/blockquote>  <p>The Revenue Commissioners backed up the Minister's position, saying, &quot;As the PUP is not specifically exempted from income tax the payment is subject to tax.&quot;  As Gavan Reilly put it on 23 October, &quot;both the taxman and the Government say: the PUP was a Section 202 payment in practice, but not in spirit.&quot;<\/p><p>There is a very interesting paper from 2009, The Constitution and Retrospective Tax Legislation, by Paul Brady, BL, where he concluded that there ought to be only two justifiable circumstances for retrospective tax legislation, which are curative legislation, and when the legislation is necessary to stop the State going bankrupt.  He states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tPart of a taxpayer's property rights is the right to know where he or she stands.  That is, a right to know in advance what the tax implications of his or her actions will be.  Any interference with that right should only be justified when prospective legislation is inadequate to prevent an extreme financial crisis for the State. <\/blockquote>  <p>The inadequacy of the pandemic unemployment payment levels has been subject to much debate.  To now bring forward a provision shafting those who lost their jobs because of a global pandemic and leave them with further income tax bills will just add to the mental health strains already evident across the country.  As usual, it is those at the lower end of earnings who will suffer the most.  I hope to submit an amendment in opposition to section 3 on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>Why have beauticians not been exempted from the VAT reduction that was extended to hairdressers?  In Part 3, section 37, which pertains to value added tax, seeks to amend section 46 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010.  It reduces the VAT rate to 9% from 1 November 2020 for certain businesses.  This VAT reduction is to remain in effect until the end of December 2021 and will apply to restaurant and catering services, admissions to cinemas and museums, etc.  Point 13(3) of Schedule 3 to the principal Act is included and applies this reduced rate of 9% to hairdressing services.  I have been contacted by many small business owners in Donegal who provide beautician services and they are unhappy with their exclusion from this reduction.  I know that beauticians are not provided for in the 2010 Act under other services but surely they should be included in any of the measures that are being introduced to assist businesses in continuing despite disruptions due to Covid.<\/p> <p>There is another section I wish to draw to the Minister's attention and on which I have a question.  In Part 2, section 29, which pertains to excise, provides for the amendment of section 104 of the Finance Act 2001.  It inserts two new subsections (ba) and (bb) after section 104(1)(b) of the 2001 Act.  Section 104 of the 2001 Act states:<\/p><blockquote>\t104.&mdash;(1) Subject to compliance with any conditions or limitations the Commissioners see fit to impose, the duties of excise imposed by the provisions referred to in section 97 shall not be charged or levied on excisable products delivered&mdash;  \t(a) under diplomatic arrangements in the State,<br \/><br \/>(b) to international organisations recognised as such by the State, and the members of such organisations based in the State, within the limits and under the conditions laid down by international conventions establishing such organisations or by other agreements.  <\/blockquote> <p><i><\/i>The new subsections (ba) and (bb) relate to the exemption of excise on products delivered to NATO forces and, from 1 July 2020, forces of EU member states taking part in activities related to the Common Security and Defence Policy.  The explanatory memorandum with the Bill states that this is &quot;to transpose Article 12(1)(ba) and (c) of the EU General Excise Directive, 2008\/118\/EC, as amended by Article 2 of the EU Directive 2019\/2235&quot;.  Council Directive 2019\/2235 of 16 December 2019 amended Directive 2006\/112\/EC &quot;on the common system of value added tax and Directive 2008\/118\/EC concerning the general arrangements for excise duty as regards defence efforts within the Union framework&quot;.  This directive is also provided for in the Finance Bill 2020 in Part 3, section 40, which pertains to value added tax.  Goods and services supplied to NATO are exempt from VAT, and from 1 July 2022, goods and services supplied to forces of member states undertaking a common defence effort under the Common Security and Defence Policy of the EU will also be exempt from VAT under the Bill.  What assessments of costs have been done on these measures?  How much will be lost to the Exchequer as a result of granting these exemptions?  When were these measures communicated to the D&aacute;il?<br\/><br\/>Article 29.9 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann states: &quot;The State shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence pursuant to Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union where that common defence would include the State.&quot;  In December 2017, Ireland voluntarily signed up to the European Council's permanent structured co-operation on security and defence, PESCO.  The webpage of the European Commission's representation in Ireland, under the heading of &quot;Foreign affairs, security and defence&quot;, reads:<\/p><blockquote>\tPESCO is a sophisticated legal instrument central to the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) that enables the EU to play its part in global peacekeeping, crisis management and conflict prevention.  The CSDP is an integral part of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), through which the EU speaks and acts as one in world affairs. <\/blockquote> <p>Does that include NATO as well?  At the end of December 2018, we were informed that being part of PESCO had not cost the State anything.  Despite strong opposition from me and other Members, this went ahead and now provisions are being made for tax exemption in our Finance Bill, without any discussions, clarity or debates as far as I can tell.<br\/><br\/>It would be far more helpful if the Government was transparent about the annual Finance Bill.  It is unfair on Deputies, media and the electorate when it only highlights the few stories that it wants to talk about during budget week.  I continue to be disappointed with this Government and will be voting against the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400053#FFF00200","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604514300,"counter":292,"content":"<p>It is difficult to understand how the previous speaker could have issues with this budget, of all budgets, or with the budgetary approach of the Government during the pandemic.  Essentially, billions of euro have been spent on the most vulnerable in our society.  As I have mentioned on a number of occasions, there is an unwritten social contract between the State and its citizens whereby the citizen hopes that in a time of crisis the State will be there for the citizen.  The manner in which the State has behaved over the last ten months has been impeccable, and exemplary in comparison with some neighbouring countries, in how it has sought to look after its citizens during this time.  Has it always been right?  No, and some of the wrongs were corrected, particularly in respect of the pandemic unemployment payment being restored to &euro;350.  The Government must always be acutely aware, and my party colleagues are aware, of the difficulties for people who have to live on &euro;300 or &euro;350 per week, particularly coming into winter when fuel costs are higher.<\/p>  <p>  The thing that characterises the pandemic from a fiscal perspective is that, unlike the financial crash ten years ago, no country in the world is unaffected by the pandemic.  Even though the financial crash was described in global terms, many countries were unaffected by it.  However, nobody has escaped the impact of the pandemic, and every country must do what it can to ensure its citizens get through it safely.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the commitment to and care for those who are out of work and who previously had their mortgage payments suspended, the State must go back and talk to the banks about that.  The State bailed out the banks.  It was that act which allowed us to borrow, and borrow at the low interest rates that those on the left talk about, as well as how we should spend the money that is borrowed at low interest rates.  They never mention the fact that if we had not bailed out the banks, and none of us liked it or was keen on doing it, this country would not have any credit rating abroad and would simply not have been able to borrow, even for the pandemic, the amounts of money it has had to borrow to look after its citizens.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the significant educational input of the budget.  The Minister, who was present earlier, could not go into all the detail due to circumstances and time limits, but the educational input will result in the pupil-teacher ratio being reduced.  That was never more important than now in terms of class sizes and the impact of the virus.  There is an increase in resources for children with special needs, and we are only at the first stage of this.  I raised an issue in my constituency in the last D&aacute;il, and the Minister for Education and her Department are beginning to move on this.  There is only one autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit in the postal addresses of Dublin 6, Dublin 6W and Dublin 16, whereas the postal districts of Dublin 24 and Dublin 12 have multiple ASD units.  That led to the ratio of children with special needs in some of the schools in Dublin 24 and Dublin 12 being out of proportion with the ratio of children with special needs in schools in Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W, which is simply not right.  I and other colleagues raised it when we were in the Opposition.  Small moves are being made on it, but it must be addressed.  It is an area that must be resourced significantly.<\/p>  <p>  I also commend the Government on the recent announcement of the agreement with caretakers and school secretaries.  It was long-running issue, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, will be familiar with it.  That has been warmly welcomed by people in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  My constituency covers the areas of Greenhills, Templeogue, Rathfarnham, Tallaght, Ballycullen and Citywest.  It has two major Garda stations in Tallaght and Rathfarnham.  Obviously, Tallaght would be considered the mother ship.  I am delighted with the additional Garda resources, including Garda cars and personnel, that will be allocated.  The Garda has had significant drugs finds.  It beggars belief that drug suppliers can get the drugs through even during a pandemic.  They have used all sorts of creative methods to get their drugs to recipients, ranging from An Post to Parcel Motel.  In fact, drug seizures were up approximately 5% on the same period in 2019, which is remarkable given how the country has been locked down for so long.<\/p>  <p>  The waiving of commercial rates and the VAT reduction for businesses are to be welcomed, but a VAT reduction for a business that cannot trade is quite useless.<\/p> <p>I urge the Minister and my Government colleagues to support businesses.  I spoke informally to the Taoiseach about it recently.  We must have some sense now of the pattern of the virus.  There have been a few challenges in Dublin but we had begun to succeed with level 3, plus the ban on household visits.  It was certainly stabilising the virus and the level 5 measures will be important for driving it down.  The Minister knows that some businesses will simply not reopen.  We must have the data now on the infection rate in non-essential businesses and in all the large multiples and retailers.  I refer to the staff rather than the customers.  I know as a fact from talking to supermarket owners locally that the rate has been virtually zero.  What are the figures the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, has in that regard?<\/p> <p> Likewise, we must have figures on the efficacy of mask wearing.  I get it that NPHET wants to cut down on mobility but it does not make sense to many citizens to close businesses when juvenile teams of 15 can engage in non-contact training, but the same children cannot play on the local tennis courts or the people who are training them cannot play on the local golf course.  We need to reflect on that to ensure we fall back to some degree on people's sense of self-responsibility and to treat people like adults.<\/p> <p> Businesses need to be encouraged and a number of things could be done in the hospitality area.  I see some innovation in the city in terms of outdoor furniture.  Irish people have shown that they will do what is necessary to keep themselves warm.  We could provide grants for the provision of canopies and give planning exemptions for the erection of canopies within a certain square footage, as applies on the Continent, so that outdoor space is more protected if we do open up a little, given that people feel more comfortable outdoors because the virus has less chance of spreading.  However, we need to incentivise businesses to do that.  I was talking to a local publican this morning who is very keen to provide street furniture but given that he has had no income since March, he is concerned about the outlay.  If a business owner wants to erect a fairly solid canopy outside his or her premises, he or she must apply for full planning permission and that would take three months and could take longer if there were objections.<\/p> <p> We must be really creative about how we deal with this.  We need to look at the possibility, when we get back to level 3 in the future, that non-essential stores or services would be allowed to open.  Experts could look at the issue.  Google must have significant data on people's movement and mobility in the past eight or nine months.  All stores do not have to open at the same time.  It would be great if we staggered the opening of stores and in doing that there was evidence to show that people are not congregating in great numbers for that reason.  It would allow non-essential services to open.  For example, hairdressers could open from 5 p.m. until 10 p.m., which would means they were not caught up in the rush of people shopping and it would be a quieter time for people to move around.  The same could happen with a range of other non-essential services that could open at different hours.  We could encourage employers to stagger lunch hours in order that people are not queuing at the same time for a sandwich, coffee or whatever else, thereby increasing the chance of contracting the virus.  We can never come back to level 5.  It is clear the country could not bear it economically but I really do not think people could bear it psychologically either.<\/p> <p> I am like a broken record, in that in every contribution I make I keep harping back to the only precedent in Ireland for something similar, which was the Spanish flu.  It had a surge in October and November and another surge in March and April, so we ought to anticipate a third surge and prepare accordingly for it.<\/p> <p> We need to be more agile in our policies and much more flexible.  We must consider measures such as the ones being introduced on the Continent now, for example, curfews.  It is a very easy thing to police.  If there is a curfew from 10 p.m. until 6 a.m. then businesses are shut, people should not be out, there are no house parties and no house visits.  It does not have to be every night of the week but it is a really easy thing to police and it is certainly a good way of stopping people's mobility as a short, sharp, shock measure.  The Minister should not bring us back to level 5.<\/p> <p> Again, there must be data on an issue I mentioned at the Joint Committee on Health this morning.  There are four local electoral areas in my constituency and, as we know, the figures for Covid are available for local electoral areas.  Three of the four are under the national percentage for positive cases but one area is above it and it has been above it consistently.  One does not need to be a rocket scientist to figure it out.  It relates to housing conditions, perhaps working conditions and a number of other factors as well, yet we do not seem to be targeting those areas to help them drive the figures down.  It is in economically deprived areas that the numbers are most significant.  That is the case throughout Dublin, yet we do not seem to be adopting or coming up with any measures that attempt to deal specifically with that.<\/p> <p> I know I have strayed off the Bill but these are all economically related issues.  As the Minister is aware, I am a big fan of micromobility.  I think it is something the Government needs to get its teeth into.  I know the Minister extended the bike-to-work scheme to e-bikes but a good electric bike costs a lot of money.  One has to shell out &euro;1,500, &euro;2,000 or &euro;2,500 for a really good bike before one gets the tax back.  There is a system in Belgium, for example, whereby if employers provide any facilities in the workplace such as shower facilities, equipment such as bicycle parking stations or bicycle lockers or if they buy the bikes themselves, it is tax relievable to 125%.  There is huge take-up on that in Belgium.  In fact, some employers pay their employees a very modest rate as a further incentive.  A Belgian man gave a keynote speech in this convention centre a year ago at the cycling international conference, Velo-city.  Belgium is the leader in this area.  The man earned &euro;70 a month from his employer for using an e-bike to go to work because he had not taken his car.<\/p> <p> Dublin Chamber will forward a paper on micromobility in terms of e-scooters.  The British Government did not introduce laws, it just introduced a trial of e-scooters for a period of up to a year.  A number of constabularies in the UK have requested e-scooters.  We have brought no regulations in here yet, although we have halved the capacity on buses, so people have got back into their cars, as they do not have any alternatives.  Part of the reason the Government has not done it is because most Ministers have never been on an e-scooter or used an e-bike.  It is not until one has that experience that one sees not just how much fun they are but how practical they are, particularly in a city or town.  They are the last mile people talk about, and unlike a bus or a taxi they are incredibly convenient.<\/p> <p> I signed up to the dublinbikes scheme this year because there is a bike station outside the convention centre and there is also a bike station outside Leinster House.  One can imagine if we had an e-scooter station.  We would not need our cars.  That would be a sight for journalists.  I am sure Miriam Lord would have a field day if she saw us but I am talking about the practicality of it.  Other countries are way ahead of us on this.  All it requires is a little change in the law.  I would like to see a little bit more innovation.  Some of my colleagues organised trials, which had to be done off the public road as e-scooters are illegal at present.  Again, it is only when one has the experience of an e-scooter that they become more robust and practical.  Young people would love them.  We have cut back significantly on public transport, in particular in the early days of Covid.  We probably cut 75% of the seats that were available and then we were up to 50% capacity and now the capacity is being cut again so people are being forced back into driving their cars.<\/p> <p> This evening, RT&Eacute; news reported that the High Court has approved a settlement in the case of a 15-year-old boy who developed an incurable sleep disorder and a debilitating autoimmune condition after receiving a swine flu vaccine ten years ago.  By pure coincidence, I had a call with a constituent this morning who is the mother of a young girl who was administered the same vaccine, along with her mother, but who had side effects as a result.  It was just a fluke.  As her mother said, they were not anti-vaxxers and her husband has just had the normal flu vaccine.  What she pleaded for, and what the High Court provided for today, is a certain amount of facilities.<\/p> <p> The decision by the High Court is a ground-breaking settlement that paves the way for a further eight people.  The agreement means that any financial compensation received as part of these settlements would be disregarded when assessing a person's means for eligibility for State supports such as medical cards, exam fees and student accommodation costs.  When some of the parents involved appealed decisions to reject a medical card on behalf of their children, the Department of Health stated that it could not deal with them because the matter was subject to court proceedings.  The reason that these issues were subject to court proceedings was that the people in question were looking for the tiniest break.  They were not looking for compensation or anything like that.<\/p> <p> The woman with whom I had a conversation this morning told me that there needs to be some identifying mark on the Department of Social Protection and HSE system that automatically provides discretion when someone like her daughter applies for either a medical card or some kind of assistance.  This woman's daughter has to take a nap at school at 1 p.m. and a nap after school from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m.  She said that her energy levels are a bit like when one recharges a battery.  She only ever gets to 30% or 40% recharge as a result of the damage the vaccine did.  Our conversation was not dominated by the vaccine, it was dominated by how bloody difficult it is for her to access even the most basic of assistance and help for her daughter in terms of State support.  The mother's big concern is that, while her daughter is 15 or 16 now and she is 52 or 53, in the future her daughter will require assistance.  She is, otherwise, a healthy human being with the same dreams and ambitions as any other young kid.  However, she will need some kind of care for the rest of her life and everything has to be fought for.<\/p> <p> What happens is that the High Court rules in favour.  It always seems to end with a High Court decision.  I am hopeful because colleagues like the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Rabbitte, have incredibly compassionate streaks.  However, the court case today really illustrated the point I am making.  I was not aware that the decision on the narcolepsy issue was going to be handed down today.  Will the Minister use his influence in the Government to ensure that this issue is addressed?<\/p> <p> Survivors of the mother and baby homes were looking for this as well.  I remember meeting them with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, last year.  They were looking for little things like discretionary medical cards because they might not qualify for regular cards on the basis of their normal income.  They had suffered so much, whether it was psychologically, mentally or emotionally.  If we could create in the system a little red tick that would indicate the position when such a person applies for additional help or for modest additional resources or would alert the State to the need to treat his or her application with discretion, it would mean that matters would be dealt with in a different way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400054#GGG00200","speaker":"1572","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604515500,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill.  It is an important Bill, a version of which we see every year giving effect to the financial and tax measures in the budget.  With that in mind, I want to speak to some of those tax changes, specifically in respect of the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and on some business and workers' rights related matters.<\/p><p>One key measure announced on budget day was the CRSS.  In his budget speech, as well as over the following days, the Minister and his Government colleagues outlined how it was designed to assist those businesses whose trade had been significantly impacted upon or temporarily closed as a result of restrictions set out in the Government's living with Covid-19 plan.  The details of this scheme are laid down in the Bill.  We can see from the finer details as to how the scheme will generally operate when level 3 or higher is in place and will cease when those restrictions are lifted.  Will the Minister provide some further details on this matter?<\/p><p>Section 485(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 describes business activity with three separate subsections below the definition.  Prior to the detail being relayed in the Bill, many suppliers were concerned that they would not be included.  They were specifically concerned that they would not be included during level 3 restrictions due to how the Minister articulated the details of this scheme on budget day.  Section 485(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 states that one example of business activity is:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... where customers of the trade acquire goods or services from that person other than through attending at a business premises, that portion of the trade which relates to transactions effected in that manner shall be deemed to relate to the business premises or, where there is more than one business premises, shall be apportioned between such business premises on a just and reasonable basis. <\/blockquote>  <p>Will the definitions of business activity not exclude suppliers, cash and carries and so on?  Suppliers upstream in the business chain may be drastically affected by the impact of the public health measures on their customers downstream who are affected by levels 3 to 5 restrictions.  It is important that they are explicitly included in level 3 through to level 5.<\/p><p>The scheme provides for qualifying businesses to apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a cash payment to assist them and provide targeted support during their time of need.  My understanding is that this cash payment is essentially an advance or a loan from the State to the businesses.  However, it actually involves lending businesses their own money because the scheme is an advanced credit for trading expenses.  Accordingly, it is an advance on the business tax credit scheme.  It is their own money.  This is not a grant.  This is the State fronting the money with Revenue just to make the tax credit available directly in cash.  The result is that the CRSS payment will reduce the amount of trading expenses that are deductible in computing the taxable income of a business.<\/p><p>We had the July stimulus package only five months ago.  The VAT reduction for tourism and hospitality should have been delivered then, a point now acknowledged by some on the Government benches.  We welcome the measure but it should have been done in July.  The problem now for businesses is not only that this measure is five months too late but that it is currently of no use to them, while the level 5 restrictions mean that they cannot operate or take advantage of the reduction.<\/p><p>I want to focus on one group of workers who feel totally let down by the Government and who had hoped that, either through the budget or another way, that their situation would have been resolved by now.  The workers at Aer Lingus have been locked in a battle with the airline and the Department of Social Protection for the past nine months.  We all understand the ongoing impact that Covid-19 has had on the aviation industry and that workers' hours across all airlines have been dramatically reduced.  For many workers, this has meant that they are now only working one, two or even three days a week.  These reductions are not, however, the source of their anger.  Their frustration stems from the failure of the Department of Social Protection to ensure that they receive their entitlement to short-time work support for the months March to August when they were on the temporary wage subsidy scheme.<\/p><p>Aer Lingus has consistently dragged its heels with these workers and has refused to sign necessary forms so that they can access welfare that they absolutely and desperately need.  These people have spent their savings.  Any savings they had are gone.  They are entitled to this social welfare benefit but the company will not fill out the forms, while the Department of Social Protection will not accept the forms without the stamps on them.  It is beyond ridiculous at this stage.  These are people who pay a lot of tax and work extremely hard.  It is not their fault that they cannot go to work.  They are being punished as a result of a refusal on the part of the Government and the Department of Social Protection to instruct the company to fill out the forms or instruct the Intreo offices to accept them without the stamp.  I am appealing to the Minister to take action on this as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400056#JJJ00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1604515500,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I echo the points made by Deputy O'Reilly on the CRSS.  It is important that as many as possible businesses are included.  It is probably not the scheme that we would like in that it is effectively lending businesses their own money.  We would rather have seen some sort of grant scheme.<\/p> <p>That said, some businesses will benefit from it, which I welcome and I encourage them to apply, but I ask the Minister to ensure that as many of the affected businesses as possible are able to avail of it.  <br\/><br\/>Other positive things came out of the budget.  I refer in particular to the reversal of cuts to the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  This happened because of sustained pressure by Sinn F&eacute;in and other parties.  In hindsight it is incredible that the payment was ever cut.  The reversal of the cut is welcome, though it did not go as far as we would have liked.  It is hard to comprehend the logic behind cutting supports like that and supports for businesses when the pandemic looked very likely to escalate.  Workers were in a very uncertain position and still faced the prospect of hardship.  The payment should never have been cut.  I welcome the reversal, but the Government should have listened to us during the budget discussions, after which the decision was made.<br\/><br\/>We have concerns about other issues.  The changes in the vehicle registration tax are hard to comprehend.  In many respects they anticipate a motor industry that does not yet exist.  They anticipate consumer behaviour that not only does not exist but is not even possible yet.  We are asking people to pay more for the cars they have or will buy or else to choose an electric vehicle as an alternative.  <i>DoneDeal.ie <\/i>features only about 80 such cars for less than &euro;10,000.  A brand new electric car costs &euro;40,000 or possibly more.  These are not affordable or realistic options.  I agree with the objective of shifting to electric vehicles and reducing the overall number of cars on the road in the longer run.  However we will need significant improvements to public transport infrastructure to achieve that.  That motor industry does not exist yet.  Those cars are not there.  Consumers do not have the option to choose them. <br\/><br\/>I also note the things that are missing from the budget.  When will an affordable housing scheme be brought forward?  We have been talking about it for ages.  The last Government promised it any number of times.  Fianna F&aacute;il said there would be a housing budget every year.  There never was such a budget.  Affordable housing was never built.  The last Government was a catastrophe in that respect.  I hope this Government will be better.  The scheme has been delayed repeatedly and we still have not seen anything.  I am concerned that this scheme will just be a fig leaf and a press release, perhaps in the form of some kind of shared equity scheme.  The last such scheme did not work out that well.  It must give councils the ability to build their own affordable housing schemes.  They have land to which debt is attached.  Several schemes in Cork city and county will not proceed unless the debt attached to the land is dealt with.  This will prevent people who do not qualify for social housing but who cannot afford a mortgage from getting housing.  <br\/><br\/>Finally, I wish to discuss schools.  There has been no increase in the capitation grant at primary or post-primary level.  I find this hard to comprehend in light of the additional costs that must be paid.  Rental incomes from halls and other rooms has more or less disappeared, heating costs will be massive this winter as schools try to deal with ventilation and refuse costs will increase as personal protective equipment, PPE, will have to be disposed of.  It is incredible that there is no increase in capitation grants.  A lot of schools are already under serious financial pressure and will be even more so by the end of the school year.  They will barely be able to make ends meet.  The Government must begin the process of revisiting that now.<br\/><br\/>It is incredible that schools are losing teachers at this point.  One school in Cork city that is part of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme has lost a teacher.  It will have to combine two classes.  The school is not benefiting from the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.  Some of the most disadvantaged schools in the State did not benefit from that.  That is shameful and wrong and must be revisited.  I will be raising that matter with the Minister.  Schools should not be losing teachers at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400056#JJJ00300","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604516100,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Like the budget, this Bill is most notable for its lack of vision.  It largely ignores the fact that 637,000 people in Ireland are living in poverty and 193,000 of those are children.  Some of the contributions from the Government show that trickle-down economics are still in vogue.  That is not how things should be.  I will focus on what is missing from this and why I believe the Government has fallen at the first fence and failed to bring about the transformational long-term change that we need.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a tax on multinational corporations that would raise &euro;720 million in 2021.  We included this proposal in our general election manifesto before the Covid-19 pandemic and in the alternative budget we proposed last month.  Our proposal would change a rule on the taxation of some of the multinationals here.  I am tired of hearing that if we ask these companies to pay tax they will disappear or take flight.  We are not saying anything about the 12.5% corporation tax, but we must have tax fairness.  When Sinn F&eacute;in has argued for this measure in the past, the current Minister for Finance has argued that it would raise more money now but that would balance out in the long run.  He has therefore suggested it is not worth doing.  This is only true if things remain as they are today.  We have no guarantees.  The only way to guarantee this revenue is to begin collecting it now.  Tax justice delayed is tax justice denied.  Even if we had fully accepted the argument of the Minister for Finance, we in Sinn F&eacute;in feel that the longest waiting lists in Europe and the housing crisis were enough to justify accessing the money as soon as possible.  If the money had been accessed our society, particularly our health services, could have been in a better position going into the Covid-19 pandemic.  Now, in the midst of a global pandemic, there has never been a more pressing time to do this.  In this regard, budget 2021 was another missed opportunity.  The Government ignored our proposal yet again, leaving &euro;720 million on the table that could have been used to pay student nurses, invest in hospitals and schools and support people who are out of work.  The Government has again chosen not to avail of this measure, though this time it did not argue that it would only raise money upfront.  I do not think it could wheel this excuse out during a global pandemic.<\/p><p>I do not know why the Government refuses to bring in these very sensible measures.  Instead it is doing its best to retrospectively tax the emergency Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  This is why people feel the Government is absolutely disconnected from them and has no relevance in their lives.  This is not some radical measure.  It is a reform that has been recommended to the Government by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, an advisory body known for its fiscal conservatism.  The Government should explain why it left this money on the table at a time when families are struggling to get by on the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment or by working on the front line for very low wages.<\/p><p>On top of that &euro;720 million, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a wealth tax on fortunes over &euro;1 million, which would have generated more than &euro;89 million.  However, the Government could not equalise the jobseeker's allowance rates for under-25s.  What kind of message does that send to young people throughout the country?  A 3% solidarity tax on incomes over &euro;140,000 and the removal of tax breaks on income over &euro;100,000 would have brought in &euro;388 million.  That would have gone a long way towards covering the cost of a hugely necessary disability payment.  <\/p><p>The tax breaks for banks that have been bailed out were also left in place.  We are not proposing giveaways or attempting to opt out.  This is about challenging the <i>status quo <\/i>and applying fairness to how the State works and who it works for.  The changes we suggested would have been a step towards a fairer society.  Carers have been given a miserable increase of 41 cent per day.  Our care assistants will receive an extra 10 cent an hour.  These are the people we needed to prioritise in this Finance Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400057#KKK00200","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1604516100,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I begin by welcoming the Government's decision to reverse the cuts to the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment and the employment wage subsidy scheme.

Having regard to the continuing grave threat to public health posed by Covid-19, and as provided for in the legislation, I am now bringing forward a proposal that the Act should continue in operation until 9 June 2021.  That date aligns with the timeframe of the Government's medium to long term strategy, Recovery and Resilience 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19 which was published on 15 September and spans a period of six to nine months.  Furthermore, the continued operation of the Act to 9 June next year is necessary in order to ensure that we can apply the enforcement of Covid-19 regulations made under the relevant Department of Health legislation.  In this regard, the House will recall that it recently resolved that the amendments effected by Part 3 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 should continue in operation for the period beginning on 9 November and ending on 9 June 2021.  It is important that the Covid-19 regulations and the powers contained in this Act remain in alignment for the same period.<\/p><p>By way of background, the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 was signed into law by the President on 11 September 2020.  It provides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with statutory enforcement powers to ensure strict adherence to public health measures on premises selling alcohol for consumption on the premises, having regard to the manifest and grave risk to human life and public health posed by the spread of Covid-19.<\/p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to all of society.  Members will be conscious that Covid-19 remains a real threat to all of us, particularly our most vulnerable citizens.  The country has been at level 5 of the resilience and recovery plan since Thursday, 22 October.  This remains a critical time for the country and we all continue to have a special responsibility to comply with the public health guidelines and regulations for the good of everybody.  Under level 5, pubs and restaurants are closed, but I hope they will soon reopen if we are successful in tackling the virus.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that the public health restrictions that have been in place since the outset of the pandemic have not been easy for everyone.  The pandemic has had an impact on all of our lives.  The vast majority of people and businesses have complied with public health restrictions during this difficult period because they understand that so doing is the most effective way to help to keep us all safe.  It is also the best way to help us to return to a situation where there will be fewer restrictions or no restrictions at all.<\/p><p>The vast majority of publicans have been fully compliant with what has been asked of them even though they have put their livelihoods on hold.  However, it would be completely unfair if the few who wish to flout the law and put their customers at risk are allowed to do so without consequences.  The Act gives the Garda the power to enter such premises to encourage the small minority of publicans who are acting contrary to public health regulations to bring themselves into compliance and it provides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the powers to act swiftly to enforce the law where necessary.<\/p><p>I have been advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has taken extensive action in support of the public health restrictions since the beginning of the pandemic.  A graduated response to policing has been adopted from the outset, based on the Garda tradition of policing by consent.  This approach has seen garda&iacute; follow the four Es: engage, educate, encourage and, as a last resort, enforce the relevant provisions.<\/p><p>I wish to once again compliment the garda&iacute; who have done exemplary work on the front line throughout the pandemic.  They have been diligent and thorough in their work.  They have responded with compassion and empathy to difficult situations in which people have found themselves.  Their response has been low key and effective.  As Minister for Justice, I am extremely grateful for their hard work and professionalism during this extraordinary time.  I know Members on all sides of the House will agree with me on that point.<\/p><p>The Garda Commissioner's reports have supported the view that the vast majority of licensed premises have been acting in compliance with the relevant regulations.  That is evidenced by the fact that the number of crime incidents recorded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to licensed premises between 3 July 2020 and 24 October 2020 was 281, but fewer than 100 such incidents have taken place since this law was enacted approximately two months ago.  There were only 11 reported incidents in the week to 24 October 2020.  These figures must be seen in the context of the varying restrictions on licensed premises and, in particular, their effect in counties which were there at that point under levels 3 or 4.  As all licensed premises are currently closed, the need to have such measures in place may not seem obvious.  However, if a publican decides to ignore the current restrictions and open a licensed premises, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the power to immediately take action.  Level 5 is only in place until the start of December and I think all Deputies will accept that Covid-19 will be with us well into 2021.  <\/p><p>In that context, therefore, and in line with the Government's Recovery and Resilience 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19, the emergency measures contained in the Act will continue to be required.  The Garda Commissioner has reported to me that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has not, as yet, issued any closure orders or compliance notices.  Consideration has been given to each of the powers contained in the Act but they have not been required to date.  I am happy that is the case.  When I introduced the legislation in the House, I stated that it would be my preference for the small minority of publicans to come into compliance and that I hoped there would be no closures under the Act.  I was clear that enforcement should be and would remain a last resort.  The entire purpose of the enforcement power legislation is to try to enhance compliance, not to trick people or to catch them out.  Everybody is given an opportunity to co-operate and work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>There is no immediate penalty where a licensed premises is flouting the regulations.  The first thing that happens is that the licensee or manager is given a direction to come into compliance.  The penalties in the Act only kick in if the publican fails to comply with that direction.  Some Deputies may state that the fact that no closure orders have been issued is evidence that the powers are not needed.  The Commissioner is of the view that it is because of these powers that those publicans who wish to flout the law have come into compliance.  Consequently, it has not been necessary to issue any closure orders so far.  The Commissioner noted that the legislation has supported An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through its graduated policing response and he has strongly supported the continuation of these powers into 2021.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the existence of these provisions, I assure Deputies that I fully expect that the graduated policing approach we have seen to date in all aspects of dealing with the pandemic will continue to be pursued by the Garda.  By continuing to provide these additional enforcement powers to the Garda, we will see an improvement in compliance with Covid regulations by publicans, restaurateurs and operators of registered clubs in the interest of public health and in a way that will facilitate the gradual reopening of society.<\/p><p>As I indicated in my opening remarks, the continued operation of the Act is closely related to the new health regulations prepared by the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the recently enacted Health (Amendment) Act 2020.  I will refer briefly to the provisions of that Act.  As provided for in the recent amendments to the Health Act 1947, the Minister for Health may make regulations prescribing provisions for the purposes of enforcement under the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act.  That Minister may also make regulations prescribing penal provisions to be fixed penalty provisions.  Officials from my Department and the Department of Health are currently co-operating to develop statutory instruments to be made by the Minister for Health.  However, I should point out that the purpose of the fixed penalty system is to help to change behaviour.  The objective of the Government here is to prevent the kind of behaviour that endangers others.  A large number of fines being issued for non-compliance is not the desired outcome. <\/p><p>The matter before the House is relatively straightforward.  I am simply proposing the continued but time-limited application of legislation which was scrutinised and passed by this House only recently.  The circumstances leading to the enactment of the legislation have not changed.  The continued application of the Act facilitates a necessary, proportionate, carefully balanced and human rights compliant approach to address the small minority of licensed premises which are showing disregard for public health regulations.  Clear safeguards have been provided throughout the Act, such as, in particular, the requirement for involvement of a Garda member of at least superintendent rank, the time-limited nature of the closures and the provision for possibility of appeal.<\/p> <p>I repeat a point I made earlier.  None of these provisions can be triggered unless a person fails to comply with a Garda direction in the first instance.  Providing for these additional limited powers until next June will enable the Garda to move swiftly to address those cases in which licensed premises and private clubs breach public health regulations.  I again acknowledge and support the hard work and efforts being made by the vast majority of licensed premises to operate within the law.<\/p> <p> I commend the resolution to the House.  I thank Members for their attention.  I look forward to hearing their observations on the matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400058#LLL00400","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604517300,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete the words &lsquo;9th day of June, 2021&rsquo; and to substitute the words &lsquo;9th day of February, 2021&rsquo; therefor. <\/blockquote>  <p>I will be sharing time with Deputy Cullinane.<\/p><p>Our amendment relates to the length of time for which the Minister seeks to extend these powers.  We understand we are in the most unusual and unfortunate circumstances where extreme powers like these are required.  At times that happens, but when extreme powers such as these are in place, they need to be revisited as often as possible to ensure they are fully assessed, and we have full buy-in from the public.  That is one of the big issues in all of this.<\/p><p>The Minister outlined what happens when garda&iacute; enter licensed premises that are selling alcohol.  If there are breaches of the guidelines in respect of that, the Garda can make a legitimate case for that to end and if that is not adhered to, it then has powers to close the premises for 24 hours or whatever, which is fair enough.  Under difficult circumstances we accept that needs to happen.  However, extending them to June of next year makes people ask why it is going that far ahead.  Much of this is about buy-in from the public and trying to get people on board and bring them with us.  We have been trying to do that through all of this.  All parties and groupings in this House have tried to work with the Government to ensure we can keep coronavirus at bay, keep our people safe, keep our businesses open as much as possible and continue with as much of normal life as possible in the safest circumstances possible.  That is what we all want to try to do.<\/p><p>A very profound principle in law is that if a law is introduced that does not have the confidence of the public and the public feel it is difficult to enforce, it removes people's respect not just for that particular law but for all other laws as well.  We always need to guard against that danger.  When we introduce extreme measures like this, we need to ensure we do not undermine people's confidence in what we are trying to do.  We get the maximum buy-in we possibly we can from everyone in society to ensure compliance.  I hate using the word &quot;compliance&quot; because it gives a hierarchal nature to it.  This is about everyone working together for the best possible end goal, to protect all people who are out there doing their best, as the vast majority of people are.<\/p><p>To build that confidence, we need to look forward to the day when level 5 restrictions end and we go back down the scale, hopefully to level 3 or below.  To build confidence and to ensure people understand that is what we want to do, we need to see from Government a clear plan for getting there.  When we leave level 5, how will we ensure we have a strategy in place to avoid going back to that level again?  We need to get our heads around that and work on it.<\/p><p>We tabled this amendment because a timescale going out to June is too far ahead to be able to get people to buy into the strategy without having a sense of where we are going with the plan to ensure we never return to level 5 again.  I hope the Minister recognises that is what we are trying to do and accepts our amendment to revisit the provisions in February, which is in three months.  We can then look a further three months forward if need be.  Hopefully we would not need to do that then.  The more often we can revisit these matters, re-examine them and learn from the experience we have when they are in force, the better.<\/p><p>As I said, we need to have a strategy.  The World Health Organization and the vast majority of medical experts in this country and elsewhere tell us that the key to keeping this virus or any virus at bay is by having a very effective testing system that is fast and efficient, and also a highly efficient tracing system.  That is one of the issues on which we need to try to get people's confidence back.  I have a great fear that many people in our communities are losing confidence in this process.  We need to restore that confidence.<\/p><p>This is a small country, and everyone knows someone who has the virus or somebody who is a neighbour of somebody who has the virus.  They are all sharing the experience of what happened.  They contacted their GP and it took four days before they got notification of the test.  It was two days later before they went for the test and it was another three days before the result of the test.  People hear all these stories which give the impression that the system is broken and not working.  They feel under pressure and that they are being forced or somehow coerced into adhering to all these rules and regulations, while on the other side of it not enough effort is being done by the health services to ensure adequate testing facilities are available and the testing is fast enough.<\/p><p>Contact tracing is the big one that we all hear people telling us about.  The incident that happened about ten days ago where people who tested positive were told to contact their own close contacts was a retrograde step as we try to build and secure that confidence.<\/p><p>Much work remains to be done.  The issue at hand is the need to have a law that will build the confidence of the people.  The Government must do more to do that.  Unfortunately, that has not happened.  While the broad thrust of this Bill may be appropriate at this time, it is certainly not appropriate to extend it for length of time proposed.  It would certainly not be appropriate to keep this measure in place for almost nine months into the future when people do not have confidence in the contact tracing and testing.  That would be a bad thing to do and would undermine the confidence of the public in what we are all trying to work together to achieve. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400059#MMM00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1604517300,"counter":306,"content":"<p>In the early stages of the pandemic, we supported emergency measures that we felt were necessary to ensure there was a level of enforcement of the restrictions that were introduced.  Despite some commentary from the Minister's party leader, and also from the Taoiseach, that the Opposition has not been supportive on occasions, the support that the Government in this State has got from the Opposition compares favourably with other states in Europe and around the world.  There has been widespread support and acceptance that, while none of us want them, restrictions are needed to protect people's health.  There is an acceptance of some level of enforcement.  However, we need fairness in how the Government approaches these matters.<\/p><p>Time and again we have given the power to Government.  On previous occasions we have given the power to the Minister for Health to draft regulations and statutory instruments only for those regulations and statutory instruments to bite him, the Government and us because we do not have sight of the regulations when we pass the primary legislation that gives him the power to do so.  We saw that when he tripped himself up over the requirements to take details of what people ate in restaurants and how badly communicated that was.<\/p><p>When the powers were given to him in a recent Bill to introduce fines for people who moved beyond 5 km for non-essential journeys and also for house parties, we again said we could not sign up blind.  I asked the Minister to ensure we did not get to hear of these regulations and statutory instruments through the media.  I asked that when he is crafting these regulations and before he publishes them on his website and signs off on them he would brief members of the Opposition so that we would get sight of them first.  What happened today?  An article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>outlined details of how much these fines will be, what they will relate to, apparently again arising from a leak from Cabinet regarding an incorporeal meeting of Cabinet that was held to discuss the issue.  That is why we did not support the legislation at the time.  We were again being asked to give powers to the Minister blind to allow him to make the regulations and we would not have any control over them.<\/p>  <p>We tabled an amendment proposing that those regulations would then come back to the D&aacute;il for approval, and other parties put down similar amendments, all of which were refused.  Of course there must be restrictions, enforcement and legislation but the emergency powers are really draconian.  The Minister for Health has accepted that.  We cannot extend them for seven months.  It is too long.  We have tabled an amendment for the extension to end until 9 February rather than 9 June 2021.  As a result, we would come back next year, hopefully in a better position with the numbers down and with a better plan on how we can deal with, manage and live with Covid and would not be obliged to have this yo-yo approach of being in and out of lockdown and restrictions that we have now.

The mere fact that the D&aacute;il is meeting in a conference venue rather than our normal home in Leinster House underscores how extraordinary these times are.<\/p>  <p>  The issues at the heart of the legislation have been debated and passed by the House already.  The only issue at stake in this debate is that of time.  I have listened to the very reasonable case put forward by our Sinn F&eacute;in colleague that an extension until next June is far too long.  I am sympathetic to that view but I am also sympathetic to the view which the Minister put to yesterday's briefing to Members that we need to make all the regulations understandable to the public.  That means they must all be aligned.  Different termination dates for different sets of regulations will utterly confuse the public.  I am minded to accept the argument that this particular set of regulations need to align with the other regulations that were agreed to last, at least in theory, until next June.  None of us envisaged in September that we would be talking about restrictions of this nature going on until June of next year, and hopefully they will not have to.  The Minister might reiterate in her concluding comments that if things improve remarkably, and please God they will, early next year and there is a vaccine and we have suppressed the virus, that all this will lapse as soon as it is prudent to do so and there is no requirement to stick to any arbitrary date but that the measures will be taken off the Statute Book and out of functionality.  <\/p>  <p>  We are all pleased to see today's Covid figures in the sense that the R rate of infection is now below 1 again.  Hopefully that is the sign of a trend that will continue, though we must continue to be vigilant.<\/p>  <p>  There is a certain irony that all the premises that will be directly affected by this set of measures are currently shut.  There will be no impact on them unless someone is running a shebeen completely unlawfully and need to be acted against.  During this debate we must mention the plight of the publicans who are really on their knees, and beyond that.  We must be mindful of that when we enact these sorts of measures.  We must not only reach out to them but make it crystal clear that we understand their position and are willing to provide State supports for them to survive this unprecedented time.  I hope the Minister will mention that in her final comments.<\/p>  <p>  I will conclude on yesterday's briefing and the views of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We were told by the Minister's officials that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is happy with these provisions and supports their extension.  There was some doubt over whether there was general support for the extension of difficult measures but I think there is support for these measures.  The running of licensed premises is something for which we need more than the carrot of exhortation.  Obviously the prime purpose is to change behaviour and it is interesting to not that no place has been closed on foot of these measures.  Part of the confidence we are giving to the Minister might be reciprocated by giving us very regular updates on the operation of all these measures, rather than waiting until we put down parliamentary questions, in order that we know their impact.  I ask her to give Members the firm assurance that these powers will be removed from the Statute Book as soon as they are no longer necessary.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400060#NNN00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1604517900,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I wish to consider three different groups of constituents who have contacted me and on whom this legislation touches.

When they see people gathering in pubs and smoking in contravention of the rules, they get annoyed and angry.  They want the Garda to be able to do something.  If this legislation enables the Garda to act on that and support the protection of public health that people want, then this is positive.<\/p>  <p>  I also have been contacted by publicans and restaurant owners who went to great efforts to fit out their premises to meet public health standards, who put in outdoor seating, provided PPE to staff, reduced the number of tables and the number of covers they served and therefore the amount of money they can take in through the door, while facing the same costs.  They did this so that they could run their business responsibly during the public health emergency.  When they see a pub or licensed premises down the road which is not doing that but is carrying on in flagrant disregard, it gets to them for several reasons.  If a law is not enforced, that reduces the respect for others.  Owners of licensed premises ask why they should put money, time and effort into protecting health if others do not.  Legislation like this allows them to do what they need to do protect public health in the confidence that they will not be undercut by unfair competition based on someone down the road ignoring the rules.  Then there are the people who work in these premises and who want to be able to go to work in safety.  They want to work in a place where its operators have put in the time to consider public health and put in the measures that are necessary to keep customers and staff safe.  If we adhere to the public health guidelines and the measures required, we can keep staff safe and ensure that there are jobs.  If we do not do that and if we allow a free-for-all by not giving the Garda the power of enforcement needed, then we are not protecting the position of those staff or their health and safety in order that they can come to work with some confidence.  I note the Garda has been obliged to use such powers very infrequently but where it has done so, it has been with great calm.<\/p> <p>If we can address the needs of those three separate groups, we will be doing well with this legislation and this motion.<\/p> <p> The Garda has played a very important part in how we have managed the pandemic, from the very beginning through to now and the restrictions that currently apply.  Unfortunately, gard&aacute;i have often come in for very serious abuse.  There has been an increase in the number of people concerned about the restrictions and some of the stuff that is happening around us.  They are scared, as many of us are, and they are being exploited and taken advantage of by elements who want to push a far-right ideology and use the pandemic to undermine the State.  I am not saying that everybody who has concerns about the restrictions, the lockdown or the pandemic is coming from that place.  However, as Commissioner Harris noted, there certainly are some people coming from that place and exploiting people's concerns.  We must acknowledge the work the Garda has done, including in implementing a graduated response which fits very well with the provisions we are discussing.  I echo Deputy Howlin's comment that these powers should only be on the Statute Book for as long as they are necessary.  As he acknowledged, the unfortunate thing is that they are still necessary at this time.<\/p> <p> For all the reasons I have outlined, I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400060#NNN00300","speaker":"1570","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604518500,"counter":311,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Daly but I see that he is not in the Chamber.

He spoke about how he would prefer there to be a greater understanding of the requirements and that a well-informed and knowledgeable public is more motivated to buy into such measures.  Senior representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have spoken in similar terms about how achieving that type of buy-in is the preferable goal in this pandemic.  An issue we discussed at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response with witnesses from the Law Society and Dr. David Kenny was that the difference between what is health advice and what is the law has not always been clear.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is running the risk of that type of confusion continuing.  In the absence of the pre-legislative scrutiny that generally applies, there has been very little time to discuss all the detailed regulations that have been introduced and all the nuances of the issues.  That is not in any way desirable because we want people to be honest with contact tracers and doctors and, if they have symptoms, to declare themselves.  Criminalising behaviour which is, of course, unacceptable from a public health perspectives gives rise to the risk, as Dr. Holohan said, of driving people who may need testing underground.  This is something that must be avoided, and that objective is the basis of our proposal for a shorter time period for these regulations.  Appropriate powers and resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to be important but the public must have confidence that the Government is striking the right balance.  These are extraordinary powers for extraordinary times.  Without the usual pre-legislative scrutiny, they must be kept under regular review.<\/p>  <p>  While we support the continuation of the measures set out in this legislation, we must provide hope that their end is anticipated.  Extending the legislation to next summer sends the wrong message at a time when many people are wilting under the pressure of the regulations.  People in their 60s are coming to me saying they cannot go for a walk on Banna Beach.  Independent retailers whose businesses have been in their family for years cannot open, despite the lack of evidence that Covid-19 is transmitted in such premises.  The people of Valentia Harbour, who are supposed to be putting in any objections they might have to aquaculture licences, cannot travel outside their 5 km zone to view the proposals, which are located in Portmagee and Cahersiveen Garda stations.  People's patience is running out and extending the provisions to next summer sends the wrong message.  I support the amendment put forward by Deputy Martin Kenny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400061#OOO00900","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1604518500,"counter":319,"content":"<p>This not the kind of legislation that any of us wants to be debating or supporting.  My colleagues and I will support the proposal for a reduced timeframe, as provided for in the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  There is no doubt that some measures are required to be available to the Garda to deal with non-compliance.  However, as colleagues have pointed out, the pubs are closed at the moment, as are the hotels.  If Twitter can be believed, the Taoiseach has told the Fianna F&aacute;il Party tonight that there will be no early end to the lockdown and it will last the full six weeks.  That will come as a huge disappointment to people because there is the hope that there would be an honest review of the current restrictions after four weeks if the numbers allow for some relaxation.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that we are seeing some very positive signs in terms of the R-nought number moving below one.  That is happening not because of the punitive measures that are being taken but because the public has bought into getting the virus under control.  It has not been achieved by a high degree of enforcement.  When I speak to people who are critical of the restrictions, the point they often make is that some of the things that are being done are a bit counterproductive, such as the road checks and reductions in traffic lanes on major arteries at peak times when people are going to and coming from work.  Nobody is being stopped and all that is happening is that traffic jams are being created.  People are quite cross about that.  They are saying that they only want to go to or get home from work and they really do not see the benefit of the road blocks and other measures.  It is really important that the Government does not lose the public by imposing measures that are not seen to really address the issues.  In the case of targeting non-compliance such as that of pubs which are flouting the law, I certainly can see the sense in doing that and the need to do it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about how the operation of the provisions of this Act dovetail with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) Act 2020 by way of statutory instrument and so on.  I have noticed that people are breaking the restrictions only when they have really genuine reasons to move around.  For example, several people have contacted me who have a family member with autism for whom a regime is required to be in place that might involve going a little further than 5 km.  There are people with genuine caring needs who need to break the rules.  No matter how one reassures them, if they do not have that piece of paper in their pocket, they are very reluctant to move out of their 5 km area.<\/p> <p>The people who are the most compliant are likely to be those most fearful of the statutory instrument the Government has proposed and the regulations introduced a couple of weeks ago on foot of that legislation.  They will probably be those most affected by virtue of the fact that they are so compliant.  The Policing Authority's report on commercial businesses indicated that when inconsistencies in the approach of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na arose, it was primarily due to the detail of the regulations and how they were initially communicated by the latter.  I am certainly not being critical of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in making that point.  I am aware that Garda sergeants and inspectors had pointed out that they were very concerned about what was being asked of them.  They may not have been referring to the particular component with which we were dealing but a range of other measures, particularly those in place prior to the Health (Amendment) Bill 2020 and the associated regulations.  Having read those regulations, I must say that they were so prescriptive that I could see how people who should not have been greatly impacted by them would have been.<\/p> <p> The earlier date is a signal that this House is maintaining oversight of these draconian measures.  It is important that these measures do not remain on the Statute Book a minute longer than is necessary.  It is better to evaluate whether they are still needed in February rather than waiting until June to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400061#OOO01000","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604519100,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak on and support this Bill, which extends the sunset clause in respect of enforcement powers.  It is important that these powers exist and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, other law enforcement authorities and the emergency services have the options they may require.<\/p>  <p>  The concept of a sunset clause struck me in the early days of the pandemic when the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 came before the Houses.  We were in those early days of trepidation, fear, uncertainty and doubt as to what we were about to face.  We did not expect it to still be with us at this point, six, seven or eight months on.  It struck me that this concept was missing from the first draft of that Bill in March.  I contacted my party leader, now Taoiseach, to raise the matter that night.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties was discussing it the next day.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, a number of other Deputies and I tabled amendments to introduce such a clause.<\/p>  <p>  The relevant provision was introduced, which was very important because all citizens in this society enjoy certain rights under the Constitution.  Those rights include freedom of movement, freedom of association and other rights that allow us freedom and liberty in normal circumstances.  All rights are proportionate, however.  No right is absolute.  The greater good must always be weighed against individual rights.  The greater good of public health, which includes the right to life, health, well-being and a functioning society which is not overrun by a pandemic, can at times legitimately encroach on those other individual rights.  It is a balancing act the Government has to manage in legislation while respecting the Constitution.  I believe it has done so but it is important that a sunset clause was, correctly, introduced in the legislation to recognise that while these measures are quite severe and draconian and involve restrictions on some individual liberties, they are there for a reason and that they will be revisited rather than becoming the norm by default, which would be wrong.  As I have said, that was introduced at the time and carried over.<\/p>  <p>  We probably thought the pandemic might be gone, defeated or have dissipated by this stage.  We may have thought that we would have acquired herd immunity or that a vaccine would have been available.  There might have been a certain naivety, hope or expectation in those early days in spring.  Many people thought this would have been behind us by the summer.  Unfortunately, that was not to be the case and the pandemic is still ongoing.  Again, it makes sense that the provisions enacted to manage or mitigate it and the powers given to law enforcement authorities, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in particular, be continued, maintained and carried over.  We are now talking about extending these powers again and that makes sense.  June 2021 seems a reasonable time to revisit it.  It is six months from now.  I have just listened to the end of Deputy Catherine Murphy's contribution.  She always makes solid contributions and I listened with interest to her closing words.  I believe she mentioned February.  I am concerned that we would again be having this debate in February and, perhaps, in March, in April and so on.  Let us give it time to bed down.  Let us give it the seven months and let the provisions run into June 2021.  That seems to be a reasonable time to take stock.<\/p>  <p>  I have a couple of other points to make about this issue as a whole.  We have been through the mill across the country and we are now at level 5.  Kildare went through its own hard lockdown in August at a time when the rest of the country was beginning to enjoy more freedom of movement.  In fact, many people were taking staycations in August at the time when Kildare went back into lockdown.  Along with Laois and Offaly, Kildare was among the first counties to experience that second wave.  Of course, it has since multiplied and the whole country is now at level 5.  We learned a great deal from that, however.  Paradoxically, one of the things we learned is that we need both the carrot and stick.  If we are to enforce more stringent rules and ask people to stay at home, stay within their counties or stay within 5 km of home, the iron fist in the velvet glove is sometimes needed.  Asking people nicely to do things does not always work.  I found myself in many debates on local radio and in other media explaining that garda&iacute; did not have powers of enforcement during the Kildare lockdown.  I was explaining the tradition of policing by consent in this country.  Part of the reason we have a largely unarmed police force is that it is the force of the people rather than the force of the establishment that matters.  That is our tradition of policing on this island.<\/p>  <p>  That did not necessarily work in all situations however.  Unfortunately, a small minority of people threw two fingers up to the rest and say that, because they could, they would.  They did not respect the garda&iacute; on the ground, their fellow citizens or their neighbours and friends.  A small few breached the rules and it was those who did that tended to make a song and dance about it.  They almost revelled in the fact that they could.  People threw statutory instruments at me on social media as if to say they could do what we liked because no enforcement powers were in place.  Unfortunately, there are always a few who ruin things for the rest.  Having said that, the vast majority of people across the country, and certainly in Kildare, have been absolutely outstanding in their commitment to beating this pandemic and to voluntarily observing the measures required to do so.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to give people information.  The most important thing in any controversy or crisis is that people are informed.  People are intelligent and tuned in.  They have a strong conscience and will do the right thing once they understand what that entails.  That is why it is so important that we run public information campaigns, as we are doing, so that people can understand how the virus is transmitted.  It is now very well understood.  When there is a second or third wave or when different events occur, it is important that people understand.  They need to know whether it is spreading by community transmission and where the virus is transmitted.  They need to know how it works and they can then make their own informed choices.  On the one hand, we tell them what they should do, what the Government wants them to do while and, at times, what the law requires them to do but, on the other, we tell them why and explain the logic behind it.  We tell them why they will be safer if they do certain things and why it is not safe to have a party at a neighbour's house and why it is not okay to gather in large groups without social distancing.  We tell them that, because of how the virus is transmitted, certain measures should be taken.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to pubs and the measures we are talking about here, these measures are obviously not mandatory.  Even when we get out of level 5 and begin to edge towards normality in the early new year or even over Christmas, there will be no requirement for the powers to be used immediately or for a crackdown.  The powers are there to deal with the exceptional cases of people who will not comply or adhere to the rules voluntarily and who unfortunately need that extra sanction to be brought to bear.  During the Kildare lockdown, I worked night and day with multiple businesses to try to get them support packages, to get them over the line and to keep them viable and afloat.  The small number of businesses who tried to go against the tide, to trade in the face of the restrictions and to get one over on their neighbouring competing businesses by disobeying the rules again really threw up two fingers.  It is not a good attitude.  That is a reminder for everybody that these sanctions are important.<\/p> <p>They are proportionate and come as part of a wider balancing exercise.  It is eminently sensible that there be a realistic end date.  I support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400062#PPP00200","speaker":"1583","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604519700,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Public health and adherence to guidelines are paramount in tackling the current public health crisis.  Transparency, common sense, public confidence and clear messaging are the measures needed to bring the public along with the Government with these restrictions, but the Government has been found wanting in all these areas.  We supported the legislation at the time but the way the Government has acted since means there is much to be answered.<\/p><p>There has been no transparency or rationale given as to why people had to spend &euro;9 on a substantial meal while having a drink.  Where did the &euro;9 figure come from and what should constitute a substantial meal?  How was the substantial meal going to protect people against Covid-19?  There was also no transparency or rationale given on how the limit of 105 minutes was arrived at.  The idea that a pub must record all food ordered by each customer and store the information for 28 days was a case of bureaucracy gone mad.<\/p><p>I have seen at first hand the genuine efforts the pubs in Clondalkin, Lucan, Rathcoole, Palmerstown and Saggart made to open their premises safely and in line with public health guidelines, despite mixed messages and a lack of transparency from the Government.  My heart went out not only to the licensees but also to the staff who are now back unemployed through no fault of their own.<\/p><p>We in Sinn F&eacute;in are not privy to the briefings that the Government receives from the National Public Health Emergency Team.  As a public representative I have been asked numerous questions seeking clarity and the rationale behind these decisions.  For examples, local barbers and hairdressers jumped through more hoops and red tape in order to reopen safely but they now find themselves closed again.  One barber told me that if the Government said the barbers were a cause of Covid-19 outbreaks, he would happily close his doors.  However, he has been given no explanation whatever for closing and there is no transparency in the process.<\/p><p>Gym customers have contacted me with concerns that they have about physical and mental health.  Even the option for them to work out in a sterile, safe and socially distanced manner was ripped away from them, again with no transparency or rationale given.<\/p><p>I asked the Minister for the evidence used in the decision to close gyms under level 5 restrictions but I was left with more questions than answers.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t...the set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe.  Instead they are baskets of measures informed by public health understanding of the disease. <\/blockquote>  <p>What are &quot;baskets&quot; and what measures have been used to inform how they will be filled?<\/p><p>We had a blanket approach the first time we had restrictions, and this was widely accepted as we never went through a pandemic before.

It is unwelcome for everybody to have to impose measures of this kind but of course the circumstances behind them are most unwelcome as well.  We must deal with the public health measures and the enforcement of those public health measures in the interests of the protection of the health and well-being of everybody in our society.  There is no Government or Member in this House that wants to introduce measures of this kind.<\/p>  <p>  We have been through a detailed debate from the health, criminal justice and enforcement perspective about the need for these measures.  We have discussed proportionality and the time-limited nature of it with the Minister, as well as the necessity for the Garda to have in its arsenal the capacity to enforce the regulations on foot of legislation passed by the House.<\/p>  <p>  Without the capacity to enforce these regulations, we would undermine entirely the measures put forward by this House and the confidence of people that we are capable of delivering the sort of public health measures we need.  We all had correspondence during the summer outlining the genuine frustrations felt by people who have been compliant, as other Deputies have mentioned, and who have found others not to be compliant.  They expressed real frustration, hurt and anger arising from this, and they have asked us to introduce appropriate measures so enforcement measures could be improved.  We know there is a particular link to alcohol and house parties, and we all acknowledge the impact on the licensed trade.  We have tried to include supports for it.  It is important that if we introduce legislation and regulations, we should have measures of enforcement with them.<\/p>  <p>  It is concerning to hear Deputies from Sinn F&eacute;in introduce yet another element of confusion into this, implying that the provision of time-limited regulations linked to a published Government plan that is also time limited is confusing.  Deputy Martin Kenny said this evening that in order to have buy-in from the public, there should be a measure of certainty with this and that people would not comply any more if they did not know what is going on.  Surely coming back to this in a number of months would only give rise to this additional confusion.  The Government has a plan and should be able to enforce it.  Not doing so would generate its own confusion.  It is surely entirely logical to have a plan, a means of enforcing the plan and for those elements to be linked in time at a minimum.<\/p>  <p>  I do not understand the perspective being brought by Sinn F&eacute;in tonight.  I cannot help but wonder if it is only about having the opportunity to say the Government is creating confusion when the Government has published a plan and tried to stick by it or adapt the plan where necessary.  The Government is trying to provide a measure of enforcement appropriate to the different levels to ensure compliance with the plan in everybody's best interests.  It is trying to do this by linking the elements explicitly in time.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Cullinane expressed concern about a \"yo-yo\" effect of coming in and out of levels rather than having a long-term plan.  This also seems to introduce a measure of confusion and uncertainty in speaking about the Government's approach but I make the same point to him as I did to Deputy Martin Kenny.  Again, a plan without an enforcement schedule only generates confusion rather than fixing it.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Pa Daly spoke about the criminalising of behaviour but that is not the point of what we are doing.  He spoke about people who cannot go for a walk on the beach.  He is right in the sense that we want people to be able to go for a walk on the beach.  However, we need them to stay within the 5 km zone and if they are further away from the beach, we need them to stay at home in the best interests of everybody.  That a person cannot go to the beach is a matter for regulations rather than the measure of enforcement of those regulations.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy makes the point about retail outlets closing and again we have tried to provide supports for the industries most affected by this desperate pandemic.  The closure of retail outlets is relevant to the levels rather than enforcement.  Accidentally confusing these elements, if that is what is being done, can only add to the confusion rather than solve it.  The idea that coming back to have this conversation in February will give clarity instead of confusion is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Howlin and others have said, these are extraordinary measures.  The Minister is clear on that.  We do not want to have to do this but Deputies realise these measures are proportionate, necessary and limited.  There is also the possibility of review between now and the period at which they are meant to expire.  It is possible, for example, that the Minister could provide an update to the justice committee on these on a regular basis, whether it is monthly or when we move through different levels.  The need for enforcement, for example, is different at the different levels.<\/p>  <p>  Rather than Deputies having to table parliamentary questions, the Minister could provide a written update every month or have the members of the justice committee ask additional questions.  The Minister has said very clearly that she wants to be open about this and to provide information.  The Garda has done this already with respect to the enforcement operations and the numbers have been very clear and quick.  This is probably an appropriate and welcome measure because Deputies are uncomfortable with these regulations and for good reason.  Nobody wants to have to do this but there are ways in which we can reasonably supervise the process.<\/p> <p>To suggest that it is more rather than less confusing to change the time limit and have it be different from the measure in the plan, and the Government's plan to get to next summer, is distracting and difficult.

These provisions are due to expire on 9 November 2020 and the motion before the House is to extend them until 9 June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I put on record my support for any measures necessary to ensure public health and safety is maintained.

It should be noted that the majority of licensed premises have complied with the regulations and we thank them for the sacrifice they are making.  I note also the report from the Policing Authority last month showing that the use of enforcement powers by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a last resort continues to be modest.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation will make it an offence to organise an event in a private home that is in breach of public health regulations.  I have a problem with this measure in that we do not have a clear definition of \"event\".  I am also concerned that people will not fully understand this part of the regulations, which could unfortunately result in people committing an offence because they were unaware it was an offence.<\/p>  <p>  Operation Fanacht is a high-profile Garda operation.  The Garda Commissioner has stated that approximately 2,500 garda&iacute; will be involved in this operation and their functions will include community policing, local area policing and roads policing.  Part of the reason for this operation is to ensure members of the public do not travel more than 5 km from their homes except for essential purposes.  Garda&iacute; are operating highly visible checkpoints on all major routes.  In recent weeks, there have been some 130 large-scale checkpoints every day, along with thousands of mobile checkpoints on secondary routes in towns and villages.  It is generally agreed that the public, in the main, have fully complied with all health guidelines issued.  That is why I believe the highly visible presence of garda&iacute; on our main routes was a mistake.  The majority of people have complied with the regulations, yet these checkpoints were placed on main routes.  Specifically, the checkpoint on the M1 resulted in unnecessary stress and pressure on people travelling to and from work.  Only those deemed to be doing essential work were supposed to be travelling to work, yet these people were faced with nightmare delays on their journeys.  I understand there were only two instances where individuals were suspected of breaching travel restriction regulations, whereas the checkpoints impacted on thousands of workers.  They were not necessary.  I ask the Garda Commissioner to reconsider this approach to ensure the many thousands of workers travelling to work daily are no longer severely hampered by delays of more than two hours in some cases.<\/p>  <p>  I also raise the issue of priests and the likelihood of them facing criminal charges should they celebrate mass in public settings.  This issue has been raised before but I do not believe we have received any clear guidelines.  From speaking with clergy, I know they are deeply unhappy with the current situation.  Some have told me they believe the Government has a totalitarian approach to the current situation.  They feel that freedom is slowly being stripped away.  One priest expressed the view that priests can now be jailed for celebrating mass in public for the first time since the penal laws in force during British rule were repealed in 1829.  He said the Government is orchestrating an attack on priests and the church.  As Deputies will appreciate, it took a lot for the priest to say that to me.  The bottom line is that the church and priests believe we are all being denied our constitutional right to practise our faith in public.  In making that point, the priest stated that when Ireland moved to level 3 restrictions several weeks ago we were the only country in Europe where public worship was prohibited.  No other country in Europe adopted the extreme measure of denying people the right to attend public mass or preventing a priest from celebrating a mass in public.  Only Wales has followed us in closing its churches and it only adopted that approach for two weeks as part of its firebreak approach.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the churches went far beyond what was required to ensure worshippers were safe.  As proof of this point, I understand that not one case of Covid-19 has occurred as a result of someone attending mass.  All churches are closed, yet it is clear that churches were one of the safest places to be, outside of the family home, in respect of Covid-19.  Priests have made the point that while churches were closed, it was still possible for people to go to beauty salons, hairdressers and mingle with hundreds of other people in large supermarkets.  People are now faced with another five weeks of being unable to attend public mass and being denied the sacraments.<\/p>  <p>  After this five-week period, we will either remain on level 5 or move to level 3 or 4.  People could still be denied the right to attend public mass.  To put this another way, why are God and the celebration of mass not considered essential services, yet off-licences can remain open?  The 50 or 100 people mingling in a supermarket cannot worship in their local church while maintaining social distancing measures.  The arguments made to me by priests are strong.  They believe Ireland is turning into the most anti-Christian country in Europe and it is hard to argue with that.  They make the point that we must not allow the current situation to change our relationship with the church and God.  It is also hard to argue against that.  Many people, particularly among the older generation, have a strong relationship with the church and are finding it difficult to cope.  I would appreciate Deputies' support for examining this matter.  If we are able to keep the schools open, we must be able to keep our churches open for public worship.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that I support any measures necessary to maintain public health guidelines, but they must be evidence-based.  I do not agree with the disruption caused to workers going to essential work each day, particularly the disruptive checkpoints on motorways.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister give an assurance that no priest will be prosecuted for celebrating mass in public?  I ask her for a clear answer and to state in no uncertain terms that no priest will be prosecuted for a public celebration of mass.  Will she give me a commitment to examine whether churches will be permitted to hold public masses during the current lockdown?  The Minister is present and many priests are listening.  Can she please give clarity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400064#RRR00300","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1604520300,"counter":329,"content":"<p>It is unfortunate we are where we are.  This is a serious issue and it has been thrust upon us.  We did not bring it upon ourselves and nor did all other countries across the globe.  The virus is here, however, and it is raging.  It has been clearly demonstrated that meetings of people, however large or small, contribute to it spreading.  I do not mean people do so deliberately, but it just happens as a result of people meeting.  Before the level 5 restrictions were introduced, it was obvious to some of us that serious breaches of the regulations were taking place.  If the regulations had been strictly observed, it would have been possible to continue trying to defeat the virus and slow it down without any of the regulations we are discussing or any of the level 5 restrictions.  Those will come up again for discussion when the impact of the level 5 restrictions is reviewed and we decide how to proceed from there.<\/p>  <p>  It makes no sense to pretend at this stage that the virus will go away overnight or a vaccine will be found and it will quickly disappear thereafter.  That is not going to happen.  For as long as the virus is here and rampant, it will spread.  Every occasion, therefore, where people come together in small or large numbers will allow that spread to take place.  That is why many people throughout the country have made huge sacrifices, such as avoiding family members and not meeting others in case they spread or contract the virus.<\/p> <p>In deference to those people who made those sacrifices, it behoves the rest of us to do what we can to also restrict, and to do so voluntarily and without the necessity of enforcement.  That is the way it is.  In the past three, six or seven weeks, it was obvious that there were many occasions when people refused to accept even the necessity of added restrictions.  Some people do not believe there is a serious issue at all, which is sad because it is a serious issue.  There are also people who have a notion of a conspiracy.  There are civil libertarians who say, \"No, we have a right to go where we wish and to meet with whoever we wish.\"  That is fine but there is no sense at the same time of spending large amounts of taxpayers' money on trying to restrict the forward march of this virus.<\/p> <p> It is unfortunate that we have to have enforcement but it is a result of necessity.  I hope it will only be for the shortest time possible, hence the need for a sunset clause.  I am one of those people who would not accept the nature of the restrictions we are discussing being enforced were it not for that necessity.  All of us have a public health obligation to respond in time to the challenges that have presented themselves as a result of this virus.<\/p> <p> It is unfortunate that we have to have restrictive measures of the nature proposed, but we have to have them.  Hopefully, it will be for the shortest possible time and, more importantly, we hope that they are effective.  If they are effective and we slow the rate of growth of the virus, and if we make it possible to come out of the restrictions before Christmas, we then have to look at the next level and what we must do from there on in.  I believe that is the stage when the responsibility falls on every single citizen in Ireland to observe the restrictions in every way possible through social distancing, hand hygiene, avoiding crowds and congregations and so on.  It is difficult and it is an imposition on us all.  The alternative, however, is that we go back to more restrictions and try to defeat the virus that way.  The voluntary route is far and away the best route, without compulsion.  All it requires is the recognition of the seriousness of the threat of the virus.  I believe that the sunset clause should reassure everyone who might have a concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400064#RRR00400","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604520900,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak on this motion on the extension of the sunset clause and enforcement powers.  I believe the proposed extension is far too long.  It will go for seven months right up to next June.  At the very outset we all supported all the emergency powers.  The Taoiseach was wrong to suggest that Deputy Michael Healy-Rae did not support any of the measures.  Everyone in the House did and we did our best.<\/p>  <p>  There has been no pre-legislative scrutiny at any time.  I am aware there was a briefing yesterday but there has been no proper debate or discourse.  Earlier Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill said that we could ask questions on this at the justice committee but we have had no debates or discussions, only emergency powers.  I believe that it is disproportionate in the extreme and that most of the restrictions are not logical.  They have just been banged together.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland was supposed to have been blamed for drawing them up, especially the one through which we could be safe from the virus if we had a &euro;9 meal, and crazy situations like that.  Publicans and many other businesses such as hairdressers, beauty saloons and small shops all put up the Perspex screens and supplied hand sanitisers.  They did everything and after all the expense they went to, they have been closed again.  It is so unfair.  Now we want to extend these powers for the next seven months, which I will oppose.  I will support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to have the powers reviewed again in February, which they should be.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to public confidence, the Garda cannot govern without the support of the people and, thankfully, they have that.  I thank the Garda, especially the garda&iacute; in Tipperary and the community garda&iacute;, including Chief Superintendent Derek Smart, Superintendent Denis Whelan in Cahir, Superintendent William Leahy in Clonmel, the community garda&iacute; in Cahir, Sergeant Ray Moloney, and all their colleagues.  The community garda&iacute; visit the elderly and It is wonderful that the garda&iacute; do this.<\/p>  <p>  The elderly are locked away and cocooned and it is totally unfair.  It beats Banagher altogether that they cannot worship in a church.  A wedding can take place with 25 people or a funeral with 25 people, which is so sad, and yet the church cannot open for mass.  If a pastor, a priest or a minister of any religion says a public mass, he can be fined &euro;2,500 or even face jail.  This is shocking.  I believe it was 1826 when those Acts were repealed for the Penal Laws.  Now we have them back again.  Are we trying to frighten the people?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has been asked about the marts and perhaps she will answer a question on that.  It is a very important time for farmers and she has been pleaded with to allow the marts to go ahead.  They are normally big, airy places and they too have made huge strides with protections.  They simply cannot do their business online.  The Minister has been asked about gyms as well.  I have had hoteliers on to me.  I have had people crying that they cannot go to the gym at this time of year.  Coursing has also been stopped.  We had clarity today from the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, about game shooting being stopped, which was announced suddenly last Thursday evening.  The Minister of State informed us today at a committee meeting that it was not through any ministerial order or any order for that matter, and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had brought in this law last Thursday whereby people should not go out with their dog and their gun.  What is the Minister trying to do to people?  People want to support her but she is not supporting them and she is not allowing them even a modicum of solace whereby they can go out with the dog and the gun, yet they can go for a walk with the dog for 5 km.  Thankfully, they are not going to shoot anybody and they are good respectful people in good game clubs that have preserves.  I salute my own game club, the Ardfinnan-Ballybacon-Grange and Newcastle Gun Club, which does huge work on preservation.  The members raise their pheasants and look after them well through restocking and so on.  This is their only recreation and it is the only season open.  There are many areas like this.<\/p>  <p>  There are so many anomalies, discrepancies and inconsistencies in the rules and people are confused.  These are draconian powers by any manner.  The Minister is losing the people, if they are not lost already.  Today I became aware of a situation where a gentleman who is living here had to go to a parent's funeral abroad.  The aeroplane was full of Irish tourists going to Turkey.  The Government has never addressed the airports and has refused to look at the people coming and going through them.  It is unbelievable that this is happening when other people cannot go for a walk or to mass or any church service and cannot go to a funeral.  People cannot even get their hair or nails done.  Barbers, shopkeepers and clothes shops went to huge expense to get their premises open.  I spoke to a wonderful draper recently, Mr. Val O'Gorman, who has three Mr. Mister men's clothes shops that give great employment.  He cannot even sell his summer stock.  What are they supposed to do?  The Government has ruled many business people out from receiving a payment if they are not rate payers.  Everyone over the age of 66 is also ruled out from any type of a payment.  There are inherent inconsistencies and unfairness with this.  The Rural Independent Group and I will oppose it totally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400065#SSS00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1604520900,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being here and for her approach in all of this.  I will start on a positive note because I certainly do not agree with what she said.  She has, however, taken the matter seriously and she has been in the Chamber on every occasion.  It is important to acknowledge that.  She has also given us a written speech on each occasion and I thank her for that.<\/p>  <p>  I will not support the motion.  I see absolutely no reason for it.  I am worried by some comments.  When the Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, was not in the Chair and making his contribution, I did not agree with his comments.  There is a blame game going on  The Minister gave a speech of a few pages.  It is extraordinary that the Policing Authority was not been mentioned once, nor was there any reference to a written comment from the Garda Commissioner.  Although he has been dragged into this to say that he agrees with these measures, I have seen no reference to a press release where he does.  This takes me by surprise because I have read all of the Policing Authority reports, which have consistently said that additional powers are not necessary.  It appears that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has said the exact same thing. <\/p> <p>The only public comment I heard the Commissioner make was that he was a good public servant and would do as he was told, which is not a resounding endorsement of the measures the Government was bringing in.<\/p> <p> The first sunset clause was inserted as a result of a debate in this Chamber, because we were extremely concerned.  We also wanted a full debate on it and we are getting some measure of a debate now.  This is an extraordinary extension of draconian powers.  I am on record as saying that from the beginning but I acted against my conscience at the time because the virus was such a threat.  I knew they were draconian powers but I gave them careful consideration and went along with them on the basis that there would be full and frank disclosures in the seat of democracy.  That has not happened and blame is now going around.<\/p> <p> When Covid struck Ireland, we were all in receipt of a letter from one of the unions informing us about the vulnerable state of the health system, to put it mildly, and the primary care system.  Covid came on top of that and decisions were made to make the public health system ready for the virus.  It was not fit as a public health system.  Without doubt, we ignored the vulnerable sections of our society, including direct provision, meat factories and nursing homes.  From an early stage, I was extremely concerned about nursing homes but there was a consensus mentality among the vast majority of people, and among the media as well, that we were to don the green jersey, or the wine-coloured jersey in Galway, and say everything was okay when we were worried that vulnerable groups were not being protected.  Then we told the over-65s to stay at home and cocoon and so on.<\/p> <p> Now a blaming exercise is going on but the Policing Authority has complimented the vast majority of the public in seven of its reports.  Nothing could have happened without their compliance.  The Government is now extending draconian legislation with no basis and is using words such as \"proportionate\", \"necessary\" and \"limited\", which is turning language on its head because the Garda has not used these powers since the Government brought them in.  It has placed the Garda in an impossible position with its regulation of meals.  Garda&iacute; are being spared at the moment because the pubs are closed but can the Minister imagine putting them in the position of going in to a pub to see whether a substantial meal was being served?  Daft decisions were made such as keeping wet pubs closed while opening others and sending in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to check if they were serving substantial meals.  All of this was nuts.<\/p> <p> This legislation also goes against all the research showing that we bring people on board through education and showing leadership.  No leadership was shown by our leaders in Clifden during \"golfgate\".  No leadership was shown by many others in other situations and instead we turn on people on the ground and bring in draconian legislation.  This is no way to proceed with a public health campaign.  First, we need honesty.  Second, we need maximum information.  Third, we need leadership and not of the type we got during \"golfgate\" in Clifden, with apologies being drawn out of people.<\/p> <p> The Government has to stop the nonsense about wet and dry pubs.  It has to stop turning language on its head.  This legislation has the most serious implications for our democracy and the Government is extending it to next June based on absolutely nothing, which beggars belief.  I would have thought, at the very least, that we would get a written report from the Commissioner on the necessity for these powers and the long extension, or a report from the Policing Authority outlining its views on it.  I will finish in a moment because I always give out about people going over time.  The Policing Authority has repeatedly asked the Garda for a complete breakdown of its existing powers in order that it can analyse them and decide if they are being used appropriately, effectively and proportionately. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400065#SSS00300","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604521500,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I thank all Deputies for their contributions.  I will touch on a number of the points that have been raised.  I cannot accept the proposed amendment and will outline why.  Some Deputies have referred to this issue.  As much as I would like to say that we will be in a different place in three months and will not need this legislation, if we are all honest with ourselves, that is not where we are going to be.  We are doing this in the interest of not having to come back here every few months and have the same debate when nothing has materially changed.  We have to give people certainty.  As we have heard clearly, the amendment to Part 3 of the Health Act 1947, which was passed last week, extended those particular regulations to 9 June.  The Government's medium-term strategy, which is a six to nine-month strategy, was launched in September of this year and that will potentially go to June as well.  In August and September of this year, the first plan was coming to an end while we were working on the next one and different rules and regulations were introduced at different times, which caused some confusion.  With these measures, we are trying to make sure people are very clear that all the regulations and guidelines and everything we are planning come in line with each other and that there is a finish point.  Those points come together on the same date, which is 9 June.  That is why we have set this timeline but also because, as much as we would like the situation to have improved so drastically that we would not need these regulations in three months, I am not sure that will be the case.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Connolly mentioned the blame game and bringing people on board with us.  This is not a blame game in any way, shape or form.  When this legislation was first introduced, it had the support of the vast majority of publicans, if not all, and the reason for that is the vast majority of publicans have been compliant.  They are doing their best and I fully agree with Deputy Howlin that they deserve more than just our praise and thanks.  They deserve our support and I hope the support we have provided to them so far has been of some help.  They want and need to be able to open and do their work safely.  What they do not want, when the regulations at level 5 or otherwise are in place, is to see some premises not adhering to the guidelines, putting people at risk and essentially making everybody else look bad.  These regulations have been brought in to ensure that those who do not follow the guidelines will be brought into compliance.  I think it is working and that, based on the very low numbers, even the idea that this regulation is in place has brought some people on board. <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin asked if I could give a commitment that this regulation will not continue or that it will be removed from the Statute Book once it is not needed.  That will absolutely happen.  I would love to say that will be the case when the deadline approaches next June, and I hope it is, but I cannot give that commitment.  However, it will certainly not be reimposed once it is no longer needed.  This will also be brought to the House again and there will be an opportunity for people to debate this legislation and whether it is necessary to extend it again.  I am very happy to give updates if Deputies so wish, whether in the Joint Committee on Justice or otherwise.  It was suggested that I might withhold information or not attend a committee.  I am always very happy to attend a committee if I am asked, particularly to give updates on progress, enforcement, compliance or any of the regulations with which the Garda is involved.<\/p>  <p>  A few people mentioned travel and the Garda checks.  A clear and lengthy list of exemptions was published of when people can travel outside their 5 km, particularly for care needs.  Garda&iacute; have been very understanding and are willing to listen to people.  One of my family members had to travel outside the 5 km yesterday for an operation.  She did not have a form from the doctor or the hospital but the garda&iacute; listened and understood and allowed her to go about her business.  Garda&iacute; have been very understanding in that regard.  Granted, schools were closed back in March and April and a number of industries are now open that were not at the time, but driving around then was like driving on Christmas Day.  There were no cars on the road.  This week and even last week when the schools were closed, it feels as if we are pre-Covid levels with the number of cars on our roads, despite people being asked to work from home and not to go outside the 5 km unless it is absolutely necessary.  There are still too many people on our roads and out and about.  The Garda is not there to stop people who need to get to work from getting there on time but it is important to point out that there are still far too many people on our roads who do not need to be out and about and who can work from home.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Ward suggested that Sinn F&eacute;in has not been given any access to NPHET or health advice, which is simply not true.  I again refer to the fact that as the Government was trying to decide whether to move to level 5, Sinn F&eacute;in's leader left a briefing with the CMO, top health officials, the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach after 30 minutes and then complained that there was no access to information.  I completely refute that assertion.  It is absolutely not the case. <\/p> <p>Regarding the Commissioner, I would not, nor have I ever put words into his mouth or made any comments relating to the Commissioner without knowing whether or not they were his thoughts.  In a letter to my Secretary General two days ago, he gave a clear commitment that he supported this legislation and its continuation.  I would not ever put words into his mouth or say that he supported something when he did not.<\/p> <p> This is not legislation that any of us wants to have here.  Everybody has made that comment.  It has been brought in for a specific reason, for the minority of people who are not compliant and are putting others at risk.  What we have seen even in the short time since it has been introduced is that it has brought more people into compliance.  I was speaking with the garda&iacute; before this legislation was introduced and there was a higher number of repeat offenders who were continuing to break the rules, to open when they should not, or to go outside the regulations.  However, once this legislation was introduced, the number of repeat offenders immediately reduced.  That is not to say that everybody has been perfect but the fact that there is knowledge and understanding that there can be repercussions has made a difference.  The vast majority of people are trying; the figures this week show that.<\/p> <p> The numbers are moving in the right direction.  We hope that they will continue to, and if they can, the most positive thing that can happen is that we move away from level 5, reopen our society, start to re-engage and can do so safely.  We need to make sure that we continue to have the guidance, rules and regulations in place because unfortunately, as I have said, I do not think this will disappear in the next few months.  We will have to live with this and work together to try to get through it.  I know people will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020110400066#TTT00200","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1604522100,"counter":336,"content":"<p>On a point of clarification, the Minister said that the Garda Commissioner gave her a letter.

We have a situation where if somebody plays golf and has a golf course within 5 km of his or her home, and decided to go out on his or her own to play golf as if they decided to go for a walk, he or she cannot do it.  We have asked people to stay within 5 km of their home and only to move outside of that to go for exercise.  This is a sport.  They have fought for many years for it to be seen as a sport and in the same way that many sports are not going ahead with the level 5 restrictions, it is the same for shooting.  This is not a decision of the garda&iacute;.  This is applied as part of the level 5 restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked about the issue of mass and whether somebody would be sent to prison or fined.  The answer is \"No\".  While it is against the law, we have not imposed a penal provision in this regard.  It might not make sense but a decision was taken that this was not something we wanted a penal provision to be attached to.  It is against the law.  We ask people not to attend.  We have asked priests.  This is a difficult time for those I know.  Mass is important for them every week or every day but we are asking people, particularly throughout these level 5 restrictions, to adhere to these regulations.
