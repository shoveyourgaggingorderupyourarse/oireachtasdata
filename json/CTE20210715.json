The Deputy asked about jobs.  We have 13 jobs in this sector, but in the sector in total, you are probably talking about between 30 and 40 jobs.  However, it is not just the few jobs involved in the sector directly, but it is the jobs in the spin-off industries, such as food suppliers.  What will they do with the remains of the food that we do not collect?  What will be the story there?  We are dealing with close to 70 or 80 food suppliers throughout the island of Ireland.  In my particular region, we are probably dealing with 25 food suppliers.<\/p> <p>  We do business with 250 companies on the island of Ireland, from buying the nuts and bolts to other identities we deal with.

I thank Senator Lombard for his question.  The compensation scheme package is dealt with in section 68 of the draft Bill.  In particular, subsections (3) and (16) set out the heads of compensation and the definitions of how this compensation will be calculated.  The farmers would have concerns under all heads.  I appreciate there are constraints of time here this morning, so I will just give an overview of the points.  If there is time, I will try to answer the questions.<\/p><p>The initial part, the most focused part of the compensation, is in relation to the unrealised profits and net asset value.  The unrealised profits terminology effectively is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, which is effectively adjusted profit.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in the proposals, in subsection (16) is suggesting that the compensation package be calculated on an average of the profits for the last five years, that is, the years 2016 to 2020, inclusive.  That is not acceptable to the farmers because that reflects a period in the down cycle in the industry when losses were incurred.  The graph which we furnished demonstrates that.  We have sent the committee a graph showing the combined profitability of the three farms over the period 2016 to 2020, inclusive, which shows that it tends to go in cycles of approximately five years.  The period  the Department suggests the compensation should be based on coincides with a loss-making cycle.  That is evident from the graph furnished and from the financial statements which were furnished to the Department back in mid-March of this year.<\/p><p> The farmers are arguing that the average earnings should be calculated over a longer period of ten years, which would recognise the cyclical nature of the industry.  That would give a more fair calculation of the average profitability in that period.  For example, if the period the Department is suggesting is taken into account, it would give a negative figure which means the figure on which the compensation would be calculated would be a nil figure.  Over a ten year period, it would give a more positive figure.  In fact, the farmers would argue that a more reflective period of their profitability would be the years 2011 to 2015, inclusive, which was a profit-making period.  The reason for suggesting that would be a better period is that the evidence is that the upcoming period, which is the current year 2021 onwards, is going to be a period of sustained profitability.<\/p><p> In support of that, we have obtained correspondence from two of the prominent four auction houses in Europe, one in Helsinki and one in Copenhagen, which have confirmed that in 2021 to date, the prices of fur have increased by 150% and 127%, and the evidence is that that will continue to increase.  Second, a research study has been carried out by a senior adviser in the University of Copenhagen, giving evidence that the fur prices, again, in 2021 have increased.  That research was concluded in May of this year, so it is very recent.  The evidence is that the prices will continue to increase.  In addition, with the Danish cessation of operations, there is a shortage of supply in the global fur market so again, the Irish farmers would have been in a position to take advantage of that.  The Department has insisted it will not consider speculative future trading.  However, we will submit that the evidence is that the period 2021 onwards is likely to be a sustained period of profitability for the farmers and should be considered, rather than the five years from 2016 to 2020, inclusive, which did not give any prospect of the farmers getting any compensation for the loss of their farms.<\/p><p> The alternative calculation that has been put forward is a net asset basis.  What the draft legislation is suggesting is that that be based on the accounting book value of the assets, which again the farmers cannot accept because if, for example, an asset has been written off for accounting purposes, the legislation suggests they would get a nil compensation for that asset, whereas the market value of the asset could be significantly in excess of that.  The farmers would argue they should get the market value for their assets.<\/p><p> The third aspect would be the compensation to employees.  It is suggested in the draft legislation that the employees get statutory redundancy only, which the farmers consider to be a very unfair compensation to these employees who have been very loyal and contributed to the operation of the farms over many years.  Statutory redundancy generally arises in insolvency situations where the employer cannot afford to pay anything higher than that and, in general, this is usually paid by the Social Insurance Fund, because there are deficits in these failing companies.  In most negotiated close-downs agreements are reached whereby employees receive enhanced benefits, and we believe this is a case where this should be taken into account.  It has been suggested by the Department that any enhancement of the redundancy payment should be funded by the farmers from their compensation.  That is considered to be inequitable.<\/p><p> The next heading of compensation is for the demolition and clean-up costs of the farms.  The Department proposes that each individual farmer obtains three independent quotations and that the Department will accept the lowest of those three quotations, subject to a cap of a maximum &euro;50 per square metre for the demolition costs.  The farmers do not consider this realistic, because it is important to ensure that whatever compensation is paid allows the farmers to do the demolition and clean-up in a safe and environmentally-friendly manner.  For example, buildings in some of the farms have asbestos and it is very important that this is disposed of safely, with no environmental negative impact.<\/p><p> The draft legislation also specifies that only those building which are used exclusively to house mink should be part of the compensation scheme.  We would submit that any other buildings which are essential for the fur farming business and which do not have an alternative commercial use should also be included in the compensation scheme.  If there are any buildings which it is agreed may have an alternative use, that any adaptation costs should be covered by the compensation scheme.  Due to the location of the farms there will be extreme difficulty setting up alternative businesses and generating alternative employment for employees.<\/p><p> On the culling costs of the animals and the disposal costs, the Department has suggested that it costs 35 cent per animal for the culling and disposal of the animal.  The farmers have examined this and they estimate a figure of between &euro;4 and &euro;5.  Further discussion and negotiation is needed on this issue.<\/p><p> Finally, there is a suggestion that the compensation scheme would cover reimbursement to the farmers for professional fees incurred solely after the legislation had been enacted.  We do not consider this to be reasonable because the farmers have engaged with the Department over the last number of months and have incurred costs in meeting the requirements of the Department, so it seems unfair and inequitable that they should not be covered for those costs which have been reasonably incurred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071500002#A01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Reynolds","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Mr. Reynolds, you have given a very comprehensive outline of the problems regarding compensation.

Some members have probably never been on a mink farm.  The mink are housed in houses, which are open on each side.  There is a roof, which as Mr. Reynolds said is asbestos.  There is a pathway going down the middle.  There are lines of cages on each side of the pathway.  Most of our houses are 120 m long while some are 100 m long.<\/p><p>The mink are in double tier pens.  We could say that there is a ground floor and an upper floor.  The mink can move around and run around in the pens.  They have a food area and a drinking area.  At the very end of a cage, there is a tray which catches all the manure.  That is piped out of the farm underground and into holding tanks.  All of this is to help members to visualise a mink house.<\/p><p> The most important aspect on a day-to-day basis is the welfare of the animal.  Unlike some farming practices, we have welfare checks at least three or four times a day.  When the staff arrive first thing in the morning, they make the food.  Food is made fresh every day.  When the rest of the staff go into the farm, each pen is looked at.  This is because we divide the food.  We look to see if the food was not eaten the previous night.  When the staff divide the food, they look at the pen.  At the moment, a pen would hold three animals.  The staff first check for water.  If a lot of food is left over, that is the first sign of a problem.  They would then check the food.  The first thing they check is if there is water.  The mink are sometimes inclined to put the food into the drinker.  Next, the staff check if the three mink are there.  If there are only two and the feeder contained enough food for three, that would explain why a lot would be left over.<\/p><p> After that, the staff make a note of any problems, or if a mink is sick.  Every house and cage has a number.  The staff writes down the number of the house and cage.  That is the morning process.  They feed the mink at breakfast time.  While doing the welfare check, a staff member goes around and immediately puts food into any empty cage.  Then we divide the food.  After all that, we feed the mink again at about midday.  We go to any cages that no longer have food.  We may have a problem, as we refer to it.  For instance, a mink may have to be taken to sick bay to be looked at, a pen may need to be repaired and so on.  Staff members take all of this down in notes as we go along.  The problems are then fixed and sorted.<\/p><p> The feeder gives the mink food again in the afternoon.  We give a fairly good portion to the mink at that stage.  The feeder also observes all of the mink at this time.  We feed them three times a day, so those who feed them observe any problems.  We also feed them in the evening at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m.  At that point, we go around and top up the food.  If there is only a little food left, we top it up.<\/p><p> All of this is for the welfare of the animals.  It is important that they have fresh food and water at all times.  That is more or less what happens on a farm.  Each season is different.  There is a mating season, a weaning season, a whelping season and a pelting season.  There are other jobs as well, such as looking after the pups.  Like in all farming areas, there are different seasons.  However, giving food to the mink and checking their welfare is done every day of every year: even on Christmas Day.  Like all farmers, we do not get a break.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071500002#B01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Una Heffernan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Heffernan.

I will focus my question on two or three aspects.  First, for once and for all, we need a straight answer in terms of the three farms they are representing here today.  How many mink are on these farms?  I refer to the exact numbers of mink that are currently on these farms.<\/p> <p>  I read a number of newspaper clippings on mink, which I downloaded yesterday.  This was in the context of both Covid and the Denmark issues that the witnesses would be familiar with.  It suggested there are 120,000 in Ireland.  That is only earlier this year.  That may be incorrect.  I want to start from that point.<\/p> <p>  The next point is this is Government policy.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party have agreed in their programme for Government to phase out mink farms.  That is the way it is.  It is a numbers game in the House, crude and all as it is.  They are in the majority.  They will support this.  They will see this through.  I am merely trying to be pragmatic.  I am trying to be honest and upfront with the witnesses.  It will happen.<\/p> <p>  Now it is a question of their compensation package.  They make a strong case for their compensation package and I would be supportive of that.  Also, I am very disappointed to hear, besides the owners, that the workers will end up walking away with the basic redundancy package.  That is simply not good enough for committed workers who have worked in this farming sector.<\/p> <p>  The next real issue is that the most emails and representations I have received on this controversy are around the animal welfare aspect.  I took the time to check out the European Communities (Welfare of farmed animals) Regulations on the culling of mink and other animals.  The suggested recommendations from this European paper which I received yesterday state permitted methods consist of the use of mechanical instruments which would penetrate the brain, an overdose of a drug of anaesthetic properties, electrocution by cardiac arrest, exposure to carbon monoxide, exposure to chloroform and exposure to carbon dioxide.  That is dramatic and headlining stuff.  It is of concern to people.  Clearly, that is on the record as being permitted.  We are talking about culling a large number of animals.  What methods do the witnesses use?  Are they familiar with any of these methods?  Have they used any of these methods?  We need to know whether they are familiar with them, whether they have used them, what their preferred option is and how would they envisage culling these animals.  Clearly, we cannot release them into the wild and we have to be responsible in how we manage them.  I suppose that brings a dose of realism into this debate.<\/p> <p>  Having talked to the people in government, my view is they are hell-bent on phasing out this trade.  That is the decision they have made.  That is their political prerogative.  It will happen.  My two issues are the animal welfare aspect we need to address and a proper, realistic and fair compensation package for everyone involved in this industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071500002#D00900","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for concise questions.

That is unacceptable because of the circumstances of this prohibition and because of the locations these farms are in.  It is a very unusual circumstance and the Department is taking the view that statutory redundancy is the top line and it will not discuss anything other than that.  It has said that it cannot change the redundancy legislation.

One query was on the farmers contributing to the compensation packages for the employees.  Of course the farmers will be very fair to the employees.  They have been long-standing employees on their farms, and almost like family members in some instances.  The overriding picture is that the prohibition is being brought in by the Government so the compensation package should be financed by the Government.  This should include the payment of appropriate compensation to the employees.  It should not have to be taken from the employers' compensation, which will also be calculated in what the Department has said will be a fair and reasonable manner.<\/p> <p>  On the world demand for fur, I am not too clear if there is an overall drop in the demand for fur but there is a significant drop in supply.  The Danish market has ceased with effect from last year.  That was a significant contributor to the world supply.  From that point of view, this sustains the view that the prices of mink are on the increase, currently and going forward.  The independent evidence, which was quoted earlier on, supports this.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the point made about the ten years, there are two aspects to calculating this part of the compensation.  One is to establish a sustainable and realistic average profitability per annum.  The Department has suggested that this be done over five years from 2016 to 2020, but that period clearly shows a loss because there was a downturn in the cycle.  We suggest ten years which, as Deputy Browne has said, takes into account some good years and some bad years, and gets a reasonable average of what the profitability would be.  It must be remembered that the farmers continued to endure the loss-making years in the expectation of getting recoverability of that finance when the profits come in so they could replenish their reserves.  This is why we suggest that 2021 onwards should also be taken into account because the market is on the upturn and there will be higher profitability.  That calculation is to calculate the average profitability.  There is also the multiple figure.  When the average profitability on an annual basis is agreed there will be a multiple also.  The Department is suggesting five years, but the moment this is five times zero, so it is nothing.  We are suggesting a figure of ten, which reflects the most recent compensation scheme in Denmark that takes a ten-year period to review.  Again, a multiple period is not an exact science.  With any company valuation or disposal there are subjective issues that are part of the negotiation.  The farmers are prepared to negotiate, but five times zero is not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Reynolds"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank the businesses for coming in today.

I expect that any compensation above and beyond statutory redundancy would have to come through the employer.<\/p><p>On the seven-year cycle, on a good year if a farmer had 1,000 animals, broadly speaking what is the likely profit margin on that?  What is the net profit on 1,000 animals?  Pick a multiple just to give me an example of what that would be in a good year.<\/p><p>I believe that the multiples of ten years is very high.  Even in the worst excesses of the Celtic tiger, with any business that is being sold the best multiples they were looking at were probably seven to eight times.  I would probably agree that the Department's offer at the minute of a multiple of five is probably reasonable but I take on board Mr. Reynolds view on that being five times zero.  It is probably the case that five years is the right period but we can ask what the baseline is and whether it is five times that figure.<\/p><p>Perhaps Mr. Reynolds could try to explain more to us the seven-year cycle and how that works.  I would have thought that the demand for fur, which I assume is largely eastern European driven, is still fairly consistent.  I cannot understand fully the seven-year cycle.  Perhaps Mr. Reynolds could give more background on what causes those fluctuations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071500002#F00300","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Which of the witnesses would like to answer Deputy Flaherty's questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071500002#F00400","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626303600,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I will answer some of those.  We have looked at the Danish model and examined its compensation scheme.  While there are differences in the actual calculations, the fundamentals are the same.  The Danish scheme provides for compensation for a ten-year period.  This is what we are proposing.  It is the most recent example.  The reason we suggest a multiple of ten years is that the initial calculation of an average over ten years going back takes in significant loss-making periods.  It gives an average profitability.  This prohibition is proposed to come in immediately.  This will preclude the farmers from participating in a period of profitability which, going by previous cycles, would be a period of five years minimum of profitability.  The farmers are foregoing that period of profitability by being prohibited now.  If the average profitability was determined over a five-year period in the last good period, which was 2011-15, and which we feel is reflective of what is going to happen in the coming five years, the multiple of ten would be a negotiable figure then.  With an average over ten years it takes into account loss-making periods.  We feel that a multiple of ten is appropriate.  Again, it depends, as the Deputy has mentioned, on the baseline that is agreed.  When the baseline agreed is reasonable the multiple is negotiable in any valuation.  I read an article recently in the <i>Irish Tax Review<\/i>that calls it the mysterious world of company valuations.  It is very much a subjective issue.  The Deputy is right that ten is a high figure but in the circumstances we present we believe it is reasonable.  If the base figure is calculated on a more realistic basis that is something that could be discussed.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy referred to statutory redundancy.  I accept that this is provided for in legislation but I repeat that in most negotiated settlements there would be agreement where employees would benefit from more than a statutory level of redundancy.  In these circumstances, to suggest that employees only get statutory redundancy is not equitable in any sense for the employees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071500002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Reynolds"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":78,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee I want to thank the witnesses Ms Heffernan, Mr. Curran and Mr. Reynolds for coming to the committee.

I should have said at the beginning of the meeting that apologies were received from Deputy Paul Kehoe.  This session is on pre-legislative scrutiny of the animal health and welfare (amendment) Bill 2021.  I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Charlie McConalogue.  I also welcome Mr. Gerry Greally, senior inspector in livestock breeding production and trade, and Mr. John Kinsella, principal in the legal services division.  They are all very welcome to the meeting.  We have received the opening statement and briefing material.  These have already been circulated to members.  We are limited in our time due to Covid-19 restrictions so the committee is taking the opening statement as read.  We can use the full session for questions and answers.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and are publicly available.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin I have an important note on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected to the subject matter of these proceedings be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible they should not criticise or make charges against person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>Participants in the committee meeting from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protection afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts does not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which the participation is covered by the absolute privilege of a statutory nature.<\/p><p> Before I open up to questions, I wish to note that in the previous hour we have had representatives from fur farming appearing before the committee.  They gave us a very comprehensive briefing and raised a number of issues that are to be covered in the legislation.  I am aware that other members will also be raising this issue, but we find ourselves in a very unique situation in respect of the workers and the compensation that is available to them.  In my memory - I can be corrected if I am wrong - this is the first time that legislation has been introduced to cease an agricultural activity, albeit a very minor activity, but obviously for the three farms in question it is their income and of very great importance to them.<\/p><p> Questions have been raised about workers' compensation and the redundancy packages that will be available for them.  Other questions raised were in respect of the calculation of the profit level of these farms which is being done on a five-year cycle where these farms are producing evidence to say that a ten-year cycle would give a far better reflection of the fluctuations in the fur trade.  The farms' representatives state that fur is recovering very strongly in price in 2021 and went through a very serious valley period during the years which the Department is using for the determination of profit.<\/p><p> Another point made by these representatives, which would greatly concern me, is the question of the cull and the differences in costs that they say will arise per animal and what the Department is estimating.  In the past we have had instances where businesses have closed and where a cull was not done effectively.  This caused very significant problems for people in that locality.  The culling has to be sorted out as a priority.<\/p><p> A further point made is that these farms have made an investment in their buildings and there are now going to be very significant demolition costs in respect of those buildings.  This also needs to be catered for in the legislation.<\/p><p> I know that other members will have points to make to the Minister but I was taking notes while the representatives of the mink farmers were talking in the last session and these are four points I highlight which they made in respect of this legislation and the compensation package that is to be put in place for them.  That is what they focused on.  While they feel aggrieved that the licence that they have in place to 2024 is now being revoked and that they have been unfairly treated in that regard, their main focus has been on the compensation package both for themselves and their workers.  That is my summary of their position and others will obviously add to it with further points but when the Minister is answering questions at the end, I ask that he might take those four points on board.  I will open up to the other members of the joint committee now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071500002#G00100","speaker":"1611","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>If I may, Chairman, I wish to make a number of introductory remarks to thank both the Chairman and the joint committee for facilitating the pre-legislative scrutiny on this Bill within a very good timeframe, which I appreciate.  As the Chairman has outlined this is a unique initiative and action in respect of the closing down of a sector which emanates from a commitment in the programme for Government and emanates from very significantly changed attitudes in society as to the keeping of what would otherwise be wild animals specifically for fur or skin.  It is a correct and welcome move but undoubtedly has very significant impacts for the three remaining fur farms in the country.  They have run their operations in compliance with all of the rules and regulations and in a very efficient, effective and compliant manner and it is very important that that is stated.  The fact that this decision has been taken is no reflection on them.<\/p> <p>  It is also very important to acknowledge the fact that this means an end to their livelihood and what has also been a way of life for them.

These people are not being taken out of their jobs or leaving them because they want to but are doing a favour in respect of whatever was agreed in the programme for Government.  I may not agree with that but that is the way it is.  I have a number of questions as to this offer of two weeks' redundancy from the Department.  We have seen the Debenhams and many other cases and I ask the Government to lead from the front on this to say that the least that these workers need is four weeks', or whatever, redundancy  payments to look after them?<\/p><p>It must be borne in mind that these people are working with and not against the Government.  <\/p><p> Many of these buildings have asbestos which must go to Germany.  It costs &euro;50 per square metre to get rid of that and to demolish those buildings.  Whoever commissioned the report does not know much about farming.  I am not even talking about fur farming.  These so-called experts would want to go down on the ground and find out what building projects cost now.  Turning to this type of farming, I have gone through this myself and talked to others about how it operates right across Europe.  Like other types of farming, this sector seems to follow a seven-year cycle.  A few good years are then followed by a few bad ones.  There seems to be a pattern of seven years alternating between good, middling and average outcomes.  These farmers, then, have sought to calculate their costs based on a ten-year cycle.  Is the Department prepared to do that?  <\/p><p> In 2012, the Department issued new regulations for animal welfare.  That is fine.  All the people involved in this area complied with those regulations and spent large amounts of money on infrastructure.  We are not talking about the construction of something like a three-bay shed in the back garden.  This was fairly significant and expensive infrastructure.  There are not 5,000 or 50,000 of these farmers around the country, so why has a genuine effort not been made to ensure that we look after them?  I refer to aspects of employment, infrastructure, asbestos removal and disposal, etc.  Many of these people have been in with the banks, to be frank.  It was not possible to build the infrastructure required without loans.  It is as simple as that.  Why has a genuine effort not been made to help these farmers?  Why is a five-year cycle period being used?  I have examined this area myself.  Around Europe, this type of farming has a seven-year cycle.  These farmers are seeking the use of a ten-year cycle for assessment.  Is the Department willing to co-operate with them on that point?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071500002#H00900","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I call the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071500002#J00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for those questions.

I must make that point to begin with.  In undertaking that process, Grant Thornton did, of course, look at how best to compensate for a business that is being closed.  Methodologies used in this regard in other countries were examined.  In the general perspective of accounting, certain conventions and methodologies are used when trying to value a business.  Grant Thornton considered two methods of doing that and then combined them in the end.  The first was valuing the assets and devising the net book value of those assets.  The second approach then was a consideration of the profitability of the businesses concerned over time.  The thinking was that combining those two methods of assessing value in a formula would best produce a market value for these companies.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's questions concern the formula in the context of a five-year or ten-year cycle of assessment.  The five-year cycle in this regard encompasses a retrospective examination of five years and a projection of five years into the future.  In calculating the profitability figure, therefore, the accountants suggested taking an average by going back five years and then going forward another five years to give these companies a multiple of that profitability average for the future.  The rationale behind using a period of five years to measure backwards and forwards was that these are multiples and values that are used in company evaluations and for companies of this type.  It would be very unusual to go back ten years to calculate a retrospective average of profitability and then to go forward another ten years with that outcome.  The logic here is that going back five years is considered as being enough to show the historical profitability of a company and, equally, projecting forward for five years should also be adequate.  Going forward those five years takes into account the consideration that people seeking to put a value on these companies will estimate that it will take that long to make their money back.  These sorts of multiples and values, therefore, were put together in that context by Grant Thornton and it was conscious of the type and size of the businesses being examined.  <\/p> <p>  The farmers have only recently come to us regarding a ten-year cycle and given us some data for those years.  In effect, we have struggled to get any data from them.  We first gave them notice that we required these data back in November 2020.  We have repeatedly sought these data since then.  The farmers provided some data to us, but it was not adequate.  They put together some trend lines for us for the ten-year cycle they are talking about now, but that information came in their last communication to us just a little over a week ago.  We have not had a chance to examine that information in any detail yet, but we will do so.  My main point, therefore, is that Grant Thornton put together the formulas in the absence of specific data on these farms.  Granted, information was available from statutory accounts which could be used and, in many ways, it is possible to put together a model for compensation based on such accounts, but we also needed the detailed information that we received only recently.  However, we certainly can look at using a period of ten years rather than five years.  <\/p> <p>  Would the Deputy like me to deal with the other questions concerning asbestos, etc.?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Greally"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Yes, I would like Mr. Greally to comment on the asbestos issue and on the redundancy arrangements for the workers, if he can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071500002#J00500","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626303600,"counter":98,"content":"<p>On the subject of asbestos, we got a chartered surveyor company to provide us with figures in this regard.  It was done through Grant Thornton, which commissioned that company as a contractor to do the work for us.  Therefore, we are familiar with the levels of asbestos material on each of the farms.  We could, then, take into account that asbestos costs much more than a fibre cement roof, for example, to demolish.  Therefore, the figures in this regard were adjusted to take account of the presence of asbestos.  Regarding the figure of &euro;50 per square metre, the farmers have come back to us and they are now talking about &euro;62 per square metre.  Again, it is easy to pluck a figure out of the air.  They have not given us any detail regarding the breakdown of that figure of &euro;62 per square metre.  As far as we are concerned, we have the required knowledge of the type of roof on each of the farms and the amount of roofing material involved to allow us to calculate a cap value.<\/p><p>On that basis, we put together a figure of &euro;50, which takes into account some building inflation costs.

On the asbestos, an exercise was done by specialists here and those are the figures they came up with.<\/p><p> On redundancy, we are really just doing what happens in industry in general.  When a company goes out of business, the company is bound by law to pay redundancy to its staff.  It is statutory redundancy and it is bound by legislation.  That is all we are doing here.

We had a very good engagement this morning with the witnesses.  I did not think it was satisfactory in terms of their answers.  Of course, the big problem we had was that we did not get from them a definitive number of minks that are on these farms today; not yesterday or tomorrow but today.  There is a long lead-in and mink breed pretty rapidly.  If one wanted to bring the numbers up, one could do so pretty rapidly.  That is just a cautionary note I want to raise.<\/p> <p>  I want to share with the Minister that I was also somewhat disappointed that there was much talk about the individuals involved but not too much talk about the workers.  Again, it raises the issue of data, facts and figures with regard to this industry.  How many people are registered and officially employed on these farms today?  I simply do not know.  I would be interested in hearing from the Department about its knowledge of how many minks are in this country.  We know from media reports some months ago in the context of the Denmark mink controversy, although it was in an Irish newspaper, that there was a confirmation of approximately 120,000 mink in this country at that time.  The witnesses did not seem to dispute that with us.  Indeed, two of them nodded their heads.  I, therefore, took it that it was around that or perhaps more but they did not contradict that suggestion that there were approximately 120,000 mink in the country.<\/p> <p>  We were not told how many employees there were.  When I asked the witnesses what they had in mind in terms of a package for the workers, they said they did not know.  They did not seem to come up with any opposition to any idea I suggested.  Indeed, I took from it, and this is my own view, that they did not really give much thought to it at all.  Certainly, I was interested when the Minister's official talked about what the ownership of these companies can contribute to their workforce.  We need to know exactly the numbers of registered employees on these farms and we need to talk about compensation for them.  I am sympathetic to the people involved in the businesses.<\/p> <p>  This is Government policy.  Phasing this out is a Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party agreement in the programme for Government.  That is, therefore, the reality.  This is a numbers game; the Minister knows it and politicians at this meeting know the story.  The Minister has seen what has been happening in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in the last few months.  If the Government has the largest numbers, it can effectively do what it likes and we have to put up with it.  That is the reality and it is frustrating for someone who is in the Opposition.  It is not good politics.  There will be a day and a time when the road will break and people have to go left, right and centre and then there will be all sorts of complaints and accusations.  That is for another day.  It is inevitable and it is going to happen.<\/p> <p>  On what is in hand today, I am interested in what will happen to the workers in these places.  I am interested in fair and equitable compensation for the people through the Government's decision and policy to close their businesses down.  They need to be supported but we need to see the whole package.<\/p> <p>  I set out today the animal welfare issues and EU regulations, with which the Minister will be familiar, regarding the culling of animals.  Welfare is another aspect about which I have had more calls and emails than about any other matter.  I spoke today about mechanical operations, instruments that penetrate the brain, overdose of drugs by anaesthetics, electrocution by cardiac arrest and exposure to carbon monoxide, chloroform and carbon dioxide.  They are options I do not necessarily support but they are set out in these regulations.  Two of the people told us today that they are using carbon monoxide to destroy these animals.  What is clear in these regulations or in whatever the Minister and his officials intend to do is that we need to have veterinary and animal welfare people oversee the culling of these animals.  It needs to be very clear.  That is important.  I do not believe we can allow for any vagueness here.  Whatever the Department and the veterinarians believe is the appropriate way to deal with this, it needs to be set out in order that we have no ambiguity about it.  That is a major concern.<\/p> <p>  I want to wrap up by commenting on the inevitability of it all.  It is about fairness to the companies involved and to the employees, who need a far better package and who are my concern.  We also need very strict guidelines, which are in line with international practice and European Union regulations, and statutory instruments with regard to this matter.  That is really important.  I thank the Minister for listening.  It is important we set out and address specifically those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071500002#K00400","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for that comprehensive overview of his assessment of the situation.

To give members some idea of the numbers, we are talking about 15,000 breeding females.  Each of those will, on average, have five kits.  Straight away, therefore, at the end of the year, the number is up to approximately 90,000 mink at that stage in the year.  In the normal course of events, all the young from those females would be slaughtered and we would be left with the breeding females at the end of December of the year concerned.  It depends, therefore, on what time of the year we dip into these farms to look at the numbers.  The maximum we are talking about is 100,000 or 110,000.  It is that sort of number.<\/p> <p>  As regards numbers of workers, we do not have exact figures here but our estimate is ten or 12 across the three farms.

This is a unique situation because legislation is being introduced to ban a farming practice.

Because of the nature of this process, the Opposition will not be permitted to bring forward amendments in that regard given that costs would arise.  It would be very useful, therefore, if the Department and the Minister would engage with us on our proposals.  One of the suggestions is that there would be a one-off lump sum for the staff involved.

In terms of redundancy, according to the departmental officials we are only talking about 12 members of staff.  It was stated that they have to get two weeks' redundancy payment.  That is a very small amount of money and we must find a way around it so that they can be suitably compensated for their work.  Effectively, we are giving 24 weeks, which is 12 by two.  We must find a mechanism whereby we can ensure that some kind of contribution can be made to staff following the change in regulations and legislation that is not of their making.  Finding a solution to that is one of the key issues we must address.<\/p> <p>  Could Mr. Greally comment on how he came up with the calculation of &euro;50 per square metre, taking into consideration that there is a loss?  He also mentioned that it was &euro;47 and he increased it to &euro;50 due to building inflation.  In my part of the world, building inflation is running at 25% this year alone and building costs have increased dramatically, particularly in the context of labour.  When responding, could Mr. Greally outline the date on which the calculation was made, given the dramatic increase in building costs in the past six weeks alone?<\/p> <p>  Could Mr. Greally also clarify the views of the three local authorities involved on how the work can take place?  Is planning permission required?  What licences or permits are required and how will the process function in terms of a timeline for when the buildings will be taken down?  Is there a proposed timeline in the legislation for the decommissioning of the buildings?  Will there be a period of grace and how will it be set out in the legislation?  Mr. Greally might respond to those issues.<\/p> <p>  In a previous contribution it was mentioned that Denmark gave a ten-year compensation line.  I would like to hear a comparison between the differences in our approach and the approach in Denmark.  Why did Denmark propose ten years and we proposed five?

That figure is attributed to one of the three farms on the basis of an analysis of the roof type, mainly.  We have information on the roof types, whether they are galvanised, fibre cement or asbestos roofs.  The consultants concerned calculated that figure on the basis of the components that I just mentioned.  These consultants are from a chartered surveyor company.  We asked them to look at those aspects.  They had information on the farms concerned.  They had pictures of the buildings, they had photographs from Google, they had planning applications and they had information on Department files that we have had for years.  Our Department engineer has been working with these farms since 2012 to bring the type of building up to a certain standard.  We have a lot of information in that regard.  All that information would have been used to come up with the figure of &euro;47 per square metre.<\/p> <p>  I take the Senator&rsquo;s point that perhaps the &euro;3 extra for building inflation is not enough in the current environment.  However, a cap like that can be looked at again.  We are not saying that this is set in stone.  We could look at the cap again.  Certainly, we can take into account whatever information the farmers are willing to provide to us.<\/p> <p>  As I explained to Deputy Fitzmaurice, the cost of killing the mink are based on cost the of labour as well as the cost of carbon monoxide gas.  That is all that is included in that compensation.  The farmers obviously are including other costs.  Unfortunately, we do not have the information as to what they are including.  I note that we talk of 35 cent per mink.  However, there is also a compensation amount of &euro;160 per tonne of carcase material.  We do not know if they are comparing like with like.  In the absence specific information from the farmers, we put those figures in place.  I apologise for repeating this but we have been struggling from November of last year until this date to get specific information from the farmers.  It is only in the last week and a half or so that we have gotten some information on these aspects.  That information can be looked at again.<\/p> <p>  I will respond to the question about the Denmark situation.  The accountants examined different compensation packages.  Denmark was just one of these.  Denmark has ten years but the UK, for example, has five years back and seven years forward.  It depends on what kind of compensation at which we are looking at the time.  I am sure the consultants had this issue as well but it is difficult to try to compare like with like when looking at these schemes in other countries.  I take the point that Denmark has a ten-year multiple.  We do not have information as to why it is ten years, rather than five.  Our five-year multiple is based on what Grant Thornton deemed to be adequate.  This is five years forward in time and five years back in time for the average.  It deemed it adequate to place that value on a company of that type.  It is using custom and practice here in Ireland, as well as abroad, in general accounting practice.  I cannot give the Senator the exact details as to why Denmark has ten years, rather than five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071500002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Greally"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Greally and call Deputy Martin Browne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071500002#M00500","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I will be fairly quick.  Just like the other speakers, I encourage the Minister and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to look after the workers.  There is a discrepancy between what we heard earlier and what the Department is saying.  The farmers told us that they had 30 to 40 workers.  It is still a small number of people who are losing their jobs because of the legislation.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice said earlier, the Department should lead from the front and look after the workers in this situation.<\/p> <p>  Is there a particular reason that the farms should be closed down this year?

I may not know a whole pile about mink farming, but I spent 35 years working on steel and using asbestos.  I can assure Mr. Greally that there is a massive difference between removing asbestos roofs and fibre cement roofs and galvanised roofs.  The figure of &euro;50 would come nowhere near covering the cost of removing those kinds of roofs.  Asbestos roof removal has to be done by someone with a licence.  Every pallet of an asbestos roof has been double wrapped and sent to Germany for disposal.  The person in the Department who came up with the figure of &euro;50 needs to update the information.  Like I said, I spent 35 years on that kind of work and I know a figure of &euro;50 would come nowhere near what is needed.  I will leave it at that.  All of my other questions have been answered.

In section 38 there is loophole around young animals that are being transported in breach of domestic or EU regulations.

This means that young pups being seized at ports and are about two years old before they can be rehomed.

There are a number of reasons for it being where it is at the moment.  It is useful because it gives everybody involved, including the farmers and the committee, a good snapshot of the thinking with regard to the compensation scheme, the various heads of loss and other matters we are looking at.  It is useful to have a debate and to get good input from everybody involved at this stage.  That might not be the case if the detail was to be held back and if we were only to talk about the very high-level stuff you normally see in primary legislation.

At that stage, it will go through the process and it will be open to Deputies and Senators to come forward with amendments.  In advance of bringing the finalised Bill to the D&aacute;il and having it approved, we will consider what amendments are appropriate.

It was a late night last night.  Today the committee will engage with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to discuss the summer economic statement.  I welcome him, Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and Mr. John Kinnane, principal officer.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, if they are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, then as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, either Leinster House or the convention centre, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate if he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement and, therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to give his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021071500002#A00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear here today to discuss the summer economic statement.  I will focus on the current economic and fiscal outlook, and I look forward to hearing the committee&rsquo;s views regarding some of the key issues in the medium term.  After a difficult and unprecedented 16 months, we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel.  The vaccination programme is well advanced, with approximately half of our eligible population now fully vaccinated.  Restrictions are gradually easing and there are signs of recovery, albeit uneven, in the domestic economy.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, we cannot expect to return to the same world we occupied before.  The pandemic has changed the way in which we work and live, and there will be lasting implications that will take some time to become clear.  While our vaccine programme is going well, we must also be cognisant of the fact large parts of the global population, particularly in developing countries will not be immunised for some time, leading to the possibility of the emergence of further strains of the virus.  This is the context in which the summer economic statement has been developed.  It provides the context for the year ahead, with particular regard to the upcoming budget.<\/p> <p>  The summer economic statement incorporates an upward revision to the gross domestic product, GDP, projection for this year, which is now projected to grow by 8.75%.  Projected growth in modified domestic demand remains unchanged at 2.5% this year and 7.5% next year, although all of this depends on where we are with our health.  Put simply, I expect the recovery to continue and strengthen into next year.  Households and firms are adapting.  There is a move towards online transactions and investment in remote working technologies.  As the public health containment measures ease, we can expect to see further recovery in the labour market.<\/p> <p>  It is unfortunate, however, that many firms face a difficult future in the post-pandemic world.  The Government will work towards assisting these firms in the transition to newer and more sustainable sectors.  We will also facilitate workers in retraining and upskilling.  Our response since the outset of this pandemic has been to minimise the permanent fallout through the provision of supports to households and businesses.  That said, to do this, budgetary policy took a countercyclical approach.<\/p> <p>  However, this has to work both ways to be effective.  As the private sector and the broader economy begins to recover, we need to roll back on some temporary supports to prevent the economy from overheating and begin the journey to reduce our deficit.<\/p><p>These public supports have been massive.  Taking into account the measures announced in the national economic recovery plan, &euro;48 billion has been made available up to 2022 in the form of direct expenditure, tax measures and below-the-line supports.  The committee is familiar with the larger figures: &euro;8 billion in the pandemic unemployment payment; &euro;6.5 billion in two wage subsidy schemes; and &euro;650 million for the Covid restrictions support scheme.<\/p><p> As I have said on many occasions, we allowed indebtedness to increase in order to look after our economy and help our society.  We also need to acknowledge, however, that as the worst effects of the pandemic pass and the economy begins to recover, we cannot continue to finance very large deficits.  The current level of public spending is far in excess of what can be supported by the domestic tax base.  Our public debt ratio is now among the highest in the world, and is due to exceed a of a trillion euro next year.  Going forward, the Government&rsquo;s budgetary strategy will involve an expenditure ceiling of &euro;88.2 billion for next year for core public expenditure.  In addition, we will also provide for a continuation of some temporary supports amounting to &euro;6.8 billion.  This will be consistent with a budgetary deficit of 6.2% of modified gross national income and 3.4% of GDP.<\/p><p> The deficit projection is higher than it was in April.  This is due to additional expenditure to allow for continued investment in housing and other critical infrastructure.  Expenditure ceilings are also being set for later years in order that the headline deficit will be approximately 2.8% of modified gross national income, or 1.5% of gross national product, by the mid part of the decade.  Expenditure growth has been set at 5%, which is broadly in line with the trend growth of the economy.  If actual economic performance deviates from expectations, automatic stabilisers will be allowed to operate fully to keep expenditure fixed.  These projections cover the period 2021-25.  They also include provision for tax measures of &euro;500 million per year.  Of course, all of these forecasts depend on conditioning assumptions regarding where we are with the virus.<\/p><p> Our future challenges will revolve around how we reduce the deficit to low levels by the middle part of the decade.  Returning the public finances to a sustainable trajectory that will put us in the best position to meet upcoming challenges.  I emphasise, in particular, the focus on reducing our deficit during the first half of the period relating to this plan, when, hopefully, our health situation will continue to improve.<\/p><p> We saw the value of balanced budgets before the pandemic.  There will be a value over time in reducing our deficit.  These pandemics may be once-in-a-lifetime events, but other longer-term issues will require challenging decisions in the months and years ahead.  We need to finance two further transitions, namely, the transition to a carbon-neutral economy and the transition to a digitised economy.<\/p><p> Our population is, of course, ageing rapidly.  While corporation tax has helped at times to plug the gap in some areas of public policy in recent years, there is a very real possibility that this revenue stream will soon begin to decline.  Further agreement is needed within the OECD framework.  International corporate tax reform, if and when finalised, could reduce our relative advantage in this area.  My Department&rsquo;s estimate is that corporation tax could be impacted by up to &euro;2 billion annually over the short to medium term.<\/p><p> It is fair to say that we are facing into a better outlook, but there are still challenges ahead.  We are by no means out of the woods.   Many families and businesses know that to be the case.  Our policy will continue to adapt to changing circumstances in order to build upon recovery and facilitate a move to a post-pandemic economy as smoothly as possible.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here and I look forward to an exchange of views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021071500002#A00500","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I welcome this opportunity to appear before the committee to speak on the summer economic statement, which was published yesterday, with my colleague, the Minister for Finance.<\/p> <p>  The summer economic statement is a key element of the reformed budgetary process and sets out the parameters for the forthcoming budget and our medium term budgetary strategy to 2025.  The expenditure strategy outlined in the statement reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to return the public finances to a more sustainable position while addressing our infrastructure challenges, including the key areas of housing and climate action, continuing to enhance our public services and social supports and ensuring a balanced recovery from the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  In line with the approach in budget 2021 and in the stability programme update, expenditure to fund temporary measures to address the impact of the pandemic is dealt with separately from expenditure on the delivery of core programmes and infrastructure.  This distinction between core and temporary funding is essential to ensure the medium term sustainability of the public finances.<\/p> <p>  The strategy on core expenditure is to grow overall expenditure each year by 5%, on average, over the period to 2025.  The average annual growth rate in core current expenditure is just under 4.75%, with total capital spending, including that funded under the national recovery and resilience plan, NRRP, growing by an annual average of over 8.5%, and reaching more than &euro;13.5 billion in 2025.  These increases in capital investment in the period to 2025 follow the significant increases in 2020 and 2021 and would see total capital spending as a percentage of national income, as measured by GNI*, increase from 3.4% in 2019 to 5% in 2025.  Over the five year period 2021 to 2025, on a cumulative basis total gross voted capital expenditure, core and NRRP, would amount to over &euro;59 billion compared to core capital spending of &euro;29 billion over the period 2016 to 2020.<\/p> <p>  A key element of the medium-term expenditure strategy will be setting out revised capital expenditure ceilings for the period to 2030 following completion of the review of the national development plan, NDP.  Engagement with Departments on the review of the NDP is ongoing and the capital expenditure amounts in the summer economic statement provide the overall parameters for the NDP for the years to 2025.  Core current spending as a percentage of national income will also grow, from 28.1% of GNI* in 2019 to 29.9% in 2025.  The average annual growth rate of just under 4.75% over the period 2022 to 2025 provides the resources to meet existing levels of service costs and for new measures to enhance public services and social supports.<\/p> <p>  The level of resources being set aside for core spending is significant, almost &euro;93 billion in 2025 compared with just over &euro;70 billion in 2020.  This level of resourcing requires an ongoing and enhanced focus on value for money and that we ensure that there is the capacity to deliver this significant investment.  We must build on the budgetary reforms already in place to drive spending efficiency and effectiveness.<\/p> <p>  As we look to ensure that the recovery from Covid-19 is fair and balanced, it will be important to utilise these reforms to provide the evidence to inform decision-making.  The development of the well-being framework for Ireland can support this approach, in terms of developing a shared understanding of what makes for better lives and influencing public debate on strategic priorities.  The careful phased withdrawal of Covid-19 supports is essential to support society and the economy to recover from the impact of Covid and to return our public finances to a sustainable position. <\/p> <p>  Across 2020 and 2021, we will have made available over &euro;31 billion for direct expenditure measures with approximately &euro;15 billion this year.  The stability programme update included &euro;4 billion in Covid-19 related expenditure in 2022.  Including the expenditure funded under the NRRP, the summer economic statement now sets out almost &euro;7 billion for temporary Covid spending next year including an amount to be held in reserve to allow the Government respond as the situation with the virus evolves.  This is a prudent approach given the uncertainty that still exists regarding Covid and the requirement to ensure that supports are carefully withdrawn in a manner that supports the recovery of our economy.<\/p> <p>  The summer economic statement includes an amount of expenditure of &euro;1.1 billion for measures funded by the Brexit adjustment reserve, BAR.  Funding under the BAR will be used to support employment, businesses and local communities negatively affected by Brexit, including those in the fishing industry, and will be allocated across budgets 2022 and 2023<\/p> <p>  The fiscal strategy underpinning the summer economic statement marries the commitment of the Government to deliver improvements in infrastructure and public services with the commitment to sustainable public finances.<\/p><p>The strong position of the public finances before the Covid crisis put us in a position to deliver a significant fiscal response to support our people, businesses and key public services through the crisis.  As the impact of the crisis recedes, we must start returning the public finances to a more sustainable position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021071500002#B00500","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I welcome my colleagues, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance, and thank them for their presentations.

We are seeing a significant rebound in the economy and we expect that to transition towards a sustainable recovery over time.  Our key focus is to help people who want to get back to work.  We still have more than 200,000 people on the pandemic unemployment payment.  These people lost their jobs simply because of Covid.  That will remain a key focus of Government.<\/p> <p>  On the expenditure side, the need to gradually and carefully unwind the emergency Covid-related spending over time will be critical to bringing the public finances to a more sustainable position.  The Covid spend this year is of the order of &euro;15 billion, as an estimate at the mid-point of the year.  The provision we are making for next year is of the order of &euro;7 billion.  The assumptions underpinning that are that we will make continued progress in the battle against this virus, that the vaccination programme, which is already proving highly successful, will continue to be so and that the situation will progressively improve.  The unwinding of the expenditure is directly linked to the Department of Social Protection and conditions in the labour market.  It relates to the number of businesses that have to depend on the employment wage subsidy scheme and the number of individuals and families depending on the pandemic unemployment payment, for example.<\/p> <p>  Covid aside, our key focus on the expenditure side is, first, to protect existing levels of service and make sure they are properly funded into the future.  I believe we have made adequate provision for that on issues such as demographics, public service pay and the full-year costs of commitments made this year and in prior years.  That is an important starting point.  Then the focus is on having adequate headroom to support the recovery through the continuation of supports where we deem it appropriate.  Then, critically, it is about prioritising the public capital investment programme.  The figures set out in the SES show that this is where Government is focusing the most significant increases in public expenditure, with our capital envelope for next year rising to more than &euro;11.1 billion.  Four years ago in 2017, that figure was &euro;4.6.  It has been increasing very significantly since and will increase significantly next year and in the years beyond.  That is to drive recovery, assist with job creation and tackle what we can all accept are the big challenges facing society.  Undoubtedly, those include the need to tackle the housing crisis and get back to building in a more significant way.  Public housing, affordable housing, cost rental and purchase will be the cornerstones of the Housing for All strategy, and the review of the national development plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021071500002#C00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I will ask a brief follow-up on the public capital investment programme in relation to housing.

Compare that &euro;50 billion across all Departments in capital spending over the next four years to the equivalent figure for the previous four years, including this year, of &euro;31 billion.  For the four years from 2017 to 2020, the figure was &euro;26 billion.  By any measure, we are seeing a rapid expansion of the public capital programme and the precise figures allocated to housing will be confirmed once Government approves Housing for All and the national development plan ceilings.<\/p> <p>  It will be critical to ensure value for money.

The Deputy makes a fair point that in order to gain tax relief, people have to be in a position to pay the tax in the first place.  Looking at how our economy is structured at the moment and the changes in our economy, with a level of excess savings between &euro;12 billion and &euro;13 billion, there are some forms of purchases about which the Deputy's point would have been very appropriate 18 to 24 months ago and that are more likely across the coming period.  As people make choices about how they are going to use their savings, being able to use changes we have made in our tax code to encourage the purchase of less environmentally damaging vehicles, for example, the value of that could become more apparent.  We have to look at how we can continue to guide decisions, particularly those relating to larger purchases, in a direction that can be more beneficial for our society and economy in the long run, whether through expenditure or taxation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021071500002#C00900","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>The Minister is an avid reader.

That has involved an extensive amount of documentation and it provides the evidential basis for making the decisions as a Government on the allocation of those resources out to 2025 in the revised NDP.  It is at an advanced stage.  Once we have agreement from Cabinet on the capital ceilings by Department out to 2025 and the overall envelope out to 2030, that will allow Departments to set their individual priorities.<\/p> <p>  Of course, it is the case in the implementation of any national public capital investment programme that there will be projects that do not move as quickly as you might wish.  There will be projects that encounter difficulties along the way.  Of course, it is open to Government at any point to select other projects that can step into the place of the projects that have run into difficulty.<\/p> <p>  The key measure set out in the summer economic statement is the framework.  It is &euro;50 billion of taxpayers' money going towards the public capital investment programme over the next four years, 2022 to 2025.  We must ensure we get value for money.  That is why the implementation of the public spending code and the strengthening of the external assurance framework is so important.  In recent days, my Department has gone out to tender, for example, to put together a panel of experts who will provide their experience and expertise to line Departments in managing major projects.  We are conscious of the escalation in costs across the system.  I need to ensure we have enough safeguards in place to protect this massive public investment and to make sure it delivers.

Housing, I believe, is a fundamental issue in regard to our economic performance by virtue of house costs or the proportion of the family income devoted to mortgage repayments or rent payments.  I note the five-year plan, and it is positive.  Unfortunately, I have been hearing that for the past ten or 15 years.  There has always been a plan that would take four or five years.  Every time there has been a change of Minister, and Ministers want to progress the issue for the benefit of the country at large, other people have had reasons to say it will take five years to do that.<\/p><p>If it takes so long, then I am concerned we may find ourselves running out of runway.  The five years could be up and we still might not have made an impact on this issue.  We require hugely accelerated expenditure and delivery in the first of these five years.

I ask that because we need to achieve that to break the back of what is a serious national impediment.  Can it be done?  Can we instruct the construction sector to recruit abroad, or wherever, so that it will be able to put in place a programme capable of delivery on this scale?  The longer we go the way we are now, the more expensive it gets.  I am not suggesting the Ministers are in any way lethargic.  I think the plan is good.

He rightly pointed to the scale of the issue, and the Government is acutely conscious of it.  That is why we have set housing as a key priority.  Consider the level of resources allocated in this regard in budget 2021, when we increased the capital envelope in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage alone by &euro;500 million and provided sufficient funding to build more than 9,000 homes directly.  The Deputy will be aware output has been significantly impacted by the public health restrictions we were forced to impose.  However, it does underline this Government's commitment to tackling the housing crisis and it will be continued right through our term in government.<\/p> <p>  Let us recall the amount of public money and the increase in that public money which was allocated to this priority area in recent years.  The capital envelope for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, for example, was just over &euro;800 million some years ago, but in 2021 it is now more than &euro;2.7 billion.  It has increased more than threefold in four years and there will be further significant increases in funding for the Department.  We want to get back to a position where we are directly building many more public homes through our local authorities or approved housing bodies.  We must also recognise we have huge challenges with affordability, and that is why the schemes we have legislated for and which will be put into operation shortly for affordable purchase and cost rental are so important.<\/p> <p>  We cannot instruct the construction industry on the number of units which must be built, but we can help by ensuring the bottlenecks in the system are addressed.  Challenges exist in respect of the planning system, legal actions, costs escalation, the availability of labour and the provision of services and infrastructure.  The Government has a role to play in dealing with all those aspects of the situation and that is what we are seeking to do.  Consider, for example, that the Central Bank of Ireland forecast for housing output next year is 23,000 units, while the consensus is we need at least 33,000 homes coming on stream each year.  We are not going to get there overnight.  It takes time to build houses, but this Government is determined to make significant progress on this issue.  That is why the Housing for All strategy will be so important.  It is a whole-of-government approach and cannot be left to one Department because the issues cut across many Departments.  We are all working together as a team to address this issue.  There is another meeting of the Cabinet housing subcommittee this afternoon and we are in the final stages of completing the Housing for All strategy.  It will be ambitious and it will be funded.

It seems People Before Profit is alone in challenging the consensus on what we consider to be the immorally low corporation tax rate which is applied here.  I refer not just to the nominal rate but to the effective rate.  It is derisory and that rate is imposed on some of the wealthiest corporations in the world.  We have been pretty much alone in arguing we must do something about this situation.  For a long time, more than a decade now, we have argued we should have a minimum effective tax rate for corporations that is at least 12.5% rather than 4.5% and that we should also go higher in that regard.  It is immoral that average workers pay a higher proportion of their incomes in taxes than some of the wealthiest corporations in the world do on their revenues.<\/p> <p>  We have long argued as well that defending this indefensible position shows that Ireland is a tax haven.  Some 130 countries around the world have finally had the courage to begin to address this obscene scenario of wealthy corporations paying negligible amounts of tax.

The major parties here, including, if I understand this correctly, the major party in Opposition, are defending this indefensible position.

Only about half of that amount, some &euro;90 billion, though, is actually taxed because of the application of reliefs, deductions, allowances, etc., and it is only possible to sustain the Minister's argument if we work from that lower figure.

What he is doing is not just morally reprehensible, but he is creating uncertainty and would be far better joining what is a progressive move internationally to make these corporations pay something like a fair share of contribution in tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021071500002#F00600","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":190,"content":"<p>With regard to the Deputy's point about gross profits, companies pay tax on what they earn after expenses are deducted.

We clearly have differing views on this.<\/p> <p>  We know that we need to dramatically increase expenditure on housing.  The Minister is not giving away the figure.  We believe he should double housing expenditure.  In addition, we have long-needed, and after Covid-19 it is desperately urgent, to increase capacity in our health service in a whole range of areas such as ICU, staff, beds, primary care and in  public health teams, not least.  Similarly, for education and training, we have to dramatically increase the capacity of our third level higher education system, apprenticeships and so on.<\/p> <p>  When we used to argue for a &euro;20 billion adjustment to fund these things, the Minister's predecessor used to always accuse us of fantasy economics.  We have now discovered in the past year, in response to an emergency such as Covid-19, you can do a &euro;20 billion adjustment and the world does not end.  After Covid-19, the emergency spending needs to be sustained to give us the permanent increases in capacity in housing, health, infrastructure, education and so on but we have to be able to pay for that.  Yet, the Minister is simultaneously saying he will have &euro;500 million per year available for tax breaks.<\/p> <p>  That suggests that the level of spending we need for housing, health and education will not be sustained, and we will begin to pare back when need that spending, that ordinary people will have to pay for it in some shape or form or we will continue to base that expenditure on debt financing which is not sustainable.  I want the Minister to spell out his position on that.  Our view is we need to maintain the levels of spending in these areas but pay for it, not through debt financing primarily, but by beginning to tax some of the wealth, which exists in this country and has grown exponentially during Covid-19, whether it is through wealth taxes, increased corporation taxes, financial transaction taxes or taxes on the vulture funds and those who make money from property and so on.  I will not list all the areas in which we think we could raise additional tax revenue.

As the Minister, Deputy McGrath, outlined in his presentation, both current and capital expenditure, but especially capital expenditure, are due to increase significantly across the coming period.<\/p> <p>  With regard to taxation, the Deputy is the biggest tax cutter in the house.  He wants to abolish the universal social charge, carbon tax and the local property tax.  There is not a tax we debate that he does not want to abolish.  What we are doing here is saying that over a period of time, we want to do what we can to try to protect workers in protecting their living standards and take home pay as it rises due to inflation and gradual wage increases, which we expect to see happen in the economy.  That is what we are looking to do.  It is a clear and targeted objective.  It is an amount of money that is a minority of the resources allocated.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the &euro;20 billion adjustment the Deputy referred to, where we significantly increased spending and where we are in intervention in our economy, we can do that because our public finances were in good condition and support from the European Central Bank but we cannot continue it indefinitely.  That is why the plan we have here, over a number of years rather than abruptly or in a single goal, looks to gradually reduce that emergency expenditure.  The Deputy is right in one way.

I was speaking in the convention centre earlier.  I have had a chance to look through the summer economic statement and I have a number of points I want to make and questions to ask.  One of the concerns I have with regard to our economy is the inflation factor.  I know it is something that has been addressed in the statement in terms of it being noted, the nature of it, that it is a timing thing and that it is hard to predict how inflation will go.  I would like to get the Minister's thoughts on where we might be going on that.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I looked at was the economic balance or imbalance.  I was looking at it more from a geographical imbalance and how, in the next five-years, we will make up the difference between the underspend in the regions, such as in the north-west region which has been downgraded in status to a region in transition.  It gives us an opportunity to look for more structural funding from Europe on the basis we should possibly be discriminating because of that situation.  It is something that is badly needed in that region.  While we have many challenges and demands, that is something we need to look at.<\/p> <p>  The other issue that concerns me is the cost of funding.  What I am talking about there is the attractive interest rates at present and how we can potentially harness as much of that in order that we have infrastructure and development money in place at a rate that is attractive and that we take advantage of the situation we have.<\/p><p>I can only imagine that this situation will not remain the same forever.<\/p><p> I am aware that the European fiscal rules have been relaxed.  I am sure that at some stage those responsible will look to anchor them in the future.  How do we transition back into the fiscal rules?  One of the big questions I have on this relates to the climate action legislation and the cost of climate action. Will this be tied into fiscal rules also or will it be outside of the fiscal rules given it is such an important world issue?  Do we need to unleash investment in that area?<\/p><p> On housing, one of the biggest impediments towards the acceleration of the building of houses is planning.  This is not so much the planning system as the judicial review system.  How can this be addressed effectively?  While it is not quite stifling development it is delaying the process.  This has created an urgency to deliver some silver bullets now.  I listened to Deputy Durkan speaking about getting the construction industry to deliver so many thousand houses next year.  I would love to see this happening, but the planning situation is causing delays.<\/p><p> The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform referred to the public spending code.  That code has become very paper oriented.  I had a meeting with a chief executive of one of the local authorities and the Construction Industry Federation some weeks ago.  The discussions included the length of time from a project being announced to when money can actually be drawn down to start spending.  This is one of my fears.  Consider the gateways within the public spending code whereby one must get approvals as the project goes along.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has six gateways of approval, the National Transport Authority has seven, housing has four and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has nine.  There is something wrong when we have all these gateways.  Doing this work is eating up the scarce resource of technical staff and consultants.  These people are not getting other work done.  There is a very simple project in Galway city of a bridge to be put across the Corrib for a greenway.  It will take three to six months to get it to construction from today.  We have overcooked all of this analysis and all of these approval processes.  We have created an industry within it.  We must come back to more basic ways of getting things done quicker in order that we can spend the money we have and get ahead of the inflation curve.<\/p><p> I compliment everyone involved over the past 18 months of Covid on what has been done for industry, what has been done for people and what has been done for everybody right across the board.  It has been exceptional.  Our public services have proven to be absolutely top class in the context of that delivery.  Hopefully, we are now exiting that period and getting everybody back to work.  We have an issue regarding employment.  Unemployment stands at 16%.  We must look at how we get people back to work in the next year.  I heard the Minister speaking on the radio this morning about getting 250,000 people back to work next year.  We must simplify this for employers and employees.  We must encourage employers to take on apprentices.  Not everyone can or needs to go to college.  We need to get apprentices out there also.  I am aware that work is ongoing in that area with a suite of measures but we need to get it done quickly to see the benefits of it.<\/p><p> With regard to Covid, we are coming to a stage now where we will have a cost in repairing our health and not just the system.  I refer in particular to mental health and to the issues around disabilities.  We must also deal with hospital infrastructure where it has proven to be deficient through Covid.  An investment, not tokenism, will be required in people's well-being.  I received a paper from Deputy MacSharry this morning.  The Deputy is looking for mental health services to have 15% of the overall health budget.  He is right.  We need to invest in mental health services now and not wait until the problem gets worse.  While mental health or disability services are matters we talk about, and in respect of which we give solace, we do not always take effective measures quickly enough to actually repair them.<\/p><p> I have said a lot already.  The final thing I will say is that when it comes to how we budget, we must consider the new ways of working.  People will be working remotely and people will have blended working arrangements.  There will be a cost involved in that in the context of societal adjustment.  There will be a lot of benefits also and we must look at how we can factor this into the budget and into Government policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021071500002#G00700","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>There is about a minute left in the Deputy's slot for a reply.

I have heard what the Deputy said about the public spending code.  It is there to protect the interests of taxpayers.  It kept under review.  Significant changes were made in 2019.  It is important that we have safeguards in place because in general, the better the homework is done prior to a project turning a sod the likelihood is improved of fewer problems later on.  This is important, and a point worth making.  I am introducing reforms through the setting up of a major project advisory group, which will advise my Department and others about the efficient delivery of infrastructure projects.  I am also setting up a panel of experts to try to guide sponsoring bodies, Departments and other public bodies through the system in as seamless a way as possible.<\/p> <p>  The safeguards are there to protect both the interests of taxpayers and public money.  We all know that it can go badly wrong if stages are skipped.  I will take on board and examine the points made by Deputy Canney.  The Deputy made a number of points on the planning system.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, brought before the Cabinet in recent days a number of proposals to improve the planning system through the replacement of the strategic housing development process with a new process that involves certain stages that are time bound.  The imposition of time limits is important.<\/p> <p>  We made a very significant health investment in budget 2021.  We are committed to the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  This involves significant public investment over the next years, including reforms such as the delivery of a new public-only consultant Sl&aacute;intecare contract.  It will be very important.<\/p> <p>  We are very conscious of the impact of inflation on construction.  We are monitoring this very closely.  The tools the Government has at its disposal are limited because many of the factors are external in nature, such as those relating to supply chains, shortages of products, the impact of Brexit and so on.  The Office of Government Procurement is doing a lot of work in monitoring the impact of this and putting measures in place to mitigate the impact.  I will be bringing a memorandum to Government on this issue very shortly.<\/p> <p>  I reassure the Deputy that the objective of achieving balanced regional development will be core to the national development plan, which is a subset of Project Ireland 2040.  There will be very significant opportunities for the regions in the NDP.  The Deputy has touched on the remote working and blended working that we are likely to see in the future.  I have agreed a policy statement from Government with regard to moving towards blended working across the Civil Service.  I expect this will also happen across the wider public service.  This will give rise to many opportunities.<\/p><p>There will also be funding through the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF.  We will have approximately &euro;1 billion in respect of the PEACE PLUS programme, which will not just be for Northern Ireland but the Border counties as well.  I expect, therefore, there will be much opportunity and investment available for the regions over the next number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021071500002#H00300","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for their time and attention this morning after such a particularly late meeting last night.

We must be very careful about how we go about reducing the deficit.  Interestingly, the position as enunciated in the summer economic statement differs greatly from that set out in the stability programme update, SPU, which was published only a few short weeks ago.

Would the Minister for Finance agree with the European Fiscal Board when it said that a profound reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is a must?  My view and that of the Labour Party's political grouping in the European Parliament is that the EU fiscal rules are to a degree anachronistic.  They belong to another time and need to be reformed.  In fact, these rules could end up holding European economic development back if we are to stick with them and not reform them.  The Minister might apprise the members of any developments, in a European context, around any possible reform of those rules over the next couple of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021071500002#J00500","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Nash.

I differ somewhat from Professor Thygesen and the assessment of the fiscal advisory board.  I believe some changes and reforms will happen but the rules have already demonstrated that flexibility is possible when the economic circumstances merit it.  That has been proven by what we have been able to do over the past two years.

It is my view, which I have spoken about quite widely, that there is an inevitability of changes to Pillar 2.  While I may not necessarily agree with them, I understand the reasons the Minister is holding to the defence he has made of Ireland's position.  I firmly believe we have nothing to fear, however, if it is a case we move to a 15% corporation tax rate.  It will give some certainty and it is debatable about whether it will be permitted to fall.  In that context and especially around the review process he has committed to undertake over the next period, will the Minister apprise me a little on the terms of reference for that review and provide information on the potential impact of the 15% rate on Ireland, our Exchequer and business in this country?  It would be very useful if it was framed and included in those terms of reference.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask the Minister a question related to that.  Today and previously, he has gone on record as stating very clearly that corporation tax reforms will impact the Exchequer to the tune of approximately &euro;2 billion per year going forward over the next short period.  Is it his assessment that this &euro;2 billion impact will be exclusively around the reforms we have already signed up to in the context of Pillar 1 or does that include any anticipated change we may sign up to around Pillar 2?

We have not done any further analysis.  The reason for this is that the outcome of the OECD process is not clear at the moment.  That is why I cannot sign up to it.  What I mean by that is, if the Deputy looks at the figures he has used at the moment, very respectfully, it is not saying an agreement of 15% is on offer  It is not saying, for example, that what is on offer is a precise agreement regarding what base of taxing activity will happen here in Ireland.  It is saying with regard to these things that it is at least.  It is saying, therefore, it could be these figures or it could be higher.  That lack of certainty means I am convinced Ireland cannot be part of this agreement.  I am equally clear, however, that we want to remain within the process and see if we can influence it.  We must do that in good faith, however.  We have to do that cognisant, for example, that we are engaging with the United States of America, which is a very good friend, ally and partner of Ireland.  Because of that lack of certainty, however, we cannot update our revenue forecasts because we do not have enough information available with which to forecast the revenue impact.  It is for that reason there is not an update.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question about the terms of reference.  I am actually signing them off in the next day or so.  They will not come as a surprise to the Deputy.  It is about asking the business, political and NGO communities here in Ireland to give us an assessment of these different strands of what we know at the moment.  We look at the two strands individually and then we look at them collectively.  There will not be too much in the terms of reference that will come as a surprise to the Deputy.

Looking ahead to Covid-related expenditure in 2022, we made provision in the stability programme update which we published in April for expenditure of &euro;4 billion.  Some &euro;2.5 billion is for different Departments since there will be continued costs in health, for example, for the vaccination programme, continued costs in education for the remainder of the academic year, and continued supports in areas such as public transport.  We also provided &euro;1.5 billion for what we call automatic stabilisers.  In effect, it is for the provision of income supports for people who may continue to need to rely on the State for income if they are not in a position to return to work.  We are going further than that in the summer economic statement and providing a further &euro;2.8 billion as a contingency, which we can use for income supports, to meet costs that arise in Departments and to address any risks that will emerge in the labour market with the number people returning work.  We have made steady progress in tackling this virus, notwithstanding the risk of the Delta variant.  The vaccination programme is proving to be highly effective.  In the next weeks, the level of coverage will be very high indeed across the eligible adult population.  We believe that will enable us to fulfil the commitments that we have made and that, all going well, the assumptions will prove to be correct.  There are always risks with a global pandemic and none of us can be certain.  What we have set out in the summer economic statement represents our best judgment.<\/p> <p>  Regarding balanced regional development, I reiterate the points that I made to Deputy Canney earlier.  There are significant opportunities in the revised national development plan, which we will bring forward shortly.  It is a key priority for Government.

Under Project Ireland 2040, we expect the bulk of the growth to be outside Dublin over the period to 2040.<\/p> <p>  On the capital envelope, the figures that we set out in the summer economic statement represent the overall capital figures for each year.

I have two brief questions.  The first is for the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  Page 29 of the summer economic statement states that because of developments with the OECD, there could possibly be lower corporation tax receipts.  It states, \"The Department of Finance&rsquo;s central estimate is that revenues from this source could be around &euro;2 billion lower over the short to medium-term; however, there remains considerable uncertainty with the possibility that the overall impact could be even larger.\"  The OECD is in pillar 1 and pillar 2.  Is the &euro;2 billion an estimate for pillar 1, pillar 2, or both?  The Ministers indicated that they are going for public consultation about what is happening in the OECD.  Is that currently under way or is it about to get under way?  That is a good initiative.  Within the OECD's proposals, if the rate is 15%, does it apply for a period of time?  How long is that period?  Is there a mechanism whereby a principle is signed up to that can be revisited in a number of years, is it a rolling matter, or is it looked at fresh every time?  I am interested in clarity about the process more than anything else.  The public consultation is a welcome, positive step.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the Minister, Deputy McGrath.  Throughout the document are references to the public debt being high.  Page 31 states that the level of debt between 2020 and 2025 will go up by nearly &euro;64 billion, from &euro;218.2 billion to &euro;281.7 billion.  We will be at nearly &euro;250 billion by 2022.  It is below the old measure of 60% of the debt to GDP ratio.  Is that sustainable?  It is a high debt level.  Where does the Minister see challenges with it?  What is his overall perspective on it?  It is commentary repeated throughout the economic statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021071500002#K00400","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":214,"content":"<p>The revenue forecasting that we have done so far has mainly focused on the reallocation of taxing rights.

He has rightly highlighted what will be one of the main legacies of the Covid crisis, that is, a significantly elevated level of public debt from a pre-Covid level of around &euro;200 billion, rising to around &euro;280 billion by 2025.  I would make the point that despite that significant increase in public debt, the cost of servicing that debt has fallen.  The annual interest bill stands at around &euro;3.5 billion per annum, which is significantly below where it was projected to be because of the historic low interest rates.  The average interest rate across the portfolio is of the order of 1.6%.  The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, has done an enormous amount of work to reprofile the Irish debt to take maximum advantage of the benign borrowing conditions that are there and which will not remain in place indefinitely.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy will see on page 28 of the document in figure 16a, the interest to revenue ratio has fallen considerably over recent years.  If the Deputy looks at page 27, table 3, the ratio of debt as a percentage of GNI* remains quite steady and falls modestly over the period.  All of this underlines the importance of this framework and of Government agreeing to and sticking to it over the next number of years because it is undoubtedly the case that the scale of the increase in the nominal debt increases risk.  It is not risk free so we have to ensure that we remain within this framework, meet the milestones within it, make steady progress in unwinding the Covid related expenditure, support the economic recovery and reduce the deficit in a gradual way in line with the forecast we have set out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021071500002#L00800","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I thank the Ministers.

A significant amount of progress has been made in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the overall budget position for the Department of Health and the HSE, as the Deputy knows, we provided an extra &euro;4 billion in budget 2021 for health.  Broadly speaking, that was split into two halves with about half of it for new measures and the protection of existing levels of service.  The other half of around &euro;2 billion, which was directly related to the cost of Covid, included the testing and tracing system, the vaccination programme, personal protective equipment, PPE, etc.<\/p> <p>  I had a meeting earlier this week with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and his team.  It was a mid-year review on how things are going across health and on implementing all of the key objectives we set in the budget last year.  While Covid has had an enormous impact - and that has been compounded by the cyberattack - a lot of progress is being made on the reform side.  For example, the Department of Health and the HSE are significantly increasing the permanent bed capacity in our public health system, which was a significant element of the funding we provided in budget 2021 for new measures.  We provided about &euro;1.25 billion for a significant implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and they are making a lot of progress in that regard, notwithstanding the enormous challenges they have faced.  They are determined to reinstate non-Covid healthcare as quickly as possible.  We also discussed their progress in the ambitious recruitment programme we have in place across health.  For example, we gave sanction for an increase in the workforce across health from pre-Covid levels to the end of 2021 of in the region of 16,000 extra people, which is a massive investment by the State to improve our health system into the future.<\/p> <p>  We have to learn the lessons from Covid and we need to implement Sl&aacute;intecare, which is the future.

I notice that next year the difference in capital is only &euro;800 million over what the SPU had projected.  We are all aware that it took additional time for this summer economic statement to come out.  There appears to have been a squabble in relation to this.  The reality is that people of my generation are locked out of housing given the huge rents.  It is the view of so many people that they will never be able to afford to buy their own home.  That &euro;800 million does not go far enough.  I assume some of that money is going to housing and that some of it is going to climate.<\/p> <p>  It is not just myself and my colleagues who are talking about the housing crisis and the amount of money that needs to be spent on housing.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, said that it needs to be doubled.  At the same time, there is a tax measure of &euro;0.5 billion.

To be fair, she should reserve judgment until she sees the housing strategy, Housing for All.  There is an increase in the SES in the underlying core capital from 2021 to 2022 of &euro;1.1 billion.  In addition, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, is looking at all other possible sources of funding and investment.  This includes, for example, non-Exchequer investment and the role that the Land Development Agency, LDA, can play.  As the Deputy knows, the LDA has the capacity to borrow and leverage the investment it will get from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  The Deputy should reserve overall judgment until she sees the Housing for All plan which will be ambitious.  The real issue and focus has to be on delivery.  Covid-19 has had a dramatic impact on output, both last year and this year.  We get the scale of the housing crisis, and the fact that so many people are unable to even aspire to home ownership.

It noted that the corporation tax policy may be a less powerful tool in winning new investment and as such there will need to be a refocusing on cost competitiveness.

Obviously, because we are in the eurozone, we cannot change interest rates to boost competitiveness and we cannot devalue our currency.  I do not suggest that we should; I am just stating the reality.  Can the Minister clarify what he means by &ldquo;cost competitiveness&rdquo;?  I hope it is not a suggestion in regard to labour costs because that would mean that the focus would be on internal devaluation as in the wake of the last crisis.

I thank the Chair for recognising what has happened in Germany and the loss of life there.  When I say that Brussels is grey and rainy this morning, it is an understatement.  There have been very unusual weather patterns across the Continent.  In Canada there are extreme forest fires.  Maybe we will touch on the big subject of climate change in our conversations.<br\/><br\/>As the committee knows, my portfolio is financial services and it covers quite a broad range of policy areas.  However, I am not long gone from being a Member of the European Parliament, so I come to this role with the parliamentary perspective.  As First Vice-President, I was charged with engaging with national parliaments and I chaired many discussions with the national parliaments across the Union, which is something we need to do more of.  My successor in the role is also deeply engaged, particularly now as we look towards the future and a conference on the future of Europe.  National parliaments have a key role to play and no doubt this committee will do just that.  <br\/><br\/>We are emerging, although not fully, from a pandemic that no one was prepared for.  Those of us in the developed world should hang our heads in shame that we were not prepared for a global pandemic.  We have had to catch up very quickly in terms of investment in public health.  Equally, businesses have been so badly impacted by the pandemic that the old saying that health is wealth is absolutely true.  In fact, some of the learnings from Covid-19 will feed into our discussions around climate change and the need for the financial system and corporates to move towards sustainability.  In the past few businesses would have thought about investment in public health as being an important contributor to their bottom line and to their financial well-being.  Whereas today businesses, large or small, know that public health measures have impacted, in some cases severely, and, in many cases, businesses may not reopen.  The consequences of being vulnerable and not being resilient are being felt right across the system.  Across Europe, both within member states and between member states, the impact of Covid-19 has been different, in particular in those countries that rely heavily on tourism and hospitality.  The discussion in Ireland is very strong at the moment.  <br\/><br\/>There was a difficult start with our vaccination roll-out.  However, Europe should be proud of what we have achieved despite that difficult beginning.  We have managed to export significant quantities of our production of vaccines from the EU to more than 90 countries.  We are the only bloc to have done that.  Others have put up barriers to the export of vaccines.  I acknowledge the role of the President of the European Commission, President Ursula von der Leyen.  She announced at the weekend that we have produced and delivered enough vaccines to cover at least 70% of the adult population.  That is very significant.  I compliment Ireland, the HSE and the Government for its roll-out of this campaign, which is regarded as one of the great successes.  This is good because it will allow us reopen, but we are all conscious that new variants exist and more could happen.  My sense is that we will be living with Covid-19, and learning as we go along.<br\/><br\/>Let me speak briefly about the recovery, because we are looking to this as well.  One of the things that we prioritised was to make sure that the banks could continue to lend to businesses and citizens, so as much flexibilities as possible were brought into the system to accommodate that requirement.  Equally, the fiscal supports that governments have provided, and monetary policy from the ECB, have both helped the banks continue to lend to the real economy.  It is noteworthy that bankruptcies have declined during the pandemic.  This is probably an indication that some supports are masking problems.  We may see an increase in this problem as we come through the recovery.  When we launched our non-performing loans strategy last December, I said it was really important for lenders and borrowers to talk early to see if there can be a restructuring or a situation where viable businesses that are vulnerable at the moment because of being closed can actually survive.  That is a very important conversation happening across the member states.<br\/><br\/>In addition we have this Next Generation EU, with &euro;750 billion being borrowed from the marketplace.  So far, when we have gone to the marketplace as the European Union there is an avalanche of investors wanting to provide the finance towards our recovery, because of the stability of the Union.  Equally, we are determined that the money is invested in the future.  We do not want to invest to recreate the past or the <i>status quo<\/i>.  We have to ensure that a significant part of the money is used for the green and for the digital transition.  Indeed, we may discuss that in more detail.<br\/><br\/>My role is in financial stability, so anything that impinges on that is something that I have to be mindful of.  I am also very conscious that the world is changing and the world of finance is utterly changing.  For example, Covid-19 has accelerated digital transactions.  Cash is not being used as much, but it is still important that people can use cash.  We are seeing a big increase in the number of innovative FinTechs providing services traditionally provided by banks.  I am having a discussion regarding an ideas forum on what that means for the future.  Many central banks, including the ECB, are looking at digital currencies, and we are slowly rolling out that process of trying to navigate what it might mean for the financial system.<br\/><br\/>At the global level, I refer to the work I do around sustainable finance, which is greening the financial system, to invest in green.  This week I had very good discussions with Ms Yellen, Secretary of the US Treasury, during her trip to Brussels.  The work Europe is doing around climate change, environmental degradation, and making the finance flow towards sustainability, is leading at global level.  What we need to do is make sure that other countries are with us on that journey, because Europe alone will not tackle climate change.  If we look to what is happening around the world in terms of weather events, people know there is something there that we need to tackle.  <br\/><br\/>Yesterday we launched quite a significant package, Fit for 55, to achieve a reduction in emissions by 2030 by that very ambitious 55%.  There is much activity, and the financial system, is absolutely key to us achieving those very ambitious targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021071500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Thank you Commissioner.

She mentioned the vaccine roll-out which has been incredibly successful.  However, the original invitation to her to speak to the committee came in the context of the triggering of Article 16 back on 29 January 2021.  I know the European Commission wants to move on from that and pretend that it almost did not happen but, as the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, we need an understanding that it will not happen again in the manner that it happened in that the Irish Government and the Irish State were blind-sided.  The consequences of that decision are still being felt today on the island.  Despite the enormous work done by the European Commission, the Parliament and all the institutions in defending our island's interests during Brexit, that couple of hours of madness undermined much of that work.  We need an understanding that there are new procedures in place to ensure that such a thing will never happen again and that where our strategic interests are central, the Irish Government will be centrally involved.  As the Irish nominee to the Commission, what has the Commissioner changed in terms of her ways of working to ensure that does not happen again and that we are not blind-sided?<\/p> <p>  In regard to the Commissioner's role, there is an area around the financial equivalence side of Brexit.  I suspect we are going to move from sausages to financial services very quickly.  The Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said recently that on equivalence, nothing has moved forward.  Can the Commissioner give us an update from her perspective of where we are in negotiations on financial equivalence?  I do not want the Commissioner to show me the poker cards, but to give me a sense of her vision for the EU's financial markets post-Brexit and post the city of London not being part of the EU.   Are there opportunities for Ireland in that?<\/p> <p>  In regard to the banks, the Chairman and I are dealing with a situation which the Commissioner will be familiar with from her parliamentary days, namely, pyrite in blocks and mica.  It speaks to building defects, and not just in Ireland.<\/p><p>We see the whole issue of cladding in England.  I imagine there are similar issues across Europe.  They all have an impact on banks' balance sheets because banks have invested in homes and commercial properties.  Is the issue of building defects on the Commissioner's radar across the European Union with respect to its potential impact on the balance sheets of banks?<\/p><p> To move to the climate side of things, I will refer to the human impact of these weather events we have been referring to this morning.  We have seen this in Germany.  The Chairman has referred to that.  It is appalling.  There will also be an impact on the physical buildings and capital assets that are used as collateral by our financial institutions.  At what stage does the Commissioner believe there will be an awakening as to this potential impact?<\/p><p> On the climate agenda, does the Commissioner get the sense that the financial companies and institutions around Europe are engaged in respect of this matter?  There is a phrase used.  I am sorry; my brain is not fully working yet.  I believe the term used is \"greenwashing\".  Is it a question of greenwashing on the part of the financial services industry?  Are these companies just seeking to be seen to be doing something and to tick the boxes or are they actually going to engage?  The Commissioner mentioned digital currency.  We know the impact this has on, for example, electricity usage which, in turn, has all sorts of consequences for our climate.  Does the Commissioner get the sense that the financial institutions see this as a serious issue and are genuinely interested in truly green products or are they greenwashing?  If they are greenwashing, what is she going to do about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021071500002#B00400","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I would like to be associated with Deputy Calleary's point regarding mica.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021071500002#C00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626303600,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Calleary very much.  He made five points.  I will try to answer them in the order in which he raised them.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the issue of Article 16, the invitation from the committee to be here was sent last December.  We had difficulty finding time.  On the Deputy's specific point on what happened and ensuring that it will not happen again, I have been very public about what happened.  It certainly will not happen again.  The Deputy should acknowledge the words of the President of the European Commission, Dr. Ursula von der Leyen, her apology and her commitment to Northern Ireland and to the full implementation of the protocol.  The idea that this would have consequences was accurate at the time but we should not allow the past to blur the situation today or to be used inappropriately by those who might have other ideas as to what should happen in implementing the protocol on Northern Ireland.  The Deputy asked me a direct question.  I can give him absolute guarantees with regard to the system in place.  There is now an onerous system regarding issues relating to Northern Ireland and Ireland.  There are many issues that will impact on Northern Ireland in our normal day's work.  We in the Cabinet are very focused on that.<\/p> <p>  I wish the United Kingdom would apologise for its unilateral action.  We have never seen such an apology.  There should be an acknowledgement that the President of the European Commission and my colleague, Vice President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, whom the Deputy knows very well, reached out to Northern Ireland and gave an abject apology in the week after the Article 16 issue arose.  That should be accepted for what it is.  I can give the Deputy guarantees that this will not happen again.  I am sure that, in politics, all of us have seen things happen that should not have but, if people are big enough to apologise and if that apology is accepted, we should move on, wiser to what happened and making sure that it does not recur in the future.  I am a little worried that our UK friends bring this up all the time.  I do not believe we should help them in their case because they can do that quite strongly themselves.  It is inappropriate at this stage.  This is now the month of July.  Brexit happened on 1 January.  Article 16 was not triggered but there was an interim of a few hours before that was clarified.  We have learned from that, as we all should when errors are made.  I again hope that we will not ignite a fire that should not exist and allow others to use, in a very inappropriate way, a mistake that was made, acknowledged and apologised for.<\/p> <p>  To move on to the area of financial services, it may be useful to say that financial services do not form part of the trade agreement, as colleagues will be aware.  There is no formal negotiation around financial services.  What we did before 1 January was to grant equivalence in a small number of areas where doing so was in our interest.  That is what equivalence is.  It is interesting that, just before 1 January, the United Kingdom granted equivalence on 28 areas of the financial system, although not to the European Union but to the EEA.  That is significant.  I am not sure how the Deputy would read that.  The Deputy asked me about what is happening in respect of the negotiations.  There are no negotiations on financial services.  What we are doing, and the UK has done likewise, is making sure that the financial system that Europe relies on post Brexit is stable.  We are looking to see where our interests will lie in the future.  We have agreed a technical memorandum as to how we will work with the United Kingdom.  These are technical discussions.  We have the same sorts of agreements with the US and they work really well.  It is a forum where we can discuss regulatory issues because there will be common issues which we need to discuss.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to equivalence, we have granted equivalence to the one area of these central counterparties, CCPs, in the London system which Europe relies on until June of next year.  We are now looking at what will happen for the future.  We have made no final decision on that but we will be looking at it from the point of view of what is in the best interests of the financial stability of the European Union.  When we get down to having regular engagement with the United Kingdom, as we do with the US, there will be global issues on which we will have to have conversations.  These may include digitalisation or other parts of the system which are changing.  I hope we get to that stage.  We do not have any poker cards.  The situation is not quite the same as that which obtained during the trade negotiations because it has been very clear from the outset that finance was not part of the conversation.<\/p> <p>  For the European Union, this means that there will not be one main financial centre.  London was the main financial centre for the European Union but it is now outside the Union.  From my experience, I have come to the view that we will see different centres emerge for different services.  Whether in Frankfurt, Dublin or Amsterdam, we will see these developing.  There are opportunities in this area for many member states.  Up until Brexit, it was very appropriate to have a central place like London.  Covid has shown us that it is not always necessary to have one location.  We now know that people can work from all sorts of places once the technology exists.  I cannot stress enough that the role I play here in the college is to make sure that the financial system is stable and that we can weather not only the good weather, but the bad days.  As I look out my window here in Brussels, it is pretty grim and pretty grey with heavy rain.  On the financial side, that is the objective.  There are no specific timelines or deadlines we have to do things by.  I am listening to the comments of the chancellor and others in the financial system.  They believe they can continue to serve us with a lot of the infrastructure.  We have to see whether that is in our interests.  I am sure the UK is taking the same view.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Deputy's questions on banks, I will refer first to the broad question of climate risks and the financial system.  Climate risks will cause financial instability if they are not addressed.  That is a fact.  We see that from all of the regulators.  We know that this will be the case.  It speaks very much to the Deputy's point.  You can have an investment portfolio of buildings which might be subject to flooding or which might be just wiped out, as we saw on the Continent.  Your balance sheet will be fairly skewed if this happens to a significant degree.  I draw the Deputy's attention to a strategy, which I can share with the Cathaoirleach, that we launched just last week.  It relates to financing the transition.  One of the four pillars relates to the resilience of the financial system.  The Deputy asked me if the financial system is aware of all of this or whether greenwashing is taking place.  I have been here for approximately nine months and it is very clear to me that the financial system gets it now.  Those involved understand that climate change is a risk for them and for their bottom lines, and that they have to act.  When you hear the big asset managers who have not traditionally supported climate action and so on speaking to both their boards and their shareholders about what they need to do for the future and see them seeking to invest in sustainability, it is clear that they get the message.  They can see that the consequences for their bottom lines will be really severe.  We have asked the supervisory authorities here to look at the regulatory implications of taking climate into account, which we have to do.<\/p><p>The ECB is also looking at this.  It may speak to the point I made in my opening remarks that business used to divide itself from health in the sense that one never thought the other would impact on it in the way it has.  Business now realises that nature hits it and it hits nature.  There is what we call in Europe a double materiality concept.  In terms of sustainability, we are making sure that corporate entities report on their impact on climate and the impact of climate change on them, and that the financial system reports on what it is doing around sustainable investments.<\/p><p> We are trying very hard to avoid the disaster that would be greenwashing.  We have had a good bit of it up to now because there are many, but no clear, standards.  We have issued a directive on corporate sustainability reporting.  When that is in place, it will give clarity to the corporate world and the financial system.<\/p><p> The only way to avoid any sort of washing, in particular greenwashing, is to check.  We will insist on assurances.  Those who carry out audits and those involved in sustainability reporting will have to give assurances to the system that what they are saying is what they are actually doing.  If they do not do what they are saying, penalties will apply.  We are using a carrot-and-stick approach.  We are making sure there is transparency so that investors, whether small or large, know what they are investing in and their investment requirements as individuals or pension funds are met because they have access to this information.  The point the Deputy raised is very important.<\/p><p> As to the specifics around mica and pyrite, it is on my radar because I represented the areas that are impacted by this.  Our hearts would go out to people whose homes are crumbling.  It has not been brought to my attention in terms of the financial system, but following the intervention of the Deputy, I will make an inquiry and perhaps reply to him separately around that.  He can bring it to the attention of colleagues.<\/p><p> We are awake to the impacts of climate change.  The financial system is now on board and it is our duty to make sure it stays on board.  We also need to stop investing in what is not sustainable.  That is perhaps another part of our conversation.  It may arise later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021071500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for the comprehensive response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021071500002#D00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for her very comprehensive overview of the issues affecting the European Commission at this time.  She has responsibility for sanctions and plays a role in the preparation and monitoring of sanctions.  That brings me to the situation in Belarus and the awful regime of Alexander Lukashenko, involving political prisoners, the suppression of human rights and so on.  The Belarusian opposition leader is having a very successful trip to Ireland as we speak and has been very well received by many people.<\/p><p>I refer to the sanctions being imposed on Belarus.  Sanctions were imposed on 78 individuals and eight entities, as well as seven economic sectors.  How are they going?  Is there any feedback on the effect they are having on the Belarusian regime?  Is there scope for more sanctions?  What kind of extra sanctions or pressure can be brought to bear on the regime?  This follows the outrageous hijacking of the Ryanair plane and the incarceration of Roman Protasevich and his partner.  I am interested in hearing what the Commissioner has to say about that.<\/p><p>The Commissioner did not deal with this in her opening statement, and I know it is not part of her brief, but I would like her to comment on rule of law issues generally and the position in Hungary.  In a report published yesterday it was stated the European Commission is to launch a legal action against Hungary today in response to a law seen as discriminating against LGBTQ citizens.  The Dutch Prime Minister has gone so far as to say that Hungary should leave the EU.  European values are under threat in Hungary, in particular, as well as in other countries.  Is there a real commitment by the Commission and the other institutions to deal with this issue or does the <i>realpolitik<\/i>of the European Council mean it is never effectively addressed?<\/p><p>  I refer specifically to the EU recovery and resilience facility.  Hungary's application for &euro;7.2 billion from that fund still has not been agreed.  Is that due to the content of the plan it has submitted or rule of law issues?  In summary, can real sanctions be imposed on these states?<\/p><p>I want to throw in a bit of a hand grenade regarding the OECD moves in respect of global corporate taxation.  Does the Commissioner believe the OECD will reach agreement on the 15% corporate tax rate and the other measures proposed?  Does she think Ireland should sign up to that?  If the OECD does not come to an agreement, is the EU willing to press ahead with our own arrangements to deal with this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021071500002#D00300","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626303600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I will try to deal with them in the order in which they were asked.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy takes a particular interest in sanctions, an important issue.  What happened with the Ryanair flight shocked us and perhaps brought to global attention what is happening in Belarus, and no harm that it does.  My role in sanctions is threefold.  I oversee their drafting, guide their implementation and monitor them to make sure they are fully implemented by member states.<\/p> <p>  On Belarus, the Deputy saw what happened.  There was quite a strong reaction and unanimity at EU level that this was an issue that had to be tackled and addressed.  The sanctions were adopted in record time.  On 4 June, the EU adopted a ban on aircraft flying over the airspace.  On 21 June, we adopted the additional designations and the Deputy mentioned the people and entities involved.<\/p> <p>  On his question on the impact of sanctions, I would not be able to say they are having a specific impact, but I think they are.  I daresay the Belarusian authorities will not tell us how severe the impact is, but we are carefully monitoring the situation.<\/p> <p>  The shock of what happened has catapulted concerns around what is happening in the region.  The whole idea of sanctions is a difficult area of policy.  They target those who are up to no good.  In some ways, this is a sensitive issue.  We have to try to avoid impacting those who are not part of the problem.  The humanitarian side of sanction implementation is something we have to be very mindful of, but it is fair to say the immediate response, the unanimity around that response and the targeting of citizens and entities was real and strong.  The Council will consider this again and, if needs be, examine whether to impose more sanctions on the regime until it realises democracy matters and countries cannot interfere in flights that citizens are on without getting some reaction to that.<\/p> <p>  On the rule of law, the Deputy asked whether there is real commitment, and I will answer that very strongly.  I am sure he has listened to the President of the Commission speaking about rule of law issues, Hungary and recent events.  She leads us in our total commitment to making sure the rule of law and values are respected and we use whatever instruments we can to insist this happens.  I want to be very clear on that.<\/p> <p>  I understand what one leader said about Hungary.  The Council meeting was particularly emotional, and rightly so, because what Hungary was and is doing is completely against the rights of individuals and the things we hold dear.  We have to do whatever we can to make sure any member state that does that, in particular Hungary, is aware this is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked specifically whether there is a link with the recovery plan.  I cannot give him a definitive answer.  It may well be the plan is still going through the scrutiny process because, as he knows, some plans were submitted early and approved while others remain to be approved.  If I have more clarity, I can reply to him separately on that.<\/p><p>The real sanction comes through money.  We have to use all the tools available to us to insist members of the European Union abide by the customs, laws and values of the union.  Members cannot pick and choose or discriminate.  The European Union, for all its difficulties over time, has been strong on our freedoms, including freedom to move and freedom of speech.  Non-discrimination is a core element of our values.  Whatever we need to do to make sure countries comply with that will be done.<\/p><p> The hand grenade remark is worrying.  Let us stand back from the discussion around tax.  Ireland feels in a particular position but I take a different view and took such a view in the European Parliament.  The world is changing on two fronts.  First, citizens are wondering whether big companies pay a fair share of tax.  The sense is they do not because they can avoid paying a fair share.  Second, digitalisation means things are more mobile.  Where countries are located may be different from the markets they serve.  The European Union fully supports the work of the OECD.  There is a view it has been more rapid than might have been the case had there not been a different Administration in the United States.  The Biden Administration has been to the fore in trying to have this global agreement.<\/p><p> Regarding the details, my colleague, Paolo Gentiloni, a happy Italian this week for reasons we all know, is deeply involved in all this.  He would like to see the European Union collectively agree to what the OECD is working towards.  There are three members states concerned, namely, the member state I know best, Estonia and Hungary.  I am reading various reports and have listened to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, discuss this.  It is not clear yet whether these details will get through the US Congress and what the details are.  While the European Union would have to move as one rather than as some, there is an opening to address some of the concerns of those who have not signed up to the agreement yet.<\/p><p> It is significant that there is now a realisation that those big earning companies have a requirement to pay tax at a certain level and that it is apportioned to where the services are delivered.  That has consequences for the member state I know best and I have been reading about those.  A wider discussion may be required about peripheral countries' economic model for the future.<\/p><p> I have listened to commentary about undue pressure being put on Ireland.  I do not see that as the case.  There is an understanding of Ireland's perspective but also a hope and expectation Ireland will join with the rest of the European Union if a global agreement comes into play.  We should all hope it does.  If it does not, it shows multilateralism has not worked.  With the Biden Administration back around the table on many issues, including finance and climate, there is a hope that multilateralism is back in vogue.  We will not solve any of our problems without that.  While it is a concern in Ireland, at the broader level the European Union is keen that there be a global agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021071500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McGuinness for her presentation and her presence, albeit virtually.  I hope she gets home in the coming weeks, if feasible and work allows among everything else.<\/p><p>I want to go back to a couple of the answers and questions from the first session with Deputy Calleary to tease out a couple of issues further.  The first relates to the next steps of the protocol.  Ms McGuinness rightly referred to the worrying unilateral actions taken by the British Government.  A couple of weeks ago, the grace period was extended and a bit of hope - I hope it was not false hope - was brought back that we might be able to get a workable solution in the medium term.  That hope is fading rapidly due to the actions of the British Government and, more important, the statements by their key implementer, Lord Frost, in his joint opinion piece in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>and various responses he has given to questions in the House of Lords and at committee meetings.<\/p><p>My major concern is there will be further unilateral action by the United Kingdom.  If that is the case, what preparations have been made by the European Commission?  Commissioner &Scaron;efovi, who appeared before this committee, has made references to the scope for further legal action and retaliatory measures.  Will Ms McGuinness elaborate on that suite of options?  None of us wants them to be needed but we need to be frank that there is a worrying mindset and attitude among certain members of the British Government.<\/p><p>It goes to the protocol and the outworkings of it on this island.  We are, thankfully, starting to see in the past week a few people be more vocal about the upsides and possibilities of the protocol.  Much credit must go to the SDLP MLA for Belfast South, Matthew O'Toole, who has been consistent in talking about the opportunities provided for Northern Ireland and the whole island by the protocol.  We are starting to see that from business leaders and other non-political actors in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>I hope we have seen some of the political rhetoric around the protocol dampened down because it was getting to a dangerous stage and being used and abused by certain political actors.  Any sign of flexibility from the European Commission was being jumped on and we saw all manner of accusations made against the European Commission and the Irish Government which were false, bogus and unnecessary.  What role can the European Commission play?<\/p><p>It was welcome to see Commissioner &Scaron;efovi appear before the executive committee in Stormont and to see continued outreach by the European Commission and by Ms McGuinness, as the Commissioner who knows Northern Ireland best.  It was her near neighbour, once upon a time.  Many people asked how we retain a Northern Irish voice in the European decision-making process and how, in Ireland and working in partnership with Ms McGuinness, her colleagues and wider European figures, we play a substantive role in Northern Ireland and make sure the people of Northern Ireland feel their voices are being heard and they have an element of influence.<\/p><p>I move on to a wider Brexit point.  Deputy Calleary focused on financial services and the ongoing negotiations.  We are grateful for Ms McGuinness' previous appearance before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, which I sit on.  We went around the houses on the issue at that time.  It is about looking at the growth opportunities in financial services post Brexit, particularly for member states like Ireland, related to an exodus from Great Britain or people looking to diversify.  We have seen it in other member states.  What initiatives are being taken, primarily by Ms McGuinness in her brief, to develop the financial services sector across the European Union post Brexit and to seize every opportunity?  We have said many times there is no such thing as a good Brexit but we have to take every opportunity.  There is one for growth in financial services for all EU member states post Brexit.  Within that sector, opportunities will be provided for citizens.<\/p><p>Ms McGuinness spoke before of the joint EU approach to things like mortgage provision, health insurance and motor insurance, and of how we can use Brexit as a catalyst to develop that.  How do we tailor the supports provided by the Brexit adjustment fund, of which Ireland is the largest benefactor of all member states?  We do not just look at sectors that are most negatively impacted by Brexit, such as agrifood exports into Great Britain.  We must also use that fund with the recovery and resilience package to take every opportunity.  We have seen through this troubling pandemic period that there are opportunities for certain sectors and workers in them, especially in Ireland.  We have shown a commendable level of resilience in society as a whole.  We have to encourage such resilience.<\/p><p>It goes back to the salient point that underlines everything that we are all talking about today that it is easy to criticise the EU but we do not recognise enough when the EU is playing such an important part.  With the Brexit adjustment fund, that is key.  I would be grateful to hear the Commissioner's opinion on those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021071500002#E00200","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626303600,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Richmond for a number of points but clearly around the Brexit scenario and what next, including financial services.<\/p> <p>  I will start at the very beginning here.  The United Kingdom, in these last weeks, reached out and looked for an extension of the grace periods.  Because it was requested, the European Union has given that up until the end of September as well as a number of other important offers to make implementing the protocol easier.  What has been quite shocking is the reaction from the UK side.  I was in Brussels last weekend and I listened to an interview given by the UK ambassador to Ireland.  I read the Op-Ed from Lord Frost and I thought as to whether they were listening, whether they read what the European Union has offered here, and if they had, that their response lacks any graciousness.  Worse still, it seems that the response was written before there was any acknowledgment of the strong reply from the European Union side wanting to solve problems and wanting to sit down with the United Kingdom to make sure that the protocol is implemented, that the benefits of the protocol to Northern Ireland flow towards Northern Ireland and that difficult areas are solved.  I was a little concerned when I heard the ambassador talk about medicine shortages.  This is something that European Commission Vice-President Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi has said from the outset we are addressing.  I thought it lacked grace that there was no acknowledgement of the work we have done here at EU level which begs the question as to what the United Kingdom intends to do for the future.  Based on past performance which, they say, is not always an indication of future performance, I would be afraid that it might be.  I would be concerned that after September we would be back into this, where the UK refuses to acknowledge what it signed up to in the protocol and continues to point the finger at the European Union and accuse it of all sorts of things.<\/p> <p>  I will be very clear with this committee.  Mr. &Scaron;efovi and I talk all the time about this.  My colleagues around the table were aware, for example, around sensitivities with the month of July.  I note there were big bonfires but I am relieved that there was nothing more than that.  There were the celebrations of the loyalist community around that day which is important for them but at least we did not see violence.  Europe understands that.  Mr. &Scaron;efovi was sensitive to the month of July.  The reason we were so willing to offer an extension was because we understand the sensitivities.  The committee also should know that Mr. &Scaron;efovi tried to reach out after that debacle that Deputy Calleary alluded to in January but was not helped by the UK side, to colleagues in Northern Ireland to explain and, indeed, carry that apology.<\/p> <p>  Let us look at what this means for the future.  If the United Kingdom thinks that if it persists in non-application this problem will go away, that will not be the case because this problem gets worse.  This is an international agreement and I am sure the rest of the world is watching with some interest as to how an international agreement is being regarded by the United Kingdom.  From our side, I repeat that we want it fully implemented but we also want to iron out those difficulties for citizens and businesses.  That is already being delivered on.  More can and will be done but we have to do it with the United Kingdom.  We have to do it with a United Kingdom that is open to implementing what it signed up to.  This is important.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Richmond asked in particular about what action we might take.  It is not wise at this stage to talk about retaliation.  It is not our style.  In the long run, politeness and good manners matters.  Diplomacy matters.  While people might say you should be tougher and you should perhaps give a kick to the shin which does not happen in football matches but sometimes can, it is not the right approach.  The approach we are taking to keep calm during all of this is not an easy one but it is important as a partnership of 27 countries that we stay calm, respect sensitivities in Northern Ireland and find solutions.  I would just say that plans are being made and will certainly be unrolled and revealed if we do not see co-operative implementation of the protocol.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy talked about the upside of the protocol.  What is troubling - I saw this during the Brexit referendum campaign - is there were voices that were silenced because they were afraid to speak up.  There are businesses in Northern Ireland quietly getting on with doing more business but they may not be willing to speak out because it is such a divisive issue that they are better off if they work away and increase their business under the protocol and the opportunities it would give continuously and seamlessly - access to both the EU and to the UK.  On this point, it occurred to me that was the same during the referendum campaign.  One of the saddest parts for me as a politician when I was still in the European Parliament was I would have delegations coming from Northern Ireland because the Assembly was not functioning and they had no voice at all.  Their concerns about the negotiations were not being heard and I did my best to try and raise to those concerns, indeed, as Deputy Richmond does in his work as well.  I would hope that the quiet application of business people and entrepreneurs getting on with it and finding new opportunities will tell its own story.  Frankly, headlines never do.  I was a journalist and I can say this with some clarity.  That will perhaps happen.  Yesterday Lord Frost commented he had some concerns about an increase in cross-Border trade.  I cannot understand why.  I would have thought that, as a free marketeer, a global Britain would be delighted to see an increase in trade.  It was an interesting observation.<\/p> <p>  Let me move to the wider point Deputy Richmond makes around the financial sector.  There are two areas where I have particular work to do.  One is banking union and the other capital markets union, in particular, green capital markets which I referred to in my opening remarks.  There is a huge opportunity for all member states together to development the capital markets union.  At present, we have fragmented capital markets.  We need a union of those markets.  We particularly need it now going into the recovery.  Our businesses rely too heavily on bank lending.  We need equity funding.  Indeed, we need to change our own mindsets around saving and investing.  If you look at the balance sheets of banks in Europe, and indeed in Ireland, those who are working have not been spending and there are enormous amount of savings waiting to find a home.  One of the concerns - it is a hot topic in Ireland - is our property prices.  Perhaps we think that Ireland is unique, but I spoke to finance Ministers just this week and practically every member state has this concern.  It is to do with people with cash trying to find opportunities to invest.  We need to look at that in the round to see what are the consequences.<\/p> <p>  In addition to that, we are seeing quite a high level of increase in raw material and construction costs.  We had a good debate last week in the Parliament on this that I was engaged in.  That will feed in to the work of different member states, including Ireland, around trying to build houses to house our citizens.  To answer the Deputy's point directly, there are huge opportunities in the financial system and around sustainability, but I understand the Government is already focusing on this.  We have many asset managers and funds in Ireland and there are opportunities to go that direction.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Richmond asked a question about how we tailor supports.  We will have more details around Ireland's recovery and resilience package and the Brexit adjustment fund.  In one sense, I will almost put that back to the members.  The members are best placed as elected representatives in Ireland to know where these funds should go.  I dare say that the Cathaoirleach, with his fishing constituency, will be well aware of the impacts of Brexit on fishing from coastal communities.  The money will be put to good use.<\/p> <p>  It also is important to say that the amount of money that Ireland gets recognises that we are the member state in the hot seat, if you like, most impacted by Brexit.  That continues to be the case.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, as a general remark, Brexit has been front and centre of all our minds since 2016 and before, but we have many other issues as well.  It is important that we do not lose sight of other policy areas where we have to do important work, notwithstanding that Brexit remains unfinished business.<\/p><p>I have said before, and am probably going to be blue in the face saying, that Brexit is always going to be with us because there are consequences of a major country leaving the European Union.  There are consequences around engagement at international level.  On climate change, however - and we all hope to be going to Glasgow for Conference of the Parties, COP, 26 in November - we need to work together.  In a way, Brexit is a fragmentation.  It is a fragmentation of capital markets, of people and of all the things Europe stands for.  On the other hand, the UK, Europe, the US, China and Russia all face the global challenges in the context of environment and climate issues.  The only way we will solve those challenges is collectively because if we do it individually, it just will not work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021071500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for coming before us today.  I apologise if I repeat anything anyone else has said, I had to go in and ask a question of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Given what it related to, I might just direct it to the Commissioner.  There is a particular issue for maize growers in Ireland in the context of the directive on single-use plastics.  There was an unintended consequence with some of the plastics used.  Obviously, finding alternatives is where we need to go.  In the short term, however, I am dealing with a number of farmers and contractors who have probably spent a huge amount of money on plant machinery for these particular types of oxo-degradable plastics and suchlike.  Is there something the State could look at in the form of mitigations, derogations or something of that nature?  This is in short term because alternatives would obviously be better in the long run.<\/p><p>I welcome what the Commissioner said on the idea that health is not an EU competence but that the Commission definitely got its act together.  The bulk-buying of vaccines and the solidarity involved have been shown to be the correct action.  Beyond this, however, none of us is safe until all of us are safe, to use that terrible phrase.  How engaged are we in finding a real solution?  I am not ideologically wedded to the TRIPS waiver but I have yet to see an alternative put in place that we will look to as being a real solution.  When we talk about COVAX, it is something that is probably only going to cover 20% of the population of developing countries.  I am afraid to leave some of this to the market because we can imagine where it would go.<\/p><p>Will the Commissioner give us some general indication of the conversation on the movement relating to a possible European digital tax?  Obviously, there is the whole conversation around tax harmonisation and the housing of profits in particular states.  Some of this is just the world catching up with where the tech world has been for a long time, but there are particular implications for this State.  It is about where we go from here.<\/p><p>There has already been considerable discussion on Brexit.  I welcome what the Commissioner said about businesses in the North.  It would be similar to some of the conversations I have had or what the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, said to us about dealing with unionist businessmen and farmers who are getting on with it and are just looking at solutions in respect of particular issues.  Whatever about kicking shins and throwing an occasional elbow - and occasionally they are required - the big thing is us knowing for sure that the Commission and the EU are not for moving and that the Irish protocol is here to stay.  It is about knowing that while we will look at mitigations and all the rest of it, the protocol is the only show in town.  Sometimes we think the British Government is just engaging in conversation with itself.  The problem is that it destabilises unionism and almost gives it false succour so it is dangerous, particularly at this point.<\/p><p>We have the conversation around legacy issues and the unilateral action on the part of the British Government.  From time to time, the EU has been very strong on human rights and other issues.  I wonder can it be part of this conversation, while accepting Brexit has changed things.<\/p><p>There was a motion moved in the D&aacute;il recently on recognising what is going on in Palestine, namely, <i>de facto<\/i>annexation by Israel.  We have had the conversation here about the occupied territories Bill.  I am assuming that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has started a conversation on what role the EU could play in that regard.  It is no different to what the EU is doing in respect of Belarus, that is, taking action against those who engage in international foul play, for want of a better term.  I apologise, but I have a string of questions here.<\/p><p>There is an issue, which Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi has been open to, regarding the democratic deficit that exists in the context of representation in the North.  We have citizens who are going to be impacted by EU rules but who have no voice at this point.  There are modalities being looked at which may take the form of observer status or some sort of situation that could address this deficit.  The Commissioner has already mentioned the difficulties around pricing and the supply chain problems at the minute.  That is impacting on the housing crisis we have here to a great degree.<\/p><p>I welcome that the EU is looking at the impact of investment funds, etc.  That is something which must be done.  There has probably been a change of tack across the board during the pandemic in the sense that we cannot leave everything to the market.  I assume that means there has been a change of tack in Europe, not just from the point of view of the pandemic but even onwards towards the necessity for states to take action.<\/p><p>This is my final question, and I apologise again for the number I have asked.  We have a huge issue here with insurance, specifically public liability insurance, and the lack of players in the market.  Is there, or should there be, a general audit of services such as this across Europe to see where those deficits are?  They are going to impact on the economy in general and on organisations, community centres and businesses.  It might put them out of action which will obviously have an impact on this State but also on the wider European economy.  Beyond that, we have recovery and resilience and whatever else.  Are we looking at something further in terms of fiscal stimulus into the future in order that we will avoid entering a recession following the pandemic, particularly as we are not through it yet and there are still major difficulties with the Delta variant and so forth?  I thank the Chairman and apologise again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021071500002#G00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Well done.

It is really good to hear that it is alive and well.  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s lack of sleep has not impacted on his ability to ask questions.  Fair play to him.  I will try to answer them all because they are really important questions and I thank him for them.<\/p> <p>  The issue regarding single-use plastics has been around since 2019.  As I understand it - and I hope I am correct in saying this - there are some stocks still in storage but these can be depleted.  I will certainly double-check to ensure that I have given the Deputy the correct answer.  Agriculture is near and dear to my heart.  There are many areas of the agricultural supply chain in the context of which we are going to have to look at resilience with regard to where our vulnerabilities lie, but perhaps that is a matter for another day.<\/p> <p>  Europe does not have competence in health but it needs to.  Again, the initiative by the President of the Commission pushed out the boundaries, if you like, but did it in a way that has given us positive results around protective equipment and vaccines.  The record stands despite a difficult start where many people rightly had concerns and great fears.<\/p> <p>  On COVAX, again the EU led the charge in acknowledging that even if we look at ourselves and our children it is not enough and we must look after the wider world.  That is being done at EU level.  We are pushing this strongly.  Equally the Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Ms Kyriakides, and our colleague Mr. Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market, are trying to motivate companies to invest in Africa and to construct plants.<\/p><p>There is a lot of talk about the rules around intellectual property rights, but all of that will pale into insignificance if the facilities, skills and people are not there.  We are working at that level and that is where we will see the results.<\/p><p> On the Delta variant, we should be as cautious as our public health experts are.  Around Europe, we are starting to become as concerned as Ireland is and we do not want this to get out of control again.<\/p><p> The Deputy's third point was on the digital levy.  As he knows, the proposal is not being moved forward because these OECD discussions are ongoing.  We will look to see where those discussions are in the autumn.  That might point to what will happen with the digital levy.<\/p><p> On business in Northern Ireland, I want to say clearly that I understand the sensitivities of the unionist community well.  We cannot dismiss those genuine fears and concerns.  I would hope to convince the unionist community that we negotiated in good faith with their Prime Minister.  There were other options and the Theresa May option would have avoided all of these problems, but the unionist and loyalist community did not particularly want that option so we now have the protocol.  There is an obligation and duty on the EU and the United Kingdom Government, led by Boris Johnson, to implement what has been signed up to and to stress we have found solutions to particular problems.  What troubles me is that every time we find a solution, the UK finds another problem.  That is not a good way to do business because we have to make sure the protocol is implemented fairly and in full.  I hope business will show the full value of the protocol by action rather than word.<\/p><p> On legacy issues, I am aware of the statements made and this is a sensitive issue.  I will not give a direct answer on what our role will be in that because it is a sensitive issue.  I will just express our sympathy with families that will carry these traumas to their graves.  We are all sensitive to that.<\/p><p> The foreign ministers have to agree on the issue of Palestine.  There is a conversation to be had on unanimity on this and that is something the committee might look at.<\/p><p> On the democratic deficit and the fact Northern Ireland is not represented at EU level, that is a fact of life because it is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Therefore, the voices should be coming from the UK side.  I would hope our colleagues in the European Parliament - I know the Deputy has a colleague there, as I have - would, either informally or formally, work towards having links with elected representatives in the House of Commons and in the Assembly.  In politics, it is important we talk to each other and try to listen to each other.  That is important for Northern Ireland in these difficult times.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned the supply chain problems with raw materials.  That is something to watch for because there has been an unusual disruption to the supply chains.  Timber prices have skyrocketed, for example.  I took part in the debate on this last week and one statistic was that shipping costs have gone up by 400% in some cases.  We are looking at pressures on that side of the system.<\/p><p> On insurance, I am aware of all the issues in Ireland and the work being done to get through them.  The truth is that if we had a fully fledged single market in financial services, we would not worry about having something in Ireland.  Rather, we would want to make sure we had access to the best.  We have a strong insurance sector in Ireland that services a lot of European business.  Maybe we need to broaden that out and develop it further.  If anything comes up from the Deputy's work and if there is anything he thinks I should know in my role, I am happy to get information from him in that regard.  The single market in financial services is key to resolving the issue.<\/p><p> As to the future, let us first examine what has happened already.  When Covid happened, governments responded.  Rules that were normally strictly applied were disapplied and the ECB worked to make sure there was money in the system.  No one I have spoken to in and around this House has any desire to see a cliff-edge effect.  In other words, we want to keep supports going for as long as we deal with Covid but we are conscious that at some point the issue of non-performing loans may arise, for example.  We do not want to see those on the balance sheets of banks because that chokes off credit.  Everything has its own impact.  We are watching all these matters guardedly.  We believe that the resilience funds that are being sent out to member states will have an impact.  It is interesting that in some sectors we are seeing labour shortages.<\/p><p> There have been interesting developments because of Covid, which are probably more long-term and not fully understood.  The only thing I want to say about Covid is that it was a great wake-up call and I hope we were shocked by our lack of resilience and by how powerless we were.  In one sense, we were cheeky to think that Covid would be a three-day wonder.  I was one of those guilty of it.  I left Brussels in March 2020 thinking I would be back in three weeks and it would all be fine.  How wrong we were.  It is not as if Covid is the only problem we will face.<\/p><p> Equally, we will see other issues around public health linked with climate change.  Maybe we were lucky that we had a bit of a wake-up call this time around before it was too late.  I would hope the committee could look at the work we are doing around Fit for 55.  There is a need to explain what we are doing and it is not something we can force societies to do.  We need to change and everything needs to change for the future.  I hope we could have a conversation around the enormity of that change at another stage and how we cannot leave anyone behind.  We have to make sure that when we talk about a just transition, it is more than just words.  I am conscious of the midlands, Northern Ireland and the horticulture industry that is worried about peat supplies.  Every sector will face a similar trauma, including the growing of maize, as Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said.  That requires us to step back and tell everyone, as we rightly did with Brexit, to look at their supply chains and make changes where they are vulnerable.  The same applies to climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021071500002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I apologise to members and to the Commissioner.  The Seanad is sitting this morning so I have been in the Chamber and I was listening with my headphones, but if I have missed bits and if the Commissioner has answered questions I am about to ask, she can feel free to step over them.  I have two Brexit-related questions.  First, we recently had Commissioner McGuinness at the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU and I thank her for being there.<\/p> <p>  The rule of origin issue has popped up quite a bit throughout the process.  There are particular difficulties for dairy producers and those in the drinks industry, including whiskey producers, and we had representatives of those sectors before our committee.  One of their requests was that in the negotiation of new trade agreements between the EU and third parties and in the renewal of existing trade agreements, the Commission would look at more flexibility around rules of origin relating to North-South trade and supply chains.  To give a specific example, where you have milk from Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland cows brought together in one vat to produce yoghurt or cheese, the request would be that it could maintain its EU origin.  We might try to bring that in when we are negotiating new agreements and renegotiating existing agreements.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is around the grace period that both the EU and the UK, thankfully, agreed to extend to September.  Maybe I am being a bit pessimistic about it but it is unlikely that things will have resolved by September.  Are moves under way to agree a further extension?  What is the Commissioner's view on the post-September situation for the full implementation of the protocol?<\/p> <p>  On a separate issue, this morning in the Seanad we had a motion proposed by Senator Ward on the issue of Belarus and it was supported across parties, including by my party, Fianna F&aacute;il.  I note the previous comments of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, when he questioned the future membership of Belarus of the European Union.  Many citizens in Belarus are looking to the European Union to help them and they do not want to be under the Lukashenko regime.  I am wondering what type of sanctions we can look to to bring that regime on board and to bring it back under EU values, while still protecting the Belarusian citizens who need the EU to protect them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021071500002#H00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626303600,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the three points she raised.  On the issue of rule of origin, I recall a politician in Northern Ireland saying that while they may be British, all their cows are Irish.  That was to do with a particular animal disease issue.  I understand this problem well.  I am asking the following question rather than answering it.<\/p><p>Can there be a bespoke trade agreement to deal exclusively with rules of origin for Ireland and Northern Ireland?  Equally, be mindful that sometimes, if rules of origin are stretched, they might work against the interests of Ireland.  It is difficult to say that we can fix that.  I will talk to my colleague, Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, about it.  He is now Commissioner responsible for trade.  I will talk to his cabinet about that.  I would caution that something that looks simple, if applied, could have unintended consequences.  I know it is a problem for both the dairy and alcohol industries.<\/p><p> Regarding grace periods, I do not think that any of us are optimistic, which is disappointing, because significant work has been done on the EU side to acknowledge and grant the request for an extension.  I can speak without even checking with my colleague, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi.  We are not planning to offer an extension to the extension.  This could be never-ending.  That is not how you do business or implement agreements.  We have offered that extension but it came with conditions.  We would like to see the UK work on transferring data that are required for checks and putting in place what is required to implement an agreement that Boris Johnson signed, perhaps to get Brexit done.  Maybe not enough people read or understood it but that is not our concern.  We read it, understood it, respect it, and ask that the co-signatories respect it equally.  I hope that will happen.  I hear members' pessimism and sometimes I go there too.  On the other hand, I hope that global Britain will see the importance of honouring an international agreement.<\/p><p> We referred to Belarus earlier.  Sanctions are in place.  There is a question of whether this impacts sufficiently on somebody who rules with an iron fist and has no regard for human rights.  Usually people bring about change.  We have to be mindful about helping that without interfering.  We reacted appropriately to completely unacceptable behaviour, with a Ryanair flight being taken to ground and people being removed from it.  I speak to some of our interns.  Sometimes we in the developed world, a term which I use guardedly, where we have a democracy which we criticise, which is important, really do not understand that a lot of the world does not have democracy and would love to.  There are two points here.  One is to try to make sure that when people see how Europe or member states function, they see that democracy is something that they cherish.  That is absolutely the case with Belarus.  It was lovely to see the leader of the opposition in Belarus reunited with her family in Ireland.  I watched that on the news.  She carries a significant burden on her shoulders.  She did not want to be a politician.  Her husband is unfortunately not available to carry this burden.  She is doing it.  You have to be brave to do that.  She is under threat.  We are doing anything that we can.  If more is needed, we will do that too.  This is something that the Ministers for foreign affairs will look at and continue to be active about.<\/p><p> There are many other parts of the world where we could do more.  Perhaps with the United States back around the table and the multilateral issue that I referred to, we will see greater co-ordination with sanctions regimes, effective implementation and making sure that we do not hit those that we should not.  Humanitarian assistance is important in places like Syria and many others.  While we have sanctions, we equally have to look at humanitarian issues.<\/p><p> I thank the Senator for being with us.

It is pointless for us to try to tackle emissions when on the other hand we have energy-intensive centres.  We are looking at the sustainability of these and their impact.  There are two proposals which the committee may be interested in relating to digital resilience and to cryptocurrency which are with the Parliament and Council.  We have to be mindful of the environmental and climate impact of data centres.  I thank the Deputy for raising it.  We are looking at their environmental impacts.  We have a taxonomy, or dictionary, of what a sustainable economic activity is.  We refer to technical screening criteria for data centres.  If the Deputy wants more information, my cabinet is happy to provide that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding sanctions, without repeating what was said in my answers, we have had sanctions in place since 24 June.  I cannot give the impact chapter and verse, but they do have an impact.  It hits people in the pocket.  We will continue to monitor what is currently in place.  With foreign affairs Ministers, we will look at whether more is needed.  It is my role to ensure that sanctions are fully implemented but do not impact on those who they are not intended to hit.<\/p> <p>  When the Chairman throws \"connective tissue\" at me, I go back to my biology classes for my leaving certificate which, given my age, is some time ago.  It refers to links between the European Parliament and Northern Ireland as opposed to the ones between my bones and my brain, which sometimes do not quite function.  This is a serious point.  It was raised by Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  Everyone on this committee knows how politics work.  We have many different views but we get around a table and sort them.  It is important for Northern Ireland to have a voice.  That has to be done through elected representatives, whether formally or informally.  One thing that I have found in this connected world, although I am not sure of the Chair's view, is that it is good that we can communicate, but there is nothing quite like being in the room or being outside the door, in the lift or having coffee and hearing something.  Somebody who is aggressive to you in a room can perhaps change his or her spots when you are outside.  That is the beauty of politics and engagement.  Real presence is vital.  The European Parliament managed to go back to being semi-present in Strasbourg recently.  While it was always tough for a Member of Parliament to go to Strasbourg, I realised how vital it is to have people there.  So many issues can be sorted out.  That is part and parcel of the committee's work and of my work on the Commission.  One cannot really compensate for real engagement and being in the room.<\/p> <p>  I refer again to the Conference on the Future of Europe.  Europe is criticised all the time, as it should be.  With hand on heart, I was the greatest critic of the European Commission until I was put into the chair.  I now have some sympathy for the European Commission.  It takes a lot of the criticism and rightly so, because we develop policy.  We are scrutinised by the European Parliament, which is right, and by the Council.  We get on and do our work, convinced that, with all its flaws, Europe is the best answer to any problem you have because engagement works.  Even though there are disagreements around the table, we always emerge from the room with a solution.  Colleagues from the Oireachtas were present for my first speech in Strasbourg, including Deputy Niamh Smyth, which I really welcomed.  We should not just look to what might be but to what is.  Freedom of movement struck me.  I have used those words flippantly for decades.  Now I realise what an awful imposition it is when one does not have freedom of movement and how those who live in regimes where one cannot move or speak freely live awful lives.  Let us cherish freedom of movement and other benefits that come with Europe.<\/p><p>Those things around freedom of movement and the other issues and benefits that come with Europe should be balanced against its ever-evolving nature because we have different politicians in the room depending on governments.  Look at it as always a work-in-progress but do not always assume it will work in the right direction.  It only works in the direction of those freedoms we all value and respecting democracy if we all engage.  That is as true for citizens in Ireland as it is for all of the other 26 member states, which I hope to visit during my mandate.<\/p><p> As the members know, I came in a year late and have hit the ground running.  I am lucky that I knew many of the colleagues around the table.  I am lucky we are led by a President who is committed to many of the things I value, including equality.  In my long years - I am 62 and am happy to say it; as long as you survive to it, it is good - she is the most committed to equality of any person I have worked with.  I commend her on that and I feel very privileged to serve as the Irish Commissioner and to be nominated by An Taoiseach, Miche&aacute;l Martin.  I appreciate his engagement with me and I hope to be with him tomorrow in Ireland when the President will also be present for an event.<\/p><p> My sincere thanks to the Cathaoirleach.  I am happy to take a question if there is time.  I very much appreciate the engagement this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021071500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":270,"content":"<p>We still have a bit of time.

I reiterate the importance of that.  Brexit changed everything in that a member state left the European Union and then Covid-19 changed everything in many respects.  The conference is timely.  I take the point Ireland should not get consumed by Brexit, albeit terribly important to us as it is, in that there are many other developments taking place in the EU that we need to be engaging in.  The Government was reported to have said it is not in favour of treaty change in the context of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  I did question the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il on that and he said no, what was reported in the newspapers was a position paper or whatever and the Government is open to treaty change if that transpires to be necessary.  Is the Commission neutral on the question of treaty change and the conference on Europe, is it steering in a different direction, or is there a view we need new competencies as regards the EU?

With regard to his point on the Narrow Water Bridge, I looked at this project.  It would be a hugely beneficial one and I hope it comes to fruition and that citizens benefit from it.  I listened to his comment on the engagement of citizens in Northern Ireland in the conference.  All engagement helps.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the single-use plastics directive, one of the things I was really concerned about was the abolition of the use of plastic straws.  Some people with a disability need them.  There is always an unintended consequence that lawmakers need to be aware of and I was able to bring that issue.  With regard to plastic use in agriculture, derogations are possible.  I am not fond of them because it should be phased out.  I am sure if the Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine speaks to my counterparts here in the Commission on that issue, there may be some capacity to move, but with regard to the use of plastics generally, we should not try to continue to use them.  We should find other ways.  There is always another way.  When you are forced to find it, you will, while understanding some of the problems of contractors.<\/p> <p>  I do not have much to say on funding that would not take a long amount of time.  I take the Deputy's point.  It is changing its direction but there are significant flows of money still available, including through agriculture policy.<\/p> <p>  On the bigger question on the future of Europe, which might be a good one to end on, to be clear, my colleague, Vice-President Dubravka &Scaron;uica, is our go-to person on the conference here.  She is excellent and I recommend she be invited to the committee, perhaps in the autumn.  The Commission is not steering the Conference on the Future of Europe in any direction.  I hope nobody is.  Ireland has a very good example of deliberative democracy where people come together.  My friend, Enda Kenny, would have put this idea forward and many people have realised it works.  When you give people the responsibility of taking on an issue and going through, they will come up with some interesting answers because they are committed to it.  We hope the same will happen with the Conference on the Future of Europe.<\/p> <p>  On treaty change, the idea of referendum always puts people ill at ease.  On the other hand, if in this discussion with citizens we feel there are areas in which treaty change is needed, we should not shy away from them.  These are always important moments.  We might be on different sides occasionally around the way the treaties are being changed, but at least we get to debate it.  With regard to Irish citizens in particular, from my memory of referendum, if you do not give enough information and they do not believe what they are being told, they will not vote in favour.  It also puts a responsibility on the political system to address concerns and questions citizens may have.  What I would say on the Conference on the Future of Europe is that minds should be open about the future.<\/p> <p>  Post Brexit and post Covid-19 is probably a good time to have a chat about what we want.  I know during the heat of the awful months of this year, when people were dying from Covid-19, getting ill and the vaccination roll-out was not as rapid as we all wanted, there was a sense that we would be better off on our own, which tends to be the immediate reaction until you step back and say I am glad we were not on our own because, especially if you are a small member state, you may be forgotten.  However, I come from a small member state.  It never inhibited my work as a Member of the European Parliament when I started in 2004 because I engaged.  We are lucky we have Members of the European Parliament who engage and it is very important they do because you have to spread yourself quite thinly.  I hope the conference excites and unites people in Ireland and that they have a conversation around it.  If treaty change is required, so be it.  We should all be ready for that challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021071500002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCoimisin&eacute;ir as ucht-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021071500002#K00800","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626303600,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I am thanking Ms Deirdre O'Hea for this, my very able assistant who I was able to steal from the Parliament to the Commission because of her long experience.<\/p><p>There are colleagues on the committee who are also members of COSAC.

Earlier this year our committee held a meeting with representatives of the People&rsquo;s Embassy of Belarus in Ireland after which we unanimously agreed a resolution of condemnation on the matter of the interception by the Belarusian authorities of a flight originally destined for Vilnius, which was taken to Minsk.

Ladies and gentlemen, Members of Parliament and my dear Irish people, Ireland is the country that has a special place in my heart.  The last time I came to Ireland was 17 years ago and I am extremely happy to be back.  I was honoured to meet the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, esteemed Members of Parliament and my beloved Deane family.  I am grateful for the opportunity to address the committee today on behalf of the people of Belarus, who are fighting for our right to choose our future.<\/p> <p>  I am addressing the committee in English today because I learned the language during my three wonderful summers as a Chernobyl kid with the Deanes in County Tipperary.  I remember how everything felt totally different, new and exciting for ten-year-old Sviatlana, a child from a small town in southern Belarus.  I remember climbing up Knockshigowna hill after having delicious ice cream from the truck which drove around Roscrea.  Henry and Marian Deane treated us just like their own kids, with utmost care and affection.  The Deane children accepted us right into the family without any jealously or bitter feelings.  Everybody was coming up with exciting things for us today everyday to relax.  I am immensely grateful to the Irish people for caring about Belarusian children affected by the nuclear disaster.  Yesterday, I visited the house for the first time in 17 years.  I was smothered with kisses and hugs by Henry and Marian.  With tears on my cheeks, I recalled how deeply my Irish family cared about me and other Belarusian kids.  My dear Marian still bossed me around the house and I recalled which kitchen drawer had the salt in it.  I felt as if I had never left.  The only thing that had changed was that as the ice cream man handed me my delicious cone, he shouted \"&Zcaron;yvye Byelaru\" - long live Belarus.  My story is just one of many thousands of human stories that bring Belarus and Ireland closer.  Also, our countries have many more similarities than one would expect.  Both Belarus and Ireland have had a tumultuous path to independence from an imposing neighbour.  Both Belarus and Ireland have a national language we are doing our best to preserve.  Both Belarus and Ireland have a long path of fighting for our right to choose our future which Belarusians have not yet walked to the end.<\/p> <p>  At this very moment, my country is experiencing a Chernobyl of human rights.  Every hour a piece of terrifying news comes from Belarus.<\/p><p>We have been trapped in this nightmare since last summer when the autocratic president refused to accept he lost an election.  Instead, he decided to wage a war against his own people.  He is nothing more than a usurper clinging to power with all his might.<\/p><p> Just two days ago, Belarusian security forces raided the offices of at least 19 civil society organisations - human rights defenders, sociologists, political parties and charity funds - across the country.  Four volunteers of Strana dlya zhizni, A Country to Live In, the movement launched by my husband Sergei, were arrested.  They assembled parcels and brought packages to political prisoners.  One of them, Ilya Mironov, wrote more than 2,000 letters and brought more than 100 kg of food and warm clothing to political prisoners.  Exactly a week ago, the regime cracked down on the oldest news outlet in Belarus, Nasha Niva.  Its editor-in-chief, Jahor Marcinovi, was arrested and the newspaper's website was blocked.  Later that day, we found out that an ambulance visited him at the detention centre.<\/p><p> All in all, more than 35,000 Belarusians have been arrested and hundreds were tortured.  There have been at least ten regime-related deaths.  Some 555 people are recognised as political prisoners in Belarus today and the number is growing every day.  Moreover, the Belarusian crisis outgrew its borders.  Lukashenko ordered a forced landing of a European aeroplane to arrest an opposition blogger.  The regime is allegedly assisting migrants to illegally cross the border with Lithuania and Poland.  On 5 July, Lithuania declared a state of emergency because of the influx of migrants passing through Belarus.  The dictatorship in Belarus became a regional security problem but despite the constant repression brave Belarusians find ways to protest.<\/p><p> Our goal has not changed &ndash; free and fair elections.  We did not give up and we are building structures on the ground.  We have a wide network of volunteers working in all six regions of Belarus distributing Samizdat printed newspapers telling the truth for those without Internet.  Some 16,000 workers have already joined the workers movement and are preparing the country for a nationwide strike.  Most of those people risk getting detained any day, but they continue their struggle despite fear and risks because they have a vision of a free Belarus that we will all achieve.<\/p><p> In these trying times I ask committee members to care.  We are aware of Ireland's principled position in support of democracy in Belarus.  However, it is not words but actions that matter.  Every little bit of care and empathy, every small step, helps because there are millions of us and there will be millions of steps.  In the same way that Irish people helped Belarus after the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl, there is something that everybody could do.  I call on every Irish person to write a letter to a political prisoner.  Receiving a letter from abroad makes the day a small holiday for them because it shows that there is someone far away who cares about them.  I urge people to talk about them in schools, colleges, churches and friends' groups.<\/p><p> I call on Irish charities and NGOs to accept children of the repressed for rehabilitation on the basis of the existing programmes.  My personal experience shows that they go a very long way.  I call on the Irish Government to increase support for Belarusian civil society, especially as it is being destroyed.  I urge the committee to bring international attention to the topic of Belarus, particularly through organising a formal meeting at the UN Security Council at the earliest opportunity.  I call on the Irish Government and the international democratic community to adopt stronger co-ordinated sanctions.  We need to treat the problem not the symptoms.  That is why sanctions are important.  They are the only way to bring the dictator to justice.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its solidarity, support and for being with us and standing with Belarus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021071500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I both welcome Ms Tsikhanouskaya to the committee and commend her.

I commend her courage and fortitude in the face of what can only be described as the appalling and brutal crackdown by the Lukashenko regime against the pro-democracy protesters in the past year, following the very contentious election which saw him re-elected with close to 80% of the vote.

She might elaborate on that and give an accurate figure on how many political prisoners are currently incarcerated.  It is shocking to hear that another 19 civil society groups had their premises raided in recent days and that there were more arbitrary arrests and detentions.  Organisations such as Amnesty International have reported that there was clear evidence of many detainees being tortured, which is of great concern.  While the arrests and repressions continue it is important that the international community maintains a focus on Belarus.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Ms Tsikanouskaya's presence before the committee because it gives us an opportunity to ensure the issue is still under the spotlight.  I have spoken many times on behalf of my party on Belarus and actively supported measures to end the repression, including EU sanctions.  There were two motions before the D&aacute;il and a motion was passed by the Seanad this morning which my colleague, Senator Gavan, spoke in support of.  Democracy is not something that can ever be taken for granted.  When challenged, it must be defended with vigour.  I again commend Ms Tsikhanouskaya on her role in defence of democracy within Belarus.<\/p> <p>  Human rights must be kept to the forefront of every Government and so must the rule of law.  My party and I have condemned the hijacking of the Ryanair aeroplane in May to detain a colleague of Ms Tsikhanouskaya.  We must be willing to do all within our power to end human rights abuses wherever they are found.   Ms Tsikhanouskaya should keep doing what she is doing.  She has our total support for anything she can do to support democracy and human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021071500002#C00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome our distinguished guest to the country and to our committee.

The entire approach to attacking a peaceful protest was shocking to behold.  We are completely on Ms Tsikhanouskaya's side.  Is she happy with the level of sanctions we have introduced?  Are those sanctions sufficiently targeted?  One of the fears in respect of arguments against sanctions concerns the possibility of harming ordinary people and not the people those sanctions are targeted at.  Hopefully, that is not the case in this instance.  I ask Ms Tsikhanouskaya to reassure us of that.<\/p> <p>  How much fuel is left in the tank, for want of a better term?  How well will Ms Tsikhanouskaya be able to keep this endeavour going and maintain popular support?  From listening to Ms Tsikhanouskaya, it sounds as if she is confident.   Is she confident that popular support will remain?  We pray that it will.  It takes immense courage.  Finally, I also understand that the economy of Belarus has suffered greatly.  I ask Ms Tsikhanouskaya to comment on that aspect.  I am also proud to have sponsored a prisoner as part of the campaign undertaken here.  It is important that we support Ms Tsikhanouskaya.

Following up on the questions regarding sanctions, it is the EU which is imposing these sanctions on 78 individuals, eight entities and seven Belarusian economic sectors.  It seems that represents a substantial amount of sanctions.  However, in her address Ms Tsikhanouskaya said that she felt stronger and more co-ordinated sanctions were needed.  I would be interested to know more about what Ms Tsikhanouskaya means by that.  If there is more that the EU can do in this regard, then Ireland would obviously bring pressure to bear in that regard.  Turning to the EU generally, it has committed to providing substantial financial aid to Belarus if it succeeds in bringing about a democratic regime.  I refer to the provision of support for such a new democratic regime.  Lukashenko, however, is more inclined to look towards Russia, but does Ms Tsikhanouskaya see more scope for the EU to act?  Does she welcome the commitment for substantial financial aid to support democracy in Belarus if it can be successfully achieved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021071500002#D01300","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1626303600,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for allowing me to attend.  It is wonderful to see Ms Tsikhanouskaya here today.  Two things are important about her visit.  The first is the profile it gives to the problems in Belarus.  I saw an editorial in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>yesterday which referred to a Europe of the past regarding what is happening now in Belarus.  What is happening there now is the kind of thing we associate with what happened in the past in Europe.  None of us wants to see this type of situation in Europe's future.  I praise the work being done by Ms Tsikhanouskaya.  It is tremendously important and Ms Tsikhanouskaya is taking a personal risk in this regard as well.  The secondary value of this visit is to highlight this situation and the close links between Ireland and Belarus.  Ms Tsikhanouskaya is the personification of that in many ways.  It is wonderful, therefore, that the profile surrounding what is happening in Belarus is being raised in Ireland by Ms Tsikhanouskaya's visit.<\/p><p>That has been tremendously effective.<\/p><p> I mention the adoption program that more than 30 parliamentarians have taken up to highlight political prisoners in Belarus who are being held in captivity for what we take for granted, namely, simple protest.

I appreciate the warm words they expressed to me and the Belarusian people, who are fighting and suffering.  Some of them sacrificed their freedom, health and lives to give us an opportunity to continue this fight.  They are counting on Belarusians and the international community because we are fighting for democratic changes in Belarus.<\/p> <p>  I have heard two main questions about assistance and sanctions.  On the one hand, to make our fight sustainable we have to support civil society on the ground who had to flee the country because of violence there.  Democratic countries have to support civil society in Belarus at this moment because it is difficult for political prisoners, their families and different organisations inside the country, including those who had to flee the country.  As members know, all independent mass media was destroyed in Belarus and they had to move to Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine to continue their activity to show the reality in Belarus to other people.  Somehow, they have to live and if the international community will support mass media abroad and that is still left in Belarus, we would appreciate this step.<\/p> <p>  I mention human rights defenders also.  Yesterday there was a massive attack on human rights defending organisations in Belarus and many of their leaders have been imprisoned.  There was a question about the number of political prisoners.  At the moment it is 555 people but there is no one left in Belarus who can recognise people as political prisoners because they are in prison already.  Human rights defending centres need assistance as well.  I ask all countries and Ireland in particular, on a bilateral or European Union level, to increase assistance to the civil society of Belarus.  For people to survive, not to lose hope and to continue the fight, they badly need this assistance.  I am sure members know about this and will do everything possible to continue this assistance.<\/p> <p>  I refer to sanctions.  We understand that sanctions are not a silver bullet and that they will not bring our country to democracy.  However, sanctions are leverage to help stop the violence in Belarus.  We already had such precedence in Belarusian history when sanctions and even the threat of same helped political prisoners to be released.  Since August, we tried to appeal to the regime on a diplomatic level through the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, different NGOs, mediators and personalities but the regime was closed, it bunkered and it did not answer these calls.  Therefore, sanctions were the adequate answer to the violence, torture in prisons and ill treatment of Belarusians.  Since December, there was no big conference on the Belarusian question.  Those beautiful pictures of peaceful demonstrations disappeared because the regime, with the help of violence and guns, succeeded in suppressing all those wonderful people.  The pictures disappeared, attention on the Belarusian question decreased a little bit and Lukashenko felt impunity.  He thought that democratic society forgot about Belarusians, he felt impunity and that is why this hijacking happened.  I am sure the response of the European Union in closing the airspace above Belarus and imposing a fourth package of sectoral sanctions was rather adequate and normal.<\/p> <p>  Propaganda might spread the message that sanctions will influence ordinary people and not the regime.  That is not true because people are already suffering.  They are not suffering because of sanctions but because of violence, torture and lawlessness in our country.  Sanctions hit the regime first of all and people in the last turn.  Lukashenko and his regime are so afraid of people rising up and of workers striking that he will decrease the wages of those workers in the last turn.  He is afraid of everything, he is cornered and he understands that he is economically and politically isolated.  He is toxic to western countries.  After he started to take revenge on Lithuania and after he started to send illegal migrants to the Belarusian and Lithuanian border, I am sure the European Union will be stronger in its position and will impose a fifth package of sanctions on the Belarusian regime.  It is impossible to look at this house in our country and not answer.<\/p> <p>  Sanctions can change the behaviour of Lukashenko and end the violence.  Also, sanctions can split the elites.  For sanctions to be strong, they should be joint.  Europe, the United Kingdom, the USA and Ukraine have to impose sanctions together.  Sanctions should be probed and include a wide range of people who are responsible for the violence in our country and for the enterprises and companies that are wallets of Lukashenko.  Sanctions have to be conditional so they should be imposed until new elections will be held in our country.  Before new elections, we have to release all political prisoners, start dialogue with the regime and after new elections happen, some sanctions will be lifted.  These are the conditions of the sanctions.<\/p><p>The fourth package of sectoral sanctions left loopholes for followers of Lukashenko.  These loopholes need to be closed.  Sanctions cannot be bypassed by cronies of the regime.<\/p><p> There was a question about Roman Protasevich.  He is under house arrest now.  That is not equal to freedom.  He still faces criminal charges.  He is under investigation.  He said that he is in a house but that he is observed by KGB people all the time.  His parents cannot communicate with him.  It is not freedom.  He can be used by the KGB as it wants.  He is a victim of this regime.  He is a hostage.  We have to do everything possible to release him and other people as soon as possible.<\/p><p> There was a question about state control of the media.  The regime destroyed all the independent media in Belarus.  Journalists and editors-in-chief are in prisons.  Local newspapers and other media forms are closed or had to flee the country.  They are trying to restore their activity.  New ways of delivering information appeared.  People have to be creative.  We are communicating through telecommunications channels.  New YouTube channels appear to deliver information for those inside the country.  Lukashenko wants to silence everybody inside Belarus and for no information to reach people on the ground.  Civil society is creative.  People are smart and we are looking for new ways to restore independent media, if not inside Belarus then at least outside it, to tell about the situation in Belarus.  We have to come back to old methods of spreading information.  Samizdat involves self-made newspapers which are widespread in villages, for those people who do not have access to the Internet.  They show the truth because propaganda is working hard to show democratic activists in a poor way.  We are struggling with this.  We do our best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021071500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626303600,"counter":303,"content":"<p>We are expecting a new wave of protests this fall, hopefully.  We are working hard to prepare and to build infrastructure.  Before 9 August, an important anniversary of elections, Lukashenko is trying to crack down on structures and organisations that are still working.  Our goal is to protect them, make them sustainable and assist them, which is difficult.  On one hand, the regime is not consolidated.  We hear many voices looking for a way out.  Lukashenko's regime is like the mafia.  When you are in, it is difficult to get out.  When you are out, he takes revenge, as he did with everything who quit last fall.  We have to prepare infrastructure, give energy to the people and, most importantly, give them hope.  This hope can also be given by the international community, and by the Irish Parliament, by messages about, helping and promoting Belarus.  Lukashenko suffers from delegitimisation.  He wants to be recognised as the leader.  It is painful for him not to be seen, commended or mentioned.  International media stopped quoting him, which he is frustrated about.  We can keep ignoring him.  He is not the leader or president any more.  This delegitimisation of Lukashenko can play a crucial role in creating a split in elites.  People around him do not want to be part of the failing regime.  They do not want to be part of a dark period of Belarus' history.  We will pave the way to this free Belarus.
