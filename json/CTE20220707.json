Apologies have been received from Deputy Imelda Munster.  In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others, to be respectful of other people's physical space and to adhere to any other public health advice.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the  committee.  He is accompanied this morning by Mr. William Cronin, audit manager at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from the Department of Education to examine the following: the 2020 appropriation account for Vote 26 &ndash; Education; from the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2018 Report on the Accounts of the Public Services - Chapter 7, Purchase of sites for school provision; and from the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2019 Report on the Accounts of the Public Services - Chapter 8, Management of the schools estate.  Due to unforeseen circumstances, the Secretary General, Ms Bernie McNally, could not be in attendance for today's meeting.  As the Secretary General is the Department's Accounting Officer and that function cannot be delegated, I propose that we make the transcript of today's proceedings available to the Secretary General to allow her, in her capacity as Accounting Officer, to comment on or clarify any matters that arise during the course of the meeting.  As a similar situation arose in respect of our meeting with the Department of Foreign Affairs last week, I also propose that we afford that Department's Accounting Officer the same opportunity.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I wish Ms McNally well and hope she will be back in good fettle soon.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the Department of Education: Mr. Gavan O'Leary, assistant secretary, corporate services; Mr. Hubert Loftus, assistant secretary and head of the planning and building unit; Ms Deirdre Mc Donnell, assistant secretary and head of major operations and shared services; Mr. Harold Hislop, chief inspector; Ms Martina Mannion, assistant secretary; and Mr. Tom Whelan, principal officer and head of the finance unit.  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following assistant secretaries from the Department: Ms Aoife Conduit, Ms Deirdre Shanley and Mr. Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc.  In addition, we are joined by Ms Georgina Hughes-Elders, principal officer in the education Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off or in silent mode.  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, three of today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as does a witness who is physically present.  These witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 such that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I now call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#A00800","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657182600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Vote 26 was restructured in 2020 following the formation of the Government.  Responsibility for the previous Vote programmes for higher education and science were transferred to the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  Responsibility for first level, second level and early years education remained with the renamed Department of Education.<\/p> <p>  The appropriation account for Vote 26 - Education records gross expenditure of &euro;8.6 billion in 2020.  This was up 4.3% year-on-year relative to the comparable programme in 2019.  In 2020, the largest element of spending was for the pay and pensions of current and former teachers and other school staff, amounting to &euro;6.72 billion in total.  Payments related to the provision of school buildings and extensions and other educational infrastructure totalled &euro;848 million in 2020.  This included &euro;65 million in payments related to public-private partnership provision of schools.  Expenditure on school transport totalled just under &euro;225 million.<\/p><p> On the receipts side, appropriations-in-aid of the Vote amounted to &euro;355 million in 2020.  The majority of these receipts are pension-related contributions from current education employees.  It should be noted that employee contributions from employees who are members of the single public service pension scheme, recruited since January 2013, are remitted directly to Vote 12.  For 2020, the surplus to be surrendered from Vote 26 was just under &euro;138 million.  This resulted from net underspending across the Vote subheads.  I issued a clear audit opinion for the appropriation account for 2020.<\/p><p> In my annual report for 2018, I presented a report on the purchase between 2016 and 2018 of three high-value sites for school developments in Dublin city.  The three sites in question were the former Rehab premises at Roslyn Park in Sandymount; the former greyhound racing stadium site in Harold's Cross; and buildings owned by the former Dublin Institute of Technology located in Cathal Brugha Street and Marlborough Street.  The three sites were bought for a combined total of just over &euro;67 million.  Our focus was in establishing whether a well-defined business case was in place and how the Department of Education ensured value for money was achieved for the very substantial prices paid for the sites.<\/p><p> In each case, it was noted that the sites acquired did not meet the Department's own guidelines for minimum site area for development of schools.  In practice, given the challenges of developing schools in established urban areas, the Department was planning to maximise the potential of the sites, for example by locating both a primary and a post-primary school on the larger sites and by allowing for use of multistorey buildings.  The report recommended that the Department should review its parameters for the size of sites required for schools to allow for more intensive development of sites in restricted areas.  The Accounting Officer has provided additional information on how the sites have been utilised since the report was published in September 2019 and on progress being made to develop permanent school premises and facilities on these valuable sites.<\/p><p> The Department of Education has overall responsibility for management of the nation's schools estate, which comprises almost 4,000 premises and land serving a student population of around 950,000.  This property represents an accumulated investment by taxpayers of many billions of euro.  In my annual report for 2019, I sought to outline the Department&rsquo;s arrangements for monitoring the condition of school properties, funding of maintenance and refurbishment and protection of the State's financial interest in those properties.<\/p><p> Recommendations in the report include the conduct of a survey to assess the condition of schools nationwide in a consistent manner to facilitate strategic targeting of resources; the development of guidance and good practice information to assist schools in their maintenance responsibilities; the implementation of legal agreements where appropriate to protect the State's interest in the schools estate; and refinements in accounting practice.  I am glad to report that all of the recommendations were accepted by the Department.  The Accounting Officer has provided an update on progress made in implementing the recommendations since the publication of the report in September 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#A00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Leary and thank him for leading the delegation at short notice.

In beginning my statement, I have been asked to convey the sincere apologies of my Secretary General, Ms Bernie McNally, for not being able to attend the committee today.  Unfortunately, she is unwell, and in line with current public health advice she is self-isolating and unable to be here.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee the invitation to attend today to discuss the Department of Education 2020 appropriation accounts, chapter 7 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2018, which deals with the purchase of sites for school provision, and chapter 8 of the 2019 report, which deals with the management of the schools estate.  As indicated by the Chairman, I am joined by officials from the Department who will cover various aspects of the matters under discussion.  We are also joined remotely by three assistant secretaries covering different areas of the Department.  We have provided the committee with briefing material in advance and hope this has been of some assistance.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, a new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science was established after the formation of the new Government in 2020.  Functions previously performed by the Department of Education and Skills were transferred to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in 2020.  The Vote 26 2020 accounts cover those functions that remain with the Department of Education and relate predominantly to primary and post-primary education.<\/p> <p>  The Department's net voted expenditure in 2020 was &euro;8.379 billion.  Of this, &euro;925 million was capital expenditure.  Net pay and superannuation account for approximately 78% of the Department's overall budget.  In 2020, this provided for almost 93,000 public service employees and 42,000 public service pensioners.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s programme expenditure now covers one programme area, namely, programme A.  The overall net expenditure for 2020 was &euro;8.241 billion and covered, for example, pay and superannuation costs for teachers and special needs assistants; grants to schools, including capitation payments; costs associated with teacher education; and provision of school transport.  This sum also covered additional costs arising due to the impact on schools of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  Due to the transfer of functions I referred to earlier, the Department's Revised Estimates Volume, REV, was further revised to take account of the transfer of functions in 2020.  Funding was also allocated as part of the further Revised Estimates process to cover costs arising due to Covid-19.  In July 2020, the Government agreed a living with Covid package, which made funding available from the Covid-19 reserve fund to support the reopening of schools in September 2020.<\/p> <p>  As the impacts of Covid-19 developed, supplementary supports were also agreed during the remainder of 2020 and beyond.  The funding for these supports totalled &euro;639 million for the 2020-21 school year.  Of this, &euro;331 million was allocated for expenditure in 2020.  This was allocated to cover additional costs arising due to Covid-19, such as additional substitution to cover teacher absences on sick leave, additional capital works to schools to enhance their safety in a Covid-19 environment, capitation for personal protective equipment, PPE, hand sanitisers etc. and school transport.  The full amount was not spent in 2020.  However, due to the uncertainties arising from Covid-19, it was prudent to make provision in the Vote for more negative scenarios in the later months of 2020.<\/p> <p>  Moving to procurement, the statement of internal financial control that forms part of the appropriation account provides details regarding the control systems in place.  It also notes details of instances of non-compliance with public procurement rules.  Such instances have arisen for reasons such as urgency, need for business continuity and sole supplier.  The Department is vigilant regarding good procurement practice and is committed to following the guidance available.  The Department is actively engaged with the procurement reform programme and is taking the opportunity to use centralised contracts and frameworks where appropriate.<\/p> <p>  On the question of public sector reform, the statement on internal financial control also notes the Department activity in the area of shared services.  The Department is advancing a range of initiatives across the entire education and training sector and is actively leading and participating in the rolling out of shared services.<\/p> <p>  On the school capital programme, this committee meeting will also discuss chapter 7 on the purchase of sites for school provision and chapter 8 on the management of the schools estate.  These chapters included a number of recommendations from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Department is actively addressing these recommendations, with significant progress made.  The Department is taking every opportunity to continuously improve and strengthen its processes through its integration and harnessing of data, allowing for better strategic planning and delivery of its overall school building programme.<\/p> <p>  I will mention briefly some developments in 2021 and 2022.  The Covid-19 pandemic had an impact on the Department's activity in an unprecedented manner and the 2020 accounts.  This impact has continued into 2021 and 2022.  The education system's response was aligned to our core national priority of saving lives while being focused on ensuring continuity of education for learners, including a particular focus on more vulnerable students.<\/p><p>On the Ukrainian crisis, the arrival of a large number of Ukrainian children of schoolgoing age has created challenges in finding school places for them and responding to their needs.  There is a significant cost associated with this important work, which will be reflected in the 2022 accounts.<\/p><p> On special education needs, more than &euro;2 billion of the Department&rsquo;s budget is invested in special education needs.  A significant amount has been achieved.  For example, by the end of this year we will have 2,500 special classes across the country.  However, there is still an amount to be done and the Department is working intensively to ensure that all children with special educational needs can access a high quality and inclusive education in their locality.  I thank members for the opportunity to address the committee.  We are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavan O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I wish the Secretary General well and a speedy recovery.  On a positive note, I recognise that 2020 was an exceptionally challenging year for the Department.  It had to deal with a lot of new changes relating to Covid-19.  Perhaps not everything was done right, but I imagine it was not a very easy experience for departmental staff.  I also wish to acknowledge the work done by those on the front line in schools during that period.<\/p> <p>  The first issue that I wish to raise is very much under discussion currently.  It concerns the requirement for legislation to be rushed through to provide additional supports for children with special needs.  It is an issue that is raised with me repeatedly.  When I am running my constituency clinics, I am approached by many families looking for supports and school places for their children.  The delivery of such supports and places in the Cork area is far behind where it needs to be.  I am sure Ms Mannion will be aware of the issues in County Cork, in particular, and in south County Dublin, where the issue seems to be more acute than in other parts of the country.  That represents a systems failure by the Department, and something that requires urgent action to be taken.  I know that work is being done at the moment.  I will provide an example.  Recently, the Minister came to my constituency and we visited a number of schools.  We visited one secondary school with more than 800 pupils, which has an allocation of just one SNA.  That is shocking.  This issue is being raised in other areas of the country.  I am being repeatedly told, by school principals, that despite frequent requests being made to the local officer tasked with liaising between the Department and the schools, they are getting nowhere.  That is affecting areas such as Midleton, Cobh and Glanmire.  It is extremely serious.  What is the Department doing to try to improve and build upon the work being undertaken to try to limit the scenario where the schools out there quite frankly cannot get the resources they require?  As I mentioned earlier, I visited a school with 800 pupils to which only one SNA is allocated.  That is not reflective of the needs of the students who require SNA support.  <\/p> <p>  Is Ms Mannion in charge of that brief?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#C00200","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657182600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>For the purposes-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavan O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I asked a question.

As the Deputy will be aware, the vast bulk of children in our school system are educated in the mainstream system, with access to special education teaching supports and SNAs.  Approximately 1% of our children attend special schools, and another 1% are in special classes.  The Deputy mentioned the Cork area.  There are 244 special classes for children with ASD at primary level and 99 special classes for children at post-primary level in County Cork.  That is a total of 343 special classes in the county.  As my colleague, Mr. O'Leary, mentioned, we will have almost 2,500 special classes by the end of the year.  In the context of setting out how we are supporting children, it is important to highlight that we have made significant investment in special education in recent years.  There has been a fivefold increase in the number of special classes in the past decade.  There are almost 19,000 SNAs in the system.<\/p> <p>  With regard to County Cork in particular, as the Deputy will be aware, we have opened one new special school in Carrigaline under the patronage of the education and training board, ETB.  Another new special school will be opened in Rochestown later this year.  The Deputy mentioned the challenges in south County Dublin, in particular.  While there are challenges, overall, the development of special classes and special school provision across the country is going a significant way towards meeting the needs of children with special educational needs.  Of course, we are conscious that we need to do more.  The Deputy mentioned County Dublin.  It might interest him to know that there are almost 336 special classes at primary level in County Dublin in 43% of all of the schools in the area.  At post-primary level, almost 45% of the schools in the county have special classes.  The number has significantly increased this year, notwithstanding that challenges remain in a small number of places.  We are working closely with schools to ensure that we can deliver those places for September 2022.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also made reference to the passing of legislation.  We are grateful that the D&aacute;il passed legislation relating to section 37A of the Education Act 1998 yesterday.  The provision allows the Department and the Minister to have faster access to special classes, which is in the best interest of children with special educational needs.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, announced in May that for the third time, the process was being recommenced to allow for the delivery of extra special classes in the Dublin area.  <\/p> <p>  On the issue of SNAs, as the Deputy will be aware, there are more than 19,000 SNAs-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Martina Mannion"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I am sorry but I will have to stop Ms Mannion there.  Time is limited.  We have discussed the issue of SNAs.  I appreciate her response.  I mentioned gaps in provision.  One of the areas affected is east Cork.  I do not want to be parochial, but I want to use the area as an example.  I am sure other members are aware of similar examples.  If parents living in Youghal have a child with significant educational needs for whom mainstream education is not an option and he or she wants to attend one of the special schools, they are faced with having to travel to Cork city or Dungarvan.  The journey to Cork city takes 50 minutes with no traffic, and 70 minutes if there is.  The journey to Dungarvan takes 30 or 40 minutes.  I acknowledge that the provision of transportation to special schools is not entirely within the Department's remit.  I understand that the HSE has a role in the provision of these transportation services, and it does not transport children to special schools beyond the county boundary.  To me, that is deeply frustrating.  It is something that should be looked at.<\/p> <p>   I will move on, because time is limited.  I understand that Mr. Loftus has responsibility in the area of school construction and the building unit.

It has been one of the worst experiences that I have had in politics in engaging with any individual unit within the Civil Service.<\/p><p>What epitomised it was the rapid build projects that were presented in 2012.  There was a number of them around the country.  One of them was in Carrigtwohill.  At the time, it was the most expensive school project ever presented and one of the largest school capital developments in the history of the State.  It was for a three-school campus.  It was presented as a rapid build in 2012, but the sod has still not been turned on that project.  It beggars belief that this is allowed to happen.  There are other such instances.  A major fire broke out in a school in Mallow in 2016.  To this day the sod still has not been turned on the reconstruction of the damaged part of the school and additional facilities, which is appalling.<\/p><p> Can Mr. Loftus give an indication of why this happens?  It is worth noting that it involves significant public funds.  We are talking about hundreds of millions of euro and even billions of euro for capital projects for schools.  Why is that allowed to drag on with no sense of accountability?  Nobody seems to have been fired for the errors that took place in 2012.

Obviously, an emergency is an emergency, so that is school-led or there might be an architect or whoever else out at a school.  The minor works scheme is a mechanism to enable schools to do small-scale works and gives them the flexibility for that.  The summer works scheme is a multi-annual scheme.  There are various categories of works within that.  Schools then apply on that basis.  We work through that in priority order.  In that regard, first, as part of our climate agenda, we will have a strong climate action focus in respect of summer works.  There will be more clarity on that in the autumn in terms of detail and an application process for schools.

We have 580 schools currently being surveyed as a first tranche of those, and we envisage the bulk of the balance of schools to be done over the course of 2023 and 2024.

There was, however, a substantial delay from when the tenders for that project were received to the time the offer was made.  The tenderer could not then take the contract at the relevant price.  The contractor offered to undertake the project for a slightly higher amount but that would still have been below the value of  next lowest tender.  The Department&rsquo;s attitude was that it could not do that and that the price could not be adjusted once it had been submitted.  It ended up that the contract in question went to the fifth tenderer.  The other four companies that tendered said they could not undertake the project at the prices they had originally submitted.  The whole project cost approximately &euro;1 million more than envisaged, whereas if the Department had negotiated with the lowest tenderer, &euro;750,000 would have been saved.  Has a review of the tendering process been undertaken?  What are the mechanisms for dealing with tendering now in view of the changing situation in this regard, with building costs increasing substantially in a short period?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#F00300","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657182600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Construction cost inflation is an issue that Mr. Loftus is probably best placed to address.

Other Deputies have raised issues in their constituencies.  I represent D&uacute;n Laoghaire and I am aware of a particular school which has been in prefabricated units on-site since 2005.  The State pays for the upkeep and maintenance of the prefabs annually.  About three years ago, one of the prefabs was condemned.  We thought that was wonderful because the prefabs would be moved, but instead the State purchased or rented another prefab.  The school has been on this temporary site for about 27 years, although the Department owns it.  Mr. Loftus outlined five stages, which sound quite simple, but I know it is complex.  The Department probably selects land owned by the council or State land first and then if that is not available, it seeks to acquire land, if possible.  I am sure Mr. Loftus will agree that 27 years is a long time to spend in prefabs.  It has an impact on the school, although not on the quality of education, which is excellent.  It has an impact when people visit it.  When will the prefabs be replaced or when will there be a permanent building?  I will come back to that in a second.<\/p> <p>  The Department had capital expenditure of &euro;4.1 billion in 2021.  Some &euro;165 million was spent on temporary accommodation, according to the briefing note supplied to us.  Some &euro;29.4 million was spent on renting temporary accommodation.  Does &euro;165 million include the &euro;29.4 million or is that in addition to it?  I know those are not all prefabs and that temporary accommodation could include other things.  Do the witnesses have a figure for how much the Department spent on prefabricated units in the period we are discussing, which is 2021?

Part and parcel of that was looking at modular accommodation and the creation of a modular accommodation framework.  That is very positive from the climate agenda because it works off a decarbonised heating strategy.  One variation of that which we put in place this year was a timber-frame modular framework.

According to the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, the largest class sizes in the country are in Kildare.

It was on the building programme and should have commenced in 2018.  I refer to the Mercy Convent in Naas.  A 24-classroom school, it is not completed yet because we have gone to stage 6 as opposed to stage 5.  Stage 6 is when one's contractor terminates and one has to re-tender.  That is my description of it anyway.  There will be additional costs associated with that.  I would like to know why the contract was terminated.  It is important that we understand why this happened so that it does not happen again.  There would have been additional costs in that there was security on the site on a permanent basis.  There were temporary buildings put in for a protracted period of time because the pupils were there and required the accommodation.  At one point, there were subcontractors shut out of the site.  Obviously, there would be an additional cost associated with that because they could not get their plant and equipment.  It is to go back to tender now.  It certainly will not be completed until there is a tender and somebody gets back in on the site.  It is unlikely to be completed this year.  It should have commenced in 2018.  One would nearly build the children's hospital in the time that it will take to build this particular school.  Can Mr. Loftus give us some indication of how one prevents that kind of, not unique but unusual, thing happening where it will add to the cost and create chaos?

One of the major problems was simply down to the wall-ties not being dropped on the concrete blocks when the two sets of walls were being constructed.

By and large the scheme works very well.  There are problems with it from time to time, and especially this time of the year.  Inevitably, some parents will come to us, or schools will come to us and I want to raise this with the officials.  I spent the morning of last Monday week trying to get through to the school transport section in the Department in Tullamore or trying to speak with a human being, and I failed.  I want to address this with the officials.  If we go back ten years ago, I would probably have been able to phone somebody on the couple of occasions every year when there were problems.<\/p><p>That is not possible now.  All of the phones ring out.  If people are working from home and they are supposed to be able to take calls, if they are not connected up by phone, they cannot work from home.  I know people who are working from home, such as my sister-in-law.  When the phone rings in her office, it rings twice and goes directly to her mobile phone.  She can work two days a week at home.  The point I am making is that there is no answering service and no way of leaving a message.  I cannot get a name of anybody.  I appeal to Department officials, on foot of what I am raising, to give me a name and phone number of somebody.  If they cannot do it now, maybe one of them can do it after the meeting.  I am raising it here because I am at my wits' end with it.<\/p><p> We talked about demographics.  The demographic situation in the Portlaoise area, as Mr. Loftus would know, is that the population is increasing.  Great work is being done providing new schools.  There is still a need for new school buildings, for example at Kolbe Special School.  There is a situation where there are no primary places.  Children from a number of different households and backgrounds, including foreign nationals and some Traveller children, are affected.  There are 21 children who need a bus to go Barnashrone National School.  The principal and I were told that each one of those has been informed they have to go through a section 29 appeal.  It will take much time to work its way through, and these are people whose first language is not English.  I have a copy of a letter from the three primary schools in Portlaoise town that states they are full and have no spaces.  Barnashrone National School is a DEIS school.  It is suitable for these students.  It is in the Mountmellick area.  As it happens, it is only about 4 miles out the road and about 3 miles from where I live.  It has the space and it is a wonderful school.  If the school inspector looks at it, he or she will see it is a school that has performed very well.  As a DEIS school, it has taken many children who have certain challenges and it has been very good.  That needs to be looked at.  If they have to go through a section 29 appeal, surely once the schools in the Portlaoise catchment area have confirmed that there are no spaces, that should be done and dusted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#N06200","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657182600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I am aware of the case.

In terms of eligibility, as the Chair knows, eligibility for transport is based on one&rsquo;s nearest school.  After that, it is based on one&rsquo;s second nearest school and so on.  The principal and parents have been advised that there is no requirement for a section 29 process to be undergone.  Confirmation from the principals of all the schools between that family and the school they wish to attend will be required to confirm that there are no places available in those schools.

Recently I met the family of two very special needs children, both intellectually and physically, who are now adults and their transition from primary to post-primary education was extremely difficult.  In 2001, a fundamental part of their education in terms of the delivery of special needs was the provision of a special needs assistant who worked on a one-on-one basis.  When I met the mother of these boys recently her attitude was that in 2011 when one-on-one interaction was taken away it resulted in negative impacts on one of her sons who had fewer requirements then than his brother and would have been capable of holding down a job or living alone.  In 2011, the assistance was removed and it has never been put back.  Assistance is now provided on a piecemeal basis and the teacher decides what is required and who gets what, which is counterproductive and costs the Exchequer more in the long run.  Has the Department of Education carried out a value-for-money analysis, and I hate to use the term \"value-for money\" in this instance, following removal of that system of special needs education and assistance compared with the current services provided?  Does the Department cut ties when special needs children reach 18 years and, therefore, are no longer in the Department's education system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#P00700","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657182600,"counter":342,"content":"<p>The Deputy has touched on the very important issue of transition, of which the Department is very conscious.

International evidence suggests that the best people to work with children with special educational needs are those who are most highly trained and, therefore, the teaching staff so the degree to which one can maximise face-to-fact contact between the student and the teacher is the best way to ensure the best outcomes for the child.  That means if one wants to support the child in the longer term, and get the very best outcomes, it is better to put the resources, to a greater extent, into providing teachers, and huge numbers of teachers have been put into the system, rather than into special needs assistants.  There are some children who obviously have physical and other needs so a special needs assistant is absolutely vital to them for either toileting or mobility reasons.  It is important that the provision of special needs assistants does not get between the teacher and the student.  The evidence from a lot of international studies is that special needs assistants or classroom assistants can, in some cases, become a barrier between the teacher and the child.  So it is really important that the emphasis is placed on the provision of the teaching, and teaching of a very high skill, for the good long-term outcomes of the child.<\/p> <p>  The age of the child is relevant as we talk about special needs assistants.  Young children often do need a special needs assistant and often benefit from one.  For the psychological and long-term well-being of the child, as the children become older many do not want a special needs assistant.  If one is not careful in how that is managed, the children feel they are being undermined in their own development and maturity because of a special needs assistant tagging along.  It is a really delicate operation to choose when and when not to use the special needs assistant.  The very best people to make decisions about that are probably the principal of the school and the teachers involved.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#P01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Harold Hislop"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I appreciate that there are international studies.

With regard to how they are allocated, I know there are always debates about this issue and the inspector over that section, Mr. Hislop, outlined the criteria and how the assessment is done.  I want to highlight with regard to the allocation of funding for such schools that, as I see it, there are different levels of need and there are situations where children's level of psychological or physical disability would not be very intense.  However, the Kolbe school has been told it is overstaffed.  I visited the school a number of times and I know the students have very intense needs, both psychological and physical.  The first time I was there, I came away and wondered to myself how anyone would get through a day, given the level of need the children have is so intense.  However, the school has been told it is overstaffed.  Children stay there until they are 18 years of age and there are teenagers there who are a lot bigger than me, which presents significant challenges.  I do not want to go into too much detail but I have witnessed it at first hand.  The staff are really challenged and people have been injured, and there are many things I could say about it to the Department privately.  We cannot have a situation where the criteria are the same for that school.  I appeal to the Department and Mr. Hislop to examine that.<\/p> <p>  The parents are greatly challenged and the summer period is very difficult for them.  When children go to the Kolbe school during the day in the normal school term, it gives parents of bit of breathing space, but the staff take over and it is a very challenging situation for them.  Speaking on behalf of the parents and staff, for September the school needs a couple of extra SNAs, given what they are saying to me, and I appeal to the Department to look at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#S01300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657182600,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

However, we absolutely understand there will be children within those cohorts who will need individual SNAs to support them through their education.  The National Council for Special Education will work with schools to ensure that where the needs of those children merit an individual SNA - I did not get the opportunity to say this to Deputy Verona Murphy before she left - the system has not changed in terms of individual children no longer needing an SNA or no longer being able to access an individual SNA, if that is what they require.

It seems the Department is stating if remedial targets are hit it will not impose a sanction.  I request that we seek clarification on whether any penalties have been applied.  The target was that 60,000 homes would be passed by the end of 2021.  In January, the figure was only 34,000.  The most up-to-date figure I have is from mid-June, when 56,600 premises had been passed.  This means as of the summer we have not even met the targets set down for the end of last year.

We know how important this is and how important it is if a project is not included.  I will give an example from my constituency.  The DART+ project is to go to Maynooth.  In actual fact it includes railway sheds.  There are eight railway sheds to be constructed 350 m from the station in Kilcock.  The train line will not go as far as Kilcock.  The DART will go to Kilcock but people will not be able to get on a train there.  The reason the NTA cannot amend the railway order is because Kilcock was not included in the previous project.  There will have to be a separate process so that the current process will not be challenged.  It shows the importance of having projects in the plan that make sense.  I would have thought that wider involvement in the consultation process rather than restricted involvement would have been the way to go.  Given that the strategy covers the period from 2022 to 2042, there is a value in making sure the plan is correct in the first instance and that we do not leave out very obvious measures that should be included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#CC01300","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy has proposal on what we should do on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#CC01400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":456,"content":"<p>If the Minister approves the draft and we have not seen it, I am concerned about the consultation process.

That will be for next week.<\/p> <p>  The next item is C, which is correspondence from private individuals.  Item 1343 is for myself.  It has been dated 5 July 2022.  It is a request that we make inquiries with the HSE regarding the expenditure on Erkina House, Rathdowney.  This follows on from the consideration of an issue raised by Deputy Hourigan last week and our agreement to hold an engagement with the HSE in relation to mental health and expenditure in the community health organisations, CHOs, 4 and 8.   This information will help inform that meeting.  Is it agreed to request that? <\/p> <p> The background to this is that the HSE had decided to close the facility.  Very few people seemed to know anything about it, including the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  The Minister of State confirmed on the floor of the House that she was consulted about it and that it required her say-so before it could be closed.  There have been significant improvements made to that development.  There are 12 very vulnerable people who are living there.  It is a great facility in the town of Rathdowny, in south County Laois.  The HSE said that they have four such units in Laois-Offaly.  If one is going to put two in Laois and two in Offaly, this facility is in the centre of the south of the county and is therefore ideally located.  It is on a fabulous site with fantastic gardens.  An examination of the site is being undertaken at the moment by the HSE.  A relevant point is that we want to try to get a figure for the spend on that building in recent times in order to see how it works.  I know that a huge re-roofing was job done in the past year on the building.  The building would seem to me to be in good shape.  It is a similar situation in some ways to the Owenacurra Centre.  This building is certainly a substantial structure and is in good condition.  It is important from the committee's point of view that we find out what has been spent to date on it.  Is that agreed?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#DD01800","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":474,"content":"<p>It is agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#DD01900","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Thank you.  The final item of correspondence is 1338C, which is dated 23 June 2022.  It concerns the wards of court fund.  It requests that the committee examine the issue.  The correspondence states that there have been substantial losses to the fund and that there is a lack of proper State oversight of the fund, which is in excess of &euro;2 billion.<\/p> <p>  While the Committee of Public Accounts as of the 31st D&aacute;il, published a report in July 2015, on the wards of court fund, the Committee of Public Accounts of the 32nd D&aacute;il considered the matter.  It decided that it was more appropriate that it was under the remit of the then committee on justice and equality and closed its consideration of the matter. <\/p> <p>  The difficulty is that the fund is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Therefore, it does not fall within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  In September 2020, this committee also considered correspondence on the matter.  It referred related correspondence that was received from the Department of Justice and from the Courts Service to the correspondent.  It advised that its consideration of the matter was closed.  It is proposed that we advise the correspondent that it remains the case that matter is most appropriate to the remit of the Joint Committee on Justice, particularly because the fund is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The correspondent also states that in 2010, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, assured the Justice for Wards group that legislation was being drafted to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to have oversight of these funds.  Matters of legislation are also for that committee.<\/p> <p>  To try to assist the correspondent, I would suggest that we clarify the position and that we advise that we might wish to bring the matter to the attention of the justice committee.

The witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if any of their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, the witnesses will be directed to discontinue the remarks.

I begin my presentation by quoting the description on the website of the Department of Enterprise, Trade, and Employment of the critical skills employment permit:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Critical Skills Employment Permit is designed to attract highly skilled people into the labour market with the aim of encouraging them to take up permanent residence in the State.  Eligible occupations under this type of permit are deemed to be critically important to growing Ireland&rsquo;s economy, are highly demanded and highly skilled, and in significant shortage of supply in our labour market. <\/blockquote> <p>I wish to separate that statement into two parts, each of which, in my view, is separate and independent of the other and should be treated thus when considering my petition.  The second part is most pertinent and relevant to the current major issues facing our sector, namely:<\/p> <blockquote> \tEligible occupations under this type of permit are deemed to be critically important to growing Ireland&rsquo;s economy, are highly demanded and highly skilled, and in significant shortage of supply in our labour market. <\/blockquote> <p>This statement alone is tailor-made to confirm the premise of my petition that chefs should be added to the critical skills list.<br\/><br\/>During the meeting of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media on 25 May 2022, which was loosely entitled the &quot;Working Conditions and Skills Shortages in Ireland&rsquo;s Tourism and Hospitality Sector&quot;, representatives of the Licensed Vintners Association, LVA, and the Vintners Federation of Ireland, VFI, clearly showed the desperate dearth of hospitality staff across all disciplines and counties.  Markedly, the representatives of both groups alluded specifically to the shortage of chefs as being fundamental to the re-emergence of their members' businesses. <br\/><br\/>The Chair, Deputy Niamh Smyth, from Fianna F&aacute;il, presided engagingly on the topic and asked the hugely important question of where it was possible for the sector to get skilled staff.  From the Government&rsquo;s perspective, the answer comes from the expert group on future skills needed, EGFSN, established in 1997.  It is tasked with advising the Government on future skills requirements and associated labour market issues that impact on the national potential for enterprise and employment growth.  Its membership includes representatives from Government Departments, enterprise development agencies, businesses, unions, the further education and training sector and the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in conjunction with the skills and labour market research unit, SOLAS, provides the EGFSN with research and analysis support.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Paul Clancy of the VFI suggested, quite reasonably, that an investigation of the precise scale of the problem needs to be conducted at Government level.  The EGFSN is the entity to do that.  On its &quot;About Us&quot; web page, the organisation describes what it does.  I will cite those aspects relevant to my petition:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe advise Government on projected skills requirements at national and sectoral levels and make recommendations on how best to address identified needs.<br \/><br \/>[...]<br \/><br \/>We advise on any skills requirements that cannot be met internally at a given time and so must be met through inward migration. <\/blockquote> <p>I then read the current working list of objectives from the EFGSN's website.  These are an artificial intelligence, AI, skills report; a design skills report; a zero-carbon skills report; a design skills implementation group; and work in the context of the report on Building Future Skills: Demand for Skills in Ireland&rsquo;s Built Environment Sector to 2030.  Hospitality sector needs are not mentioned or addressed.  In the context of an industry that has such highly publicised labour difficulties, surely the EGFSN should be scrambling to acknowledge and respond to the current supply-demand catastrophe.  As this is clearly not high on the Government's agenda, it falls to industry representatives like me to argue the case for at least accepting the issue exists on a national level.<br\/><br\/>To date, my engagement with the Ministers and Departments involved has been mixed.  The overall mood is that the legislation is dated, tired and unfit for purpose.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been responsive to our approaches at lobbying level and information on advisers and contacts has been given freely.  All those to whom I have spoken have been very helpful, but they suffer under the heavy burden of unabating processing queues and complex bureaucratic inadequacies.  These issues make their work and objectives unclear.  They also make solving issues or errors extremely slow and hierarchical.  The impression given is of a disparate system where checks and balances take undue time.  This is a matter for future resolution.<br\/><br\/>The crisis we face right now asks for immediate action.  The statutory instruments that can allow this change exist and are easily amended.  This is the main legislative barrier I see:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn the case of a Critical Skills Employment Permit for an employment for which the minimum annual remuneration is &euro;30,000, the qualification required in respect of that employment is a third level degree relevant to the employment concerned. <\/blockquote> <p>This third level degree stipulation must be removed.  Some of the most influential, powerful, successful and productive members of our society, and some of those in industries, do not have third level degrees.  It is an archaic measure of suitability that is standing obnoxiously in the way of the progress of my petition.<br\/><br\/>I will return to the description of the critical skills employment permit and its first line:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Critical Skills Employment Permit is designed to attract highly skilled people into the labour market with the aim of encouraging them to take up permanent residence in the State. <\/blockquote> <p>I wish to reflect on the outdated precedence it indicates.  The Maastricht treaty of 1992 opened the EU to freedom of movement and thereby created superb opportunities for workers to find employment in their fellow EU countries.  Since 1992, the EU has transformed into a powerhouse of enterprise, industry and belief.  Countries that were severely impacted by exceptionally poor labour market options are now thriving economies with enthused and proud young people, who often return from their time abroad and choose to remain in their native lands to set up businesses and raise their families.  The will &quot;to take up permanent residency in the [foster] State&quot; is not as prevalent as it once was.<\/p><p>As a result it is not necessary for the critical skills employment permit to be framed in this way.  Of course, housing is needed while workers are here and this will be a real issue.  <i>WeHaveChefs.com<\/i>has noted from our coalface experience that accommodation is available throughout the country.  It is just a matter of the hotels, restaurants, bars, chefs and ourselves as recruiters uniting in the search to find our incoming employees suitable lodging while they are here.<br\/><br\/>Our chefs for the most part are not economic migrants in the disheartened sense of the phrase.  Instead they are highly skilled, highly versatile, well-travelled, globally wise go-getters who seize at a good opportunity when it arises.  They know their skill set is in demand worldwide and they choose Ireland because our reputation for welcome and diversity is well known.  They do not necessarily intend to stay forever.  They are exploring the world and applying their passionate career choice to the nation in which they find themselves.<br\/><br\/>Under the general skills employment permit checklist, businesses seeking staff from outside the EU must complete a labour market needs test for each and every position they want to fill.  For chefs this requires a EURES advertisement that must run for 28 days before the application can be submitted, an advertisement for the job in a national newspaper for three consecutive days and an advertisement for the job in a local newspaper or a copy of the advertisement on a jobs website, other than the EURES website, for three days.<br\/><br\/>The problem here is threefold.  The expense of posting these advertisements is substantial, there is a delay of 28 days before an outside-of-EU permit may be submitted, and, most damningly; no-one responds to these advertisements.  For example, <i>WeHaveChefs.com<\/i>placed 27 EURES advertisements over 28 days with 45 positions available in top-class hotels and restaurants throughout the country and we received two CVs, neither of which was anywhere near suitable for the position advertised.<br\/><br\/>The labour market needs test is obsolete as there do not seem to be chefs in the EU who want to come to work in Ireland.  I do not think this is a poor reflection on Ireland's living and working conditions but instead describes the growth and development across the bloc that keeps native chefs in their domestic markets.  The other element is that the hospitality sector is primarily and ideally manned by locals or at least nationals.  These are people who take pride in their country's hospitality offering and often, like myself, they have only one language.  Therefore, the transferability of their skill sets as chefs is hampered by their inability to communicate in a foreign tongue.  The culinary sectors throughout Europe cater largely for their own domestic markets.<br\/><br\/>On the contrary, the chefs we bring from east Asia more often than not have worked in international hotels where English is commonly used as the mean language.  They are well-equipped, ready and prepared to travel to use their skills overseas.  Their intention is not to take up permanent residency but to explore the world of culinary variety.  We do not need to worry where they will live so much; we simply need to welcome them into our country and our communities and help them find accommodation suited to their location.  Where there is a will, there is a way.  I thank the committee for hearing my argument and I hope this petition is not raised in vain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022070700002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Lynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lynn.

The petition is specifically aimed at chefs but the hospitality industry in general is under severe pressure in terms of bodies.  Chefs are already on the general permit list, which is great, but it takes four or five months to get them here.  If they were on the critical skills list this would reduce to four to six weeks.  This would have a significant impact.  As an aside, the rest of the hospitality jobs are not even on the general skills list.

There might be a chef here or there in a town or village with a good following and reputation whose name proceeds them but that is not always the way.

I have not met him before.  What Mr. Lynn is saying is very true.  Look at what F&aacute;ilte Ireland said earlier this year.  There were 40,000 vacancies in the tourism industry and 10,000 were for kitchen staff.  I think that was in the spring of 2022, and they reported that 88% of employers in hospitality were having these difficulties.  I know from my own county of Roscommon there are people, particularly in family hotels, pleading with me every second day of the week.  They are having to close what are, in most cases, very good premises because they cannot get chefs in particular.  In one case, the hotel was asked to dedicate a few rooms to the unfortunate Ukrainian people, they managed to get a wonderful young chef from Ukraine which was a very big plus.  The language barrier was an issue, without doubt, but they managed and they worked their own-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022070700002#D00200","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":553,"content":"<p>The Senator raises a fascinating suggestion.  The Ukrainians were given PPS numbers.  More power to them.  It is great to have them here.  It is superb.  It is possible to make things happen quickly.  We can do it.  It is, 100%, an issue all over.  On 25 May, the LVA told a joint committee that one third of hospitality staff are gone.  That is vast.  It quoted a figure of 260,000.<\/p> <p>  I spoke with a hotelier on Newstalk two days ago.  She was unaware that chefs were not on a critical-skills list.  The owner of Matt the Thresher, where I worked for ten years, was also unaware.  It has only become an issue since Covid and this mass exodus of people.  We have not needed critical skills at this level before but we do now.  The only way to solve it quickly is by their addition on this list.  The only real barrier is the third level thing.  We analysed the chefs on our database currently and 60% have third level education.  There is great quality in the ranks of our chefs.  They are not Irish and I wish they were.  They are people from overseas, outside the EU.  They have great English as a second language.  Everyone can interview strongly.  Most have super hotel backgrounds and college experience plus work experience.  They are raring to come here.  They want to come here but the only barrier is the timeframe.  The hotels cannot wait four or six months for staff to come in.  They cannot predict that far ahead, as much as they would want to.  They are running a day-to-day business.  The chefs have to make decisions about what they will do.  Khairul who is with me today has six children and a wife.  He is from Kuala Lumpur.  He has travelled the world as a chef for many years.  He is interested in exploring the world.  His wife and children do not intend to come here.  His wife is an accountant who works at state level and the six children are various ages.  The goal is not to move everyone here.  I am not saying that is the case for all of our chefs but they want to bring their skills here for a period at least.  All we need to do is to make that more easy to achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022070700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Lynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I was going to make the point that we can do this with Ukrainians, and that is great.

We are only seeing the nub of the problem now and if we do not deal with it, we will see serious closures in the hotel sector.  As I said, some fine family hotels are closing two days a week.  That never happened with these hotels but they have to do it now because they cannot keep the staff they have working seven days a week.  Many of them are exhausted as it is.  Therefore they have decided that they must give a day or two off so they must close the hotel.  I know it saddens them greatly when they have to put a sign up saying, \"Sorry, due to staff shortages we are closed Monday and Tuesday\".  It is not good for tourism or for any town or village.  Many people from abroad are travelling around this country.  They are coming from every country in the world.  There is a huge number of tourists here.  If they come to a town or village and the hotel is closed, it does not look great.  I agree with the sentiments Mr. Lynn is expressing.

On the ask with regard to taking the Ministers and other stakeholders in, it is not that I am looking for the issue to be taken away from this committee, but the enterprise committee or somebody has to deal with this issue because there is an element of madness involved.  This is another of those issues we have batted over and back.

It needs to be dealt with.  It has been batted around.  Who is in charge?  I only mentioned the issue slightly, and Paul Clancy of the Vintners Federation of Ireland raised it too, but there has not been a study done on what the figures are.  To be fully open, I might have made the 10,000 figure up.  I do not know.  I might have heard it somewhere else.  Whose figures are we dealing with?  The figure of 260,000 people working in the industry was mentioned by one party and 180,000 mentioned by another.  There was a 40,000 shortfall and a 50,000 shortfall.  We do not know where it i,s but it is definitely an issue.  Every hospitality company in the country is struggling with staffing issues.  There are not any defining figures on that but we need to find them.  In the meantime, we can adjust some of the legislative barriers to fix the issue.  There are only so many positions in a kitchen that need to be filled.  There were five positions added to the general list, which were executive head chef, head chef, sous-chef, senior chef de partie and chef de partie.  That is great.  Unfortunately, commis chef is not on that list.  The &euro;30,000 threshold is the issue there.<\/p><p>One can pay, but people are not paying commis chefs more than &euro;14.79 per hour.  That is another conversation perhaps.  Senator Buttimer referred to getting young people involved in the sector.  They have to start at commis chef level.  One cannot start somebody at chef de partie level.  For now we can bring in chefs de partie.  They are accomplished up-and-coming chefs as it is, so let us bring them in.  However, the problem is deeper than that, of course.<\/p><p> The other one is the general skills permit for other hospitality jobs.  That is key too.  I did not want to explore that off my own bat today because it was not up to me, but it is very important that this is also done.  The ineligibility list blocks applications for work permits from outside the EU entirely, so one just cannot apply for a housekeeping team from outside the EU.

It is not easy for families like mine to share our story publicly.  With Anna's permission, I will share her experience of living in the Owenacurra Centre and what the service means to her and to families such as ours.  I will also highlight some problems with the closure and the steps we would like the Committee on Public Petitions to take.<\/p> <p>  My aunt, Anna, has lived at the Owenacurra Centre for over 25 years.  Before moving to the centre, Anna was a patient at Our Lady's Hospital in Cork where she was in a closed ward for several years.  My aunt has struggled with significant and enduring mental health problems since her twenties.<\/p> <p>  Owenacurra Centre was set up in 1988.  It is a multipurpose service for people with severe and enduring mental health illness.  It has a town centre location.<\/p><p>It is next to SuperValu and the Midleton market and within walking distance of lots of amenities.  This has been key to rehabilitation, community integration and quality of life for many residents, including my aunt.  It really is a life-saving and transformative service.  Life has not been easy for Anna but being at the Owenacurra Centre has given her a chance to live the best life she can.  When Anna first arrived at the centre, she found communication with people difficult, she was reluctant to leave the building and she could not go out for a short drive in my mother's car.  However, over several years of rehabilitation and with the dedicated support of the Owenacurra staff, Anna gradually found her feet and flourished in Midleton.  As a family, we are terrified that any move away from the centre, and Midleton, could result in a serious deterioration in her mental health and well-being.<\/p><p> The Owenacurra Centre is the only HSE long-stay adult mental health facility in east Cork and our only mental health respite facility.  The centre has a capacity of 28 placements and can accommodate up to 20 residents in single rooms.  In June 2021, the HSE announced its plans close the centre by 31 October 2021.  At that stage, there were 19 residents.  After a campaign mounted by Friends of Owenacurra, which is a coalition of residents, family members, local representatives and members of the community, the closure has been temporarily postponed.  The reason for pushing out the closure date was that the HSE has not been able to find suitable placements for all the residents.  Delaying the closure has been cold comfort to residents and family members.  We have been informed that the centre is definitely closing but we have no idea when it will happen.<\/p><p> The closure process is ongoing and some residents have already moved.  The number of residents has now been reduced to 11.  To date, my family has had three family consultations to discuss Anna's future.  These discussions have raised more questions than answers and have only increased our anxiety and worry about her future.  For example, in September 2021, it was suggested that she would be moved out of the area to St. Stephen's Hospital in Glanmire, which is an institutional setting in the countryside, away from her friends and community in Midleton.  This suggestion was very distressing for our family.  Anna spent years in a closed ward and now, after the progress she has made at Owenacurra, she is facing the prospect of being sent back to an institutional setting.  In December 2021, there was a conversation about another out-of-area placement in a house in Carrigaline.  However, the building did not have planning permission and the proposal has been subject to a number of objections from local residents.  Most recently, there was a vague suggestion that the HSE would look for a house in Midleton but no property has been identified.<\/p><p> The whole process has taken a severe toll on Anna and on our family.  For Anna, the past 12 months have been extremely difficult.  She has expressed her clear wish to remain in Midleton at the Owenacurra Centre, which is her home.  She has had to endure terror and fear that she is going to be made homeless.  She has had to watch her fellow residents, many of them friends, being sent off to different places around the county.  She has had no news about how they are settling into their new accommodation and she is worried about them.<\/p><p> The stated reason for the closure is that the premises is not fit for purpose and no amount of refurbishment could bring it to an acceptable standard.  The proposed closure was not signalled by recent Mental Health Commission reports, despite briefings from HSE management and communications to residents strongly suggesting that the commission's concerns contributed in significant part to the closure decision.  The decision stemmed from an internal building report by the HSE's maintenance department.  That report did not provide evidence of a new building survey that could support such a claim.  Independent asbestos and fire safety reports, carried out in 2019 and 2021, respectively, set out the works that were required on the premises.  Neither report supported the claim that the building was beyond repair or could not be brought up to an acceptable standard.<\/p><p> Despite repeated HSE briefings suggesting otherwise, no independent report has supported the HSE's position that the Owenacurra building is beyond repair.  A member of the Oireachtas health committee who is a qualified architect with a specialist expertise in healthcare buildings visited Owenacurra, studied the building reports, concluded there was no reason the building could not be renovated and suggested this could potentially be done section by section, with the reduced number of residents remaining on site.   After a thorough examination of the closure rationale, including a site visit to the Owenacurra Centre and St. Stephen's Hospital for comparison, the health committee wrote to Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, in April calling for a reversal of the closure as a matter of urgency and stating that the committee considered the evidence produced by the HSE justifying the decision to be \"unconvincing\".  The committee repeated this opinion in a more detailed follow-up letter to the CEO of the HSE, Mr. Paul Reid, and the Minister of State in May and in a referral to the HSE board in recent weeks.<\/p><p> I will sum up what families of residents and the Save Owenacurra Centre campaign are seeking.  It is important to emphasise that the campaign is not just about current residents, including my aunt.  It is primarily about them but it is also about the many other people in east Cork with severe mental illness who require placements of varying duration to attain a decent quality of life.  The campaign is not just about a few vocal families holding out against the HSE's planned closure; it is about a broader regional need into the future for a very vulnerable group of people.  Families and others involved in the campaign want the Oireachtas health committee's detailed refutation of the closure to be upheld by the HSE.  We want to see the building issues addressed in a manner that is not so disruptive that it leads to an almost total cessation of services over many years.<\/p><p> We are appealing to the HSE board to intervene and direct the executive to overturn the closure decision.  The board was set up with the aim of building public trust and confidence in the HSE.  The experience of families and many other supporters is that a vital service is being removed in a manner that just does not stand up to scrutiny.  There appears to be no accountability for this.  No amount of evidence of the distress of residents and family members or arguments from Oireachtas committees is making any difference to these proposals.  It is extremely difficult to have trust in the HSE as a result of this attempted closure and how it has been handled.  We ask the Committee on Public Petitions to write to the HSE board to reinforce the health committee's recommendation that the decision to close the Owenacurra Centre be reversed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022070700002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Orla Kelleher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Kelleher.

Over the years in Midleton, with the dedicated support of the staff at Owenacurra Centre, who are absolutely phenomenal, Anna has gradually made progress.  She goes out in the town every day, she is involved in the local craft group with really nice women, and she is totally integrated.  She volunteers in the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, charity shop.  She goes to the leisure centre and goes swimming.  She goes across the road to SuperValu.  She is fully integrated.  She goes across the road to the newsagents, Angela's, to get her cigarettes.  She knows everybody around the town and it is such a joy to walk around town with her and to pop in for a coffee.  Everybody knows her and she is so well-treated there whereas if she were to be somewhere else she would not have that community or those friends.

It is not easy telling her own family's stories.  At the outset, I am well aware of the Owenacurra Centre.  It is in my own town.  Listening to her last statement, there is a mixture of emotions between anger and sadness.  She hit the nail on the head in that the HSE is going against its own policy and the Sl&aacute;intecare policy of a community-led, fully supported, totally integrated centre.  Dr. Kelleher explained it, from regression years ago to where her aunt is now.  I have met her aunt and many of the people in town.  This is personal.  I do not wear the fact that the building is not fit-for-purpose because these issues were raised as far back as 2016.  There is a number of reports there.  I have said at meetings, even at the one in Sarsfield Court with the HSE, that people cannot be thrown out of their homes, especially when blaming the fact that the building is not fit-for-purpose.  The HSE is the proprietor and is responsible for the upkeep of that building.  It has failed and is putting the pressure on the residents of the Owenacurra Centre.  I have heard of something similar happening in Tipperary and not too far away from Midleton, in the Castlemartyr health centre, the exact same excuse is given, that is, the building is not fit-for-purpose.  It is on the main thoroughfare, the M25.  It is in the village and yet the HSE wants to locate it six miles out the road where there is no access to it.  Again, it is isolating and cramming people in.  <\/p><p>The thing that bugs me is the fact that the campaign members have worked very hard on this.  A long time ago we said we would not make it political.  It is not about scoring points, but it is about supporting a system that works and has worked for years in Midleton.  Dr. Kelleher is right.  I have seen it and I know the residents who get the bus, who go to the supermarket and who go dancing.  I will put it very bluntly here.  I am not knocking the other locations the HSE is talking about but they are totally and utterly inappropriate for the residents of the Owenacurra Centre because they have been integrated into the town.  It is all about location and access.  To add to that, my fear and that of others is that the additional services at the Owenacurra Centre, not the premises, will be lost.  There were 22 beds originally.  Two of those beds are short-term respite, so that the individual and the family can get short-term respite.  When the individual cmes in, they got a blood test, they are made comfortable, they have a shower and their feet are checked.  If they need a chiropodist, one will be found.  The dentist is across the road and the doctor, the hospital and the Garda barracks are nearby and the market is out the back.  If that is not a model to be replicated and invested in, I cannot figure out the HSE.<\/p><p>We are 12 months down the road from the original closing date and the building is not fit-for-purpose or fit for the residents.  If you go back to 2016, why has it been suitable for the last six years?<\/p><p>I want to thank the Joint Committee on Health because it has been supportive.  This is one of my bugbears.  We are supposed to be the legislators and the people who look after the citizens of this country.  It will call it a recommendation or a conclusion but it is like the old story of the 40,000 troops marching.  The mother says, &quot;Look, 39,999 of them are out of step, but my Johnny is the only one who is walking right&quot;.  This is the game I feel the HSE is playing.  I want to put the health committee's letter on the record:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn light of the above we again recommend that you reverse the closure of the Owenacurra Centre and request that Cork\/Kerry HSE pursue essential building works on the premises that have already been identified in independent reports.  The reasons advanced by Cork\/Kerry HSE for closing this highly valued service would, if applied elsewhere, lead to widespread closures of other mental health facilities, and are not credible grounds for such a drastic service decision in East Cork.  The Owenacurra Centre has consistently received higher annual Mental Health Commission inspection compliance ratings than the two nearest continuing care facilities... <\/blockquote> <p>The two facilities are Glanmire and St. Catherine&rsquo;s ward in Cork, so you are taking it from the boiling pot and putting in the fire.  In addition, these are very isolated locations.<\/p><p>The letter continues, &quot;The loss of the Owenacurra Centre, including its town centre location, would involve far-reaching adverse consequences for one of the most vulnerable groups of people attending the East Cork mental health services and would constitute a regression in their care and rehabilitation.&quot;<\/p><p>This is the recommendation from the committee to the HSE.<\/p><p>It is personal because mental health services are in my blood.  Between 2000 and 2002, we had 69 suicides in east Cork.  It is not a proud boast but it is a fact and I like dealing with facts.  We have a very large cemetery in the town and it is called suicide row.  We were labelled the suicide capital of the world in 2004.  These are not boasting points.  We are being told one of the finest working centres in east Cork that should be replicated as a pilot project is to close and the service is not needed.  The excuse of the HSE is that the building is not fit-for-purpose.When these people are gone, nobody else is going to need the service and nobody else is going to get sick.  That is totally unacceptable to me and I am bitter and angry that the witnesses, as family members, have to appear in front of any Oireachtas committee to fight their cause.  It could be me, my parent or anybody's parent who could end up in this service.<\/p><p>This service is needed in Midleton.  I spoke to a lady a number of weeks ago who called to that centre looking for help.  She was woken by a garda on Sunday morning just after 7 a.m.  She slept in her car.  She was met by the staff, who are absolutely amazing, but they could not do anything because they were under the orders of the HSE.  That lady told me that she put her own vomit into a bag and put it into the boot of the car.  Obviously, she had nowhere to go to the toilet, so she put that bag into the boot of the car too.  If that is the way we are treating the most vulnerable citizens in this country, the HSE is nothing short of an absolute disgrace.  We are treating people as PPS numbers rather than treating the person.  <\/p><p>I will finish on the next point because, Chair, I could be here until next Thursday.<\/p><p>HSE management has made many dismissive comments.  We have tried to engage with them.  I have received numerous replies to parliamentary questions on the matter.  I have the official reports with me today.  I have received 600 petitions asking for this service not to close.  The most important thing here is not the actual building; it is the services provided, the service users and the residents who are using the services.  Family members are visiting Leinster House today.  I met them last week with the First Minister-designate, Michelle O'Neill.  I will put it this way and will be polite about it.  We were not refused entry to the Owenacurra Centre, but we were not facilitated by HSE management.  Despite that, we went to the centre and we met with residents there.  The people with me on the visit remarked how integrated the residents were.  The HSE could take them out of the setting and send them to St. Stephen's Hospital in Sarsfield Court in Glanmire.  It has been there since the 1950s.  My own grandmother was incarcerated in there because she had TB, Lord have mercy on her.  If that is how mental health services for elderly people are being progressed in this country, we should be absolutely and utterly ashamed.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022070700002#K00300","speaker":"1452","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I welcome our witnesses from east Cork.  Like Deputy Buckley, I wish to state that it is a pity that we are here today.  I recognise that there is a balance to strike between the needs of the residents, who are citizens; the family members, who provided a powerful testimony today; and the report of the Mental Health Commission and the HSE.  I was at the HSE briefing on the closure of Owenacurra a few weeks ago with Deputy Buckley.  I have spoken to Deputies O'Connor, Stanton and Sherlock about the matter.  I have to be honest.  Like Deputy Buckley, my concern here is that we need to ensure, first of all, that the people who use the service in Owenacurra are housed, cared for and looked after in a building and a facility that is not just adequate, but meets their needs.  That is my first point.<\/p> <p>  I might be speaking out of turn when I make my second point, because I was not at the meeting yesterday.  I ask that following today's meeting we consider inviting representatives of the Mental Health Commission and the HSE to attend the committee.  I accept the point that the proposed transfer of the service to different locations and the whole issue around the provision of the service has been very badly handled by HSE management.  My only motivation is to ensure that a state-of-the-art residential unit is put in place for the residents.  We must ensure that the continuum of care and service delivery is such that both family members and service users can be absolutely satisfied and quality of life is guaranteed for residents.<\/p> <p>  I would like to hear the views of Dr. Kelleher on the report of the Mental Health Commission and on the HSE estates management report, both of which have been presented to us.  I thank the case manager for the excellent presentation that she gave today.  The HSE estates management department is giving us a different view from what we have heard from the family members today.  I ask for the views of Dr. Kelleher on the reports I mentioned previously.  I thank the family members for being here today.

However, the Mental Health Commission has stated that it is legally precluded from doing so, or from commenting on the closure.  We are struggling with the fact that initially, the Mental Health Commissioner appeared on RT&Eacute; Radio 1's \"Drivetime\" to discuss the issue.  The position is that family members cannot be involved.  As family members who are really struggling with the decision, we do not really know where to go.  We would definitely like the Mental Health Commission to be involved.<\/p> <p>  The rationale for the closure has been based on a report published by the HSE estates management department.  The report does not provide any evidence of a new building survey that supports the claim that the building is not fit for purpose.  There are independent asbestos and fire safety reports that were published in 2019 and 2021.  The reports set out the works that need to be done to bring Owenacurra up to standard.

Deputy Buckley was with me on the day that we met HSE management in Ballincollig.  I am not, for one second, intending to be confrontational here.  I am actually trying to see how we can reach agreement on the issue.  The HSE has stated in a report we have received that it is certain that there is no refurbishment that could deliver the quality of accommodation which the residents deserve, and in line with modern requirements and standards.  As Dr. Kelleher mentioned in her presentation about her aunt, the HSE report states that it understands that moving to a new home will be difficult for each remaining resident, and regrets that it is not possible or safe to refurbish the existing building.  The report goes on to state that the HSE is offering to provide a new type of ten-bed rehabilitative unit in Midleton.  Like other members of the committee, I have to take what HSE management has said at face value.  I appreciate that Dr. Kelleher might have a different view.  On paper, it seems to me that there is a pretty clear choice.  The new rehabilitative unit would be new, modern and fit for purpose.  I ask Dr. Kelleher for her view on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022070700002#L00400","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":640,"content":"<p>My understanding is that there is no funding commitment, no planning permission and no building has been identified for the ten-bed unit that is being proposed.  I am just speaking as a family member here.  I am sure it would take a number of years before the new unit would be up and running.  In the meantime, people like my aunt would be moved elsewhere.  We are very concerned about the fact that one of the reasons being cited for the closure of the centre is that the rooms are too small.  Yet, the alternative accommodation being offered to service users could potentially be on a ward.  My aunt has her own room in Owenacurra.  Some, but not all, of the rooms are small.  There are only 11 residents in the centre at present.  Deputy Hourigan, who has expertise in the area, has indicated that the building can be refurbished.  She has even offered to provide expert guidance on that.  She has suggested that the refurbishment could be done with some of the residents <i>in situ<\/i>.  There are issues with asbestos, which is standard for a building of the centre's age.  In Deputy Hourigan's opinion as an architect, those issues could be dealt with.  Our concern is that there is no funding commitment for the alternative ten-bed unit in Midleton yet.  It has been indicated that there is funding for a three- to four-bed unit, but we do not know any of the details.  In the main, out-of-area placements have been offered to families.

The estimated cost was &euro;1,000 to do the cracks, &euro;3,000 to repair the ceilings, &euro;3,000 to fix the leaks and so on and &euro;300 or so to put in a sink.  Those are minuscule amounts of money.  Those figures date from 2016, when the HSE had not spent money on the place.  I have spoken to many people on this.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Senator Buttimer with regard to the HSE but I wish to touch on the issue of the Mental Health Commission.  The spin from the HSE is that it is the commission's fault that the building is being closed.  However, reports prepared by the commission each year from 2016 to 2020, inclusive, and three reports in 2021 outlined the structural deficiencies within the building or premises.  The commission has been telling the HSE since 2016 that the building is not right and needs to be fixed.  To draw a comparison, if you bring a car for its national car test, NCT, and it fails, you will get a snag list.  When you fix those snags and bring it back to the NCT centre, the car will pass the test as it is roadworthy and fit for purpose.  The HSE failed in that regard.<\/p> <p>  There are buildings similar to this one across the country.  One could start naming all the towns in east Cork that have similar buildings.  They were all built at around the same time, in the 1970s.  If the commission were to inspect those buildings, it would say they are not fit for purpose.  Are we facing a tsunami of closures of centres?<\/p> <p>  When this issue broke, a thing the members of the Owenacurra Centre said that resonates with me was not to move them, but to improve them.  That is the most important point.<\/p><p>It was a simple request from the centre's residents and their families.  Why would the Mental Health Commission not go into the centre?  It is the organisation that calls out construction snags, in that it goes into a place, investigates and says what was wrong with it so that it can then be fixed and everything will work.  The HSE claims that it is because of the Mental Health Commission's report that the HSE has to close the building.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022070700002#M02400","speaker":"1452","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":667,"content":"<p>May I ask a question?

I am in favour of Senator Buttimer's suggestion.  In our game, we listen to both sides of the story and somewhere in the middle is the truth.  My bugbear is someone else being blamed for a body's failings over the years.  My strong opinion is based on evidence that we have dating back to 2016, as well as the mix and match of reports.  When we request fire safety reports, what we get compacted into a single document is something from 2016, the next page or two will relate to 2018 and then there will be half of a fire safety report from 2019.  There is a great deal of misinformation and distortion, but the main issue is that we will lose all services for more than 94,000 people in east Cork, devastate the centre's residents and destroy their families.  There is mention of three-bed units here and three-bed units there but, as Dr. Kelleher mentioned, there is nothing concrete.  It is all just suggestion.<\/p> <p>  We have an ageing population, so I cannot understand why the HSE does not believe that we will not need these services in east Cork any more.  You do not need to be a rocket scientist to know we will.  There will be instances of people needing respite, be it short term or long term, but the HSE seems to be dismissing the need over a single point, namely, that the building is not fit for purpose.  If it is not fit for purpose, then knock it and replace it with a state-of-the-art one, keep the 22 beds, keep all of its services, including the mental health day care and short-term respite, and improve it.  When we lose those staff and services, they will be gone and we will be back here on some other committee - if we are lucky enough - being reactive instead of proactive and asking how we did not see it coming.  It will be on our shoulders because we did not stand up for the people whom we are supposed to represent.  Sometimes, we have to call people out and challenge them.

I could get angry about this matter, and I am doing my best to hold my patience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022070700002#N00400","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":670,"content":"<p>Dr. Kelleher does not need to apologise to anyone here for getting upset.  It is the system that should be apologising to her, her family and other families around the country.  I apologise for not recognising Ms Curtis as being the person who brought this petition to us.  The system is wrong.  Dr. Kelleher is not wrong for worrying about her aunt, Anna, nor is any other family.  It makes me angry as well because we have seen what is happening at St. Brigid's in Carrick-on-Suir, whose representatives we hope to speak to after the recess.  There was no mention of St. Brigid's being unfit for purpose when we were told it was closing and staff were being moved due to Covid.  It was not until the hospital was closed that problems with the building suddenly started appearing, something along the lines of what happened at Owenacurra.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Buckley mentioned, there is talk of one of the possible solutions being a building from the 1950s.  I was involved in building for 40 years and I assure the committee that, if there is asbestos in Owenacurra, then there is asbestos in the building that patients are possibly going to be placed in.  I have no doubt about that whatsoever because that is what was being used at the time.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Senator Buttimer.  We will invite the Mental Health Commission, or anyone else, to a meeting.  HIQA was involved in St. Brigid's in the end.  Despite requesting the engineer's report that says that the building is not fit for purpose, we did not get it or we failed to get adequate answers as to why Owenacurra, or anywhere else, was being closed down.  In one of our meetings with the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, we were told that a further 350 beds were to be cut in the area's services.  That will affect more small places like Owenacurra, St. Brigid's and so on.  One of the solutions for St. Brigid's was to move them into private nursing homes, but that was no good to families.  We have no public transport in south Tipperary, so a patient could be moved 25 miles away and family could not get there.  I am sure that Dr. Kelleher's family visits daily.  Families are visiting people in all of these hospitals daily.  Suddenly, they are being told that their family members are being moved 25 or 30 miles away.  That is not good enough.<\/p> <p>  I do not have further questions, but no member of the committee will disagree with me when I say that it is great to see how much Dr. Kelleher cares for her family member.  She must not apologise to anyone for fighting to keep her aunt where she is happy and can be looked after.  From listening to Deputy Buckley, Dr. Kelleher and Senator Buttimer, Owenacurra is a place that looks after family members, so they should not apologise to anyone for fighting to keep it open.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022070700002#N00500","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":671,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022070700002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Orla Kelleher"},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":672,"content":"<p>Do Deputy Buckley and Senator Buttimer have further questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022070700002#N00700","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":673,"content":"<p>No.  I thank our guests for attending.

Difficulties surrounded the whole thing from the word go when it bought it.

There is talk of demolishing another 15 units in the middle of the estate in order to get access to another field that the council owns.  It is crazy that the original scheme passed planning and was given the go-ahead only to discover thereafter that there were so many problems subsequently.

To date, 26 of the 31 local authorities have replied.  Only Carlow County Council, Galway County Council, Kildare County Council, Westmeath County Council and Wexford County Council are yet to reply.  The secretariat has reviewed these responses.  On the basis of this review, we know that those 26 local authorities all still use chemical herbicides in public areas.  However, the vast majority are reducing their use of chemical herbicides with some only using them for limited specific purposes and many also using and trialling non-chemical alternatives, such as Foamstream and the mechanical removal of weeds.  For example, Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have phased out the use of chemical herbicides in many public places.  These local authorities now only use chemical herbicides in public areas to treat invasive alien species which are particularly difficult to remove and in specific public settings, such as golfing greens in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and graveyards in Fingal.<\/p> <p>  Some local authorities also noted that while they are trying to minimise the use of chemicals, it is difficult to remove invasive alien species, such as Japanese knotweed and giant hogweed, on a large scale without glyphosate.  Others local authorities including Wicklow County Council and Fingal County Council have developed policies which aim to reduce the use of chemical herbicides further.  Overall, there is a positive and proactive movement across most of the country to reduce the use of chemical herbicides in public areas.<\/p> <p>  The committee recommends that: the secretariat follow up one last time with those local authorities yet to reply; the secretariat continue with its review of the local authority responses and work on its report on banning herbicides in public areas over the summer recess; and note in the committee's report if any of the outstanding local authorities fail to respond to the final reminder.

On behalf of the committee,  I welcome: Ms Catherine Cox, head of communications and policy, and Mr. Damien Douglas from Family Carers Ireland; and Mr. Pat Carty, chairman, and Mr. Kenneth Fox, CEO, from the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate when they are within the precincts of Leinster House.  In this regard, if members are joining us remotely, they should indicate whether they are within the precincts of Leinster House.  Due to unprecedented circumstances, witnesses are joining us remotely, so we may run into technical difficulties.  If that happens, I ask everyone to please bear with us.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the formalities regarding privilege.  Witnesses are directed only to give evidence on the subject matter of these proceedings and to respect the parliamentary practice that we do not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or entity outside of the Houses in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  If they are directed by the committee to case giving evidence, they must respect that.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  Without further ado, I call on Ms Cox and Mr. Douglas to make their opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#A00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I thank the committee members for the opportunity to speak today regarding inclusive transport for persons with disabilities.  Our opening statements will focus specifically on the motorised transport grant and the mobility allowance - both withdrawn in 2013 - and Revenue's disabled drivers and passengers scheme.  The latter is only remaining transport scheme available to people with disabilities and their family carers.  We believe that denying people access to transport is, by default, denying them access to employment, education and the right to interact in their community.<\/p> <p>  The motorised transport grant and mobility allowance were introduced in 1968 and 1979, respectively, meaning that for 45 years they formed a vital part of the transport infrastructure that enabled people with disabilities to live independently in their communities.  The Department of Health's announcement in February 2013 that both schemes would be discontinued because they were in breach of the Equal Status Act resulted in a profound loss to people with disabilities and their wider families.  In many cases, adapted vehicles secured under the motorised transport grant were purchased and driven by a family member of a person with a disability.  The removal of these financial supports meant that many family carers could no longer afford to purchase accessible vehicles or pay for the fuel or taxi costs necessary to transport their loved ones.  As members can appreciate, this has been greatly exacerbated by spiralling fuel costs.<\/p> <p>  The withdrawal of both schemes was supposed to be a short-term measure.  The failure to replace them during the past decade, despite many commitments to do so, has led to the illogical situation whereby those who received a mobility allowance prior to 2013 have been allowed to keep it, while others who are equally deserving and in need of transport support are locked out of the scheme.  It also means that the only transport support available is the disabled drivers and passengers scheme, which is targeted only at those with severe physical disabilities, with no support available to those with intellectual or non-physical disabilities.<\/p> <p>  It has been recognised for many decades that transport costs are higher for many disabled people.  Transport is also recognised as one of the essential services required to realise independent living.<\/p><p>However, research shows that the cost of transport limits their decision to travel.  Many have to rely on family and friends, which reduces their independence.<\/p><p> Family Carers Ireland believes that a one-size-fits-all system for mobility support will not work.  Neither will an attempt to shoehorn people with disabilities into existing transport schemes.  Rather, we recommend the continued payment of a cash allowance.  This would give people with disabilities and their carers greater choice and flexibility in the type of transport they choose to use.  This is particularly important for those living in rural areas.  Existing schemes, such as Accessible Community Transport Southside and Vantastic, should be fully evaluated.  If they are found to meet the needs of people with a disability and their families they should be adequately funded.<\/p><p> The disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme offered by Revenue is the only remaining transport scheme available to people with disabilities and their families.  It provides a range of tax reliefs linked to the purchase of specially adapted vehicles, exemptions from motor tax and toll fees and eligibility for a fuel grant.  These are all incredibly valuable provisions for people with disabilities and their families.  Our issues relate to eligibility for the scheme rather than what it offers.  The requirement to satisfy the overly stringent medical criteria associated with qualifying for a primary medical certificate, including the need to prove that a person is completely or almost completely without the use of both legs or hands, is exclusionist.  Persons with disabilities, as defined under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, include those who have long-term mental, intellectual or sensory impairments.  The excessively restrictive criteria exclude this group from the scheme.  Eligibility for the scheme should focus less on people's medical conditions and more on how they function in society.  We call for eligibility for the scheme to be extended to include those with non-physical disabilities.<\/p><p> I will now hand over to Mr. Damien Douglas, who is a family carer for his two daughters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Cox","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  As a father of two severely physically and intellectually disabled children, my family benefits from the disabled drivers and passengers scheme.  We are thankful for this.  My twin girls, Una and Ailis, fit the criteria for a primary medical certificate which qualifies them for the scheme as passengers.  We need a specially adapted long-wheeled vehicle with lift and clamps to transport them.  They are both in wheelchairs.  Without this vehicle, the girls would be prisoners in their own home because it would be impossible to bring them together anywhere on a bus or taxi.  They attend day services but we have to bring and drop them because transport is not provided.<\/p> <p>  Many family carers look after children and adults who are no less disabled than Una and Ailis but because they have the use of their hands and legs they do not qualify for the primary medical certificate and, therefore, cannot participate in the scheme.  They are on disability payments, their family carer qualifies for carer's allowance or benefit and their disabilities are undeniable but they do not qualify because they do not fit the very restricted criteria as laid down in respect of the scheme.  Those who are autistic or display severe behavioural issues do not qualify.  Gigantism does not qualify but dwarfism does.  Often in areas of the country where there is no or very limited public transport, these families have no other options for transport.  Access to transport is very important to go shopping and attend day services, medical appointments, social outings and religious events.  Not to have appropriate transport or access to it is another form of discrimination for people of all disabilities.  It is a form of imprisonment.<\/p> <p>  \"Buy your own car\", you might say.  We already know that most full-time carers barely make ends meet and may not be able to afford this huge expense.  In our case, to provide the type of vehicle we, as a family, require costs more than &euro;50,000.  This is not luxury but a necessity.  Having access to the drivers and passengers with disabilities scheme may enable families to afford transport that meets their needs and lightens their burden a little bit.<\/p> <p>  I thank committee members for their time and attention.

It is an organisation of people with disabilities and has approximately 5,000 members.  As the name suggests, the founding members had a strong view that personal transport was key to fulfilling many of the principles now outlined in Article 3 of the UNCRPD.  These include the freedom to make one's own choices, independence of persons, full and effective participation and inclusion in society, equality of opportunity and accessibility.<br\/><br\/>Throughout our 50 years in existence, we have campaigned on the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax relief scheme and the mobility allowance and associated motorised transport grant.  These are part of the committee's deliberations today.  Having advised and supported thousands of applicants for the schemes we are well aware of the benefits they have provided as well as their shortcomings that put them beyond the reach of many with a genuine need.  The schemes have their origins in the late 1960s, so it is not surprising that difficulties have been highlighted by the public, their representatives, the Ombudsman and the Supreme Court.  Our vision, and the public vision, for a person with a disability has been completely transformed in this time.  The principles quoted above represent only a small part of the vision outlined in the UNCRPD.  The schemes represent the State's attempts to fulfil the requirements of Article 5, which states, &quot;Specific measures which are necessary to accelerate or achieve de facto equality of persons with disabilities shall not be considered discrimination under the terms of the present Convention&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The mobility allowance has been suspended for more than nine years.  Although it was a major support for the declining numbers who were in receipt of it prior to 2013, it is now a failed measure and a source of continuing inequality in that two persons with identical circumstances have different experiences.  Someone who met the income requirements and acquired a qualifying disability in January 2013 may continue to receive it.  Another person in identical circumstances who acquired an identical disability in April 2013 of afterwards is excluded.  The mobility allowance shows recognition by the State that in order to achieve the freedom to make one&rsquo;s own choices, independence, full and effective participation and inclusion in society and equality of opportunity, individually targeted specific measures on mobility are necessary to accelerate or achieve <i>de facto<\/i>equality of persons with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>While views are expressed that improvements in the accessibility of public transport and a broader availability of accessible public transport will address the needs of people with disabilities we argue strongly that personal transport measures are also necessary.  The disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax relief scheme is the only remaining scheme supporting personal transport that is still open to new applicants.  It has been very effective, as evidenced by its longevity, and provides support to around 15,000 participants.  The scheme is, in principle, intended to fund the adaptations that are necessary for disabled drivers and disabled passengers.  In practice it has provided general support to a disabled person to remain mobile.  A simplified explanation of how the scheme works is that the tax relief provides a market advantage which compensates the disabled person for the adaptations employed.  Provided full market value resales can be achieved with each vehicle change disabled persons can maintain their transport even on a relatively modest income.  If people with disabilities on low incomes are in receipt of the mobility allowance this further helps contribute to the running costs.<br\/><br\/>At its height, the tax relief might have contributed relief of 35% of the cost of a vehicle.  However, the scheme is very susceptible to changes in vehicle registration tax, VRT, and VAT policy, including the margin scheme, and new taxes such as the nitrogen oxide emissions charge.  Thus, the allowances can be eroded or the market advantage reduced.  The allowances are now closer to providing less than 25% of the purchase value of the vehicle in most cases.<\/p><p>Even when the scheme offered the greatest relief relative to the total cost, the applicant needed the resources to fund 65% of the cost of the vehicles.  Vehicles with the least adaptation have wider appeal in the resale market and therefore achieve better relative resale prices.  Thus, the scheme tends to favour those with the most resources and the least vehicle adaptation.  The motorised transport grant was often used as a way of getting on the first step of the mobility ladder of the tax relief scheme.  The uptake of the motorised transport grant was low, with about 300 applicants per annum and the word \"grant\" is probably a slight misnomer, as it was essentially a cash advance on the mobility allowance to contribute to the purchase of a vehicle.  It should be remembered that as a means to get started on the tax relief scheme, the grant might only be claimed once.  For subsequent purchases, applicants would rely on the tax relief scheme and keep their mobility allowance for vehicle running costs.<\/p><p> For those unable to access the scheme, a car purchased using the motorised transport grant might be kept for a long time.  I am aware of one example where a car purchased with grant aid is now 14 years old.  The  Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland, DDAI, still gets inquiries from people seeking to repeat the process nine years after the mobility allowance scheme was closed to new applicants.  The tax relief scheme has become less attractive to those with limited resources because of the greater initial capital required and the absence of a mobility allowance to assist those with limited incomes with maintenance costs.<\/p><p> The most recent criticism of the tax relief scheme has concerned the access criteria.  These have changed little since the 1960s and select a limited number of conditions as approximations of those who might require adapted vehicles.  The spectrum of persons with a disability needing a vehicle adaptation has broadened considerably, and this is what was demonstrated in the Supreme Court judgment.  Necessary and expensive adaptations to enable disabled people to drive are not all related to the ability to walk and there are equally necessary adaptations on the passenger side that have more to do with environment and safety than mobility.  Equally, because there is no correlation between the medical criteria and the extent of adaptation required, there is little correlation between the level of adaptation required and the allowances offered.  The graduation of benefits is solely on the driver&rsquo;s side, which is in itself iniquitous.<\/p><p> An emerging issue with the tax relief scheme is that its design is firmly rooted in fossil fuel vehicles, such as the fuel grant, for example, and its mechanisms are not well suited to the current tax structure for electric vehicles in terms of market advantage.  Its direction of flow is counter to Government policy regarding motor vehicles in general.  Thus, if Government policy is successful, disabled persons need to be equally incentivised to adopt electric vehicles.  It is not intended to dwell on the importance of social interaction or access to education and employment because the whole population now certainly knows the experience of what a predecessor of mine referred to as being stuck at home beside the fire.  It is, instead, more important to return to the necessity for personal transport supports, as distinct from extended accessible public transport.  Anyone living in rural Ireland is familiar with the necessity of personal transport for access.  When it comes to disability, however, the same can be true in an urban setting.<\/p><p> The DDAI is an administrator of the disabled person&rsquo;s parking permit scheme under legislation for more than 50,000 permit holders.  In total, between our fellow administrators in the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, and our group, there are almost 120,000 permit holders.  We have some experience of having to operate within the constraints of legislation and regulation but one of the definitions in the context of existing permit holders is the inability to walk more than 50 m.  It is unlikely that more than a small proportion of those permit holders live, work and are educated within 50 m of a public transport access point, nor is it expected that access points will or should be placed at intervals of 50 m.  The fact is that for many the alternatives of walking, cycling or hopping on an electric scooter do not exist for a person with a disability.  Equally, it is well accepted that there are those for whom public transport systems in themselves provide too challenging an environment.  In this context, personal transport is an important and necessary alternative.  Families and individuals have proven themselves as willing as any other citizens to invest in their own transport, but in many cases there are significant additional costs - in some cases more than the cost of the vehicle purchase itself.  <\/p><p> If the State is to meet its obligation regarding specific measures which are necessary to accelerate or achieve de facto equality of persons with disabilities, supports need to be in place for those for whom public transport, however accessible, is not a viable alternative to achieving that equality of access.  The experience concerning the mobility allowance has been traumatic for the community and the legacy of that experience is that, whatever the flaws in the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax relief scheme, and those are great, it is currently the only support available.  The greatest fear of those relying on the scheme is that faced with too many complications, the State will simply drop the scheme altogether.  The suspension of the scheme for new entrants for some months, while unavoidable, did not allay any of those fears that a repeat of the mobility allowance experience was about to occur. <\/p><p> At present, combining the mobility allowance and tax relief schemes, fewer than 20,000 persons are supported in this way.  In the United Kingdom, just over 2 million people receive a payment specifically related to mobility, which is roughly equivalent to 150,000 people in the Republic.  These payments in turn provide access to other self-supporting vehicle leasing mechanisms, of which approximately one third avail.  A targeted personal transport support system is needed for people with a disability.  Equally, clarity is needed on who should be supported and why they need to be supported, as well as better integration between the needs of the individual and the level of the support provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenneth Fox","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":723,"content":"<p>We go now to members for questions and answers.

I will have to feel my way as I go.  I thank the representatives of the DDAI and Family Carers Ireland, FCI, for their presentations.  I come across this issue regularly in my constituency and in other areas.  I remember there being issues with the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant as far back as the time when I was a councillor for 12 or 13 years, starting in 1999.  I also remember chasing the mobility grant and being able to get taxis for some people to and from places.  A recent case I dealt with involved questioning the HSE on transport.  The response stated that there was an ongoing issue for some individuals in assessing HSE-funded day services and rehabilitation training programmes.  Furthermore, it stated that no resources were allocated for the provision of transport to new or returning entrants.  This is a ridiculous situation.  Doing away with the mobility grant was a disaster.  We would like to see it reinstated in some form.<\/p> <p>  We constantly come across issues when it comes to transport.  Every stop should be pulled out to help people with disabilities.  There should be no barriers to how we help people and it does not matter what the disability is.  When it comes to severe disabilities, the witnesses outlined that it is possible to avail of the present grant.  It is different for anyone outside that context.<\/p><p>It is a whole battle to get any sort of grant.  What happens when the vehicles reach a certain age and must undergo the national car test, NCT?  If vehicles have to go after four years or three years to undergo the NCT, what way does that work?  Do people get help with that?  Is any help available in that regard?  What amount of grant is available at the moment if a person is applying for a grant for someone?  The witnesses mentioned family members or otherwise.  There seems to be restrictions in terms of family members, which I find a bit difficult.  Only recently, my sister bought a disabled vehicle and had to pay for it because the whole process was too messy.  She gets a certain amount back but it did end up costing her a substantial amount of money.  People with disabilities are on, in many cases, &euro;208 or whatever it is.  It is not even enough to get by on.  With inflation the way it is, obviously, that is a massive thing.<\/p><p> I also want to ask about Vantastic.  I recall having made loads of arguments in the past about Vantastic but it does not take people to, say, day centres.  Is there a role in which Vantastic can be utilised or funded better in a way that it could fill a gap by taking people to and from appointments or otherwise?  I am just not sure what the position is.<\/p><p> I was taken by the fact that once artists who have disabilities earn more than &euro;140, they are penalised in whatever State payment they receive, which I find really hard to understand.  They should be given the security of having a payment that is not touched in order that they can get on with whatever they are trying to do or whatever type of work they are doing.  Penalising them like that is absolutely wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#C00300","speaker":"1470","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":726,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy very much.

Many families tell us they may be offered a day service but they are told they have to provide their own transport and, in some cases, that is just not possible due to the costs, in particular.  I know that is a huge challenge for families.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Vantastic, and there is another scheme called Accessible Community Transport Southside, ACTS, we said they should be fully evaluated to find out how good they are.  If they are deemed to meet the needs of people with disabilities and their families, we believe they should be adequately funded.   At the moment, however, they are not.  Therefore, they have gaps in their funding and that is why some of them have either stopped or folded.  I think there is room to look at those to see whether they could provide accessible transport to day services, for example, and schools as well.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the cost of a disability in a home, we did research very recently with the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  The findings were that it costs &euro;244 per week more to provide care for a person with a disability in a home than it does in another home without a person with a disability.  That is &euro;244 on top of the other costs, and one of those costs in particular relates to transport.  Another cost is buying in therapy services.  There is no doubt that there is a cost in disability, which chimes with the Indecon report on the cost of disability.<\/p> <p>  I cannot believe we are sitting here nine years later and we still have no transport supports.  The mobility allowance and motorised grant have not been replaced.  It is inequitable, unfair and outrageous that there is still no support there to replace that.  Rather than bring standards up and bring everybody into the loop for the mobility allowance, it was stopped completely and everybody was ruled out.  That for us is a huge injustice and inequity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Cox"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":728,"content":"<p>On the technical side, I will just echo something Ms Cox said to give an example.  I remember when the mobility allowance was in progress.  There was a student in Dublin who was quite happy to use public transport to get to lectures.  There were vagaries that might occur at times with being left behind at bus stops or not being able to get on certain buses and things like that.  For examinations, however, this student would get Vantastic or the Lucan Disability Action Group, as it was at the time, to pick them up and take them from door to door.  That kind of reliable door-to-door transport is what Ms Cox is speaking about.  The mobility allowance was saved and was crucial to those kinds of door-to-door transports when a person had to be somewhere at a certain time.  Individuals saved that money for those occasions.<\/p> <p>  To go through the grant values for the tax relief scheme, the grant level for a passenger is a fixed &euro;15,000 or &euro;16,000 now.  The point I was making was that the cost for a person's adaptations, say, for a vehicle that has a lower floor and is wheelchair accessible with lowered floor accessibility, is probably &euro;30,000.  Tax relief is &euro;15,000 but a person gets the same relief if he or she is putting in a swivel seat, which is probably less than &euro;2,000 - maybe &euro;1,500.  There is a notion that there is not actually any graduation.  There is a bit of graduation on the driver's side so, in fact, the driver gets &euro;10,000 for his or her adaptations.  If a person is in a wheelchair accessible vehicle in which he or she is driving from a wheelchair, he or she will get &euro;15,000.  The passenger has to keep the vehicle for two years, but the driver must keep it for three years.  If that person has what are called extensive adaptations with specialised braking or specialised steering and wheelchair accessibility, there is a grant of &euro;22,500 but the driver would have to keep that vehicle for five years.  Again, that is a lot of graduation on the driver's side in terms of limits and the length of time a person has to keep the vehicle, but there are none on the passenger's side.<\/p> <p>  The whole scheme presupposes that a person will only qualify if there is an adaptation to be made to the vehicle.  Therefore, the basis of the original scheme was compensation for adaptation.  The use of the scheme has changed.  In general, in terms of a wider view of what people need for transport and why people need transport, that is not the structure of the legislation for the scheme.  There is, therefore, nothing for all those categories of people about whom Ms Cox spoke in her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenneth Fox"},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":729,"content":"<p>We will now go to Senator O'Loughlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#D00500","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":730,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cox, Mr. Douglas and Mr. Fox very much.  I apologise; I missed some of the discussion because Senators were called to a vote in the Seanad.  Forgive me if I repeat or ask questions about which the witnesses have already spoken.<\/p> <p>  I completely agree with all the points I have heard from the witnesses with regard to the absolute need for people with disabilities to be able to access both personal and public transport and the different schemes.  It is quite shocking to think that the two schemes were done away with in 2013 because at that stage they were not considered equitable, and at this point there has still been nothing to replace them.  Mr. Fox gave the example of two people in exactly the same situation who were three months apart and one could access the scheme but one could not.<\/p><p>I remember dealing with one mother whose child with special needs needed to go to a particular school but was not covered under the school transport.  She had to drive her daughter behind a school bus bringing other young people who were able to avail of the mobility allowance but her daughter could not.  There were spaces and seats on the bus.  As she said, every morning she drove behind this bus for 45 minutes.  It did not make sense.  I am very glad the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for disability, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, has convened that group to look at the whole transport area.  Have the witnesses' groups been included in that group?  I hope representatives from the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Association and from Family Carers Ireland have been included because that lived experience is really important.  What key changes coming from that group do the witnesses believe need to be introduced to ensure a needs-led and rights-based scheme?<\/p><p> I have one or two other brief points.  In terms of people being isolated and connectivity, it is important to every one of us but particularly to people who are isolated in other ways.  It is heartbreaking to see people with disabilities being excluded sometimes from work, from social events and from being able to do the very basic things they want to do with dignity and independently.  I worked with Special Olympics Ireland for a period of time and looked at the challenges.  Where there was a Special Olympics club, it was very difficult for athletes to go to the activities because of the issue around transport.  There seemed to be a view generally that the Local Link service was not fit for purpose, which is such a shame.  We have quite a good service in Kildare.  That is possibly down to the chief executive, Mr. Alan Kelly, but there is a lot of scope and potential to make it better.  Could the witnesses talk a little about that?  Obviously it is hugely important we have wheelchair accessible mini buses day and night to provide transport into hubs to train stations, etc.  Yesterday we had the Oireachtas Work Learning programme, OWL, graduation where we have had young people with disabilities from both WALK and KARE working in Leinster House.  It is wonderful and six of the ten have got jobs but I spoke to some of them about how they actually got into Leinster House.  One particular issue is lifts at stations.  Newbridge is my own local station and I am constantly on to it because the lift is not working.  It is hugely important to get those basic things right.<\/p><p> I thank Mr. Douglas for talking about his daughters and I completely understand where he is coming from and the need that is there.

The primary medical certificate is very restrictive.  You have to have either no use of your hands or legs, have only one arm or one leg or be a dwarf, because you cannot reach, to qualify.  I am not being funny there.  If you are 7 ft. 6 in. and are totally disabled, you do not qualify because you have the use of your hands and legs.  If you have severe intellectual disability but you can walk and talk, you do not qualify or your mother does not qualify on your behalf, which is a huge anomaly.  We are looking at the needs of the people with disabilities themselves and at the needs of those who care for them, which is where I come in to it.  My girls cannot go out on their own.  They can do nothing for themselves.  Many people with disabilities need a considerable amount of care and assistance and, in the main, that is provided by their families or by other professional caregivers.  The people with the disabilities themselves are not able to do it.  Likewise with disabled drivers, those adaptations they need are essential to give them the mobility and the independence they need.  We know approximately only one third of carers get the carers allowance and that is because of means testing.  Two thirds are probably working and that disqualifies them.  Any changes or cost involved have to be met from their means.  Those who qualify for the carers allowance, and we are very grateful for it for those who do, are still means tested and means limited.  This means a person does not have a huge bank account or money in their back pocket to provide, for example, the &euro;50,000 for the van we needed.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Fox mentioned the importance of the grant initially, in that it gave families a lift up towards the purchase of a van.  Every two or three years when the van was replaced, the amount to be covered was less.  The value of the van was such that the amount to be paid for a new vehicle was less, in that the resale value was good.  This is only if you are lucky enough to be able to get an appropriate vehicle.<\/p> <p>  In regard to public transport, I live in Lucan and if I want to go into town with my two girls on what used be the 25A bus, but which is now the C1 or C2, I cannot do so because no bus will take two wheelchairs.  That is the reality.  For family days out, if we did not have a vehicle, we would be stuck at home or have a nice long walk into the Phoenix Park, which is not manageable.  If I want to get a taxi, I can get a wheelchair taxi fairly easily but no wheelchair taxi will take two wheelchairs.  There is a dearth of availability there, never mind the difficulty trying to get a wheelchair taxi on occasion, even in Lucan.  Lucan Disability Action Group will provide transport but you have to book it well in advance and most times it is not available because they are already providing transport on a contractual basis to other families or other services such as to Stewarts or St. John of God.  When you need them, those vehicles are not always available.  If you are trying to organise your life around a time that suits your family, you are banjaxed.  I thank the members for listening to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Douglas"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":734,"content":"<p>Senator O'Loughlin asked if we were included in the group.

Whether it is an allowance, a voucher or a cash allowance, if people need to pay for a taxi, adapt their car or whatever, that system needs to be flexible enough to look at individual needs rather than pushing everyone into one type of system.  It is a bit like respite around the country.  There is definitely a postcode lottery.  Where you live determines how good or bad the service you will get is.  We need to see consistency and equity of access, right across the country and that is why it is so important that the mobility allowance and the motorised transport scheme are replaced.

I raise this among Fine Gael Parliamentary Party members, in the Seanad, and in the context of wherever I can and we can say that for those who get access to schemes, the schemes are inadequate and not fit for purpose.  Then we have the incredible cohort who do not get access to schemes at all.  We have those two divisions.  I am mindful that earlier this year, the disability advisory committee resigned <i>en masse<\/i>in protests against the fact that it was discriminatory and unfit for purpose.  I wanted to mention that in the context of our debate.<\/p><p>My thinking is heavily influenced by two individuals.  One, Maureen McGovern who came before this committee in the context to access to public life, politics and participation.  She is a disability activist in Chapelizod and Ballyfermot and she described her experience of sexual violence on leaving the house, of being imprisoned in her house because of the lack of the access to funding, and the ability to get out and about and the infrastructure of our footpaths, let alone having everything else that should flow from that.<\/p><p>My second big influencer, who is in my ear all of the time, is Gr&aacute;inne Leach.  She was in an accident in her early 20s and lost her arm.  It is now a number of decades since then and she has never qualified for any scheme even though she is now experiencing significant disability in the arm she has relied on because it has been overused for years.  This shows how inadequate the scheme is for the person who is fully qualified for it, and for those outside the remit of the scheme, they suffer dreadfully as a consequence.  Underneath all of this, it is a horribly cruel irony that the exclusion of people and ending of schemes was as a result of a decision under the Equal Status Act.  The irony of that is not lost on me.<\/p><p>Looking at where we are now, we have a transport group.  I am disturbed to hear that witnesses have not had access to that yet.  It is crucial and important that we make sure there is engagement with them and that we hear from them.  As a committee, we can write and ask for that.  What do the witnesses want us to do?  Our committee is about articulating that.  As individual party members, we are advocates within our own parties.  What three things do witnesses want here and now?

I refer to the report by the former Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, called Grounded.  Everything he said in that report made perfect sense.  For us as a quick fix, I do not know but we need to see an allowance brought back, whatever it may look like.  How it could take nine years is beyond me.  We need to see that and that needs to be a payment.  The Government did it in the past with home care, where cash vouchers were available and people could buy in care, whatever it looked like.  The responsibility was placed on the family but at least they had a choice.  For us, that choice is what is most important, as well as a system that is simple, flexible and meets those needs.<\/p> <p>  On the budget, we obviously represent family carers and we want to see the means test for the carer's allowance, for example, abolished.  We want to see carer's paid for the work they do.  We want it to be a fair payment and not &euro;224 per week.  The artists were mentioned earlier.  The artist grant is a non-means tested payment of &euro;325 per week, whereas the carer's allowance is &euro;224 per week.  How is that fair?  If carers had a fair payment for the work they do, that would go some way towards paying for the additional costs of transport, along with everything else.  Budget-wise, we would like to see the carer's allowance increased, the means test completely abolished over the coming years, and a flexible allowance for people in order that they can pay for whatever transport they require.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Cox"},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":741,"content":"<p>We would have universality of supply but it would be bespoke to the needs of the individual and his or her family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#F00600","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":742,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Cox"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":743,"content":"<p>Speaking more about families and carers of those with intellectual and physical disabilities, an awful lot of them have not had full participation in anything because of their disabilities.  We are looking at the needs of the carers who have to provide, as advocates, for the people they care for and the needs of those who are intellectually or physically disabled.  For some people, such as my girls, their disabilities are obvious.  If anyone looks at them would say, \"God, the poor things.  It is shocking.\"  There are an awful lot of families whose children and young adults have massive disabilities and just because they look normal, their needs are not perceived as being as severe as they are, or their behaviours are not seen as bad or disruptive as they are.  All of those behaviours affect the normal things we all do, such as hopping into the car for a Sunday afternoon drive, going to McDonald's for a takeaway, or going to the Phoenix Park.  We cannot do that just on a whim.  So much needs to be done.  We cannot even hop on the bus to do that because so many other things have to be taken into account.  It is around that whole mobility issue and the needs.  Many of our children and young adults cannot be put on a double-decker bus because, in many ways,  their behaviour is so disruptive to other passengers or their own needs are such that it does not allow them to interact with people in that way.  The choices we have are very limited.  That is why it is so important to have a means of transport that suits the family needs.<\/p><p>As I said earlier, only a third of family carers get carer's allowance, and the maximum one will get is &euro;224.  Most family carers will not even get that.  That is not both parents.  It is only one carer in the family.  Carers may be allowed to work up to 18 and a half hours per week, which is taken as means, so there is not even the luxury of both carers perhaps working full-time jobs and then having the money to buy the &euro;50,000 vehicle or the vehicle for the sister or whatever else.  People have to club in together or they rely on charity or community groups to help fund them with that.  Of itself, it is great that people are willing to help, but it does nothing for one's pride or dignity.  One knows one is the object of charity.<\/p><p> One is already in a situation whereby one has enough things - I will not call them crosses as that is not the word - to make one's day difficult and long.  Before I came here this morning, we were up at 7 a.m. trying to get the two girls ready to go out.  Mary was going to bring them because I was coming here.  There is an awful lot of stuff to be done before one does anything else.  I do not give out about any of that as that is part of our normality, but what would make our normality easier to bear would be not having to worry about whether I can afford to change the van when it is next due.  I pay a huge amount for insurance because of the type of van it is.  Where does that come from?  That is where the grant one would get every month could be very useful, to be able to put that towards the annual insurance.<\/p><p> Deputy Ellis asked about the NCT.  Thankfully, I have only once kept one of the vans more than four years and we had the NCT, but there is no help towards that.  There is no help towards the running cost of the vans.  There is in England, but not here.  People cover all those costs themselves, which is fine.  That is why most people, if they can, will try to change them every two or three years to minimise those types of servicing costs.  If one gets a hand-up initially, as the &euro;5,000 grant usually gives, it was easier to do that once one got started, but for those families now who are starting off and apply and if they are lucky enough to qualify, they have to bear all those costs themselves.  The sum of &euro;16,000 is the VRT grant one will get and, as far as I am aware, that is all one gets back.  The adaptations to my vehicle will cost over &euro;5,500, with a new floor and changing the lift every time.  That is not covered because the VRT, as far as I understand it, has taken up the maximum availability of assistance on that.<\/p><p> They are hidden costs.  I am not giving out.  I am just saying it is part of the lived experience of many family carers that these are extra burdens they have to carry at a time when they are financially constrained by means tests and everything else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Douglas","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":745,"content":"<p>I have to say, and perhaps this is borne from my experience with the committee on surrogacy, that Mr. Douglas does not have to explain.

While VRT is covered to a limit of &euro;16,000, the hike in VRT on certain vehicles, particularly the larger vehicles we are talking about, is eating into the &euro;16,000.  The NOx tax is refundable but again it eats into the &euro;16,000.  With regard to the &euro;5,500 adaptation grant, people may not realise that in a new vehicle there is VRT on that &euro;5,500 adaptation cost and there is VAT on the &euro;5,500 adaptations.  If they are created in the vehicle before it is registered and if the vehicle draws a VRT rate of 35%, there will be 35% on the &euro;5,500 worth of adaptations and there will be 21% VAT on that as well.  If one has a highly adapted vehicle where the vehicle cost might be &euro;30,000 and there might be &euro;30,000 worth of adaptations, the State is taxing the adaptations as well.  In some cases, it might be giving &euro;16,000 of relief but it has charged quite an amount of tax on the adaptations themselves, not to mind the vehicle.  There are some structural things there, it is all tax law and is quite complicated, but there are things there that do not seem to be right.<\/p> <p>  Ms Cox quoted the example of somebody with the amputation of an arm.  The cost of the probable adaptations to drive as a driver is probably approximately &euro;2,500.  Some of the reluctance is with this business of the primary medical certificate being so different from the actual scheme itself.  If somebody qualifies with the primary medical certificate, the person can go in as a passenger or as a driver.  There is a certain reluctance there for people who would be perceived as not having a need for adaptation as a passenger getting the primary medical certificate while they have very real and expensive needs if they wish to become independent drivers.  What we probably would want people to do is to be supported to get out and about and to go to education and to work independently, not to be driven or to need somebody to drive them but to drive themselves as all of us aspire to do and to make their own way and do their own thing.  That person might have got the motorised transport grant.  It was possible to get the motorised transport grant if one met the means requirements.  However, at present, one cannot get on it, yet the adaptation cost is approximately &euro;2,500, which is a lot more expensive than certain other adaptations that are allowable.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what we might perceive, it is that there is some connection within the scheme, if it is about adaptation, with the adaptations required.  We spoke about the environment and the environment in buses for certain categories of people.  One of the things that came up in the Supreme Court is that the person had a permanent disability and an adaptation was required.  It was not necessarily related but the vehicle had to be adapted because the environment of the vehicle had to be changed for the person to travel in it.  That is where the Supreme Court had the problem.  The person met the requirement, needed an adaptation and had a permanent disability yet could not get the primary medical certificate.<\/p> <p>  It is some correlation of the need and a better correlation within the scheme.  It might need some change but we do not want to be in a situation where we lose it altogether.  Coming behind that is a mobility allowance scheme reinstated and we develop that.  If in time we develop a mobility allowance type of scheme and it supersedes or is better than the tax relief scheme, that is fair enough.  If we need to make changes to the scheme let us make them and bring in a comprehensive mobility scheme behind it that may replace it in the future.  There are changes in tax effected all the time.  The tax relief scheme is a tax relief scheme so if we change our taxes, it immediately impacts.  If we double the amount of VRT on petrol vehicles, it affects the scheme.  If there is no advantage between me buying an electric car and Mr. Carty buying an electric car, it disrupts that market advantage for electric vehicles and it makes electric vehicles unattractive.  What is going to happen in 2030 when the intention is that electric vehicles are what is around and one is going to be heavily penalised for owning a petrol or diesel car?  Where does the disabled driver who is in the scheme go there?  It is only seven years until 2030.  If that is the direction of Government policy, what are we doing in terms of preparing for that on the disability side?<\/p> <p>  There are a few issues there, but I am very much of the opinion that the scheme should be adjusted and then the comprehensive scheme should come in behind it.<\/p><p>As I said, there is fear that we will find too many problems with the scheme, the scheme will collapse and, effectively, we will be waiting another nine years for this replacement scheme to come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenneth Fox","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":750,"content":"<p>Just to add that, I know Ms Cox said we should not have to apologise.

We will probably summarise what they told us and prepare something for the Minster as well to try to help ensure that a workable and adaptable scheme is put in place.<\/p> <p>  It also comes down to individualisation.  I was talking to Gabe Cronnelly the other day.  He is a county councillor in Athenry and is an amputee.  He explained that a friend of his is also an amputee.  Gabe lost his right foot and his friend lost his left foot.  The adaptations they need to their vehicles are completely different, even though both of them are amputees.  Individualisation of support is needed for people because everybody cannot be shoehorned into the one grant or whatever.  There are variances in that.  That is why we need to have a support scheme that is worthwhile and can be adaptable in terms tax changes in budgets or whatever and for people&rsquo;s needs rather than force something on people.  That is the key to a good scheme.  I think I heard from Mr. Fox that we have something in the interim until we get something that will work correctly and properly in the long term.  Is that what he said?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#H00700","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":756,"content":"<p>We have all repeated that the only show in town is the tax relief scheme and we all have this fear.

Everybody is afraid that because of all of this pressure that it is under, it will suddenly fall over and there will then be no scheme and nothing coming to replace it.  Everyone wants improvements or some adjustments to be made to the scheme, probably separately, because even if this comprehensive schemes comes later, being realistic, that will not happen in a day or two or whatever.  Perhaps, in time, it will get replaced.  However, we may have to make some adjustments to the scheme to improve it because it may not be perfect.  Keeping that running is the important thing while building a comprehensive system behind it is the way to go.

On this committee, we are aware of the importance of accessible transport, both public and private.  The motorised transport grant was for the purpose of retaining employment but we have come to realise that transport is necessary for more than employment.  It also gives access to education, shopping and socialising so that people can live independent lives.  The biggest issue is in rural areas.  I live in a rural area and if I did not have personalised transport I would not get to many places.  There is a Local Link service in the county but it is quite sporadic.  Some areas are well serviced and others are not.  I have heard of the Local Link service not accepting the free travel passes of many disabled people attending day services.  I am trying to get clarification on that.  That should not be happening.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses talked about the fact that the motorised transport grant and the mobility allowance were suspended nine years ago with the promise of a new scheme.  They actually gave the new scheme a name and that seems to be all they have done.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Douglas mentioned the Motability scheme in Britain.  I had some discussions with people about that scheme, especially in the North where people can avail of it and have done so for decades.  People find it a good scheme where a car can be leased for a certain number of years.  The insurance and upkeep of the car are covered.  Are witnesses familiar with the scheme?  Do they think it is a good scheme?  Is it something the transport group here should consider?  Are there other schemes in other jurisdictions that should also be considered?  Would it work?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Fox said he was at the initial meeting of this transport group.  I have heard from other groups that were at the initial meeting.  That concerns me because that initial meeting was in January and I do not know what kind of work has happened since then.  I hope there is a good deal of work going on behind the scenes.  There needs to be consultation with groups such as Family Carers Ireland, the DDAI and others.  Members of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach a couple of months ago.  They were engaged with once or twice on the transport scheme and that was it.  They were asked for their submission, but not much happened after that.  <\/p> <p>  I am also concerned about the appeal board because it resigned at the end of last year.  Many people who applied for primary medical certificates have been turned down, have appealed the decision and are waiting.  They are asking me how long must they wait.  There is no board of appeal.  I have submitted parliamentary questions asking what is happening there.  The Department of Health advertised and looked for new people to go onto that.  There are no applicants.  People who were on it are not surprised because the criteria were so stringent.  They were promised a review by the Minister for Finance which has not happened.  It is concerning.  People are applying for that scheme because it is the only scheme.  Most of them will not qualify because the criteria are so stringent.  We need a completely new scheme that covers all levels of need.  I can understand the witnesses&rsquo; concern that if a new scheme was found to be too complicated, it would be suspended like the others.  That is something we do not want to see.<\/p> <p>  The consultation is important.  I know of disabled people who were consulted with by the National Transport Authority, Dublin Bus and so on regarding accessibility.  They have engaged only to have their suggestions and submissions ignored.  We do not want consultation just for the sake of a box-ticking exercise.  It needs to be meaningful and those suggestions that come from disabled people need to be taken on board.  Again, I thank the witnesses for their presentations here this morning. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#J00100","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":761,"content":"<p>I am only familiar with the scheme in Britain through families like ourselves who are in the same situation.  We are part of a support group of families with children who have the same conditions that my girls have.  The Motability scheme in Britain is very useful for many families at a nominal cost of a few hundred pounds.  It might have increased to a thousand or two.  They can change their vehicles every three years.  It is a vehicle of their choice rather than one imposed on them.  It is a vehicle that meets their needs rather than somebody else saying what they want.  The amount they pay is minimal.  As far as I know, the scheme covers insurance and tax.  Any repairs that are needed are covered as well.  Something like that would be very advantageous here.  As far as I know the families do not actually own the cars but at the end of the three years they can hand them back and qualify for new one.  They pay money again but it is a minimal amount.  In Ireland, by contrast, you buy the vehicle.  As far as I know, you cannot lease it.  You have to purchase the vehicle, as passengers.  You cover the cost of it.  The VRT is refunded.  As part of the scheme, the tax is covered for the vehicle, which is much appreciated.  However, you cover your own insurance and all other costs such as repairs.  They are huge amounts.  In our own case, it is very hard to get insurance for a vehicle like ours.  As far as I know, AXA is the only company that will cover it.  I have tried numerous other companies to see if I can get a cheaper quote but it is not available.  As we cannot afford to have any difficulties with the vehicle, we have to maintain it according to garage specifications.  The kind of mechanical input that has to be made into new vehicles afterwards is very limited.  Sometimes you are lucky and only have the regular yearly service.  Other times you are banjaxed, something goes wrong and you are gone.  I had a problem recently with a hoist.  I had to change the hoist and the new hoist let me down with the girls stuck in the van.  I could not get them out.  That was an emergency for us.  We had to manage the cost of the hoist ourselves, as we do with the maintenance, repairs and servicing.  A scheme like the Motability scheme in England could be very useful to look at here.<\/p> <p>  I do not think any carer or anybody expects to get something for nothing.  We do not.  We are happy to pay reasonable amounts of money.  I ask the committee to bear in mind that we are coming at it from a different point of view.  We are already, pardon the pun, disabled in the sense of the people we look after.  We are disabled in the sense of the money we are allowed to earn before we lose any abilities.  It is all capped.  There is a limited amount of money available to us for what are termed \"luxuries\".  They are not luxuries; they are essential to have any kind of limited freedom as a family.  We are always looking over our shoulder and in our pockets to see if we have this or can plan for the cost of that.  If not, we must consider how we are going to manage.  The last thing any of us want to do is depend on charity or on the kindness of strangers.  We should not have to do that.  We are lucky that people are so generous.  We are lucky too that the State in a sense is generous in what it gives us, but in all honesty it is not really enough for our current needs.  The needs of those who do not qualify on a technicality are as great, if not greater.  I refer to the families of those with intellectual disabilities, in particular, who cannot be drivers themselves.  Their need for transport is just as great if they are to have an ordinary day&rsquo;s activity.  They will not go to work, but they need to go to school, attend day services and attend medical appointments, etc.  You want to give families a degree of autonomy to give them that freedom.  In ten years&rsquo; time I will probably be too old to drive - I will be 75 - but my girls&rsquo; needs will not have changed.  The services we can provide ourselves may be very different.  I am afraid to think of what that might be like.  As I have said, you cannot get on the 25A with two wheelchairs.  Many day services do not provide transport.  It is left to your own means.  Something that addresses such issues is needed.<\/p> <p>  Senator Seery Kearney asked what the committee can offer.  I suggest it should listen to families about their needs, and not about what somebody in an office in town understands those needs to be.  If it listens to the families, it will hear about the different needs in different parts of the country, depending on what supports are available in various places.  We talk about the postcode lottery in relation to service provision, and likewise in relation to transport.  Nobody is looking for anything exorbitant.  We are just looking for the same opportunities that other people have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Douglas"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":762,"content":"<p>I will add to what Mr. Douglas has said.

We need to look at the broader picture for people, including the person with the disability and his or her wider family.  We must stop penalising people and start supporting them, not just financially but also through the provision of adequate supports.  Quite often, the financial strains are there because the other supports, such as respite, day services and transport to and from services, are not in place.  From our perspective, we need to look at family carers and how they are supported to care safely for their loved ones in their own home.

As I said, approximately 2 million people in the UK get a mobility payment.  Approximately one third of them convert that mobility payment into a lease payment.  They are allowed to use the money to lease a vehicle through the motability scheme.  That scheme probably represents the largest leasing company in Europe.  We recently had a meeting with the people who run it.  They lease 800 cars a day.  It is a very large scheme.  The UK Government allows the people who run the scheme to buy the cars VAT exempt, and they have huge negotiating power with the vehicle manufacturers, insurance companies and car maintenance companies.  They lease the cars, fully insured and fully maintained, for a three-year period, after which the vehicles are taken back and put on the resale market.<\/p> <p>  Some 10% of the 700,000-plus cars used in the scheme are highly adapted, which means that many of the cars go back into the general market.  Committee members may not realise that we depend to a huge extent on that supply of vehicles.  A large number of the cars we see coming through the various suppliers are vehicles coming off the motability scheme in the UK that have finished lease, finished lease early or were handed back for various reasons.  They go onto the general sale market and end up here.  Many of the not-new vehicles with lowered floors, wheelchair accessibility and various adaptations that are on the market here are second-hand or out-of-lease cars coming from the UK.  They are a big factor in our supply because we do not have the infrastructure to build those cars in a mass way here.  We just do not have the population.  We are depending on that supply.<\/p> <p>  Brexit has not been great for us in terms of access to this source of low-cost supply.  Previously, that access meant people did not have to go for new vehicles and could, instead, get a fairly good vehicle at a reduced cost from the UK.  It is a big factor for us in terms of supply.  As I outlined, the payment can be converted and may be supplemented if more is needed to purchase a vehicle.  There is also an equalisation process under the scheme whereby the people with a lower adaptation need contribute in a way that equalises the contribution required from those with a higher adaptation need.  Everybody pays the same amount as a result of that equalisation factor.  There are big numbers involved in the scheme and the people running it are allowed to do that.  The possibility of an arrangement being reached with them is probably more difficult in the current political circumstances, but that is how it works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022070700002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenneth Fox"},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":765,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for joining us this morning.  This is an issue that often lands on our desks.  We get many queries and representations from people in regard to primary medical certificates and the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.  I do not have many specific questions.  I thank the witnesses for educating us, particularly in respect of the UK scheme.  It seems to be based on common sense.  Every week, we come in here and learn a little more, which I very much appreciate.<\/p> <p>  We have noticed a few themes with all the contributions.  Many people are excluded from current schemes.  If they do have access to them, the schemes are not fit for purpose.  There is no flexibility within any of the schemes and their implementation, for the small percentage of people who make up the cohort that can access them, there is a double taxation on the adaptation work.  It is, in a way, a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul, and penalising people in that way.  Participants must continuously work to improve their situation when, in many cases, sadly, people's situations do not improve but, in fact, deteriorate.  When I got a car in my early 20s, my independence was greatly improved and, all of a sudden, I was able to live a life away from the curtailments of my family.  What right do I have above someone else to be able to do that?  The fact people do not have access to that independence, flexibility and choice is embarrassing for me.  I am no greater than anyone else and I should not have more access to something just because of my circumstances.  I find that infuriating.<\/p> <p>  Ms Cox spoke about the uncertainty for family carers.  A woman came to me recently who had taken on extra hours in order to upgrade the family car and be able to care for and transport her mother a little more easily and comfortably.  Then her carer's allowance was cut.  She was penalised for the few hours she had taken on in order to survive and improve the circumstances for her family and the person for whom she is caring.  It is heartbreaking to see that and have to say I am unable to help because of the rigidity, inflexibility and uncertainty in the scheme.  One does not know what one will get.  How dare people try to improve their situation by getting a pay increase or working a few extra hours.  People are being penalised, to the detriment of their family, for trying to help themselves.  It is nonsensical to me.<\/p> <p>  We have a lot of actions to implement.  We launched our pre-budget submission yesterday and transport is one of the key areas.  It continues to be one of the key issues we work on in our constituencies and in this committee.  I thank the witnesses for educating us this morning on some of the practicalities of their own situations and the practicalities of situations and schemes in the UK.  We are waiting long enough for improvements and serious action is needed now.

I needed to be in the D&aacute;il for two oral questions to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I thank the witnesses for being here today and for helping us to understand multiple issues related to transport systems.  We all know that accessible and inclusive transport is a really important enabler for participation in normal life events.  It is necessary for work, socialising, independence, education and many other things.  However, the impact of poor and inaccessible transport is somehow not fully appreciated by the State as a major barrier for disabled people and their families.  One of the witnesses also mentioned the additional transport and related costs faced by disabled people and their households, from major investment in vehicles to expensive additional journeys and having to use taxis.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday the D&aacute;il passed a Social Democrats motion seeking an action plan on the cost of disability.  That report outlines the extra transport costs faced by disabled people.  The additional cost of having a disability in Ireland is up to &euro;12,000 annually.  We can only hope that the Government acts on that and listens to the witnesses' points on things like the motorised transport grant, mobility allowance and the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.<\/p> <p>  The discontinuation of the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant to new applicants in 2013 was disgraceful in itself.  That no adequate replacement has been developed nearly eight years later is truly shocking and really difficult for people to get their heads around.  I do not believe the vast majority of the public knows that.  The situation is another clear violation of individual rights under the UNCRPD, both the right to equal access to transport in Article 9 and independent living in Article 19.  We all agree on the need for public transport.  As a Deputy representing a rural constituency, I am very aware of private transport being a vital resource for disabled people and the need for targeted supports in that regard.<\/p> <p>  In her opening statement, Ms Cox said that a one-size-fits-all model for mobility support does not work for disabled people.  There is a complexity of interacting issues and conditions that can affect an individual's mobility which can change over time, sometimes quickly.  Departments and the Revenue Commissioners have insisted on a very medicalised model which focuses on impairments rather than individual capacities.  I ask her to elaborate on how the system should work for mobility support.  The committee would like to be able to make specific recommendations.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Fox highlighted how little has changed since the 1960s concerning accessing the tax relief scheme.  I again ask for specifics on what application process and criteria would be more suitable.

The Deputy is correct in saying the model is very medicalised.  It is an approximation with people required to pick a few categories and that is roughly what should cover anyone who needs it.  Rather than it being a medical model, we need something similar to an occupational therapist's assessment even if that is within the State system.  There should be an assessment of somebody's needs taking a more global view and then the benefits based on a recommendation within certain categories should flow from that.  It should be based on a broader spectrum of considerations rather than strict narrow criteria.  There should be an assessment followed by a recommendation for a particular level or something of that nature where the individual's needs are being considered.<\/p> <p>  At the moment we are using senior area medical officers.  Part of the issue is that they have other responsibilities.  Especially during the Covid pandemic they had many other responsibilities.  The system is under pressure anyway.

There is a normality in our house that nobody else has.  We have had to normalise things to work for us, such as the use of hoists.  Our girls are in nappies and we have considerable extra costs.  Thankfully, the HSE supplies those, but it does not pay the bin charges for all of those nappies.  I am not giving out, but it would help to have them paid for.  As part of the carer's grant, we get the homemaker's grant.  We get &euro;35 per month towards bills, which, again, is great, but we have to have electricity on the whole time.  Our girls are on pumps and hoists and use electric showers.  Some &euro;35 per month is certainly a great help towards it, but I got an electricity bill for &euro;312 the other day.  That is the kind of bill I get every time.   That is normal for us, because that is the amount of electricity involved.<\/p> <p>  I had to bring the girls into St. James's Hospital yesterday to get blood tests.  I could find not a wheelchair parking space anywhere.  I drove around the hospital two or three times.  There are considerable difficulties such as that.  The van is slightly larger than a car space and one needs space at the end for the tail lift and hoist to come out.  I eventually got a space.  Planning takes much longer.  One has to give oneself much more time to get to places because there are many other difficulties and one has no certainty.  I have no faith that the new children's hospital will be any better equipped for families in a similar situation that will have to use it.<\/p> <p>  In many ways, the State is extremely helpful to people with disabilities through the medical card scheme.  The scheme covers the costs of many things, but there are many other things that are not costed.  We do not have any carers coming into the house.  Anything that has to be done, we are doing.  It has never been offered to us.  We have never looked for it.  We can manage.  However, I know if I have to look for it, I probably will not get it, because we have managed all of these years, unless I break a leg or Mary dies or has a stroke.  It would then be extreme and we would probably get an hour in the morning and half an hour in the evening, which would be no good because the needs are very different from that.<\/p> <p>  Many carers are doing many things behind closed doors that even people on their street know nothing about.  People are proud.  It is nobody else's business, and, yet, they suffer because of that.  Sometimes we suffer because what we can do is so limited in the absence of some kind of support.  It is great in a way that the support is there but, in all honesty, the level of support is minimum.  It is a chore in that it is very difficult one wants or needs to change one's van.  Nowadays, one cannot even get a van because of the shortage in supply.  I have been on a list since last November.  I am told that a van probably will still not be available by this November.  That is the reality.  It is not as though one can pick out any vehicle.  Our needs are very specific and we need a very specific type of vehicle.  Those vehicles are just not there.  We are lucky enough in that we are patient - for a bit longer anyway.  Not everyone can be patient, particularly as their needs are such that they are on the edge nearly all of the time.<\/p> <p>  Carers are on the edge twice.  They are on the edge for themselves, as carers and families, and on the edge for the people they are looking after.  The people the carers are looking after because they cannot do anything for themselves.  They cannot make decisions.  No matter what the capacity legislation says, they have no capacity to do so.  Carers are on the go twice and their energy is going into that the whole time.  There is no excess energy for much other stuff.

I know that Mr. Carty alluded to there being intricacies and challenges in having it be universal and making it as accessible as possible to everybody, but we need to have a new system.  The carer's allowance should be care assessed rather than means assessed.

We tried that through the Revenue Commissioners, through the scheme.  The lease went down, rather than the purchase.

I am a professor of law and transitional justice, working at the law school at Queen's University and at the Mitchell Institute.  Mr. Holder is a member of the Committee on the Administration of Justice.  The model Bill team is a team of academics, including me and my colleagues, Professor Louise Mallinder and Dr. Anna Bryson, working with colleagues from the Committee on the Administration of Justice, which is the main human rights NGO in the North.  The work in which we have been involved through the past decade has been trying to find lawful and human rights-compliant ways to help deal with the legacy of the conflict in Northern Ireland.  In that period, we have produced 20-odd reports.  As we see it, our job as the nerds in this field is to produce accessible information that allows stakeholders to make up their minds on these difficult and controversial issues from as informed a position as possible.  The way in which we have done that is to benchmark all our work against the European Convention on Human Rights, international law and domestic law in particular, as well as the Good Friday Agreement and the Stormont House Agreement.  Everything we have done has been framed within that context.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the opportunity to again appear before the committee to give evidence.  I and my colleague Dr. Bryson gave evidence to the committee in 2018.  Mr. Holder was before the committee a few months ago.  We have also given evidence to a range of committees at Westminster and to the US Congress.  We have worked extensively with the United Nations, the Council of Europe and other international stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  Following the UK&rsquo;s unilateral departure from the Stormont House Agreement which, it appears, includes the abandoning of the bilateral treaty signed by the British Government and the Government in the Republic, we have critiqued the proposals that have since emerged, from the UK command paper in 2021 onwards.  As members are aware, that command paper proposed a general and unconditional amnesty.  My colleague, Louise Mallinder, is probably the world expert on amnesties.  She compiled a database of more than 500 amnesties from around the world and we were able to place the amnesty proposed in the command paper within that context.  Our conclusion was that it was one of the most egregious in our database in terms of its scale and ambition and was significantly worse than that introduced by General Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator in Chile.  In addition to concerns in respect of the scale and ambition of the amnesty, we also raised our concerns about the gutting, as we termed it, of meaningful investigations into the conflict.  In particular, our argument, on which we will expand, is that the piecemeal approach to dealing with the legacy of the conflict in the North has been providing, albeit in a rather slow and rumbling way, a version of truth recovery with teeth, using the legal powers of various legal and investigative mechanisms to ultimately deliver for families.  We saw the command paper as, in effect, undermining that. <\/p> <p>  The command paper and the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill that is currently before Westminster were rationalised by reference to a deeply misleading and inaccurate series of information - in essence, fake news - relating to purported biased efforts to hold to account state actors in terms of investigations and prosecutions, thus calling into question the credibility of investigative mechanisms, the work of the PSNI, the Judiciary, lawyers and a range of other actors.  That same fake news has been used to rationalise and justify the Bill that is currently before Westminster.  The command paper was critiqued by the Council of Europe and the UN special rapporteur on transitional justice as a flagrant breach of the UK&rsquo;s international obligations.  The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights recently expressed serious concerns in respect of the new Bill.  She released a statement to that effect last week.  We expect to hear interest from the United Nations in respect of the new proposals that have come forward.  It is our view that although these proposals are dressed up in the language of reconciliation, that is not a credible claim, not least because the claims relating to reconciliation that have been associated with the Bill in its passage through Parliament and in terms of how the UK Government has responded to concerns from the Irish Government and other stakeholders does not tally with what the Secretary of State and other political leaders have said in other formats.  For example, the Secretary of State commented on the real rationale for the Bill which, it appears, is to ensure that state actors are not held to account, that there is a drive towards impunity for state actors.  In our view, the reconciliation aspects of the Bill are window dressing to cover up for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022070700002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Kieran McEvoy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":789,"content":"<p>We have been the first to point out how some of the existing mechanisms for dealing with the past in Northern Ireland, such as the inquest system, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and police investigations, etc., have been weakened through the years, largely through limitations imposed by UK state agencies.  It is notable, however, that these mechanisms, having overcome many of these significant barriers, are currently delivering information recovery with teeth, and historical clarification in particular, as never before.  It is at this juncture that the UK is moving swiftly to close down these existing mechanisms, thwart their work and replace mechanisms relating to independent judicial and investigative processes with mechanisms that are under direct UK Government control.  There has been no due process in the production of the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill, the contents of which were not even disclosed to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which is a core Good Friday Agreement institution precisely with a mandate of advising whether the contents of a Bill are human rights compatible.  It saw the Bill at the same time that it was published in the UK Parliament.<\/p> <p>  Our conclusion has been that the Bill is unworkable and in breach of the Good Friday Agreement and binding international law and will not deliver for victims and survivors, many of whom have waited decades for truth and justice.  The breaches of the Good Friday Agreement relate to the way the agreement guaranteed the specific incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, as well as issues relating to the devolution settlement.  There are specific issues under Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR that require independent and effective investigations into certain deaths, including those with potential state culpability.  There are similar obligations with regard to torture and serious injury.<\/p> <p>  In addition to shutting down all existing investigative mechanisms, the Bill will, for a very limited period only, permit reviews into certain cases.  These are reviews, not investigations, that, in our view, will not meet the standards for independent or effective investigations, which renders the Bill domestically unlawful as well as in conflict with the ECHR.   We consider that the immunity provisions, which are broad and based on a subjective test where the person seeking immunity only has to think they are telling the truth to get immunity, are also unlikely to be compatible with the ECHR.<\/p><p>The extensive proposals in the Bill on oral history memorialisation and academic research on the conflict would appear to be designed to provide legal and political cover for what many rightly regard as an indirect route to impunity.  We consider the Bill to be irredeemable and unfixable.  Notwithstanding what else is happening today, it appears, nevertheless, that the Bill will proceed through the UK Parliament.  It has already gone through the House of Comments.  We recognise that the Irish Government has already raised clear concerns about the UK Bill.  If and when the Bill becomes law, a clear option for the State, not least as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, would be to challenge the UK over the Bill through an interstate case to the ECHR.  <br\/><br\/>The onus to do this has to be said in the context of the UK not being the only state in Europe showing contempt for the international rule of law at present.  There is a very complex situation within the European context and the consequences of the Bill would reverberate well beyond the island.  There is a real risk that authoritarian regimes around the planet will be licking their lips at the precedent this type of Bill will set.  My colleagues have already raised in media pieces in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and <i>Business Post<\/i>the prospect of the Government taking an interstate case against the UK if the Bill proceeds.  It would be very welcome if the committee would consider raising this matter with the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022070700002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Holder","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":791,"content":"<p>A number of us recently visited Washington in the United States.

I suggest the committee have a look at the website.  The UK Government is being quite frank; it is something it planned to do.<\/p> <p>  The fact that this has been railroaded through the House of Commons in the face of complete opposition from all of Northern Ireland's political parties tells us that this is not about achieving reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  If one was serious about achieving reconciliation in Northern Ireland, one would have worked much harder to bring Northern Ireland's political parties and civil society together.  All of the major victim groups in Northern Ireland are opposed to the Bill.  The UK has also abandoned its partnership approach with the Irish Government.  If people were serious about achieving reconciliation in Northern Ireland, they would have worked on bringing all of those constituencies with them. <\/p> <p>  Our strong view is that the evidence all points to the fact that it is not about what is happening in Northern Ireland; it is about what is happening in Britain and on the right of the Tory Party.

As the committee knows, a version of an assumptive amnesty was put through in the Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and Veterans) Act 2021 for British army veterans who served in Iraq, Afghanistan and other international operations.  The assumption was that after five years had passed, veterans would get an amnesty.

The Government should continue to articulate very clearly its opposition to the Bill, and also articulate very clearly that it is not, in the view of the Government, ECHR compliant.  There are diplomatic ways and international institutions in which that can be articulated.  The key institution is the Council of Europe human rights system, in particular the ECHR and the potential for, ultimately, an interstate case to bring this before the court relatively quickly.<\/p> <p>  It is also quite important for the Irish Government to counter the false narrative that surrounds the Bill.  UK Ministers have said different things to different audiences.<\/p><p>This goes back to the last question.  When we read some of the stuff that is written and the UK submission to the Council of Europe, it is as if UK Ministers all of a sudden have had a Eureka or road-to-Damascus moment where they have come across the concept of information recovery and reconciliation, and that is the driving force behind the legislation.  We all know that that simply is not true.  We do not actually have to dig very deep to find that that simply is not true.  In other forums, UK Ministers themselves are saying that the driving force behind this is to end investigations into members of the military.  They are saying that it will end the questioning of members of the military and that no longer will they fear a knock on the door.  They are using that type of language.  While saying that the new information recovery body will have powers, there is also the clear implication that it is not going to use them.  The guarantees by the office holder who is to appoint the people who run the commission, that it will not actually use the type of powers that would involve bringing people in for questioning, are problematic.<\/p><p> There is a second issue driving this legislation that is also quite clear from the things the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and other Ministers have said in different forums, namely, the issue of taking back control of the narrative of the conflict and of projecting an official truth.  Essentially, what is being said is that independent judges, investigators and inquiries, in doing their jobs, are \"rewriting history\", in the words of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  The idea is that these types of independent investigations are rewriting history, presumably with independently verifiable facts.  Therefore, the express purpose of the oral history and memorialisation provisions that are within this Bill, according to the Secretary of State himself in his Conservative home blog, are to take back control of that rewriting of history and project an official narrative.  Sometimes these arguments get traction in places they should not.  I think it would be very helpful if that narrative is countered at a higher level and continues to be so.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022070700002#G01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Holder","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":804,"content":"<p>Just before I hand over to my colleague, how quickly can this be referred to the European Court of Human Rights?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022070700002#H00200","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":805,"content":"<p>I think it should be referred within four months.

This is not simply about what is going on in Northern Ireland.  If a Government as senior as the UK Government is seen to introduce this kind of an amnesty, it will embolden authoritarian regimes around the world.  For people who take seriously upholding the rule of law within the Council of Europe, and I would imagine most of the member states do, I think the alarm bells will ring.  If the Irish Government determined that this is the way to go, I think there will be a receptiveness to how serious and important this issue is.  I want to put on the record that in no way am I criticising the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I think the officials there have had the patience of saints in their engagement with the Northern Ireland Office over the last number of years around legacy issues.  They really stretched themselves as far as they could as diplomats but sometimes diplomacy alone does not work in these kind of relationships.  One would expect that if there was a different shade of Government or even a different style of Tory leadership with an openness, progress could be made.  The peace process only works when there is joint stewardship between the British and Irish Government.  This British Government has not done that.

I know that the Chairman and others who visited Washington DC will agree that it provided us with really valuable material to be able to communicate to those there what exactly what is going on.  As has been mentioned, the important point is that the British Government and its envoys in the United States are trying to convince people that it is trying to defend the Good Friday Agreement and deliver better outcomes for victims and survivors, which obviously is a lie.  We might as well call it that.  Nobody is being fooled.  What was good about the trip to Washington DC was that it was on a cross-party basis and was the first time that this Oireachtas joint committee had visited Washington DC.  We were able to address some of the lies that had been told about this legislation and what it might do.  At the end of the day, it is an insult to the intelligence of all of the political parties, the Irish Government, and indeed, European states in terms of what is trying to be achieved here.  I think an important point was made when the witnesses stated that it was not proposed by all veterans.  It has been proposed by an element within the military to keep things closed and to keep the lid on things.  God forbid that the people across this island or other islands around the world would see exactly what happened.  We can see very clearly the attempts to control the narrative there.  It is just appalling, never mind the unilateral actions of the UK Government.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions on the legislation.  Is it unprecedented in the last quarter of a century since the Good Friday Agreement, in terms of what it seeks to do and in there being no due process, as is set out in the Bill?  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on their point that the processes are actually working too well in terms of information that is coming out.  Indeed, some of us attended the Ballymurphy inquiry in Belfast.  Have the witnesses come across anybody, in all of their work and engagement, who thinks that this legislation is a good idea or the right thing do to?  I ask them to outline the timeline around taking an interstate case to the European Court of Human Rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022070700002#H01200","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":815,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first question as to whether this is unprecedented, the simple answer is \"Yes\".  The various items of paperwork that come along with the Bill, including the human rights memorandum, make reference to a number of things that happened during the peace process.  The early release of politically-motivated prisoners is referenced, as is the process for the disappeared and the recovery of bodies, and the process of decommissioning of weapons.  However, none of those processes are that relevant to what is being attempted here.  First, in terms of the early release of prisoners, as committee members will be aware, people had already been tried and convicted and had served a sentence.  It is true that prisoners were all released within two years of the Good Friday Agreement being signed, but in this context, we are talking about getting rid of investigations, prosecutions and no jail time being served.<\/p><p>In previous efforts we worked very hard to come up with pragmatic solutions.  Consequently, working with the British army and a range of other stakeholders, we came up with what we thought was a workable solution whereby, for example, one could have continued to have investigations and prosecutions but would have reduced jail time to zero.  I am sure there is a genuine concern, at some level, about elderly veterans going to jail in their 70s or 80s and what is the purpose of that and so forth but in doing that piece of work, we discovered that the Secretary for State for Northern Ireland already has the power within the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act to reduce the two-year maximum to zero.  That can be done now so it is not about keeping elderly veterans out of jail.  It is about not having public trials and not having proper investigations.<\/p><p> On the disappeared process, obviously evidence could not be used relating to information that was given over from the IRA, primarily, to that commission.  If other evidence emerged from somewhere else and not that process then people were still liable to prosecution and, similarly, the decommissioning.  One had narrow versions of immunity to achieve particular objectives, which is what happened with the disappeared process but it was not an amnesty and did not get rid of prosecutions so if evidence came from somewhere else, it could be used.<\/p><p> The really frustrating bit for us, having worked on this matter for all the years, I stress that our frustration is nothing compared with the victims who have waited for 50 years for this stuff, but as people who have put in a significant amount of time and energy, there was a workable solution through all of this.  There was a bilateral approach with the Irish Government keeping the local parties on board, perhaps even getting to a stage where if one had reduced the jail time to zero to deal with the veterans issue, and there would only have been a small number of prosecutions anyway, but victims would still have had their day in court.  When you can come up with lawful and politically pragmatic ways of getting it done then it is very frustrating that such a pathway is not taken because it was there for the asking and could have been done.  Yes, it is unprecedented, it is a unilateral act on the part of the British Government, it was not workable and in our view, it is unlawful. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022070700002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Professor Kieran McEvoy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":817,"content":"<p>In terms of how well the current mechanisms work, they came from the cases that were taken to the European Court of Human Rights that things were not meeting the investigative standards, so there were changes to the inquest system, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, and a call in of independent police teams and things like that to try to progress human rights complaints investigations.  As we know there has been huge amounts of obstruction of those bodies over the years.  Most recently, it was the blocking of funding for things like legacy inquests and the office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.  Also, there was what is sometimes called the slow waltz of state disclosure, where documents in control of the Ministry of Defence and other agencies are not disclosed.  We have got to a stage where the relentless work by families and their representatives has managed to overcome a lot of those barriers and we are seeing delivery of the existing mechanisms at the moment like never before, so we have many hundreds of pages this year.  There are 600 pages in the two biggest reports alone but there is more than that from the office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.  They have delivered significant truth recovery with teeth because there are proper powers, in reports like Operation Greenwich and Operation Achille, and historical clarification regarding the patterns and practices of police collusion with loyalist paramilitaries in different areas.  There is also the inquest system, which is also beginning to deliver.  There was the Kathleen Thompson inquest last week and there was the Ballymurphy inquest before that.  It has broken down what were decades of an official truth that simply was not true, and provided considerable historical clarification at the very least.<\/p> <p>  There is Operation Kenova and the other operations under the auspices of former Chief Constable Jon Boutcher, that have amassed, again using information recovery with teeth and full police powers, more than 50,000 pages of evidence now.  Definitely the British Government's command paper but no-one else ever pretended that all of these mechanisms were about prosecutions.  Everyone knew that prosecutions were going to be few and far between for reasons that do not need to be rehearsed here.  Really they were about information recovery with teeth.  It is at this very juncture, when they are now finally overcoming those obstacles and beginning to deliver, that the drawbridge is about to be pulled up, which is profoundly concerning.<\/p> <p>  On the question that asked who supports this, I struggle to pin down the names of groups.

It is where people have proper legal powers and do their jobs properly in terms of investigating the past via an inquest, the office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland or, indeed, the work of Jon Boutcher.  Good people with proper powers, proper police powers, proper investigative powers and proper powers of inquest are the problem.  That is why I had a meeting with a senior official in the Northern Ireland Office on the evening that the Bill came out.  I get on very well with this particular individual but I said to him that it looked to me as though what the office had done here was simply to do a search, find and replace for the word \"investigation\" with the word \"review\".  There is a 2018 version of the Bill that was produced to implement the Stormont House Agreement.  I asked him whether that is what had been done and if the office literally had done a search, find and replace throughout the Bill, and right down the spine of the Bill and every time.  In the previous version of the Bill there is a lot of discussion around Article 2 compliant investigations  being independent, effective and so on.

There was no answer from the ambassador on that day about why we ignored it or why we failed to deal with it.  What they were speaking about was how to use that at the UN.  It is possibly an avenue that we all could explore.  We could use our two years on the Security Council to make sure the UN looks at legacy issues.  This is an international agreement recognised by the United Nations.  It is part of its remit and we should use our place on the Security Council to address that.

From listening to them, and based on previous discussions, it is obvious that this legislation proposed by the British Government is a charter to excuse murderers, whether by state forces or paramilitary organisations.  In any democratic society it is a sad day when we are talking about introducing that type of legislation.  I gather from the witnesses' comments that a person could literally grant himself or herself an amnesty if he or she says something is true to the best of his or her knowledge and belief.  That is shambolic altogether, to put it very mildly.  It is reprehensible and absolutely unacceptable.  We have had discussions in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, which many of us participated in, since this Bill was first introduced by the British Government.  I and others have compared this legislation to what tinpot regimes in South America would have introduced.  That was a political charge on my part but the witnesses put a legal hat on that when they said it was even less that what General Pinochet granted people.  The witnesses outlined that clearly.  We can make the political charge, which we stand over.  It is a fairly frightening message that this is the type of legislation proposed by the British Government and which has unfortunately passed through a House in the British Parliament.  It is reprehensible.<\/p><p>The witnesses' written submission is powerful as it is so comprehensive and succinct.  It sends out a stark message: <\/p> <blockquote> \tWe have concluded that the bill is unworkable, is in breach of the Good Friday Agreement, interferes with the devolved administration of justice in Northern Ireland, contravenes binding international law and that it will not deliver for victims and survivors, many of whom have waited for decades for truth and justice. <\/blockquote> <p>That is a powerful summary of what should not be done with regard to dealing with legacy issues.  It is shameful that any Government or the people who voted for this legislation in the British House of Commons would put their names to such reprehensible legislation.

This legislation proposes to cut off any avenue to getting the truth, never mind getting a person prosecuted.  Those families act with such grace and dignity all the time.  All they ever want to get is the truth.  There is nothing vengeful about them.  They are very gracious.  Some of those families have been here at this committee and we meet them in our constituencies.  This Bill is telling them it does not matter now what work they have done or what conclusion the investigation might come to.  That is all for naught.  It is deplorable.

He, along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, was involved in re-establishing devolution.<\/p><p>As part of that, there was a commitment in 2020 to implement the Stormont House Agreement within 100 days.  That was the last time we saw a kind of sensible diplomatic, bilateral approach with the Irish Government, building consensus with the parties.  The Stormont House Agreement was what was signed by the parties.  Four of the five parties supported it.  The Ulster Unionists were more ambivalent.  It was the obvious place if we wanted to build political consensus.  The last time one saw common sense and diplomacy was when Julian Smith was Secretary of State, but it behoves all of us to try to build alliances with progressive elements within the British Parliament and British civil society.  I absolutely agree that we should all be in outreach mode and work with whatever progressive bits we can find.  For example, we took a position on this, that we would not work on technical amendments to the Bill.  That is not our natural approach.  We are fixers.  We are basically nerds trying to help, and doing so in a lawful, human-rights-compliant way, but when the six of us met as a team, we thought we could not be seen to be trying to fix this Bill.  It is just not fixable.  That is a big thing for us.  If it had been a sensible Bill, after the First Reading or the Second Reading, in a normal set of circumstances, we would have been all over it.  We would have been working with all of the political parties and the Government basically trying to help to nuance and draw on our international experience and so forth, but we took the view - with a heavy heart - that this is not fixable.  That does not mean we are not engaging with people.  We are talking to everyone.  I think it is the same for everyone.  We are all hoping against hope that common sense will prevail and alliances can be built with sensible people on the other side of the water.  I do not know whether the shifts in recent days in politics will make any difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022070700002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Kieran McEvoy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":829,"content":"<p>One point is that under the Stormont House Agreement the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP's, office decided who would be prosecuted.

Mr. Holder quoted a number of examples earlier.  Without a doubt, there has been a \"slow waltz\" from different bits of the security establishment in providing information to legal settings.  Even within that slow waltz, one sees the power of a judge doing their job properly.  Even within the security establishment, there is a fear of the judge.  Ultimately, they may mess around and drag things out and so forth, but a judge does strike a certain fear even into elements of the security establishment in terms of getting information.  In addition to the cases Mr. Holder was talking about, for example, in the Kingsmill massacre inquest, which has not completed yet, where 11 civilians were murdered by the IRA, more intelligence information has been provided to that inquest than any other in the history of Northern Ireland.  That is a judge using their powers to get access to stuff, and then ultimately those families will get more truth.  The Lady Chief Justice did the same in the Ballymurphy inquest - using the power of the judge to get the information.  Similarly, Jon Boutcher has demonstrated that if you put a decent police officer in and you give them proper powers and they carry out proper investigations and get access to all the intelligence and so forth, you can build relationships of trust with families and get buy-in.<\/p> <p>  The other tragedy of this is that no families are going to believe that these mechanisms have any credibility, so we are not going to get buy-in from the people they are ostensibly meant to help because no one can trust them.  The families see it as being designed to secure immunity for British soldiers.  The perception is that they do not really care what happens to the victims.  As Jon Boutcher said while giving evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee a few weeks ago, we might as well build a huge white elephant and no one will engage with it, because there is a also a big question mark over whether perpetrators will engage with it either.  If they are not going to be actually investigated and they are not under threat from being prosecuted, why would they come forward?  Victims do not believe in it.  A white elephant would be built which is designed essentially to secure impunity and it would not have engagement from the victims it is meant to help.  It is a tragedy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022070700002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Kieran McEvoy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":833,"content":"<p>In terms of interventions, again, we go back to the issue of an inter-state case.  I am not overly optimistic that there will be a change of direction in terms of whatever is currently happening with the UK Government.  I am not sure how much has changed since we came into this room.  It was correct to highlight the issues in Brandon Lewis's resignation letter speaking about honesty and integrity.  The command paper he produced was an example of big-lie politics.  It was deeply dishonest, both the reasoning and what was set out in it.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Bill itself, it is through the House of Commons.  The only amendment that I think went through was an opposition amendment from the Labour Party that sought to remove sexual offences from the scope of immunity in the Bill.  However, that does not actually change it.  If that has gone through and it remains within the Bill, someone cannot apply for immunity for having committed conflict-related sexual offences, but they still have a de facto amnesty from being investigated for those offences because the Bill still bans anyone - the police, the police ombudsman or whoever - from actively conducting a criminal investigation.  Whatever the role of the prosecutor, the prosecutor cannot prosecute without an investigation preceding that.  The very limited powers of the information recovery body may come into play in some of those cases, but they are very limited.  A review is not the same as an investigation.  It is almost as if we are not just replacing the word \"review\" with \"investigation\" but, given the historical distrust for good reason, about the lack of independence and effective Article 2-compliant investigations, there were huge amounts of safeguards built into the Stormont House Agreement Bill in everything that should have been in there.  There was a lot in there about how the historical investigations unit would have conducted Article 2 compliant investigations, what were the steps that it had to go through, what were the investigative powers it would have in particular circumstances; how it would comply with Article 2 and; what the final product would be that was delivered to families.  There were guarantees in the legislation that the reports had to be \"as comprehensive as possible\" and to include findings.  It is as if someone has gone through this current Bill and taken out piece by piece each and every single one of those safeguards.  The type of desktop reviews that will be conducted by these new bodies will not meet those standards.  There are no guarantees that families will even know if anyone has been given immunity in a particular case, let alone whether there are any findings in the reports that they get.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022070700002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel Holder"},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":834,"content":"<p>Does Professor McEvoy's group have interaction with advocacy groups for victims such as the WAVE Trauma Centre?

We are the people providing the technical and legal information to victims' organisations and then they make up their own mind on policy issues in terms of what way they want to go.<\/p> <p>  I wish to say something that is less depressing.  In preparation for coming here, we did work previously looking at amnesties and what is permissible in that regard within the European Convention on Human Rights.  The first thing to say on that is that there is not a hugely developed jurisprudence, so I am speaking with that caveat.  In looking at the memorandum that the Northern Ireland Office produced along with the Bill, it mentions a couple of the cases - you do not need to worry, Chairman, I will not go into all the legal cases - but I will pull out two or three important points just to get them on the record.  In looking at the jurisprudence and whether the amnesty Bill might be found to be lawful, the answer is, probably not.  If, for example, an interstate case was taken, from looking at the jurisprudence, there is a strong possibility that the case would be won.<\/p><p>Under the limited jurisprudence to grant amnesties, an amnesty has to be deemed necessary.  It might be necessary where there was an ongoing conflict and the violence would continue unless an amnesty was secured as part of a broader process to end that conflict, but we are almost 30 years on from the ceasefires.  Is it the idea that this is being done as something that is necessary for the peace process?<\/p><p> An amnesty would be required to balance the state's legitimate interests - I stress the word \"legitimate\" - with the individual rights of people affected by the amnesty, who are victims in this context.  In the European human rights system, you cannot interfere with rights under Articles 2 and 3 to effective and independent investigations.  A court will examine whether the amnesty is a legitimate state interest.  If there is a long goody trail of evidence suggesting that the driver behind the amnesty is to achieve immunity for state actors, it is unlikely that a court would find that to be a legitimate state interest.<\/p><p> There is a tangential reference to the notion of reconciliation in two of the cases, but it is something of a sidebar discussion.  Obviously, the British Government has latched onto framing this initiative as a reconciliation process and to privileging history and memorialisation as part of the broader peace and reconciliation process.  A court will examine whether it is a genuine reconciliation process.  It is difficult to see how it could be sold as a genuine reconciliation process if it is opposed by all of the political parties in Northern Ireland, the Irish Government, the victims' communities, civil society, churches, trade union movements and so on.  As a lawyer, I would have to stand up and try to make the argument before a number of judges that this was a genuine reconciliation process knowing that the other side was going to hit me with the reality of what was happening.<\/p><p> In no circumstances in the jurisprudence can there be an amnesty for torture.  That is covered by Article 3.  The state can lawfully kill people in certain circumstances, for example, in a shoot-out between police officers and armed robbers.  The State can never lawfully torture someone.  Non-state actors, such as people involved in punishment violence, can never be amnestied; this amnesty would cover those.<\/p><p> The \"good\" news is that, if the Irish Government decided that it was in its interests to make an interstate challenge as probably the quickest and most effective way of tackling the amnesty instead of waiting on individual victims to get through all of the domestic processes before going to Strasbourg, there is a strong chance that it would win.  That is the cheerier bit of this discussion.  It would be for the court to decide, of course, but having re-examined the jurisprudence around the space for amnesties, I do not see this amnesty meeting those tests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022070700002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Kieran McEvoy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":837,"content":"<p>Our State could only start that process after the legislation was passed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022070700002#M00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657148400,"counter":838,"content":"<p>Yes.

The South African amnesty committee was chaired by a judge, so it was a quasi-legal hearing.  Victims were present and legally represented during those discussions, some of which were televised.  The criterion for the applicant to be successful was full disclosure.

This is all going to happen behind closed doors.  There will be no hearings and no legal representation for victims.  In our reading of the legislation, it does not appear to us that an individual victim will even know whether a person has been given an amnesty in the victim's case.  At the moment, the legislation requires what looks like a statistical table showing how many amnesties have been granted per year, but the victim would not know from the report provided by what we see as the toothless review mechanism whether an individual perpetrator had benefited from impunity under that process.  How is any victim meant to believe in the credibility of such a process?<\/p> <p>  I will make a final point about the South African example.  The amnesty committee was holding its hearings and the human rights violations committee was doing its work.  The ANC and the other elements of the liberation forces sold that to their supporters as being the moment when people could come forward in the national interest and there would be a truth and reconciliation process, but that once that process was completed, prosecutions would be back on the table for people who did not engage - South Africa was not getting rid of prosecutions altogether - and the resources of the state would be deployed towards those prosecutions.  For other political reasons, there was a haphazard set of prosecutions afterwards, but the deal was that there would be a moment in the country's history, there would be a proper truth and reconciliation process requiring full disclosure and at which victims were legally represented - a significant number of applications for amnesty were rejected - and prosecutions were meant to happen afterwards.  Interestingly, prosecutions are now happening 20 odd years later because there has been a change in government and the ANC is now more interested politically in ensuring that prosecutions happen.  There are also inquests up and running to deal with apartheid era issues.  The normal legal process is now running its course.  Under what the British are proposing, though, it will happen behind closed doors, there will be no legal representation for victims, victims might not even know that amnesties have been granted and it will all be finished after five years with a presumptive amnesty, meaning no prosecutions, inquests or anything else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022070700002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Kieran McEvoy"},{"type":"speech","time":1657148400,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.

One component of the witch-hunt narrative against veterans was that the DPP in Northern Ireland had, in effect, been biased by pursuing prosecutions against State actors.  These figures may be slightly out of date since we completed the report but the onus shifted that significantly.  Since 2011, the DPP has initiated 17 conflict-related prosecutions, eight against republicans, four against loyalists and five in state cases involving six soldiers.

In one case, the defendant died.  Another case is currently before the courts.  There is a legal challenge to one of the cases that collapsed, which is ongoing.  Again, I cannot speak on that.<\/p> <p>  The second element to it all is that the investigations being carried out by different policing mechanisms were biased and again, were state-centred and focused on state actors.  One element of that narrative basically was that there was a disproportionate number of state-actor cases being focused on by the Historical Enquiries Team and, when that was disbanded, by the legacy investigative branch of the PSNI.  The state is directly involved in this regard.  Leaving aside the issue of collusion, which is a significant issue, the state is directly involved in approximately 10% of the overall fatalities in the conflict.  In some elements of this narrative, it was asked why there are so many cases when they are such a small percentage?  The key issue that bulks up the number of cases being investigated initially by the Historical Enquiries Team and then by the legacy investigative branch is an acknowledgement that, particularly between 1970 and 1973, the Royal Military Police was carrying out the investigations.  Those investigations do not stand up as proper investigations.  In effect, they were operational reviews as to what happened.  Witnesses often were not questioned and people were not interviewed under caution.  The lack of legal rigour in some of those cases is why prosecutorial cases have fallen apart.  A very critical review was carried out by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary on the work of the Historical Enquiries Team and the way it went about investigating those state-actor cases in 2011 and 2012.

I will send it on.<\/p> <p>  It must be borne in mind when considering these cases that the state is responsible for 350 deaths overall: some 300 by the army and the rest by the police.  In the context of those cases, 170 people were killed between 1970 and 1973.  Of those, 63% were indisputably unarmed, only 12% were armed and 14% were possibly armed.  No one was prosecuted at all.  No state actors were prosecuted at all during that period.  The investigations that were carried out have repeatedly found that a number of judgments in the North have been rudimentary and have not met a standard.  That was accepted by the Chief Constable.  The idea that the police were unbalanced in their investigations is because the investigations were not properly done in the first place.  Therefore, the caseload for state-actor cases got bumped up because they were not properly investigated and there is a legal obligation to do so.<\/p> <p>  The third element of the witch-hunt narrative is that the early release mechanisms favoured the non-state actors.  The early release provisions were in the Good Friday Agreement.  This is sometimes written about in simplistic terms in the British tabloid media to say that all the terrorists got out of jail early but \"our boys\" did not get an equivalent.  The reason is that they were not prosecuted and were not in jail, by and large. The legal point is actually more interesting.  When the Good Friday Agreement was signed, there were two state actors in prison.  Four were in prison for murder over the whole period of the conflict.  All were released early using different mechanisms, but there were two in prison at the time the Good Friday Agreement was introduced.  When that mechanism was established, it was independent through the sentence review commission.  Once the early release provisions of the non-state actors are about to commence the UK Government politically, and perhaps understandably, wants to get its people out first.  This is because of political optics.<\/p><p>It therefore approached the Sentence Review Commission and, essentially, said, \"We want our two guys at the top of the list.\"  I know this because I have talked directly to the chair of the commission.  He then said, \"Well, no, we have a system here.  Obviously, they are eligible for release, but we have a way in which we will address them and they will join the queue, in effect.\"  Then the Government used, I think, the Prison Act to get them out first.  The point about all this is that this applied to state and non-state actors.  There were very few state actors in for other reasons, but the early release provisions applied equally to the state and the non-state actors.  The British Government, however, wanted for political reasons to get them out before the non-state actors were released so it used a different mechanism.<\/p><p> I am sorry.

Lady Hallett, a very distinguished judge, did a review when this story broke.  It was very explicit and clear that these were letters of comfort and, in terms of legal significance, were not amnesties because if evidence came forward and you were liable to be prosecuted, you would be prosecuted.

The Conservative Party, since 2010, has gone from maybe moderate conservatism in some respects under David Cameron and the types of people who were in his cabinet to whatever you had with Theresa May to an extreme form of conservatism under Boris Johnson.

At that stage, <i>The Sun<\/i>produced a stand up for our veterans campaign and a set of pledges requiring the signatures of leaders who were running for the Conservative Party leadership at the time.  Boris Johnson signed up to that pledge, in effect, to get our boys off from being pursued.  Obviously, it is linked to Brexit and all that right-wing populism and the tabloid media and all of that.<br\/><br\/>The other significant thing that happened within the Tory Party was the emergence of the Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and Veterans) Bill.  There was an investigation into the activities of allegations of torture by British soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The courts held that in places where the UK, in effect, had sovereignty over territory, the European Convention on Human Rights applied.  Therefore, those people were able to sue.  They had Article 2 rights to proper investigation and Article 3 rights for torture and so on.  I think there was outrage within the military establishment within the Tory Party at this idea that courts were reaching deep into the military operations in theatre and there was a big reaction to that.<br\/><br\/>Part of it is anti-European Convention on Human Rights and part of it is also anti-left-wing human rights lawyers.

Let me give Ms Gildernew an example from the command paper itself, which includes the following sentence: \"Security Forces were responsible for around 10% of Troubles-related deaths - the vast majority of which were lawful.\"  That is a position put forward by the UK Government.  First of all, the 10% figure clearly represents an absolute denial that any collusion ever took place because that is just the figure for persons directly killed by the security forces.  Clearly, the phrase the \"vast majority\" of killings by the security forces were lawful is problematic on a number of levels.  Clearly, that assessment cannot be made when state killings were never effectively and independently investigated.  It is also problematic in the sense that it implies that most of the people who were victims of the state were guilty of very serious offences at the time they were killed, otherwise the killings would not have been lawful.<\/p> <p>  We put in a freedom of information request.  It is a very grand claim to make.  We put a freedom of information request into the Northern Ireland Office to get hold of the assessment it conducted to reach that particular claim.  The response we got was that it held no information in relation to that particular claim.  We pushed back at it to ask how it made the assessment.  Did it just make it up or was there something upon which this was based?  What it came back to was that very few people were convicted and, of course, we know the reason that is the case.  We have been through it already today.  The rule of law was simply very rarely applied to the security forces in those circumstances and that explains the very few convictions.  Other areas of law were alluded to earlier, where there were sexual offences, in particular, where there are very few convictions.  It does not mean offences did not take place.

It is not going to work and it will allow parallel histories to exist.  People are still going to have their own views on what happened, but there will be no central overarching mechanism or process with credibility that covers the culpability of all the actors.
