Apologies have been received from Deputy Imelda Munster.  In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others, to be respectful of other people's physical space and to adhere to any other public health advice.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the  committee.  He is accompanied this morning by Mr. William Cronin, audit manager at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from the Department of Education to examine the following: the 2020 appropriation account for Vote 26 &ndash; Education; from the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2018 Report on the Accounts of the Public Services - Chapter 7, Purchase of sites for school provision; and from the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2019 Report on the Accounts of the Public Services - Chapter 8, Management of the schools estate.  Due to unforeseen circumstances, the Secretary General, Ms Bernie McNally, could not be in attendance for today's meeting.  As the Secretary General is the Department's Accounting Officer and that function cannot be delegated, I propose that we make the transcript of today's proceedings available to the Secretary General to allow her, in her capacity as Accounting Officer, to comment on or clarify any matters that arise during the course of the meeting.  As a similar situation arose in respect of our meeting with the Department of Foreign Affairs last week, I also propose that we afford that Department's Accounting Officer the same opportunity.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I wish Ms McNally well and hope she will be back in good fettle soon.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the Department of Education: Mr. Gavan O'Leary, assistant secretary, corporate services; Mr. Hubert Loftus, assistant secretary and head of the planning and building unit; Ms Deirdre Mc Donnell, assistant secretary and head of major operations and shared services; Mr. Harold Hislop, chief inspector; Ms Martina Mannion, assistant secretary; and Mr. Tom Whelan, principal officer and head of the finance unit.  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following assistant secretaries from the Department: Ms Aoife Conduit, Ms Deirdre Shanley and Mr. Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc.  In addition, we are joined by Ms Georgina Hughes-Elders, principal officer in the education Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off or in silent mode.  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, three of today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as does a witness who is physically present.  These witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 such that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I now call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#A00800","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657182600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Vote 26 was restructured in 2020 following the formation of the Government.  Responsibility for the previous Vote programmes for higher education and science were transferred to the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  Responsibility for first level, second level and early years education remained with the renamed Department of Education.<\/p> <p>  The appropriation account for Vote 26 - Education records gross expenditure of &euro;8.6 billion in 2020.  This was up 4.3% year-on-year relative to the comparable programme in 2019.  In 2020, the largest element of spending was for the pay and pensions of current and former teachers and other school staff, amounting to &euro;6.72 billion in total.  Payments related to the provision of school buildings and extensions and other educational infrastructure totalled &euro;848 million in 2020.  This included &euro;65 million in payments related to public-private partnership provision of schools.  Expenditure on school transport totalled just under &euro;225 million.<\/p><p> On the receipts side, appropriations-in-aid of the Vote amounted to &euro;355 million in 2020.  The majority of these receipts are pension-related contributions from current education employees.  It should be noted that employee contributions from employees who are members of the single public service pension scheme, recruited since January 2013, are remitted directly to Vote 12.  For 2020, the surplus to be surrendered from Vote 26 was just under &euro;138 million.  This resulted from net underspending across the Vote subheads.  I issued a clear audit opinion for the appropriation account for 2020.<\/p><p> In my annual report for 2018, I presented a report on the purchase between 2016 and 2018 of three high-value sites for school developments in Dublin city.  The three sites in question were the former Rehab premises at Roslyn Park in Sandymount; the former greyhound racing stadium site in Harold's Cross; and buildings owned by the former Dublin Institute of Technology located in Cathal Brugha Street and Marlborough Street.  The three sites were bought for a combined total of just over &euro;67 million.  Our focus was in establishing whether a well-defined business case was in place and how the Department of Education ensured value for money was achieved for the very substantial prices paid for the sites.<\/p><p> In each case, it was noted that the sites acquired did not meet the Department's own guidelines for minimum site area for development of schools.  In practice, given the challenges of developing schools in established urban areas, the Department was planning to maximise the potential of the sites, for example by locating both a primary and a post-primary school on the larger sites and by allowing for use of multistorey buildings.  The report recommended that the Department should review its parameters for the size of sites required for schools to allow for more intensive development of sites in restricted areas.  The Accounting Officer has provided additional information on how the sites have been utilised since the report was published in September 2019 and on progress being made to develop permanent school premises and facilities on these valuable sites.<\/p><p> The Department of Education has overall responsibility for management of the nation's schools estate, which comprises almost 4,000 premises and land serving a student population of around 950,000.  This property represents an accumulated investment by taxpayers of many billions of euro.  In my annual report for 2019, I sought to outline the Department&rsquo;s arrangements for monitoring the condition of school properties, funding of maintenance and refurbishment and protection of the State's financial interest in those properties.<\/p><p> Recommendations in the report include the conduct of a survey to assess the condition of schools nationwide in a consistent manner to facilitate strategic targeting of resources; the development of guidance and good practice information to assist schools in their maintenance responsibilities; the implementation of legal agreements where appropriate to protect the State's interest in the schools estate; and refinements in accounting practice.  I am glad to report that all of the recommendations were accepted by the Department.  The Accounting Officer has provided an update on progress made in implementing the recommendations since the publication of the report in September 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#A00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Leary and thank him for leading the delegation at short notice.

In beginning my statement, I have been asked to convey the sincere apologies of my Secretary General, Ms Bernie McNally, for not being able to attend the committee today.  Unfortunately, she is unwell, and in line with current public health advice she is self-isolating and unable to be here.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee the invitation to attend today to discuss the Department of Education 2020 appropriation accounts, chapter 7 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2018, which deals with the purchase of sites for school provision, and chapter 8 of the 2019 report, which deals with the management of the schools estate.  As indicated by the Chairman, I am joined by officials from the Department who will cover various aspects of the matters under discussion.  We are also joined remotely by three assistant secretaries covering different areas of the Department.  We have provided the committee with briefing material in advance and hope this has been of some assistance.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, a new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science was established after the formation of the new Government in 2020.  Functions previously performed by the Department of Education and Skills were transferred to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in 2020.  The Vote 26 2020 accounts cover those functions that remain with the Department of Education and relate predominantly to primary and post-primary education.<\/p> <p>  The Department's net voted expenditure in 2020 was &euro;8.379 billion.  Of this, &euro;925 million was capital expenditure.  Net pay and superannuation account for approximately 78% of the Department's overall budget.  In 2020, this provided for almost 93,000 public service employees and 42,000 public service pensioners.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s programme expenditure now covers one programme area, namely, programme A.  The overall net expenditure for 2020 was &euro;8.241 billion and covered, for example, pay and superannuation costs for teachers and special needs assistants; grants to schools, including capitation payments; costs associated with teacher education; and provision of school transport.  This sum also covered additional costs arising due to the impact on schools of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  Due to the transfer of functions I referred to earlier, the Department's Revised Estimates Volume, REV, was further revised to take account of the transfer of functions in 2020.  Funding was also allocated as part of the further Revised Estimates process to cover costs arising due to Covid-19.  In July 2020, the Government agreed a living with Covid package, which made funding available from the Covid-19 reserve fund to support the reopening of schools in September 2020.<\/p> <p>  As the impacts of Covid-19 developed, supplementary supports were also agreed during the remainder of 2020 and beyond.  The funding for these supports totalled &euro;639 million for the 2020-21 school year.  Of this, &euro;331 million was allocated for expenditure in 2020.  This was allocated to cover additional costs arising due to Covid-19, such as additional substitution to cover teacher absences on sick leave, additional capital works to schools to enhance their safety in a Covid-19 environment, capitation for personal protective equipment, PPE, hand sanitisers etc. and school transport.  The full amount was not spent in 2020.  However, due to the uncertainties arising from Covid-19, it was prudent to make provision in the Vote for more negative scenarios in the later months of 2020.<\/p> <p>  Moving to procurement, the statement of internal financial control that forms part of the appropriation account provides details regarding the control systems in place.  It also notes details of instances of non-compliance with public procurement rules.  Such instances have arisen for reasons such as urgency, need for business continuity and sole supplier.  The Department is vigilant regarding good procurement practice and is committed to following the guidance available.  The Department is actively engaged with the procurement reform programme and is taking the opportunity to use centralised contracts and frameworks where appropriate.<\/p> <p>  On the question of public sector reform, the statement on internal financial control also notes the Department activity in the area of shared services.  The Department is advancing a range of initiatives across the entire education and training sector and is actively leading and participating in the rolling out of shared services.<\/p> <p>  On the school capital programme, this committee meeting will also discuss chapter 7 on the purchase of sites for school provision and chapter 8 on the management of the schools estate.  These chapters included a number of recommendations from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Department is actively addressing these recommendations, with significant progress made.  The Department is taking every opportunity to continuously improve and strengthen its processes through its integration and harnessing of data, allowing for better strategic planning and delivery of its overall school building programme.<\/p> <p>  I will mention briefly some developments in 2021 and 2022.  The Covid-19 pandemic had an impact on the Department's activity in an unprecedented manner and the 2020 accounts.  This impact has continued into 2021 and 2022.  The education system's response was aligned to our core national priority of saving lives while being focused on ensuring continuity of education for learners, including a particular focus on more vulnerable students.<\/p><p>On the Ukrainian crisis, the arrival of a large number of Ukrainian children of schoolgoing age has created challenges in finding school places for them and responding to their needs.  There is a significant cost associated with this important work, which will be reflected in the 2022 accounts.<\/p><p> On special education needs, more than &euro;2 billion of the Department&rsquo;s budget is invested in special education needs.  A significant amount has been achieved.  For example, by the end of this year we will have 2,500 special classes across the country.  However, there is still an amount to be done and the Department is working intensively to ensure that all children with special educational needs can access a high quality and inclusive education in their locality.  I thank members for the opportunity to address the committee.  We are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavan O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I wish the Secretary General well and a speedy recovery.  On a positive note, I recognise that 2020 was an exceptionally challenging year for the Department.  It had to deal with a lot of new changes relating to Covid-19.  Perhaps not everything was done right, but I imagine it was not a very easy experience for departmental staff.  I also wish to acknowledge the work done by those on the front line in schools during that period.<\/p> <p>  The first issue that I wish to raise is very much under discussion currently.  It concerns the requirement for legislation to be rushed through to provide additional supports for children with special needs.  It is an issue that is raised with me repeatedly.  When I am running my constituency clinics, I am approached by many families looking for supports and school places for their children.  The delivery of such supports and places in the Cork area is far behind where it needs to be.  I am sure Ms Mannion will be aware of the issues in County Cork, in particular, and in south County Dublin, where the issue seems to be more acute than in other parts of the country.  That represents a systems failure by the Department, and something that requires urgent action to be taken.  I know that work is being done at the moment.  I will provide an example.  Recently, the Minister came to my constituency and we visited a number of schools.  We visited one secondary school with more than 800 pupils, which has an allocation of just one SNA.  That is shocking.  This issue is being raised in other areas of the country.  I am being repeatedly told, by school principals, that despite frequent requests being made to the local officer tasked with liaising between the Department and the schools, they are getting nowhere.  That is affecting areas such as Midleton, Cobh and Glanmire.  It is extremely serious.  What is the Department doing to try to improve and build upon the work being undertaken to try to limit the scenario where the schools out there quite frankly cannot get the resources they require?  As I mentioned earlier, I visited a school with 800 pupils to which only one SNA is allocated.  That is not reflective of the needs of the students who require SNA support.  <\/p> <p>  Is Ms Mannion in charge of that brief?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#C00200","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657182600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>For the purposes-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavan O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I asked a question.

As the Deputy will be aware, the vast bulk of children in our school system are educated in the mainstream system, with access to special education teaching supports and SNAs.  Approximately 1% of our children attend special schools, and another 1% are in special classes.  The Deputy mentioned the Cork area.  There are 244 special classes for children with ASD at primary level and 99 special classes for children at post-primary level in County Cork.  That is a total of 343 special classes in the county.  As my colleague, Mr. O'Leary, mentioned, we will have almost 2,500 special classes by the end of the year.  In the context of setting out how we are supporting children, it is important to highlight that we have made significant investment in special education in recent years.  There has been a fivefold increase in the number of special classes in the past decade.  There are almost 19,000 SNAs in the system.<\/p> <p>  With regard to County Cork in particular, as the Deputy will be aware, we have opened one new special school in Carrigaline under the patronage of the education and training board, ETB.  Another new special school will be opened in Rochestown later this year.  The Deputy mentioned the challenges in south County Dublin, in particular.  While there are challenges, overall, the development of special classes and special school provision across the country is going a significant way towards meeting the needs of children with special educational needs.  Of course, we are conscious that we need to do more.  The Deputy mentioned County Dublin.  It might interest him to know that there are almost 336 special classes at primary level in County Dublin in 43% of all of the schools in the area.  At post-primary level, almost 45% of the schools in the county have special classes.  The number has significantly increased this year, notwithstanding that challenges remain in a small number of places.  We are working closely with schools to ensure that we can deliver those places for September 2022.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also made reference to the passing of legislation.  We are grateful that the D&aacute;il passed legislation relating to section 37A of the Education Act 1998 yesterday.  The provision allows the Department and the Minister to have faster access to special classes, which is in the best interest of children with special educational needs.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, announced in May that for the third time, the process was being recommenced to allow for the delivery of extra special classes in the Dublin area.  <\/p> <p>  On the issue of SNAs, as the Deputy will be aware, there are more than 19,000 SNAs-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Martina Mannion"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I am sorry but I will have to stop Ms Mannion there.  Time is limited.  We have discussed the issue of SNAs.  I appreciate her response.  I mentioned gaps in provision.  One of the areas affected is east Cork.  I do not want to be parochial, but I want to use the area as an example.  I am sure other members are aware of similar examples.  If parents living in Youghal have a child with significant educational needs for whom mainstream education is not an option and he or she wants to attend one of the special schools, they are faced with having to travel to Cork city or Dungarvan.  The journey to Cork city takes 50 minutes with no traffic, and 70 minutes if there is.  The journey to Dungarvan takes 30 or 40 minutes.  I acknowledge that the provision of transportation to special schools is not entirely within the Department's remit.  I understand that the HSE has a role in the provision of these transportation services, and it does not transport children to special schools beyond the county boundary.  To me, that is deeply frustrating.  It is something that should be looked at.<\/p> <p>   I will move on, because time is limited.  I understand that Mr. Loftus has responsibility in the area of school construction and the building unit.

It has been one of the worst experiences that I have had in politics in engaging with any individual unit within the Civil Service.<\/p><p>What epitomised it was the rapid build projects that were presented in 2012.  There was a number of them around the country.  One of them was in Carrigtwohill.  At the time, it was the most expensive school project ever presented and one of the largest school capital developments in the history of the State.  It was for a three-school campus.  It was presented as a rapid build in 2012, but the sod has still not been turned on that project.  It beggars belief that this is allowed to happen.  There are other such instances.  A major fire broke out in a school in Mallow in 2016.  To this day the sod still has not been turned on the reconstruction of the damaged part of the school and additional facilities, which is appalling.<\/p><p> Can Mr. Loftus give an indication of why this happens?  It is worth noting that it involves significant public funds.  We are talking about hundreds of millions of euro and even billions of euro for capital projects for schools.  Why is that allowed to drag on with no sense of accountability?  Nobody seems to have been fired for the errors that took place in 2012.

Obviously, an emergency is an emergency, so that is school-led or there might be an architect or whoever else out at a school.  The minor works scheme is a mechanism to enable schools to do small-scale works and gives them the flexibility for that.  The summer works scheme is a multi-annual scheme.  There are various categories of works within that.  Schools then apply on that basis.  We work through that in priority order.  In that regard, first, as part of our climate agenda, we will have a strong climate action focus in respect of summer works.  There will be more clarity on that in the autumn in terms of detail and an application process for schools.

We have 580 schools currently being surveyed as a first tranche of those, and we envisage the bulk of the balance of schools to be done over the course of 2023 and 2024.

There was, however, a substantial delay from when the tenders for that project were received to the time the offer was made.  The tenderer could not then take the contract at the relevant price.  The contractor offered to undertake the project for a slightly higher amount but that would still have been below the value of  next lowest tender.  The Department&rsquo;s attitude was that it could not do that and that the price could not be adjusted once it had been submitted.  It ended up that the contract in question went to the fifth tenderer.  The other four companies that tendered said they could not undertake the project at the prices they had originally submitted.  The whole project cost approximately &euro;1 million more than envisaged, whereas if the Department had negotiated with the lowest tenderer, &euro;750,000 would have been saved.  Has a review of the tendering process been undertaken?  What are the mechanisms for dealing with tendering now in view of the changing situation in this regard, with building costs increasing substantially in a short period?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#F00300","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657182600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Construction cost inflation is an issue that Mr. Loftus is probably best placed to address.

Other Deputies have raised issues in their constituencies.  I represent D&uacute;n Laoghaire and I am aware of a particular school which has been in prefabricated units on-site since 2005.  The State pays for the upkeep and maintenance of the prefabs annually.  About three years ago, one of the prefabs was condemned.  We thought that was wonderful because the prefabs would be moved, but instead the State purchased or rented another prefab.  The school has been on this temporary site for about 27 years, although the Department owns it.  Mr. Loftus outlined five stages, which sound quite simple, but I know it is complex.  The Department probably selects land owned by the council or State land first and then if that is not available, it seeks to acquire land, if possible.  I am sure Mr. Loftus will agree that 27 years is a long time to spend in prefabs.  It has an impact on the school, although not on the quality of education, which is excellent.  It has an impact when people visit it.  When will the prefabs be replaced or when will there be a permanent building?  I will come back to that in a second.<\/p> <p>  The Department had capital expenditure of &euro;4.1 billion in 2021.  Some &euro;165 million was spent on temporary accommodation, according to the briefing note supplied to us.  Some &euro;29.4 million was spent on renting temporary accommodation.  Does &euro;165 million include the &euro;29.4 million or is that in addition to it?  I know those are not all prefabs and that temporary accommodation could include other things.  Do the witnesses have a figure for how much the Department spent on prefabricated units in the period we are discussing, which is 2021?

Part and parcel of that was looking at modular accommodation and the creation of a modular accommodation framework.  That is very positive from the climate agenda because it works off a decarbonised heating strategy.  One variation of that which we put in place this year was a timber-frame modular framework.

According to the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, the largest class sizes in the country are in Kildare.

It was on the building programme and should have commenced in 2018.  I refer to the Mercy Convent in Naas.  A 24-classroom school, it is not completed yet because we have gone to stage 6 as opposed to stage 5.  Stage 6 is when one's contractor terminates and one has to re-tender.  That is my description of it anyway.  There will be additional costs associated with that.  I would like to know why the contract was terminated.  It is important that we understand why this happened so that it does not happen again.  There would have been additional costs in that there was security on the site on a permanent basis.  There were temporary buildings put in for a protracted period of time because the pupils were there and required the accommodation.  At one point, there were subcontractors shut out of the site.  Obviously, there would be an additional cost associated with that because they could not get their plant and equipment.  It is to go back to tender now.  It certainly will not be completed until there is a tender and somebody gets back in on the site.  It is unlikely to be completed this year.  It should have commenced in 2018.  One would nearly build the children's hospital in the time that it will take to build this particular school.  Can Mr. Loftus give us some indication of how one prevents that kind of, not unique but unusual, thing happening where it will add to the cost and create chaos?

One of the major problems was simply down to the wall-ties not being dropped on the concrete blocks when the two sets of walls were being constructed.

By and large the scheme works very well.  There are problems with it from time to time, and especially this time of the year.  Inevitably, some parents will come to us, or schools will come to us and I want to raise this with the officials.  I spent the morning of last Monday week trying to get through to the school transport section in the Department in Tullamore or trying to speak with a human being, and I failed.  I want to address this with the officials.  If we go back ten years ago, I would probably have been able to phone somebody on the couple of occasions every year when there were problems.<\/p><p>That is not possible now.  All of the phones ring out.  If people are working from home and they are supposed to be able to take calls, if they are not connected up by phone, they cannot work from home.  I know people who are working from home, such as my sister-in-law.  When the phone rings in her office, it rings twice and goes directly to her mobile phone.  She can work two days a week at home.  The point I am making is that there is no answering service and no way of leaving a message.  I cannot get a name of anybody.  I appeal to Department officials, on foot of what I am raising, to give me a name and phone number of somebody.  If they cannot do it now, maybe one of them can do it after the meeting.  I am raising it here because I am at my wits' end with it.<\/p><p> We talked about demographics.  The demographic situation in the Portlaoise area, as Mr. Loftus would know, is that the population is increasing.  Great work is being done providing new schools.  There is still a need for new school buildings, for example at Kolbe Special School.  There is a situation where there are no primary places.  Children from a number of different households and backgrounds, including foreign nationals and some Traveller children, are affected.  There are 21 children who need a bus to go Barnashrone National School.  The principal and I were told that each one of those has been informed they have to go through a section 29 appeal.  It will take much time to work its way through, and these are people whose first language is not English.  I have a copy of a letter from the three primary schools in Portlaoise town that states they are full and have no spaces.  Barnashrone National School is a DEIS school.  It is suitable for these students.  It is in the Mountmellick area.  As it happens, it is only about 4 miles out the road and about 3 miles from where I live.  It has the space and it is a wonderful school.  If the school inspector looks at it, he or she will see it is a school that has performed very well.  As a DEIS school, it has taken many children who have certain challenges and it has been very good.  That needs to be looked at.  If they have to go through a section 29 appeal, surely once the schools in the Portlaoise catchment area have confirmed that there are no spaces, that should be done and dusted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#N06200","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657182600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I am aware of the case.

In terms of eligibility, as the Chair knows, eligibility for transport is based on one&rsquo;s nearest school.  After that, it is based on one&rsquo;s second nearest school and so on.  The principal and parents have been advised that there is no requirement for a section 29 process to be undergone.  Confirmation from the principals of all the schools between that family and the school they wish to attend will be required to confirm that there are no places available in those schools.

Recently I met the family of two very special needs children, both intellectually and physically, who are now adults and their transition from primary to post-primary education was extremely difficult.  In 2001, a fundamental part of their education in terms of the delivery of special needs was the provision of a special needs assistant who worked on a one-on-one basis.  When I met the mother of these boys recently her attitude was that in 2011 when one-on-one interaction was taken away it resulted in negative impacts on one of her sons who had fewer requirements then than his brother and would have been capable of holding down a job or living alone.  In 2011, the assistance was removed and it has never been put back.  Assistance is now provided on a piecemeal basis and the teacher decides what is required and who gets what, which is counterproductive and costs the Exchequer more in the long run.  Has the Department of Education carried out a value-for-money analysis, and I hate to use the term \"value-for money\" in this instance, following removal of that system of special needs education and assistance compared with the current services provided?  Does the Department cut ties when special needs children reach 18 years and, therefore, are no longer in the Department's education system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#P00700","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657182600,"counter":342,"content":"<p>The Deputy has touched on the very important issue of transition, of which the Department is very conscious.

International evidence suggests that the best people to work with children with special educational needs are those who are most highly trained and, therefore, the teaching staff so the degree to which one can maximise face-to-fact contact between the student and the teacher is the best way to ensure the best outcomes for the child.  That means if one wants to support the child in the longer term, and get the very best outcomes, it is better to put the resources, to a greater extent, into providing teachers, and huge numbers of teachers have been put into the system, rather than into special needs assistants.  There are some children who obviously have physical and other needs so a special needs assistant is absolutely vital to them for either toileting or mobility reasons.  It is important that the provision of special needs assistants does not get between the teacher and the student.  The evidence from a lot of international studies is that special needs assistants or classroom assistants can, in some cases, become a barrier between the teacher and the child.  So it is really important that the emphasis is placed on the provision of the teaching, and teaching of a very high skill, for the good long-term outcomes of the child.<\/p> <p>  The age of the child is relevant as we talk about special needs assistants.  Young children often do need a special needs assistant and often benefit from one.  For the psychological and long-term well-being of the child, as the children become older many do not want a special needs assistant.  If one is not careful in how that is managed, the children feel they are being undermined in their own development and maturity because of a special needs assistant tagging along.  It is a really delicate operation to choose when and when not to use the special needs assistant.  The very best people to make decisions about that are probably the principal of the school and the teachers involved.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#P01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Harold Hislop"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I appreciate that there are international studies.

With regard to how they are allocated, I know there are always debates about this issue and the inspector over that section, Mr. Hislop, outlined the criteria and how the assessment is done.  I want to highlight with regard to the allocation of funding for such schools that, as I see it, there are different levels of need and there are situations where children's level of psychological or physical disability would not be very intense.  However, the Kolbe school has been told it is overstaffed.  I visited the school a number of times and I know the students have very intense needs, both psychological and physical.  The first time I was there, I came away and wondered to myself how anyone would get through a day, given the level of need the children have is so intense.  However, the school has been told it is overstaffed.  Children stay there until they are 18 years of age and there are teenagers there who are a lot bigger than me, which presents significant challenges.  I do not want to go into too much detail but I have witnessed it at first hand.  The staff are really challenged and people have been injured, and there are many things I could say about it to the Department privately.  We cannot have a situation where the criteria are the same for that school.  I appeal to the Department and Mr. Hislop to examine that.<\/p> <p>  The parents are greatly challenged and the summer period is very difficult for them.  When children go to the Kolbe school during the day in the normal school term, it gives parents of bit of breathing space, but the staff take over and it is a very challenging situation for them.  Speaking on behalf of the parents and staff, for September the school needs a couple of extra SNAs, given what they are saying to me, and I appeal to the Department to look at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#S01300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657182600,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

However, we absolutely understand there will be children within those cohorts who will need individual SNAs to support them through their education.  The National Council for Special Education will work with schools to ensure that where the needs of those children merit an individual SNA - I did not get the opportunity to say this to Deputy Verona Murphy before she left - the system has not changed in terms of individual children no longer needing an SNA or no longer being able to access an individual SNA, if that is what they require.

It seems the Department is stating if remedial targets are hit it will not impose a sanction.  I request that we seek clarification on whether any penalties have been applied.  The target was that 60,000 homes would be passed by the end of 2021.  In January, the figure was only 34,000.  The most up-to-date figure I have is from mid-June, when 56,600 premises had been passed.  This means as of the summer we have not even met the targets set down for the end of last year.

We know how important this is and how important it is if a project is not included.  I will give an example from my constituency.  The DART+ project is to go to Maynooth.  In actual fact it includes railway sheds.  There are eight railway sheds to be constructed 350 m from the station in Kilcock.  The train line will not go as far as Kilcock.  The DART will go to Kilcock but people will not be able to get on a train there.  The reason the NTA cannot amend the railway order is because Kilcock was not included in the previous project.  There will have to be a separate process so that the current process will not be challenged.  It shows the importance of having projects in the plan that make sense.  I would have thought that wider involvement in the consultation process rather than restricted involvement would have been the way to go.  Given that the strategy covers the period from 2022 to 2042, there is a value in making sure the plan is correct in the first instance and that we do not leave out very obvious measures that should be included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#CC01300","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy has proposal on what we should do on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#CC01400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":456,"content":"<p>If the Minister approves the draft and we have not seen it, I am concerned about the consultation process.

That will be for next week.<\/p> <p>  The next item is C, which is correspondence from private individuals.  Item 1343 is for myself.  It has been dated 5 July 2022.  It is a request that we make inquiries with the HSE regarding the expenditure on Erkina House, Rathdowney.  This follows on from the consideration of an issue raised by Deputy Hourigan last week and our agreement to hold an engagement with the HSE in relation to mental health and expenditure in the community health organisations, CHOs, 4 and 8.   This information will help inform that meeting.  Is it agreed to request that? <\/p> <p> The background to this is that the HSE had decided to close the facility.  Very few people seemed to know anything about it, including the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  The Minister of State confirmed on the floor of the House that she was consulted about it and that it required her say-so before it could be closed.  There have been significant improvements made to that development.  There are 12 very vulnerable people who are living there.  It is a great facility in the town of Rathdowny, in south County Laois.  The HSE said that they have four such units in Laois-Offaly.  If one is going to put two in Laois and two in Offaly, this facility is in the centre of the south of the county and is therefore ideally located.  It is on a fabulous site with fantastic gardens.  An examination of the site is being undertaken at the moment by the HSE.  A relevant point is that we want to try to get a figure for the spend on that building in recent times in order to see how it works.  I know that a huge re-roofing was job done in the past year on the building.  The building would seem to me to be in good shape.  It is a similar situation in some ways to the Owenacurra Centre.  This building is certainly a substantial structure and is in good condition.  It is important from the committee's point of view that we find out what has been spent to date on it.  Is that agreed?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#DD01800","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":474,"content":"<p>It is agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022070700002#DD01900","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Thank you.  The final item of correspondence is 1338C, which is dated 23 June 2022.  It concerns the wards of court fund.  It requests that the committee examine the issue.  The correspondence states that there have been substantial losses to the fund and that there is a lack of proper State oversight of the fund, which is in excess of &euro;2 billion.<\/p> <p>  While the Committee of Public Accounts as of the 31st D&aacute;il, published a report in July 2015, on the wards of court fund, the Committee of Public Accounts of the 32nd D&aacute;il considered the matter.  It decided that it was more appropriate that it was under the remit of the then committee on justice and equality and closed its consideration of the matter. <\/p> <p>  The difficulty is that the fund is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Therefore, it does not fall within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  In September 2020, this committee also considered correspondence on the matter.  It referred related correspondence that was received from the Department of Justice and from the Courts Service to the correspondent.  It advised that its consideration of the matter was closed.  It is proposed that we advise the correspondent that it remains the case that matter is most appropriate to the remit of the Joint Committee on Justice, particularly because the fund is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The correspondent also states that in 2010, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, assured the Justice for Wards group that legislation was being drafted to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to have oversight of these funds.  Matters of legislation are also for that committee.<\/p> <p>  To try to assist the correspondent, I would suggest that we clarify the position and that we advise that we might wish to bring the matter to the attention of the justice committee.
