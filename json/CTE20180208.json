Apologies have been received from Deputy McDonald.<\/p> <p>  Are the minutes of our meeting of 1 February agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Next on our agenda is an issue that I wish to discuss arising from the minutes.  Representatives from the National Shared Services Office appeared before us last week.  It is the body that manages the payroll and pension payments of what we all understood to be the majority of the public service, excluding HSE staff, garda&iacute; and teachers.  The figure cited in the relevant chapter regarding non-returned salary overpayments to public servants was &euro;4.6 million.  That is the figure we all saw - and by which we went - in the chapter when the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was published last year.  Towards the end of that meeting, I asked about the up-to-date figure for the end of 2017.  Matters became vague at that point.  The witnesses told us that new organisations had come in during 2017 and that the figures for the end of 2016 would not be comparable with those for the end of 2017.<\/p> <p>  When I consulted the Comptroller and Auditor General, we established that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection had not been under the National Shared Services Office in 2016 but that it was in 2017 and had had a significant influence on the &euro;4.6 million figure.  I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to prepare a chart for us showing the total figure of uncollected salary overpayments across all Departments at year-end.<\/p><p>He went through the 900 pages of his appropriation accounts report and at the end of every Vote he came up with the figures, which were scattered throughout the 900 pages of his report.  A document was submitted to us yesterday.  I asked that it be circulated yesterday evening because I only saw it yesterday and it is highly relevant.  In addition, I asked him about the other Votes that were not intended to be under the National Shared Services Office, which mainly included teachers and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> The position now is that there are overpayments reported in the appropriation accounts for Votes which the National Shared Services Office provide, namely, human resources, payroll and pensions administration.  The actual figure on the schedule submitted to us across all Departments is &euro;7.5 million.  They are the public Departments.  We were talking about &euro;4.6 million, but in addition to that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#A00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Is that the same year the Chairman is talking about, 2016?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#B00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Yes, across Departments.  In addition to that, because I was conscious of the fact that the Department of Education and Skills, the teachers, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were not included in that figure, I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General about it.  He said that in regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, prisons, education and Army pensions, there is another &euro;8 million in uncollected overpayments in respect of salaries and pensions in those Departments.  The total figure on the schedule we got last night now comes to &euro;15.633 million of uncollected overpayments of salaries and pensions across all Departments.  That is three times higher than the figure we spent several hours discussing last week.  Everything that was said here last week was correct and accurate.  All I am saying is that it just was not the full picture.  There was nothing said that was not accurate.  It twigged with me at the end of the meeting that there was probably a lot not in here, so the &euro;15.633 figure is the full picture and that schedule has been supplied to members today.<\/p> <p>  I want to go through the key figures in that schedule that were not discussed the last day.  The reason I am doing it is because it is totally relevant to last week's meeting.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will come back with an exact report.  The first one I want to highlight is the Office of the Revenue Commissioners where there are uncollected overpayments of &euro;1.512 million in respect of 1,000 people, which is an average of &euro;1,414 per person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Chairman-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#B00400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Just let me finish putting the facts on the record and we will discuss it then because the full picture did not emerge the last day.<\/p> <p>  We then have the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which has &euro;3.2 million in uncollected overpayments.  That is an average of &euro;2,177 per person.  The total figure for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na supplied by the Comptroller and Auditor General last night is &euro;1.8 million, which is an average of &euro;1,711 per case.

The figure is probably over &euro;20 million.  We will first write to the HSE for the equivalent figures.  I will call Deputy Kelly shortly, but will the Comptroller and Auditor General explain the reason the HSE is under the Department of Health and that Department does not include the HSE overpayments?

In terms of what happened, essentially we extended the chain for giving instructions for what is the appropriate pay.  The National Shared Services Office has two wings to it.  One is the human resources, HR, and pension administration function and then there is the actual payment function.  Some organisations are managed by the National Shared Services Office in terms of a HR and pension administration function, but not all of their payroll is included.

The purpose of shared services was to achieve a cost saving and greater efficiency but, based on what we are hearing, that is being only partially achieved.  It is supposed to be a shared services system but when one drills down into it in some cases it is and in others it is not.  Last week, when we asked what organisations were covered we were told all Departments are covered and that the Oireachtas is the only organisation outside of it but there are other layers within the Departments that are not covered.  For example, the Department of Justice and Equality is covered but An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army Pensions are not; the Department of Health might be covered but the HSE is not, and the Department of Education and Skills is covered but teachers and third level institutions are not.  This tells us something about the shared services system, irrespective of the overpayments.  Why did we set up this service and then not use it?

One of my objectives in doing the Chapter was to surface this issue.  The figure for the Department of Education and Skills is substantial.  We have reported previously on overpayments to teachers.  The point was made last week that in a large payroll administration there will be overpayments from time to time.  It is not news that there is some level of overpayment in any organisation.  The difficulty was that with the introduction of shared services there appeared to be an increase across the board in the overpayments that were being recorded.  That is why I decided to focus on what was happening in national shared services.  The framework that we were using for analysing it could be used by any of the State bodies, including the HSE or the Department of Education and Skills in regard to the teachers' payroll, to review their own systems and to identify ways that they could prevent overpayments occurring so that the minimum necessary amount of overpayment is incurred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#C01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Has any analysis been undertaken of the likely saving if some of these organisations moved to shared services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#C01300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518080400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Almost all of the target groups to be brought within national shared services are in now, particularly now that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is under the remit.

We acknowledge and fully respect the role of the Committee and its current focus and we thank you for inviting us to address your members.

It gives an example of how a large multinational, which Glanbia is, interacts with the Revenue Commissioners.  I ask people to read that letter.  It highlights what it considers the excellent Revenue online service.  It says it is part of the large cases division.  It highlights the fact there is a nominated person in the Revenue to deal with all of Glanbia's affairs, which it finds most helpful.

Talking about the way it deals with Revenue, she says: &quot;In fact we consider that this should be part of Ireland's offering to attract foreign direct investment i.e. make it known that Ireland has a best-in-class tax administration including both efficient online systems (e.g. ROS) and availability of senior revenue personnel to resolve technical issues promptly and efficiently.&quot;  That is praise of the Revenue Commissioners from Glanbia.  She says from her dealings with other countries, the Irish Revenue is top of the class.  We want to say that.  She has given us useful information that we will consider as part of our report.  <br\/><br\/>Pfizer has written to us.  It said &quot;Pfizer appreciates Ireland's commitment to the 12.5% corporate income tax rate.&quot;  It thinks that is quite important.<br\/><br\/>GlaxoSmithKline wrote to us and discussed its availability to come in.  <br\/><br\/>Google said it is not in a position to attend.  <br\/><br\/>Cement Roadstone said it is part of the Revenue's large case division and has direct dealings with the Revenue, which it highlights in a positive way.  <br\/><br\/>Some of them have replied with particular comments that we will take on board.  Deputy Cullinane had asked about that.  We discussed GlaxoSmithKline briefly in private session last week.  I thank it for its acceptance of the invitation and for making contact with the secretariat to make the necessary arrangements.  While it is an offer we may take up at some point in the future, in our current examination it would not be representative of the multinational sector to only have one company in.  I propose we write to GlaxoSmithKline to thank it and formally communicate our decision.  We will agree not to invite it in at this time.  We are not saying we will not invite it in but just not immediately.  <br\/><br\/>There are a couple of letters there.  We will be holding a private session next week with Brian Keegan, the director of Chartered Accountants Ireland, who will give a briefing to the committee on this area and it will be followed by public engagement with Mr. Keegan on the morning of 22 February.  Mr. Keegan has considerable expertise in this field and he will assist the committee and the public in our understanding by way of that attendance at the public meeting.  We will be completing our examination of that topic with a further engagement from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners on the afternoon of 22 February.  We will have an impartial expert here on the morning and a wrap-up session with Revenue and the Department of Finance to deal with the issues that will emerge in the public briefing session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#D02900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>There has been a spotlight on Ireland for some time now in terms of corporation tax.  Some of it is good and some of it not so good in terms of the perception of how corporation tax is applied in Ireland.  We have the European Commission's judgment on Apple.  Generally there has been what I would regard as a very negative interpretation of how the Irish tax code applies to multinationals.  I have my own concerns as a citizen and a public representative.  We were trying to establish as a Committee for Public Accounts how multinationals see our tax code, how they interact with it and Revenue so we can learn from it and do a report on the back of it.  It is disappointing that all but one have not taken up the opportunity to come before the committee.  I do not know whether that says more about them or us; I would say it says more about them.  We should commend the one company that was in a position to come to us.  Notwithstanding the companies sending us information that may or may not be useful to us, what we were looking for was these companies to come.  We cannot compel them.  Their attendance was requested on a voluntary basis to help us understand how they interact with the tax code as an organisation.  These companies make a lot of money here.  They are very profitable companies.  Some of their interactions with the tax code can cost the taxpayer money.  In my view, we had a duty to follow up on it and I commend the Chairman for taking it on as an initiative.  We cannot compel them to come.  It says something about the multinationals that operate here that they were not prepared to come before the Committee of Public Accounts to help us understand how they, as companies, interact with the tax code.  It is not good from their perspective and I want to put that on the record.  I commend GlaxoSmithKline as the one company that was prepared to come in and talk to us.  It should also be noted that many of the companies that have refused to come before the Committee of Public Accounts appeared before similar committees in Wales, England, the US and other parts of Europe.  They have form in attending similar committees in different countries but were not in a position to come to this committee in this State.  People can make up their own minds on that when they consider it is the one country in which they would not attend at the committee despite the controversy around how multinationals operate here.  It speaks volumes for them and it is disappointing that they have decided not to take the opportunity to come before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#E00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I was going to make a very similar point.

It means we have to assume things because we do not have available information that we can draw from through engagement with the companies.  It means our assumptions may or may not be right.  It is actually quite useful for us to know what their engagement is like with Revenue.  There could have been other things we could have found out that would give a better public understanding, as well as a better understanding for the committee of how this works.

I missed out on the Kerry Group.  The Chairman might come back.  I am just making my point and I will not take up too much time.  Could the Chairman tell me what the Kerry Group said?  Again, it has been put in perspective.  This arose from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report regarding corporation tax and what appeared to be a huge variation in the level of tax collected.  Arising from that variation, we were looking to engage with multinationals.  A thumbs up to a committee is not a good way to deal with a public accounts committee.  It is literally a thumbs up.  If companies are proudly paying their taxes, as we all must, they should have no fear of coming before us.  Some of them might have written very positive letters and told us that but it would be nice to hear that and engage with them.  GlaxoSmithKline is one exception and has been rightly praised.  I visited Cardiff with a member of the committee and we know well that they appeared before the committees in England.  I cannot remember whether it was England or Wales.  Perhaps they did not like the experience there.<\/p> <p>  What I was told there was that what had come out with regard to Ireland was seriously questionable.  I do not want to repeat that as gospel.  That was what was said to us, so serious questions must be asked.  I would have thought that at the very least, those companies associated with Ireland, although they are much bigger, like Cement Roadstone, would proudly come before us.  Mr. Ryanair has an opinion on me as a cyclist and on lots of things and I would have thought he would have jumped, or maybe flown, at the opportunity to speak to us here about tax matters.  The way the Chairman phrased it was very general.  We were not going into specifics so I must say that I am really disappointed.  I suppose it is pointless to ask them to reflect - multinationals do not seem to reflect - and come back to us but for the record, this is a golden opportunity to come before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#F00600","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>For the record, the Kerry Group said that \"in relation to the subject matter of your invitation, we do not believe we have anything specific to add to your enquiries in relation to the Irish Revenue Commissioners administration of corporate tax.\"  The letter goes on to say that the Kerry Group had a diary problem.

That is agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 1059 is correspondence from Mr Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, dated 31 January 2018, providing a response to queries on management of claims by the State Claims Agency and the principle of open disclosure.  This is something to which we should return when the NTMA appears before us with its financial statements, which it normally has in the first half of the year.  This is a very important letter because according to the NTMA, the estimated liability at the end of 2017 was &euro;2.662 billion.  It is overwhelming.<\/p> <p>  I want to highlight a few items in Mr. Breen's letter because it is an issue about which everyone talks.  First of all, he is very critical of the legal profession representing clients.  This letter says that sometimes things take time but that this can happen where the settlement demands made by the plaintiff's lawyers are significantly overstated.  Mr. Breen goes on to say that the State Claims Agency has direct experience where solicitors acting on behalf of plaintiffs have originally demanded a multiple of two or three times the figure they eventually settled for.<\/p> <p>  He instances one case where a claim was put in for &euro;26 million in compensation and settled for &euro;12 million.  He goes on to say that there are occasions where faced with the individual plaintiff's law firm whose settlement demands were excessive, the only way the State Claims Agency can discharge its duty to the taxpayer is to take the case to court.  He is quite scathing about certain members of the legal profession.  He does not name them.<\/p> <p>  He goes on to talk about the Legal Services Regulation Act 2016, which provides for the making of regulations to introduce pre-action protocols.  They have not been implemented.  The letter states that the State Claims Agency has on its own initiative pioneered the introduction of interim payments in the form of periodic payment orders in 74 cases since 2010 but that out of the 74 cases, 15 plaintiffs did not proceed with them after a short period of time and asked for their lump sum because of the lack of a legislative basis backing up periodic payment orders system.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Breen highlighted the fact that most of the claims involving almost &euro;2 billion are in respect of clinical negligence claims while the others are general claims and that a total of 9,956 claims were active at the end of 2017 totalling &euro;2.662 billion.  There are 2,976 clinical cases with an average estimate of &euro;666,000 to deal with each of them based on its figures.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Breen then goes on to the issue of open disclosure.  I just stopped reading at this stage.  The letter states that there were reports in 2008, 2009 and 2013; a review in 2014; and training for staff in 2015.  On and on it goes.  We have not seen any result from open disclosure yet.  I am highlighting those points because it would take too long to read the letter and just noting and publishing it would not do the public a service because it needs to know the extent of involvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#F01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I raised this last week or the week before because I do not think I have ever seen a situation where people have come out of a court having settled and talked about the payment securing the future of a child.  There is a crossover between inadequate public services and the cases that are taken.  It is almost a self-fulfilling prophecy when one has that kind of contingent liability.  When one looks at the case where the plaintiff settled for &euro;12 million having originally sought &euro;26 million and one looks at the contingent liability, one can see that built into that will be the kind of costs about which we are talking, which are legal costs, that would be more properly spent on services.  If there was open disclosure, probably a very sizeable amount of that would be very significantly reduced and we might avoid the trauma of people having to spend years in the courts.  We need to do a piece of work on this.  It is too big an issue to just leave to a very good and full response from the NTMA.  It is as much about process as it is about value for money.  Given that it is the dominant one, I suspect we will probably need to get in the Department of Health with regard to moving to the open disclosure approach.<\/p><p>It is not enough just to look at the financial side of it.

We have put quite a spotlight on this sector and published a report.  Subsequently, we had a number of independent - I use that word advisedly - examinations into a number of issues.  Outstanding is the Thorn review in Limerick.  We have subsequently received new information that was on the front pages of some newspapers at the weekend that the university, potentially, misled the Committee of Public Accounts and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I want to hear from the comptroller if that is a fact.  I do not always believe what I see in the newspapers but I want it clarified at least.<\/p> <p>  We have two reports which are still outstanding from the HEA on spin-out companies and intellectual property.  We were told that the global one looking at policy, governance and whether changes needed to be made was to be published in January but we are now into February and it has not happened.  The report on Waterford IT has been with legal advisers since last December and has still not been published.  We are waiting for these reports so that the committee can do its work.<\/p> <p>  There seems to be a lot there but, looking at the work programme, none of it is scheduled up to April.  Funding in the third level sector was described as the \"wild west\" by a committee member before and we were trying to establish whether that was the case, whether good governance was in place and whether improvements could be made.  We have done a report, but that was only the start of our work.  There are a lot of reports and information we need from the HEA and that is not even to get onto the education and training board for Kildare-Wicklow, which falls under remit of the Department of Education and Skills.  We need to give that some attention.<\/p> <p>  My second point on the work programme is that I have consistently asked for RT&Eacute; to come before the committee.  We have just spent the last 15 minutes talking about multinationals that are not compelled to come before the committee.  We asked them to do so and they have refused.  We have not asked RT&Eacute; to come before the committee even though &euro;170 million of taxpayers' money is given to it.  It is one third of the line Department's funding, but the Accounting Officer was not even able to answer basic questions on it when he was before us.  I have specific concerns about allegations of bogus self-employment.  I have met senior staff in RT&Eacute; who are concerned and persons from a trade union representing journalists to discuss this issue, which appears to be a problem within the organisation.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue I want the committee to raise which has implications for Revenue.  While they are not doing anything wrong, senior broadcasters in RT&Eacute; are availing of the opportunity which is available to them to set up companies into which their salaries, or fees, are paid.  That was previously the case with hospital consultants and we dealt with it.  That process allows those broadcasters to reduce the amount of tax they pay.  They do not pay PAYE or PRSI but rather corporation tax.  We saw problems in relation to hospital consultants.  Are there similar problems here?  I cannot say and I am not making any allegations.  It is certainly worth examining as is bogus self-employment.<\/p> <p>  Another issue people have relates to the &euro;170 million, which was established to be the majority of the money.  I ask that this be prioritised.  I have raised it gently in the past and I am being a bit more assertive on this occasion.  It is important and the issues need to be examined.<\/p> <p>  On the third level sector, I cannot understand why the reports have still not been published by the HEA.  I am getting a little exasperated that we are getting letters from it, including letters sent to me personally from the head of the HEA, stating the reports would be published in January.  In fact, they were originally supposed to be published last October but were delayed.  While legal may be looking at some elements of some of them, two or three months is an extraordinary amount of time for them to be in the hands of legal within the HEA.  Can we follow those up again?  Once we know where they are at, we need to come back next week and put a focus on it.<\/p> <p>  I want to hear from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General specifically whether it was misled by the University of Limerick rather than to take that second or third hand from a newspaper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#H00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I will call the members first and then we will come back to the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#H00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I will be brief as Deputy Cullinane has more or less listed the issues I have.  Our work programme needs to change a little bit.  A lot of things are too pushed out.  Getting on to the universities and colleges, I have serious concerns about the evidence given here by the HEA and the manner in which that was done.  I also have concerns about the way reports and investigations are being done.  Timelines are not being met.  Why is that?  It compounds the issues we reported on in our initial report on the third level sector.  There are various reports and we need the Comptroller and Auditor General to verify whether they are accurate.  There are other reports on private consultants which are also of concern.  We still have outstanding questions regarding a number of universities and colleges.  I have continuously raised issues on CIT to which I have not received full answers.  UCC is signing a major contract to sponsor a concert hall in Cork and it is frightening to think it has not learned any lessons.  The whole issue on third level colleges is to get the answers we were promised and finding out if further information was kept from the committee and, possibly, the Comptroller and Auditor General and dealing with all of that.  We need to wrap that up in a nice bow in the committee, not let it drift further.<\/p> <p>  Through various forums and in the D&aacute;il, I raised the following matter a long time ago and it has now been followed up by others.  I refer to evidence given here by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on IT contracts.  I have read the transcript of the evidence a number of times and it raises serious concerns.  We spoke about this earlier.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referenced Accenture and the contracts there.  It is obvious that this did not transpire or come out through this forum notwithstanding very detailed questions, most of which, I note, were from Deputy MacSharry.  We have to get to the bottom of this soon because it is a very serious issue.<\/p> <p>  I support Deputy Cullinane on the issues with regard to RT&Eacute;.  It is very much in the public interest that we deal with those.

On top of that, we are talking about bringing in RT&Eacute; and all these sectors.  I have nothing against bringing in any of these things, but sometimes we need to focus on what our job is on the PAC.  There is aggressive tax playing going on in agencies which is fully legal.  I remember when the head of the Revenue Commissioners appeared before the finance committee and came here the next day.  We asked him about company structures being set up and he said the Revenue is very clear that it never looks through the eyes of a company onto its employees.  That has never happened.

At times we think we should change the law if it is believed what is going on is not acceptable.  If, like me, someone has a strong social conscience, he or she might be concerned that this is State money going into RT&Eacute; or these agencies, but the point I am making is that what they are doing is fully legal.  What many of the multinational companies do is also legal.  We have heard this morning about overpayments and that we have to get value for money, but the head of Revenue is telling us that a presenter in RT&Eacute; whose only client is RT&Eacute; can set up a company to be paid on his or her own behalf in order to plan his or her income and that it is perfectly legal to do so.  We have to be clear - that is the reality under the tax code.  Perhaps there are other ways in which we might progress and we should change many of these things.  That is a point worth making.  Our job is to highlight where the State is not receiving value for money and go through Votes forensically, at which we have been doing a great job.  Sometimes, however, there are laws which have to be changed and there are great arguments for so doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#H00900","speaker":"1369","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>We always expected that we would have to come back to the university sector and there is now far more reason to do so.  There is a new independent report which I believe was carried out by Crowe Howarth, at which we need to look.  We need to include the issue in the work programme.  I had intended to address some of the issues raised by the whistleblowers about the Thorn report and with which they were not happy.  It would be kind to the Higher Education Authority to state it was less than impressive when its representatives were before the committee.  The very fact that we are still waiting for some significant responses is very disappointing.  I hope to see that issue included in the work programme soon.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Peter Burke's point, I do not disagree that some of the things being done are fully legal, but they are only fully legal for a certain portion of the population.  It is very useful for us to understand what is going on in what could be described as bogus self-employment.  If everybody were to do that, we would not be here because there would be no money to run services.  We need to understand this.  I see absolutely no reason we would not look at the issue in the same way as we try to look at the issue of corporation tax, that is, by looking at one particular organisation, in this case the national broadcaster, in order to gain an understanding.  The issue is not unique to one sector.

We ahad a very extensive discussion about recognising the independence of RT&Eacute;.  It is the national broadcaster and none of us wants to ask questions about the type of programmes it produces and why.  That is entirely a matter for it.  There is, however, merit in the committee looking at these issues - there are two separate issues - because there are potential implications for Revenue. The first is that of bogus self-employment.  This is where casual work and short-term contracts are being offered to workers when permanent contracts were once in place.  That is becoming more of the norm than the exception in RT&Eacute;.  The concern is being expressed by staff within the company.  It is a separate issue from the other point about whether persons on high salaries are setting up companies.  I have made the point that this is a perfectly legal structure, but the point has also been made that persons on a salary of &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 a year are not in a position to set up such companies.  They are for those on big salaries.  Whether they are hospital consultants or presenters in RT&Eacute; on six-figure salaries, the reality is that it is happening and legal, but there is a cost to the Exchequer.  We cannot assume that because something happened in one area it happened in another, but we did see in the case of hospital consultants all sorts of expenses being claimed which potentially should not have been claimed and further reduced their tax liabilities.  We have a responsibility on behalf of taxpayers to probe this area to ensure there is value for money if we are the ones who are signing off on it.  <\/p> <p>  There are many other related issues.

The Dormant Accounts Fund is managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which collects the dormant balances from the institutions.  The holders or beneficiaries of accounts that have been declared dormant have the right subsequently to reclaim their money at any time and the NTMA repays funds as required from reserves.  Responsibility for disbursements from the fund transferred to the Minister for Rural and Community Development in July 2017 from the then Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Prior to June 2016, responsibility for the disbursement system was with the then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. <\/p> <p>  Figure 1 in the report document shows the movements in the Dormant Accounts Fund since it commenced operations in 2003.  There was an initial transfer into the fund of &euro;172 million.  Net transfers to the fund were an average of almost &euro;26 million a year between 2004 and 2016.  What is perhaps most striking is the trend increase in the fund&rsquo;s net assets position, which increased from &euro;132 million at the end of 2010 to &euro;259 million at the end of 2016.  Net assets include an amount set aside in a reserve fund to meet potential future claims for repayment of balances in dormant accounts; the provision was just over &euro;76 million at the end of 2016.  Figure 1 shows the increase that has occurred since 2010 in the net assets figure.<\/p> <p>  Amendments made to the dormant accounts legislation in 2012 require the relevant Minister to set up a disbursement scheme for a period of up to three years.  The scheme must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  A disbursement scheme covering the period December 2013 to November 2016 was approved by Government in December 2013.  The scheme set out guiding principles and the priority areas for disbursements.  A statutory review of the disbursement scheme was due within three years of the scheme being adopted, that is, by December 2016.  This review had not been carried out at the time of the examination.  Also under the Acts, annual action plans for the disbursement of funds must be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas indicating the spending Departments, the proposed recipients of grant funding, the programmes or projects to be supported and the proposed amounts of funding.  While action plans were presented for 2014 and 2016, no plan was presented for 2015. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure of funding allocated to Dormant Accounts Fund measures may be made over one or more years.  Planned expenditure for a given year is provided for in the relevant Department's annual Estimates.  The examination found that implementing Departments significantly underspent on programmes relative to what was planned.  In total, they incurred dormant accounts programme expenditure of just under &euro;29 million for the period 2012 to 2016.  This represented only 44% of the total amount made available for spending in the relevant estimates for the same period.  The level of underspend for all implementing Departments ranged from 5% to 94%, as shown in Figure 2 in the report document.  In Figure 2, for each of the implementing Departments there are two bars.  The lighter coloured one is the amount provided in the Estimate and the darker one is the amount that was actually spent.  It also indicates the percentage of total funding made available but not spent.<\/p> <p>  A lack of preparedness appears to have been the main factor causing the underspending.  Delays in implementing projects and delays in having a disbursement scheme or action plan in place were cited by Departments as the main reasons for this.  A low level of uptake for some schemes was another cause cited for the underspend.  The report provides further detail on the pattern of underspending on a Department-by-Department basis. <\/p> <p>  Pobal manages certain Dormant Accounts Fund measures on behalf of some Departments.<\/p><p>In the period from 2012 to 2016 Pobal administered 29 measures, disbursing a total of &euro;10.2 million.  It received fees of &euro;2.55 million in the same period for providing this service, the cost of which was met from the fund under the terms of the legislation.  The fee expense was equivalent to 27% of the amount disbursed.  The National Treasury Management Agency and Departments administering their own measures bear the administration costs in their own budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I am joined by my colleagues from the Department, Mr. Fergal Costello, principal officer, finance unit; Mr. Kenneth Jordan, principal officer; and Mr. Eddie Forsyth, assistant principal officer, rural strategy division.  Also in attendance are Ms Deirdre Kearney, community and voluntary supports division, and Mr. William Hughes, finance unit.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, the Department of Rural and Community Development was established in July 2017.  Statutory responsibility for the Dormant Accounts Fund was transferred to the Minister for Rural and Community Development at the time.  The legislation governing the Dormant Accounts Fund provides a framework for the disbursement of funds for measures targeted at socially, economically and educationally disadvantaged persons and people with a disability.  Under the Dormant Accounts Act 2012 and following the transfer of functions, the Minister for Rural and Community Development is responsible for the administration of the processes by which the Government approves programmes and projects to which funding may be disbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  In real terms, this involves the development of three-year disbursement schemes and the subsequent preparation of annual action plans to give effect to the disbursement scheme.<\/p> <p>  Under the 2012 Act, the Minister is required to make a disbursement scheme for a period not exceeding three years.  The disbursement scheme sets out guiding principles for disbursements and specifies priority areas under the aforementioned headings of economic and social disadvantage, educational disadvantage and persons with a disability.  The 2012 Act also provides that the Minister shall prepare an action plan at least once a year to give effect to the disbursement scheme.  Actions plans contain details of programmes and projects to be funded under the scheme and set out the maximum amount proposed for disbursement to each programme or project set out in the action plan.  There is also a further requirement in the 2012 Act that the Minister shall prepare an annual report on the disbursement of moneys from the Dormant Accounts Fund.<\/p> <p>  Since its inception in 2001, the fund has seen a number of transfers of responsibility.  Most recently, in 2012 the Dormant Accounts Board was dissolved and its statutory functions were transferred to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In 2016 these functions transferred again to the then Minster for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  As I noted, the functions transferred to the Minister for Rural and Community Development in July 2017.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is, therefore, now responsible for co-ordinating the preparation and administration of the disbursement scheme and the annual action plans across government.  In undertaking these functions the Department fully recognises the importance of the Dormant Accounts Fund to the provision of programmes and projects aimed at disadvantaged groups.  For example, the 2017 action plan commits funding to support youth and community projects through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and to invest in community sport and physical activity hubs through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We want to ensure disbursement schemes and action plans are progressed in an efficient and effective manner and that we maximise the positive social impact of the fund.<\/p> <p>  With direct regard to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, it raises a number of issues relating to the operation of the scheme, including levels of disbursement and compliance with statutory requirements.  It recommends that the statutory review of the 2013 disbursement scheme be carried out to identify how well the scheme was implemented and how future disbursement schemes can be designed to ensure the objectives set out for the fund are met.  The report states the review should consider the reasons for the low level of disbursements; whether allocating funds to measures which do not fully use the resources prevent other programmes from being funded; and how the available funding can best be applied.  The response of the Department of Rural and Community Development provided in September 2017 states the Department is committed to reviewing all aspects of the administration of the dormant accounts disbursement scheme as part of its forthcoming work programme and that the review will consider the issues detailed in the report.<\/p> <p>  Based on the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, it is clear that the scheme is not operating in a manner which maximises the impact of the fund for those groups at which the funding is targeted.  We are fully committed to completing the planned review in 2018.  The review which is commencing will analyse the issues raised in the report, identify the administrative and other changes necessary to ensure more efficient and effective operation of the scheme and make proposals for how the changes will be implemented on completion of the review.  We have provided a copy of the draft terms of reference in the briefing material circulated to members.  <\/p> <p>  I look forward to assisting the committee in its detailed examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

Again, there is no reference to figures or money, although I note there is a reference to money towards the end of page 5 when a figure of &euro;40 million is mentioned.

There is an issue about the alignment of dormant accounts allocations with the annual Estimates.  They are not the same.  Getting a commitment for an amount under the dormant accounts heading does not mean one gets the money in a particular year's allocation.  It does not involve an implication or an expectation that all the money will be spent in that year.  For example, we got a commitment in December 2014 for Garda youth diversion projects, and clearly it would have been impossible to spend any of that money in December 2014.  We work in partnership with non-governmental organisations, NGOs, which means we have a choice between expanding existing services, giving additional funding to NGOs with which we are already partnered and, alternatively, going out and inviting expressions of interest.  Whatever we choose to do, we have a duty to assess applications properly and make sure we are getting value for money.

Last night, I took a phone call from an organisation in Connemara, Teagmh&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g, which has just received a letter from the local ETB - I keep calling it the VEC - to tell it that it is going to close.  This is a special centre for children who drop out of school and it has been told it is going to close.  I am looking at massive amounts of funds here.  I just heard about  it last night and I am going to get more details on it.  Last year, all the politicians in Galway were called to a meeting because the youth federation, or an organisation like that, was about to close due to a lack of money.  Two weeks ago, we got a call about an essential service where access takes place in time.  It is about to close at the end of March.  Various social enterprise ideas are coming forward.  One example involves repairing bicycles.  It cannot get a leg in to get help.  That is just the background.  I have mentioned a minute sample.  Comhlachas na gComharchumainn, which represents all the co-operatives in the Gaeltachts and islands throughout Ireland, has made presentations to all of us.  It is struggling to exist.  There is something seriously wrong here.  I do not wish to blame Mr. McCarthy individually.  Is there any feedback?  Is there any mechanism?  We will take the co-operative movement.  Has the Department engaged with Comhlachas na gComharchumainn?

It gives a whole new meaning to \"dormant\".  At least some people can get money out of that account even if they come back but this seems to be more dormant than the dormant account the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, manages.  We will be doing a periodic report.  I do not think this system works.  I do not think it needs a review.  There has been &euro;25 million sitting there for years with nothing happening, with organisations crying out for it which serve the most deserving groups of people in society with regard to people with economic and social disadvantage, educational disadvantage and persons with disabilities.  That &euro;25 million has been sitting there for nine years and the witnesses do not even know its position.  That is woeful.<\/p> <p>  One of the problems, though not caused by the witnesses since they are the people administering it, is that the chart from the Comptroller and Auditor General indicates that there are schemes being administered by ten different Departments.  That is on page 105, chart 7.3 in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government had a major underspend, as did the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Health, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs which spent only 6% of what was approved, the Department of Education and Skills which spent 25%, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection which spent half of it, and the Prison Service which spent only a fraction of it.  It is no wonder that this system does not work when it is spread across ten different Departments.  There is a fund managed by the NTMA and it is a good idea to have it.  The witnesses make a provision to have some money to go back.  They engaged Pobal to administer it, having come up with the policy, and then there are different schemes across ten different Departments.  How could anybody know where to go for this money?  It is no wonder it is lost in the system.<\/p> <p>  I have to contrast this.  How much has the Department of Rural and Community Development paid out over the years?  Some &euro;275 million.  We have to look at this with regard to value for money and good public administration.  We all look at what we call the sports capital programme.  It hands out that type of money every time there is a round.  The applicants know what to do.  It is well publicised.  They get their forms in.  The level of detail they have to get in is extraordinary.  There is a sunset clause and the Department, without having to go to Pobal or ten other Departments, is able to administer it, make sure it functions properly, get the documentation in after approval is given and pay for the works when they are done, subject to audit, verification and so on.  That system works well.  This system is not working at all.  The Department would be better off asking the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport if it would second half a dozen staff to the Department of Rural and Community Development, and getting rid of Pobal and the ten different Departments.  It is not just a question of the three people.  They are probably busy drawing up schemes and policy statements for ten different Departments, and ten Departments are drawing up schemes to implement it.  It is the worst level of duplication across Departments that I have encountered in my time as Chairman here.  None of it is the witnesses' fault.  They inherited this last year.  I would be of a mind, when we are issuing our interim report, to state that the system as it operates has to be called to a halt.  It is not transparent.  It is all over the place.  Nobody can follow it.  The Department even has trouble following it.  There is money as much as nine years old with no sunset clause.  We all have sight of one Department or another which would administer a scheme of this scale and nature with its hand tied.<\/p> <p>  Maybe people will utterly disagree with me but I am amazed at how poorly this system operates.  I have no confidence that it will be any better next year.  This matter of calling it a timing difference and aligning funding coming from the Dormant Account Fund versus the annual Estimates is, as just mentioned, something done by the Department I just mentioned.  It gets an Estimate for a programme and we know it will be a couple of years before some of the funding will be drawn down for the sports capital programme.  There is a prototype in the public service of how to administer a fund like this.  One of our jobs is, when we find something working well, to try to replicate it in other areas which do similar work in a very cumbersome manner.  This is designed to be cumbersome.  It involves ten different Departments and ten different types of scheme and there is probably a variety of different schemes within those Departments.  It would be impossible for people to deal with.  Without going into further detail, I think the witnesses understand our frustration.  Deputy Burke started on the matter and other people have spoken on it.  I do not think this system is working well and the public service is capable of getting a far more streamlined and effective service to deliver the money.  When we are back in our constituency clinics tomorrow, we will all have people from groups suffering from economic and social disadvantage, educational disadvantage, and persons with disability, coming to us to seek funds.  If we tell them that there is &euro;25 million which has not been spent for those years, they will give out to us and ask if we are not doing our job.  Our job is to highlight when we see that a system is broken.  It is almost irredeemable in its current format.  I stress that it is not an issue for the NTMA side of the house.

I think that goes to the heart of the matter.  This is not designed for the kind of uptake and profile of how things happen at community level.  My understanding is that it is so cumbersome to apply for that there are people and organisations that looked at it and simply dismissed it.  These are not organisations that do not need money or where &euro;1 million would not make a difference.  There could be 25 such organisations around the country if that was the case.  How many of the years we are talking about are years when the troika was here?  We were told that we were bankrupt.  People scrapped for every single shilling.  Some of those communities were among the most impacted.<\/p><p>This is not designed for the people it is supposed to benefit.  How many people from disadvantaged communities said this would work for them and this is what they needed?  I am not saying there should not be oversight and good accounting for things.  However, much of our community exists in a very informal way.  Some organisations have to exist in that kind of informal environment, yet we are looking at a very rigid system where it is difficult to access funding for worthwhile things.  Some of projects brought forward do not get the uptake because they are not what the community requires.  If they were in place and the community required them, it would use them.  It tells us something about who is designing the system for whom.<\/p><p> If there is going to be a redesign, the witnesses will have to engage the communities that are going to be the benefices of this scheme in that design.  It has to be designed in such a way that it is flexible enough for people to engage with it and not spend a lot of administrative time they do not have applying for it or drawing it down.  There is a big deficiency.  I agree with the Chairman about it not just being a review but a redesign.  I do not think Pobal can be blamed for administering a scheme it did not design.  The administration of it should be flexible enough.<\/p><p> I want to ask about a few of the schemes.  There was about &euro;500,000 of an underspend in the community-based model for people with dementia.  Has that been spent?  In respect of training and support services for homecarers, there was &euro;500,000 but up to 2016, nothing was spent.  Has that been spent?  On the Arts in Education initiative, &euro;50,000 was drawn down from &euro;280,000.  Has the rest of it been drawn down?<\/p><p> I refer to &euro;1 million allocated to establish a monitoring programme under the Department of Justice and Equality.  A value of &euro;798,000 was approved but nothing was drawn down by 2016.  Have these all been drawn down now or is there outstanding money in those particular categories?

The Government strongly supports the concerted international action needed in order to address the global challenge of climate change.  Together, with our EU colleagues, Ireland had to facilitate entry into force of the Paris Agreement of November 2016.  The goals of the Paris Agreement are very much in line with Ireland's national policy position on climate change 2014, which set out our vision to transition to a competitive low-carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.<\/p><p>Ireland also supports international efforts to assist developing countries adapt to climate change.  Irish financial support in 2016 amounted to &euro;52.7 million, an increase on &euro;36 million in 2015.  The increase is largely due to an improvement in reporting activities across Government bodies and civil society organisations.  This resulted in a more complete picture of Ireland's total climate finance contributions.  It is our intention to increase the green climate finance fund over time.<\/p><p>The Montreal Protocol entered into force in 1989.  It was designed to phase out the production and consumption of ozone depleting substances, which damage the ozone layer.  The protocol is viewed as a very successful international intervention.  Stratospheric ozone levels are recovering and are expected to reach 1980 levels towards the end of this century.<\/p><p>In the phasing out of ozone depleting substances the protocol has, unfortunately, contributed to the rapid growth of <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs, as replacement gases.  Many HFCs while not ozone depleting have a high global warming potential and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Action on HFCs is vital as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, has estimated that if no action is taken then HFCs might represent between 9% and 19% of overall greenhouse emissions by 2050.  The Kigali amendment to the UN response is the UN response to this challenge.  It includes specific targets and timetables to replace HFCs with more climate-friendly alternatives thus avoiding up to a 0.5<\/font>&deg;<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> Celsius increase in global warming. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  HFCs are already subject to a phase-down under EU Regulation No. 517 of 2014 <\/font>on fluorinated greenhouse gases<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">.  The regulation is also known as the F-gas Regulation.  The regulation will have to be revised at a later stage in order to ensure compliance with the Kigali amendment beyond 2030. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  The reduction schedule beyond 2030 is determined on the basis of a review of the EU regulation, which is to start in 2022.  The amendment includes a provision to prohibit or restrict countries that have ratified the protocol or its amendments from trading in control substances with states that have not yet ratified the protocol.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  The phase-down of HFCs, under the Kigali amendment, will operate on a schedule that gives developed countries, including the EU, earlier targets.  <\/font>For Ireland, as a developed country, the phase-down commitment begins in 2019 with a 10% reduction in the use of HFCs.  This level of phase-down should be met within the existing EU phase-down framework of EU Regulation No. 517 of 2014.  Reductions will continue on a phased basis until we have an 85% reduction by 2036.<\/p><p>The amendment also provides for assistance through a multilateral fund to developing countries to help them meet their phase-down obligations.  Such assistance is already provided to meet pre-existing obligations under the Montreal Protocol.<\/p><p>The main financial commitments, under the Kigali agreement, will commence in 2024.  There will be preparatory funding prior to that date with some additional payment obligations arising in 2021.  In light of this cost, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann must approve the ratification of the amendment.  The Government, even before the ratification of the Kigali amendment, provided fast-track funding.  The commitment was made at the back end of 2016 and the money was allocated in 2017 to start the process of implementing the Kigali amendment.  At the time the US State Department, which was led by the then Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, publicly acknowledged the leadership role played by Ireland and a handful of countries that were to the fore when implementing the amendment.<\/p><p> There is another aspect to this, which is Kigali cooling.  While the Kigali amendment itself will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on global warming by 0.5&deg; Celsius, Kigali cooling, which deals mainly with air conditioning equipment and those types of cooling elements, can provide us with an additional 0.5&deg; Celsius.<\/p><p> There is significant potential to the Kigali amendment and I hope to have this ratified in advance of my visit to Toronto next month.  I hope that my colleagues can facilitate in that regard.<\/p><p> The EU and its member states have been to the forefront in the negotiation of the Kigali amendment.  The EU has agreed to ratify it in its own right and is awaiting member states' national ratifications.  A number of member states have already ratified it.  Ratification by Ireland is a clear signal of our commitment to playing our part in tackling global climate change.  Together with the EU ratification of the Doha amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, this ratification will send another signal of our intent to take on our global responsibilities and minimise our impact on the global climate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018020800002#B00200","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518098400,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that information.

I am joined by some of my senior officials who are working on the national broadband plan.  Orla Ryan and Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in are to my left and to my right are Fergal Mulligan and Pat Neary.<\/p> <p>  I thank committee members for giving me the opportunity to address them in a discussion of the decision of Eir to withdraw from the procurement process for the national broadband plan.  This week I have contributed openly to two debates in the House on the matter as well.  Informed debate and oversight on such a project is essential.  I am pleased to speak to the committee again today to provide some assurance and certainty at a time when uncertainty has been introduced into the process.<\/p> <p>  On 30 January, Eir withdrew from the procurement process.  Eir's decision to withdraw is regrettable but it was entirely a decision for Eir to make.  Eir has reaffirmed its commitment to continue delivery of its 300,000 rural deployment of high-speed broadband connections by the end of this year.  The commitment agreement signed with me in April 2017 binds Eir to that commitment.<\/p> <p>  Some media and other commentary in respect of the Eir 300,000 deployment is misinformed.  State aid rules would not allow me to invest taxpayers' money in areas where commercial companies have high-speed broadband infrastructure or are building this infrastructure.  From a state aid rules perspective, the Eir 300,000 network must be treated in a manner similar to other high-speed broadband infrastructure in place at the outset of the procurement process.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make it clear that this commitment agreement was not a decision by Government as it was a private decision for Eir to decide where to invest.  However, the procurement process and state aid rules allow for a commitment agreement to bind a commercial company to its private plans.<\/p> <p>  While state aid guidelines envisage clear milestones being set out in commercial plans, the commitment agreement considerably exceeds those guidelines as it includes not only milestones for delivery but robust monitoring and enforcement provisions as well.  In fact, the Commission has been impressed by the extent of this agreement and believes it is a template for other countries to follow.<\/p> <p>  I hope it is clear from my statement to the House last night that it is not the case that the commitment agreement in some way determined where Eir's high-speed broadband infrastructure was to be built.  It was always a matter for commercial companies.  The commitment agreement provides strong assurance that planned infrastructure would be built.  The commitment agreement set out clearly the quarterly milestones to be achieved.<\/p> <p>  Another narrative that has emerged is that the procurement process is overly-onerous and complex.  Of course this is an onerous and complex process as we will be spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money to deliver a future-proofed high-speed broadband network.<\/p> <p>  I have endeavoured to ensure maximum openness and transparency for Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, our national Parliament and the public in respect of the national broadband plan procurement process while respecting the need to protect the integrity of the process itself.<\/p> <p>  As committee members are aware, I have held three special information sessions for Deputies and Senators in respect of the NBP on three occasions in the past ten months, including an information session to provide an update following the withdrawal of Eir from the procurement process.  This week I have supplied each Deputy and Senator with a copy of the letter I received from Richard Moat informing me of this decision.  I also supplied a copy of my response.  Yesterday evening, ahead of a statement to the House I circulated an updated comprehensive briefing document.<\/p> <p>  While I cannot and should not be involved in the day-to-day detail of the procurement process, I have been briefed at major milestones by the NBP procurement team.  Additionally, at every important stage or point of decision the NBP procurement team could not proceed without my approval or Government approval.<\/p> <p>  In July 2015, the Government approved the publication of the draft intervention strategy.  In December 2015, the Government approved the revised intervention strategy following public consultation and analysis of industry investment proposals.  At that time, the Government also approved commencement of the procurement process.  In July 2016, the Government approved adoption of a commercial stimulus ownership model.  In April 2017, the Government noted my intention to sign a commitment agreement with Eir on the 300,000 deployment and to finalise the map for the intervention area for the remainder of the procurement process.  Finally, last December, the Government approved my intention to bring forward heads of a Bill to provide certainty with regard to conditions of access to existing infrastructure for the national broadband plan and noted my update on the procurement process.<\/p> <p>  These decision points included detailed rationale, risk analysis and background updates.  Government decisions were made on an informed basis.  In this way, strong State oversight of the project was maintained.  The remaining bidder, enet-SSE, has already identified its final issues for discussion with the procurement team.  The list was submitted some weeks ago while competition remained in the process.  I am confident the solutions identified will provide a future-proofed network that will deliver new technologies and speeds as they arise with the best possible value for the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>  The NBP procurement team are still in dialogue with enet-SSE.  They are confident that the process can continue to move through the final stages and deliver a solution for rural Ireland in a prompt and effective manner.  There is no sense in stopping the clock now.  We are all agreed on the policy and the initiative.  I welcome the opportunity to work together in the final push to deliver for our communities and rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#B00300","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":666,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.   I will bring in several members of the committee together.  People may wish to bank some of the questions.  I will start with my questions.<\/p> <p>  What guarantee is there, Minister, that the remaining consortium, enet-SSE, will not at some stage withdraw from the process?  Can you comment on that?  What guarantee can you give, Minister, that the contract price will be fair and reasonable now that only one consortium remains?  Previously, you allowed Eir to roll out high-speed broadband to an additional 300,000 homes at their own expense.  Those households are widely regarded to be the easiest to connect to the network, with the remaining 540,000 being the most difficult.

I do not see any merit in putting a roadblock in the way of this process at this late stage.  I accept there is sufficient oversight and that each milestone has to be approved by the Department officials, the Minister and the Government on the recommendation of the project team.  The concern of the members of the public is when they will get broadband.  They hear about review groups or committees within committees.  We are very familiar in this House with the multitude of groups, committees and taskforces, which are effectively talk shops galore.  On this hugely significant venture it is essential that we have decisions, action, an implementation of the policy and that we get on with the job.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions.  Regarding the process, it happens in business every other day that people put in quotations as part of a bidding process and, for whatever reason, they feel free to withdraw.  That is the way business works.  Obviously, the decision by Eir to withdraw was a calculated business decision.  That is for it to make.  Regarding the remaining contender, I get the sense that we are within roughly six months of decisions being made.  Can the Minister clarify the timescale involved in the decision making process he has in place?  In that process, are we near the stage where we will get into exclusive negotiations with one bidder?  I presume, in a process like this, that a time will come when the Minister will indicate a preferred bidder and progress the process from that point.  In this instance, we are left with one remaining bidder.  Has the pricing structure been agreed already with that remaining bidder?  What the Joe Soap on the street wants to know is if there is one bidder remaining and if the pricing structure is not agreed, is it not the case that they can charge what they want?  I would like to know where we are in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#C00200","speaker":"1240"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":669,"content":"<p>To clarify, I believe members were circulated with a note in advance.

Nobody here needs to be reminded that for many people it is of extraordinary seriousness.<\/p> <p>  There are three fundamental questions about which people are concerned.

Those are the fundamental questions, and everything else is a subset of those questions.  I ask those three questions of the Minister but also by what process is he confident that SSE-enet are tied into a pricing structure?  They have stated a pricing structure, and I sincerely hope it is correct.  The Minister says they will be tied in because of what they put in at procurement stage and that that must hold.  How does he propose to secure that?  How does he propose to ensure that SSE-enet maintain their social mandate and go out immediately to the less commercially profitable areas?  Will we have a control over that process?  Will the Minister go through his projected timeframe again because that is the one aspect people want to know about, as well as the running cost?  If we were to have a hierarchy of concern the first concern is that people get broadband.  Will the Minister deal again with the timeframe?

They relate to the value for money question the Chairman asked and the questions from Deputy Lowry and Senator O'Reilly on the pricing structure and so on.<\/p> <p>  On the question as to whether enet will withdraw from the process, I have spoken with one of the key investors in this, David McCourt, who I believe is from Deputy Dooley's part of the country.  He is the chair of enet.  He is also the chief executive of Granahan McCourt, which is a major capital investor in this area.  Both SSE and enet believe that, for them, this particular project is very much a role model project so they can secure similar types of project across Europe and the globe.  As members know, the Scottish Government has announced it will replicate what we are doing here in terms of bringing high-speed broadband to the islands and highlands.  The state of New York is looking at doing something similar to what we are doing here.<\/p><p>The German programme for government, agreed yesterday, is also looking at bringing high-speed broadband to rural communities.  The company feels it has an opportunity there as well.  It is committed not just to bringing in high-speed broadband but to use it as a test bed to deliver high-speed broadband to other parts of the world.<\/p><p> I was in Limerick yesterday where we opened a new facility for a company called 4site, which has increased the number of people it employs by 20.  It has been working with SIRO for the past number of years on its fibre build-out.  It has developed a map of the infrastructure build-out for fibre networks in the towns around Ireland.  It has secured a major contract in the UK and is in negotiations to secure other contracts in the United States.  4site has done this and enet-SSC intends to do it on a bigger scale.  The decision of Eir to pull out - regardless of whether it was associated with the build of 300,000 - is a commercial decision for the company.  Eir is the only body that can comment in that regard.  There has been speculation but I have given members the letter I received from the company, as well as my response.<\/p><p> Senator O'Reilly asked if people will get broadband.  Yes, they will.  Every single home, farm and business will get access to high-speed broadband.  There is unanimity across the House, as well as in this committee, on the need to do this regardless of who is in Government.  The question is when people will get broadband.  When this Government was formed, five out of ten premises in Ireland had access to high-speed broadband.  Today, it is seven out of ten and by the end of the year it will be eight out of ten.  By 2020 it will be at least nine out of ten and it may be higher.  Soon after that, I expect we will complete the work.<\/p><p> Based on the Eir build we are expecting a build-out of 40,000 premises in this quarter.  I expect that the consortium, once it has got up and running and addressed some of the teething difficulties, will get up to a similar momentum quite quickly, taking approximately three years.  In Cavan, Monaghan, Roscommon and Clare there are some very isolated locations that may take a bit longer to deliver but we expect the vast bulk of the country to be covered in the three-year build-out.<\/p><p> I was asked how we maintained the social mandate to get broadband to rural areas quickly.  This is about bringing high-speed broadband to 542,000 homes, the last homes to get it and the most isolated homes in Ireland.  There is a State subsidy to make sure it happens.  The build-out will be defined in two ways.  One way is based on the commercial plan of the company itself, which has stated that it is easier to build from a location outwards.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is also engaging with local authorities across the country and with regional action groups.  I am determined that this will happen in every county together.

Has the remaining bidder provided a technical solution and a price to roll out high-speed broadband to 542,000 homes across the State?  On 30 January, Eir pulled out of the process.  I think this is a game-changer, following the decision of Vodafone and ESB to pull out last September.  Mr. Richard Moat, the chief executive of Eir, wrote to the Minister and the Minister has provided an awful lot of information to the committee in the past number of days.  Despite the fact that there is a lot of information, however, we do not have many answers.  In the second paragraph of his letter, Mr. Moat said the decision to exit the NBP process was driven by a range of commercial, regulatory and governance issues that had been repeatedly highlighted over the past 18 months and that this had been consistently noted in discussions on 30 August 2017 and in his correspondence of 17 July 2017.<\/p><p>Is the Minister prepared to publish the notes of the meeting of 30 August 2017 and correspondence between himself and Eir on 17 July?  This would be helpful for us in understanding more clearly the decisions of Eir.<\/p><p> In the past 18 months, I have repeatedly asked the Minister to publish a timeline, a notional date, Gantt chart or project time to which he is working that sets out the best estimate for signing the contract?  Following from that, will he indicate when the work to roll out the infrastructure will begin and when all 542,000 homes will have broadband?  While I accept that delays will occur from time to time, thus far, we have had 19 months of delays in the process.  The Minister regularly informs me that it is better to get this right than stick to a specific deadline.  Now that I and others are seeking to assist him at this juncture, he has suddenly expressed deep concern about the potential for delays.  Against what notional timeline is he measuring these delays because he has not yet published anything about it?<\/p><p> On the issue of whether he has confidence in the process, at a press conference after the withdrawal of Eir from the process, the Minister stated, when pressed by a journalist on the potential for the process to fail, that there was contingency planning and a plan B in place.  It would be helpful if he were to publish this plan B.  Does he accept that the purpose of the intervention of Opposition parties is to achieve the same result as the Minister seeks to achieve, namely, the roll-out of high-speed broadband to 542,000 homes?  He must also have doubts as otherwise he would not have a plan B.  The Minister and I share the same doubts.  I want to call time on the process if there is a fatal flaw that will lead to its collapse.  If so, it would be better if we identified now rather than trundling headlong into a roadblock in 12, 18 or 24 months' time and being forced to revert to plan B.<\/p><p> I do not want to get into a discussion about Enet but I will raise a couple of points with the Minister.  Rather than refusing to answer questions on this matter, the Minister stated the company is well funded and capitalised, has significant experience and is rolling out broadband to beat the band up and down the highways and by-ways of the United States.  On other occasions, he juxtaposed these claims with a comment Enet needs this project as a test bed and means of improving its credentials to win contracts all over the world.  This somehow indicates that he has the company over a barrel because it needs the project more than he does.  What is the position?  Does Enet have considerable experience which it can bring to the table or does the company view this project as a test bed and some kind of loss leader which will allow it to develop its credentials and move to the next stage?  As I stated, it would be helpful if the Minister could answer some or all of those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#D02100","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I will ask the Minister to respond after Deputy Stanley makes his contribution.

While I agree with him to some extent, sometimes when one is on a journey, it does no harm to check the map to ensure one does not wind up in the wrong destination or in a cul-de-sac.  This is the scenario we must avoid.<\/p> <p>  The nearest the Minister has come to outlining a timeline was his statement that he expected the project to take approximately three years.  In 2016 and 2017, the Minister outlined dates by which he hoped to have the procurement process completed.  The 542,000 households and premises in the State, including 25,000 in Laois-Offaly, which do not have access to broadband are anxious to know when the procurement process will conclude.  The Minister has 80 officials and experts working with him.  He must have a date in his mind.  Surely Members of the Oireachtas, who have been elected to represent their constituents and parties, are entitled to know when the Minister believes the procurement process will be completed.  At that point, will it take three years to bring the project to completion or, as the Minister stated, to bring broadband to almost every house?<\/p> <p>  While I do not wish to discuss in detail the history of the process, the Minister and I both know that Enet did not have the necessary firepower.  According to the information available to me, the company has only secured significant financial backers in the past year and is relatively small.  I do not want to detract from Enet which is probably an excellent company and I wish it well, nor am I having a go at the Minister.  I have thought about this issue in private moments.  When buying or selling I have never bargained with anybody where only one option was available, especially if the other party believed he held all the cards.  I have never been able to adopt that position.  If the Department can do so in this case, well and good.  Does the Minister have a plan B in the event that Enet withdraws from the process at this point?  If so, will he outline it briefly?<\/p> <p>  On State involvement, which some of the bidders strongly favoured at one stage, we already have the metropolitan area networks and what is known as backhaul fibre.  The map I have with me shows an extensive network of fibre that was installed across the country, some of it under public private partnerships.  It runs in straight lines to Bantry, Galway and radiates throughout the State similar to the spokes of a wheel.  We also have an extensive ESB network with electricity poles in every laneway.  As a former employee of the ESB, my view is that the company's decision to pull out of the game impaired the process.  The metropolitan area networks are in place in 91 towns throughout the State.  The ESB network, the backhaul network and the metropolitan areas network together amount to an extensive infrastructure network in which the State invested heavily.  Does this not lend itself to having the State control the main infrastructure?<\/p> <p>  I asked the Minister a question last night in the D&aacute;il Chamber but the procedure for questions in the House does not lend itself to an exchange of views.

This impairs the rest of the process and I contend that it was not necessary to allow them to do this.

During my discussion with Mr. Moat on 30 August, he provided me with an update on the Eir build-out to the 300,000 premises and I can provide the Deputy with a copy of that presentation.  Two others issues came up at that meeting.  Mr. Moat raised the issue of the ComReg pricing structure for fibre-to-the-cabinet.  He pointed out to me that if this pricing structure remained in place, it would jeopardise future investment that would take place in the country because companies, including Eir, but not exclusive to Eir, would not get the opportunity to get a return on the investment they put in.  I  pointed out to Mr. Moat that this was a regulatory matter, that it was an issue for ComReg and, as I have said before, the appropriate mechanism to deal with that is through the committee because ComReg is answerable to the committee and not answerable to me.  The other issue I raised with Richard Moat was one raised in the House in the past few days, namely, the gap in the build-out in respect of the 300,000 premises.  Deputy Sean Sherlock mentioned a location where the fibre was very close to some houses with 12 poles on one side and 12 poles on the other side and asked whether those houses would be part of the final 542,000 premises.  The answer is they will.  During the discussion I had with Richard Moat on 30 August, I raised a number of issues and gave the example of my own primary school, Ardkeenan national school just outside Athlone in County Roscommon, where the Eir fibre roll-out turned at the cross roads about 1 km from the school.  I pointed out that there were a number of community buildings and clusters of homes in the vicinity.  At another location in Kiltoom, with the exception of five houses, every house along the road was left out.  I made the point that Eir should review this process, particularly where it had not already built out and had only started the build-out at that stage.  He agreed that would make sense and that it would make sense at the design stage to try to deal with those issues.  I gave a commitment to him, with his agreement, that I would ask the broadband officers across the country to identify these particular anomalies, compile a list and submit them to his office.  He agreed that he would ask his team to have a look at that list.  This information was submitted towards the end of last year - I am not sure of the date - but Eir is working on that issue at present.  Let me double check the figures in this regard.  Eir has passed 121,000 of the 300,000 to which it committed, but it has also passed another 11,000 homes that were not part of that number.  These are the types of anomalies that had been raised.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Dooley raised the letter of 17 July, and subject to any redaction needed, I am happy to have that letter released.<\/p> <p>  Both Deputies Dooley and Stanley asked for my best estimate on timing.  The reason I have been very hesitant about putting dates out in the public arena is that everyone present has been embarrassed and frustrated by company press releases promising they would bring broadband to A, B, and C by a certain date but not mentioning the year.  We are still waiting in some of those locations for the broadband.  I did not want a situation where members of the public would be told they would get broadband by one date only then to be given a different date, thereby making a joke out of the system.  It is a complex procurement process. <\/p> <p>  The timeline we were looking at, up to 30 January, was that we expected to have the preferred bidder by September and that I would be in a position to go to the Cabinet in that month and name the preferred bidder in that process.  As for whether we can truncate that, I think we can truncate it a little and it is my intention to try to ensure we can.  There would be a time lag from naming the bidder to actual construction because the preferred bidder would have to negotiate with the banks.  I know the European Investment Bank, whose representative I met in Dublin within the past fortnight, is anxious to engage and has been engaging with both Eir and enet-SSE.  Some other investors are looking at bankrolling this project as well and they can now engage at a much earlier stage.  That is the reason I have made the point that it will mean shovels on the ground more quickly because we can definitely truncate the second part of the process.

If I miss one please let me know.  Several questions have been asked about plan B.  In all procurement processes, particularly where there are services to be rolled out over a prolonged period, all viable options for delivery are considered.  The current procurement process for the roll-out of the national broadband plan, NBP, in the State intervention area has been a very robust process with strong risk management throughout, with all scenarios and eventualities having been considered.  The process is entering its final stages, with the remaining bidding consortium having reaffirmed its commitment to a successful conclusion of that process.  It would be imprudent to pre-empt the outcome of the current discussions and potentially prejudice it by publicly deliberating on other options for alternative delivery mechanisms at this time.  That was a note given to me on that subject for obvious reasons.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Dooley asked me whether enet has the experience.  As I have said consistently throughout this process, what we are doing to bring high-speed broadband to isolated rural communities has never been done anywhere in the world.  Vint Cerf, one of the founders of the internet came to this city last July and said we were the global leaders in this respect and that were we to succeed, we would be setting the global benchmark for delivering high-speed broadband in rural areas.  Since we have started this process, the state of New York in the United States of America, has decided to go down a similar road.  Recently, the Scottish Parliament and Government decided to do the same and yesterday there was public coverage of the German Government's decision to go down this road.  That is why this is a test bed.  We are the first to do it.  I gave the example of 4site, which has used the challenges it faced with SIRO in building out the fibre network.  No one else has built out a fibre network to the home.  We are the first to do this on a large scale.  It has been done in some cities, in patches of areas.  That is why 4site is expanding and winning contracts on a global scale and that is why enet believes there is a huge opportunity here.  It has experience.  SSE owns 15,000 km of fibre and manages 16 data centres in the United Kingdom.  Granahan McCourt is involved in several electricity companies and has used electricity infrastructure to provide fibre in certain parts of the United States as well.  Enet manages much of the publicly-owned fibre in this country.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to Deputy Stanley's question about the backhaul map because this is something about which I know an awful lot.  I was very much involved in having that map developed in the first place.  There had been a bizarre situation in this country whereby the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is at the time, the metropolitan area networks, MANs, and the Irish Rail network each had fibre networks, independently controlled by semi-State companies, but all ultimately owned by the taxpayer.  I have definitely been raising this issue for at least 15 years on the floor of the House if not longer - including during Deputy Eamon Ryan's time in the Department - and have been stating that we should bring all those State-owned fibre networks under the control of one semi-State agency.  It did not happen.  Enet has done that, except for the ESB network.  It is my intention to have an overall holding company to have all that fibre and to manage the day-to-day running of the NBP once the contracts are signed.  Legislation is promised in this area.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanley spoke about an auction.  It is not an auction.  It is a competitive dialogue procurement process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#G00300","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":739,"content":"<p>I understand that of course it cannot be an auction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#G00400","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":740,"content":"<p>The Deputy does not.

David McCourt has said publicly in interviews that enet cannot revisit what has been agreed.  I will ask the officials to come back with the detail of that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanley is right that minimum speeds have been a concern for me.  There are people in this city, quite close to where we sit, who have very poor or no broadband.  There are pockets like this throughout the country.  My commitment is to bring high-speed broadband to every single home and premises across Ireland, not just rural but urban as well.  We feel the most effective way to deal with that is to have a universal service obligation so that the incumbent, or whoever is providing the network, would be legally obliged if there are one or two homes or premises that do not have access to it, to ensure they are provided with it.  Over the past 12 months, the team and I have been negotiating in Brussels a provision to allow each member state to introduce a universal service obligation for a minimum standard on high-speed broadband.  That was agreed in December.  Initially, that will probably be at 30 Mbps, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.  Quite quickly, that will increase to 100 Mbps and as demand changes it will go up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#G00700","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":743,"content":"<p>What about the companies and the services that are already there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#G00800","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":744,"content":"<p>That will oblige existing operators to improve their offering to meet that minimum standard as and when it is required.

That is not the case.  I distinctly remember Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on numerous occasions tabled oral and written parliamentary questions on this.  The Irish Farmers Association had publicly endorsed Eir in this regard in advance of its formal approach to me on it and I made it crystal clear to Eir that I was not prepared to alter the map on a promise.  I needed a detailed commitment agreement because we had all got promises from Eir and Eircom in the past about fibre-to-the-cabinet that did not happen and if we were going to alter the map, I said I needed a binding commitment on that and that is how the commitment agreement came about.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#G00900","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":745,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Lawless and then I will call Deputy Ryan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#H00100","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I will group a number of questions together but I hope to get answers to each one.

I recently spoke about some of my constituents in Kildare North, which is on the Dublin border and is 30 km from Leinster House, who cannot get it.  The western parts of Dublin cannot get it, never mind the west coast of Ireland.  Therefore, what is the best-case scenario?  I mean if everything goes smoothly, everyone is singing and dancing, everything is up to scratch and we hit the ground running in a way that, as the Minister said himself, is even better than had Eir not pulled out, that is, if we hit the ground with the shovels in hand.

The Minister might revert on the first question.  My third question relates to who owns the infrastructure.  Is it retail or wholesale?  Let us say it is enet, which it appears to be, barring some uncertain and unknown development.  If it is enet, good luck to it.  On the infrastructure that is built out and the kit provided to the homes in the intervention areas, will enet be the only option for broadband in those areas or will there be a wholesale package that Vodafone, Imagine or Eir could plug into to sell it on to the customer?<\/p><p>I also mentioned my fourth question in the House the other day.  We are all examining the possibility of having fibre to the home and realise that it is the gold standard, as it delivers up to 1,000 Mbps.  Is there now an argument for a phased approach?  Have technologies such as fixed wireless been considered at any point?  We can already get 70 Mbps with fixed wireless already.  I have worked with it in Kildare.  We have done this through the private sector in many places in Kildare where they could not get alternatives.  The minimum standard in the national broadband plan is 30 Mbps.  If I was living in a home in an intervention area and, depending on the answer to the first question, waiting five or ten years to get it, I might be very happy to get fixed wireless as an interim solution.  It might be possible to roll that out relatively cost efficiently and quickly.  Might that be considered as an interim measure in some of those areas which are at the end of the queue?  Even if things go swimmingly well, they might otherwise be waiting several years to get it.<\/p><p>We have spoken about procedures already today and what can and cannot be done.  I am a big fan of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and a big believer in democracy and sovereignty.  I always thought that was a given in the House but I query it now.  I believe in the separation of powers and, in particular, I believe in Article 28.4, which provides that the Government is accountable to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in all its actions.  I was a little bit taken aback when I came out of a vote this afternoon to see as a headline on the website of <i>The Irish Times <\/i>that the Government will ignore the vote of the D&aacute;il.  Is that correct?  Will the Government going to ignore the vote of the sovereign Parliament?  Why?  How?  Will the Bunreacht be thrown out the window with that decision?

The Minister said that this was a matter for the Oireachtas committee.  Did the Minister or his officials contact the committee at the time and suggest that we would consider the issue given it was of real significance for the roll-out of broadband in the country?

Eir had made the approach on previous occasions.  As the Minister said, it was public in terms of Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and others.  In the correspondence, the Minister says that it was not a political decision but a commercial decision.  He said that he could not interfere under state aid rules and had to just accept it.  The state aid rules argument falls apart because he is saying that he cannot subsidise what would be a commercial venture but by taking out those 300,000 we have now clearly seen, with the loss of the two bidders, that it is not a commercial proposition.  It could not be argued under state aid rules that including those was an unwarranted subsidy because the commercial case for this is now clear.  I do not know if it said it publicly but it is common knowledge that the reason the ESB pulled out is that once those 300,000 premises went, the commercial case vanished.  Therefore, it was not a European Union state aid rules reason and it was not a commercial reason but a political decision to take out those 300,000 houses.  Previously it had been refused and the Minister changed the political response by saying it would be allowed.  To say to us that it was great because we got a promise that they would be delivered or that there would be commitments around it is not really the issue because it appears as though withdrawing those 300,000 houses from the scheme has undermined it.  Therefore, when did Eir first approach the Department looking to take out the 300,000?  What was the Department's response and what changed last April to allow it happen?<\/p> <p>  The scheme was designed so that we would have two awards with two different contract areas.  What was the reasoning for that?  While this would mean there would be competitive tenders and difficult technologies and solutions might be tried, I presume one of the main reasons is that it would allow performance to be tested.  It would be a useful way of testing performance.  How will we now test performance?   Eir will still be providing all the poles on which enet's fibre will hang.  How will we know whether the delivery is up to speed?   We cannot look at upstate New York or Germany or wherever else the Minister mentioned because the Irish countryside is different to New York's.  How are we to know?  How will we have a control on Eir?  It might say that the poles are fine and no investment is needed in new poles.  How is anyone to know?

The entity that wins this cannot retail the product.  The intention, and I do not see why it could not become the reality, is for the range of existing commercial operators retailing to the public providing an offering on that.

In this process we are bidding to get a solution that meets the requirements for the next 25 years and beyond.  It is a question I asked of Mr. Vint Cerf when I invited him to Dublin during the summer.  I was concerned that in five years there could be some fabulous solution that is even better than fibre but Mr. Cerf made it quite clear to me there is nothing faster than light.  At that stage there was commercial roll-out of 10,000 Mbps using fibre.  I understand from some of the experts in the field now that one can even get up to 40,000 Mbps.

I advised Mr. Moat at the time that he should make direct contact and pass correspondence to the committee.<\/p> <p>  There has been some insinuation that there is a political decision being taken in respect of the figure of 300,000.  I can categorically say there was no political decision taken on the matter.  To put it very mildly, I was very hesitant about altering the map without clear black and white commitments from Eir, purely because I am a Deputy from a rural constituency and I have been for a number of years.  I have had plenty of promises regarding broadband coming, as have all my rural colleagues, and I made my views quite clear to Eir.  I will ask the procurement team to come back and speak about the procurement engagement and the areas mentioned by the Deputy.  There was detailed engagement with the European Commission on this.  The officials beside me engaged with the Commission and I will ask them to speak on that as well.<\/p> <p>  On access to infrastructure, the &euro;20 per pole is the current regulated price for access to infrastructure.  Normally, it is a three-year to five-year contract.  The price is set for three to five years.  We are entering into a contract over 25 years and we need to have guaranteed access over that time to the infrastructure and clarity on the pricing over 25 years.  That has not been set but I proposed and got approval from the Government to bring forward infrastructure access legislation.  It will come before the committee and the intention is that it will provide clarity on access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#J01200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":769,"content":"<p>This debacle has been ongoing since 2012.

I am sure the Minister is aware that the Irish people pay the third highest prices for broadband in the European Union.  Only Luxembourg and Malta pay more than we do.<\/p><p>We rank 22nd in terms of the quality of connection so we have one of the highest costs to the public and a really poor service.  I believe this is largely due to the monopoly activity of private sector operators in the market coupled with a history of weak regulation by the Irish State.  The national broadband plan was an admirable and visionary plan but the State has been led a merry dance by private sector operators.  I hope I am wrong but my prediction is that based on what has happened, what is happening and the direction the Minister seems intent on taking this, for the next 25 years the Irish people will continue to be fleeced on broadband prices.  <br\/><br\/>With regard to the process, originally, there was a map of the country with blue and orange areas.  We were told that the blue areas, which were generally the urban areas, were already covered by private operators and would be completely filled in by private operators by the end of 2016.  That is what it said on the Department's web page.  That then changed.  I looked it up the other day when I heard that Eir had pulled out.  It no longer says that urban areas will be covered by commercial operators by 2016.  It talks about where commercial operators are delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high-speed broadband services so there are no dates anymore.  So now the test for urban areas is that some private operator must have stated that it has a plan to deliver to that area.  I will read out a response from Eir to a Fianna F&aacute;il councillor in Greystones about an estate in Greystones in a blue area.  Eir stated there were no plans at that stage of which it was aware to deliver enhanced broadband to this area.  We have gone from the private operators getting this finished by 2016 to the private operators at least being obliged to have a plan to do this at some point in the future to the private operators, or at least Eir in this case, writing to a public representative saying it has no plans to do this.  That is what is happening on the ground today.  <br\/><br\/>We then got the news last year that what Eir had actually done was go through the country on a house-by-house level so anyone who pulls up the national broadband plan will see all of these light blue areas, the 300,000 premises that Eir will do.  They are not big geographic chunks.  Eir has gone up roads.  It has gone up this road and that road.  Interestingly, we will have to connect a lot of the bit that is left through Eir.  My understanding is there is now a big fight happening because Eir wants to charge a heap of money for the bit that is left, that is, for those data to go over the bit Eir said it is going to do.  My understanding of reports at the time was that Eir running away with these profitable bits increases by several hundred million euro the cost to the State because we are left with the least profitable and most expensive pieces.  I do not know whether Eir will do it but it appears it can now sit like a troll on a bridge and demand rent from every consumer who must pass over its network and indeed demand rent for the poles, which it has been doing for many years.  <br\/><br\/>The result of all of this is that, obviously, we have one bidder left so by definition, this is no longer a competitive tender process.  There is no competitive tension left in this at all.  Eir has taken a big chunk of it - the profitable piece - and it appears enet will do the other piece so what is essentially happening is that we are moving from a monopoly network, which means the Irish people have been screwed for years on price and we all know this, to several localised monopolies, one of which is owned by Eir.  I will read from an article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>on this matter.  I would be interested in getting the Minister's thoughts.  The article stated that Eircom had racked up &euro;4.1 billion of gross debt through five ownership changes in 13 years - and, of course, we have just had another ownership change - before it was forced into the State's largest ever examinership filing in 2012 resulting in &euro;1.8 billion of its borrowings being written off and a band of its most senior lenders led by US investment giant Blackstone seizing control of the business.  The article states:<\/p><blockquote>In the interim, the company, or what was left of it, has had many owners who, as short-term investors do, asset stripped with abandon.  The company was entangled in almost insurmountable debt.  Its broadband service, especially in rural areas but in many suburban areas too, was - and often still is - hopelessly inadequate despite being among the most expensive in Europe.  <\/blockquote><p>In an article in <i>Silicon Republic<\/i>, John Kennedy states that &quot;needless to say, it came to naught, and what followed was a decade of asset-stripping by various owners of post-IPO Eircom; failed and dashed investments in a promised brave new age of deregulation.&quot;  So that company has just taken ownership of these 300,000, and in my opinion, has been allowed to do so by the Government.  That is very worrying.  The Minister's response has been that this is great news because it is accelerating the connection to houses but he never talks about price.  That is Eir.  <br\/><br\/>The second monopoly provider is enet.  I am not alleging that enet has done anything wrong but I am alleging that the Government is doing something wrong because in the past hour, I received a response from the Department to a parliamentary question I tabled.  It specifically concerned the FOI request that Gavin Sheridan submitted.  What Gavin Sheridan sought was the concession agreement between enet and the Government.  In other words, the Irish people already pay enet to operate a fibre network that was put in the ground with European money many years ago specifically to deal with rural areas that the market would not get to - in other words, a small version of what the Minister is about give enet now.  I submitted a parliamentary question to say I was very perplexed by this because Gavin Sheridan put in his FOI request asking to see the concession agreement and the Department refused.  Mr. Sheridan then appealed the decision to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and the commissioner told the Department it needed to release the information because it is public interest and does not violate commercial sensitivity.  The Department, or the Government, took the extraordinary step of appealing that to the High Court, which ruled in Gavin Sheridan's favour and said there is public interest to be served and commercial sensitivity does not cover this.  The High Court ordered the Department to release the concession agreement - enet's agreement with the State - to Gavin Sheridan.  The Department then took the extraordinary step of appealing the High Court's decision to the Court of Appeal, which, coincidentally, is not scheduled until February next year - long after enet will have signed up to its new contract.<br\/><br\/>I submitted a parliamentary question to the Department a few days ago in which I asked how many FOI requests had been received by the Department since 2010 and of those, how many it had brought to the High Court or Court of Appeal.  How often in the past eight years has the Department gone to court to stop anyone finding anything out?  The Minister probably will not be surprised to find out that the answer is that of the 799 FOI requests submitted to his Department over the past eight years, the Department has gone to court once and that was to protect the enet concession agreement.  Does the Minister think there is a case to answer here where he and this Government have gone to court once after receiving over nearly 800 FOI requests over eight years to protect an existing agreement between the State and enet, which the court has ruled the Department needs to release?  Yet the Minister is asking Parliament and the Irish people to trust him in signing up to an even bigger version of the same contract with enet.  Does the Minister think that is reasonable?  In the context of asking Parliament and the Irish people to trust that the Minister will do a great deal with enet, will he now obey the order of the High Court and release that information to Gavin Sheridan so that we can see what is happening?  Does he accept that creating these monopolies constitutes a serious risk to the future pricing for Irish business and domestic consumers over the coming years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#J01500","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":773,"content":"<p>There are a number of questions there from Senator Lombard and Deputy Donnelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#K00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":774,"content":"<p>As Deputy Donnelly knows, I cannot comment on stuff that is before the courts.  There are probably questions over whether it should be discussed here but I will come back to that in a minute.<\/p><p> I can inform Senator Lombard that in the commitment agreement it signed with me, Eir gave a commitment to deliver broadband to approximately 179,000 premises before the end of this year.  It has said in the correspondence that is in the possession of the joint committee that it will fulfil that commitment agreement and will deliver on the 300,000 homes and premises by the end of the year.<\/p><p> The Senator also asked about the roadblocks that are ahead.  I have been trying to pre-empt many of these roadblocks through the mobile phone and broadband task force.  Many of the roadblocks will arise during the physical roll-out of the infrastructure.  We have done a great deal.  We have appointed a broadband officer in each local authority.  We are currently considering whether to ramp that up to a broadband office in each local authority.  We have streamlined the licensing process.  We have a uniform standard for road reopening and reinstatement.  We have completed ducting across the country on the Transport Infrastructure Ireland national road network.  I do not know whether there will be other roadblocks.  I hope not.  I am very engaged with the industry.  We are trying to deal with these issues in a proactive manner.<\/p><p> Deputy Lawless, who has proposed legislation in this area, also raised a number of issues.  I am quite happy to try to facilitate any proposals that deal with the roadblocks as we draw up the infrastructure access legislation and bring it through the House.<\/p><p> I was asked whether EU approval is needed.  Approval is required from the perspective of State aid.  We have been very engaged with the European Commission throughout this process.  As I said in my opening remarks, the Commission believes the commitment agreement we have with Eir could and should be replicated by other member states.  The Commission is quite impressed by the standard we have achieved in this respect.  Maybe I will ask my officials to come back to the committee on this in further detail because they deal with the Commission on a regular basis.  The reason for the detailed level of engagement with the Commission is to ensure this can quickly go through the formal process of State aid approval.  Our objective is to get moving on it quite quickly.<\/p><p> Deputy Donnelly raised the issue of cost versus service in the context of weak regulation.  It is absolutely the case that cost versus service is an issue.  The Deputy is aware that these issues are regulated.  I am quite happy to look at any recommendations that will come from the committee regarding regulation in this area.  I think there is legislation coming forward on ComReg and on regulation in general.  We are quite happy to look at any constructive suggestions that may be made in this regard.  As I said earlier, I advise and encourage the committee to invite representatives of ComReg to come before it so that these questions can be put to them.<\/p><p> Deputy Donnelly spoke about the blue, amber and light blue areas.  As he knows, I have encouraged colleagues formally, informally and on the floor of the House to raise anomalies within the blue area.  I emailed the offices of all Deputies to ask them to highlight anomalies within the blue area.  A number of colleagues did so and I thank them for their input.  The individual who is responsible for the map is Mr. Pat Neary, who is sitting beside me.  Maybe he can go into further detail when he gets an opportunity to do so in a few minutes.  We have changed from dark blue to amber any area or house that was not getting or would not get a minimum of 30 Mbps.  As I said earlier, our intention is to bring high-speed broadband to every home and business in Ireland, both urban and rural.  The gaps will have to be addressed.  We have made provision within the contract to allow for that.  We also believe the universal service obligation will deal with many of these areas.<\/p><p> Deputy Donnelly suggested that the light blue area has been compiled on a house by house basis.  I can inform him that it has been done on an postcode by postcode basis.  I refused to sign the commitment agreement until I got a list of postcodes across the country to which Eir was committing to provide high-speed broadband.  I did not want to say we were going to do 300,000 because people would have wanted to know whether we were going to do 150,000 in Laois while other places were left high and dry.  We have a list that has been compiled on the basis of postcodes.  Just over 300,000 postcodes were presented to us.<\/p><p> It will not be the case that people will have to pay for the data over that fibre.  It will be part of the whole procurement process.  I will ask the officials who are with me to deal with that in a few minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#K00300","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":776,"content":"<p>I want to make sure I understand the Minister correctly regarding the light blue areas that Eir will now own.

I did not want to see people having to wait to for responses to freedom of information requests to get information.  I know that a number of colleagues have had individual briefings on this issue and other issues within my Department.  That is my approach.

Its purpose is to implement the recommendations of the review of the framework for motor insurance compensation in Ireland, which was approved by the Government in July 2016.  I wish to take a few moments to remind the committee of the background to this important matter.<\/p> <p>  The trigger for the review of the motor insurance compensation regime was the failure of Setanta Insurance in 2014 and the uncertainty that followed over the compensation arrangements for third party claimants.  The cause of this uncertainty is the fact that there are two insurance guarantee schemes in place, namely, the insurance compensation fund, ICF, and the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI.  The ICF covers the liabilities of non-life insurance policyholders in the event of a failure of an insurance undertaking; and the MIBI&rsquo;s primary purpose is to compensate victims of road traffic accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles.<\/p> <p>  Both schemes have differing compensation levels.  Taking account of a clearly outlined reference to the MIBI in the ICF legislation, the Law Society of Ireland brought a case to the High Court seeking that the MIBI was liable to pay the Setanta third party claimants.  The initial outcome of the case was that in September 2015, the High Court ruled in the law society&rsquo;s favour and in January 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld that the MIBI was liable for meeting such claims.<\/p> <p>  That was, therefore, the context within which the motor insurance compensation framework working group was set up in January 2016.  Its primary purpose was to examine what could be done to address the uncertainties of the existing regime and the inequity between the MIBI award levels for third party claimants and the levels paid by the ICF for any future motor insurance insolvencies.  At the time the report was being prepared, the courts had ruled that the higher award levels applied by MIBI were the applicable ones for Setanta.  For that reason, the report focused on future motor insolvencies only.<\/p> <p>  The critical recommendations of the review of the framework for motor insurance compensation in Ireland report were twofold: first, coverage of the ICF should be extended to 100% for third party motor insurance claims in the event of a liquidation of an insurer; and, second, the increased coverage of the ICF should be funded by a direct contribution to the ICF from the motor insurance industry via the MIBI to the value of 35% of the third party motor insurance claims.<\/p> <p>  The first of these recommendations was designed to ensure that any future third party motor insurance claims against policies of an insurer in liquidation would be compensated to the same level as claims against uninsured or unidentified vehicles.  The question which then arose was who should finance this extra 35%.  There were broadly speaking two main options &ndash; the State or the industry.  The working group concluded that the State had a sufficient exposure with the existing 65% ICF requirement and that because of this, industry should fund the additional 35% cost.  It recommended that this extra amount should be financed by a direct contribution to the ICF from the motor insurance industry via the MIBI.<\/p> <p>  Subsequent to the publication of the report, the industry, while accepting the recommendation in principle, argued that any payment directly from the MIBI would create an unknown exposure for insurers, as they would not know what their liability would be from one year to the next; in other words, the extra 35% could be a very small amount or a very large amount depending on the size of any future insolvent insurer.<\/p><p>This uncertainty, the industry contended, could result in an increase in capital costs as companies would almost certainly respond in a conservative fashion in order to ensure they had sufficient funds for a worst-case scenario.  Insurance Ireland argued that to minimise future volatility, an <i>ex ante<\/i>fund should instead be established into which insurers would contribute an amount equivalent to 2% of gross written motor insurance premiums.  This fund would then be used to meet the industry's liability of 35% in the event of an insolvent insurer.  In summary, their views were that the greater predictability and certainty of their proposed approach to financing this extra 35% would mean a more stable pricing regime as companies would know from year to year the maximum extent of their exposure to a potential motor insurer insolvency.  This matter is considered in more detail in the regulatory impact analysis, which was sent to the committee last year.  The Minister for Finance agreed with this analysis and accordingly, this position is reflected in the general scheme.  He believes this approach strikes the right balance between protecting consumers - claimants and policyholders - affected by an insolvency, minimising the exposure of the Exchequer, and at the same time ensures that Ireland remains an attractive place for insurers to conduct business through the provision of as much certainty as possible.<br\/><br\/>I now turn to Setanta.  I accept that Setanta third-party claimants have been very unfortunate in the way in which this insolvency has unfolded.  It was the first large freedom of service motor insurer operating in the Irish market to become insolvent and lessons have been learnt from this experience, which are reflected in the insurance (amendment) Bill.  Unlike Quinn Insurance, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and PMPA, which were authorised in Ireland, there was no basis for placing Setanta in administration and running off the book of business over a period and meeting claims in full as they arose.  The consequence of the Supreme Court decision of May 2017 to overturn the previous decisions that the MIBI is liable in respect of third-party motor insurance claims meant that the insurance compensation fund has responsibility for the payment of such third-party claims.  In this context, questions have been asked as to why the Government did not make its decision to step in earlier to ensure that Setanta and Enterprise third-party claimants are compensated in full.  I can understand why these questions have been raised.  However, before the Minister for Finance could make any decision on a State intervention, he believed it was necessary first to get an actuarial report on the claims reserves of Setanta and an update on the extent of assets available to transfer to third-party claimants from the liquidator and second, to obtain advice on a legal concern that any Government intervention to compensate third-party claimants over and above the 65% limit could result in the Government having a lower status in the creditor hierarchy and thus significantly reduce the amount it could recoup from the liquidator.<br\/><br\/>The Department received the details of the actuarial report in early October 2017.  Based on this report, the liquidator estimates that he would not be in a position to meet more than 22% of the claims out of the assets of the liquidation, thus leaving an estimated shortfall of 13%.  On the legal issue, the Department of Finance went to tender for a Maltese legal opinion in September 2017.  The opinion was received in late November 2017 with a follow-up inquiry obtained in early December 2017.  Department of Finance officials met the liquidator on 9 January 2018 and received an update on the current status of the liquidation process, as well as the issues he is encountering in settling claims.  Also discussed was what could be done to accelerate settlement and payment of claims.  Based on the information received from the liquidator and the legal advice, the Minister announced on 30 January 2018 his agreement in principle to ensure that Setanta third-party claimants are compensated in full.  Key to this decision was his satisfaction that the ICF is likely ultimately to recover from the liquidators a broadly similar amount that third-party claimants would have received had the State not stepped in.  The Department is now working through the detailed arrangements to implement this decision, which is likely to require legislative change.  In this regard, the next step is to give consideration as to whether there is any state aid or other legal issue associated with the approach proposed.  The Department is working with the Attorney General's office on this issue and once the position is clarified we can give an indication of the likely timeline for payment, including payment of the additional 35% to those who have already received 65%.  I met the Attorney General yesterday to press this matter further.<br\/><br\/>Enacting the insurance (amendment) Bill and implementing the Setanta decision are priority matters for the Government.  The latter will most likely be addressed through the insertion of an additional provision to this Bill.  In an ideal world, I would like to have the Bill published by the end of this quarter.  However, until the state aid matter is clarified, it is not possible to give an absolute commitment on this matter.  As I said, I met the Attorney General yesterday to progress this.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the Bill.  I am happy to take any questions about the overall approach proposed or the details of the general scheme of the Bill that the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020800002#B00300","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518084000,"counter":816,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions and then I am afraid I must run.

This is the first time I have addressed this committee.  It feels very timely to do so, as we are approaching the twentieth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement; as we face, still, proposals for consultation on the legacy institutions, those measures for dealing with the past which were agreed at Stormont House; and also because of the potential impact of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement and on victims and survivors.  Furthermore, we are at the moment implementing a significant PEACE IV project, led by ourselves and our sister organisation, the Victims and Survivors Service.  We believe this has a significant role to play in building capacity and capability across the community and voluntary sector, both in the North and in the Border region, and for victims and survivors living outside Northern Ireland, in the Republic of Ireland and other parts of the UK.  That is a significant piece of work which I would also like to touch on during my presentation today.<\/p> <p>  In the months ahead, as we approach that twentieth anniversary, there will clearly be a period of reflection and commentary on the commitments in the Good Friday Agreement, including those explicit references to supporting victims and survivors of the conflict.  The agreement stated:  \"It is recognised that victims have a right to remember as well as to contribute to a changed society. The achievement of a peaceful and just society would be the true memorial to the victims of violence.\"<\/p> <p>  Very importantly, the Agreement also highlighted the disproportionate impact of the Troubles on younger generations, and the potential trans-generational effect of the conflict, which we are now seeing.  The Agreement stated: \"The participants [in the negotiations] particularly recognise that young people from areas affected by the troubles face particular difficulties and will support the development of special community-based initiatives based on international best practice.\"<\/p> <p>  The Agreement also noted: \"An essential aspect of the reconciliation process is the promotion of a culture of tolerance at every level of society\".<\/p> <p>  These commitments, made in the Agreement, are still of critical importance, and in many respects are the unfinished business of peace.<\/p><p> Before I discuss further the key issues currently facing victims and survivors, I would like to introduce members to the Victims and Survivors Forum.  Part of my legislative responsibility and the British Government strategy for victims and survivors is to convene a forum for consultation and discussion on victims' issues.  It aims to engender a process which brings together a representative group of people.  There are currently 23 members of the forum, who are balanced in terms of gender, community of origin and, in so far as possible, origin of harm.  They are there as volunteers to engage in discussion in order to find common ground and are committed to creating a better future for everybody in Northern Ireland.  It is an important civic process which is advisory to me.  I also talk to other victims and survivors groups and individuals but this is a core group of people who work together in a consistent way to inform policy and put victims and survivors at the heart of policy development and legislation in a balanced and holistic way.  That is particularly important because, in the view of victims and survivors, their voices are too often used in politics and the media to add legitimacy to differing political views or to illustrate divergent political narratives with which they often do not fully agree, leading to a sense of frustration.  This often creates the perception that victims and survivors cannot agree on the way forward.  My experience and that of the commission are very different.  If one puts the 23 people to whom I refer, who have suffered harm at the hand of many different organisations and often more than one, in a room and asks them to find common ground and the best way forward, they usually will do so and, where they cannot agree, they are respectful and clear about that.  They can provide leadership in that regard and more broadly.  The forum captures the common will of everybody who has suffered harm in order to ensure that nobody else suffers such harm, which sometimes gets lost in discussion of the issues of victims and survivors.  Although we are delighted to be here, I would like to offer the committee the opportunity to meet members of the victims forum if it so wishes.  We would be delighted to make that happen.<\/p><p> In terms of issues to address, I wish to first discuss the proposed consultation on the legacy institutions outlined in the Stormont House Agreement.  I am sure that members, who have heard extensive evidence on the subject, are aware of the current high level of frustration with continued delays in starting a consultation process to move those bodies forward.  To some extent, we recognise those delays are related to a current political impasse and other recent political events but I have strongly impressed on all political parties and Governments and also impress upon the committee that it is vitally important to move forward on consultation as a first step to implementation of the bodies agreed in the Stormont House Agreement, namely, that there should be a historical investigations unit, that is, an investigative body independent of the police to investigate outstanding Troubles deaths.  Given the time that has elapsed, we do not expect that to result in a large number of prosecutions.  The major product of the historical investigations unit would be evidence-based reports for families and a society that desires to know the truth of what happened in many cases where that has not been established to date.  An information retrieval process outside the justice process but enabling those who wish for information given confidentiality and without the prospect of it being part of a justice process to be given to them should also be established.  That will facilitate individuals who want to know what happened to family members.  An oral history archive founded on legislation but with the potential to capture different narratives and be a resource for understanding, debate and reconciliation is required.  There is also a need for an information and reparation group and-or implementation of reparation group, IRG.  Although there is currently no draft legislation for that body, it is the view and advice of the commission that appropriate legislation should be put in place such that the body would begin to tackle the consideration of the thematic acknowledgement of harm rather than looking at individual cases.  A mental health trauma network was provided for in the Stormont House Agreement and does not require legislation as it exists in policy.  However, it needs better funding and further implementation.  I will come back to that.  It should be of benefit to those living in areas, North and South, close to the Border and could provide learning, if not direct service, to people living in the Republic of Ireland who have suffered trauma, hardship and harm.<\/p><p> Those initiatives, along with a pension for the severely disabled, were part of the Stormont House Agreement.  Some, including the oral history archive, information retrieval and historical investigations, would require Westminster legislation to implement.  As members are aware, we have draft legislation ready for consultation.  The implementation of a pension for the severely disabled would require legislation, although it is currently a devolved matter.  Legislation should be put in place to fully implement the IRG, the acknowledgement of which is a very important part of this process.  However, it is frustrating that this action has all been stalled.  The first step is consultation on the legislative matters which can be progressed by Westminster and for which we have draft legislation more or less ready to consult.<\/p><p> Over recent months, our victims and survivors forum, together with the commission, have met with the Secretary of State, the shadow Secretary of State, and representatives from all political parties in Northern Ireland.  The message that although an assembly is desirable in order to progress these matters it is not essential and in its absence consultation could progress in respect of those matters governed by Westminster legislation, such as the historical investigations, oral history archive and the information retrieval process, has been consistently given by the forum and commission and that has been agreed by the Northern Ireland political parties.<\/p><p> The forum, the commission, my staff and I believe that the consultation process must be transparent, accessible and meaningful.  Any published information should be clear and explicit as to what will be done and how.  It must not to be a box-ticking exercise but, rather, proactively seek input from victims and survivors in the North of Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and beyond.  The process should not confine itself to the victim sector but should also seek to engage with wider civic society because the resolution of outstanding matters from the past is not just for the benefit of those who personally suffered as it is becoming increasingly clear it is very important from a civic point of view as a way of moving to a more prosperous and united future.<\/p><p> I have enjoyed meeting officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Just before Christmas, I met the T&aacute;naste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.  It was a very useful meeting, as such meetings always are, and it is very clear that the Government has been committed to building reconciliation in the North and helping the proposed mechanisms to be progressed.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, has agreed to meet with the forum for victims and survivors.  I appreciate that he is busy in his new role as T&aacute;naiste but we hope to soon meet him because the alternative is that the political situation will continue to fester and the lack of progress will continue to have a corrosive effect on justice institutions in the North.<\/p><p> We went through a very comprehensive and quite successful process of justice reform as part of and resulting from the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>That is being unpicked, or at least confidence in it is being unpicked, by this failure to deal with legacy.  That has a civic impact as well.  This unfinished piece is really becoming quite deeply harmful, and I do not believe we should ever underestimate the extent to which the huge amount that has been achieved since the Good Friday Agreement can be undermined if we fail to deal properly and in a transparent, effective and victim-centred way with outstanding legacy matters.  <\/p><p> Another matter which is not a part of the Stormont House Agreement but which I want to touch on is the Defence Committee's proposal for what it has termed the statute of limitations, but which the legal advisers to that committee described as an amnesty.  It is very clear from that legal advice and from other subsequent advice from the Human Rights Commission that, were there to be such an amnesty or statute of limitations, it would inevitably apply to all actors.  It would be akin to asking people to forget about what happened and that we develop a collective amnesia in relation to the past.  I do not believe, from talking to victims and survivors in my forum, that is what people want.  Different people want different things.  Not everybody wants to see justice through to its conclusion.  Not everybody wants to know what happened.  However, there is a general acknowledgment - at a civic level as well - that this cannot be ended by our being told to forget about it.  There have been so many deaths.  There must be a process, and any attempt to derail that process through the introduction of proposals - not to mention the reality - of a blanket amnesty is not going to move us forward in a civic way.  It is not going to meet the needs or wishes of many of those who were harmed.  It is not going to provide us with a psychologically healthy place from which to progress.  It is the view of the Commission for Victims and Survivors and of most of the victims and survivors to whom I speak that that is an unhelpful way of dealing with the past and that the proposal itself threatens to distract from, or potentially even undermine, the proposals that have been worked on for a long time and have been arrived at through a long, difficult process.  That is a concern at the moment.  <\/p><p> Twenty years ago the Good Friday Agreement foresaw the impact of the conflict on children and young people and research studies in recent years have highlighted how the legacy of the Troubles still continues to affect the lives of children and young people growing up in Northern Ireland, and beyond, today.  The Commission&rsquo;s 2015 Towards a Better Future study revealed that the conflict&rsquo;s legacy is complex.  It involves an interaction of many different factors, including exposure to parental mental ill-health, to parental exposure to trauma, as well as exposure to the wider social environment that is still affected by segregation, sectarianism and ongoing paramilitarism.   <\/p><p> I would like to comment briefly on that very serious issue.  Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement more than 150 individuals have lost their lives as a consequence of paramilitary violence.  Hundreds more have been subjected to brutalising attacks by paramilitary organisations.  As an enduring conflict legacy issue, paramilitarism can be viewed as a significant factor perpetuating trans-generational harm.  There are serious consequences for the mental health of people who suffered harm in the Troubles when they still see violence happening in the news and on their doorsteps.  It is a serious issue when children and young people are exposed to the threat of violence or the reality of that violence in their home areas.  Those areas are the places which were most affected in the first instance by Troubles-related violence.  They are also the areas where social and economic deprivation tends to be highest.  There are complex interrelated factors here, but it is a toxic legacy for some parts of Northern Ireland. <\/p><p> One major concern I have about Brexit is how the EU Victims&rsquo; Rights Directive may be protected in that context.  Adopted by the EU in October 2012, the victims&rsquo; rights directive means that all victims of crime and their family members are recognised and treated in a respectful and non-discriminatory manner based on an individual approach tailored to the victims' needs.  We have very specific rights in the context of historical investigations.  I am aware that that directive has been embedded in legislation in the Republic of Ireland.  I am also aware that it is embedded in policy and legislation in the North of Ireland.  We are advised that should we come to a point of implementing historical investigations, for example, or information retrieval, then those people and the families going through that process would be entitled to the rights given to them under that directive.  That is important in terms of ensuring that people are supported, protected if necessary, and given access to good information as they go through those processes.  Resources need to be in place to do that.  Given the extensive consultation and support for the Victims Charter in the North of Ireland and in the Republic, I am not saying that it is likely to be repealed or diminished.   We do need to keep an eye on it, however, in the context of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  <\/p><p> Equally, in the absence of the proposed legacy bodies, it has been possible for some individuals to achievd investigations through international human rights legislation.  That has been a significant factor in people&rsquo;s ability to bring historical matters before the courts.  It is an important context for the proposed measures for dealing with the past, all of which must be &ndash; and are designed to be &ndash; Article 2 compliant.  Human rights legislation is important in this context, and again, in the context of Brexit, it is important that piece of the jigsaw is well remembered and safeguarded in the process.  <\/p><p> In terms of our current work I want to mention the PEACE IV funded programme which is being delivered as a lead partner to the parties for victims and survivors services.  There is a total of &euro;18 million, which will all be spent on building capacity services for victims and survivors in the areas of health and well-being, and also in the area of advocacy for justice.  Some will also be spent on welfare reform.  Underpinning those three strands to service delivery, where capacity will be built in the voluntary and community sector using this money, the Commission will run a three-pronged research programme to evaluate and learn from the implementation of that funding and also to contribute to the way legacy institutions can be implemented to ensure that we do it in a fully victim-centred way.  <\/p><p> The review of trauma services project, which is the first of the programme&rsquo;s research projects, is a three year study which will provide the opportunity to explore the lived experiences of victims and survivors and their families whilst they go through trauma-related psychological therapy treatment and other support.  The findings from this research will add value to therapy service provision for service users in the future.  <\/p><p> The trans-generational legacy and young people project is also a three year study which will engage in dialogue with young people and, where appropriate, their parents, and will seek to really understand the continuing impact of conflict on the lives of young people, with the end goal of putting services in place that will most effectively enable such people to manage its impact.   <\/p><p> Finally, the advocacy services project is a two year study that will look at the experiences of victims and their families as they access advocacy support services, either in relation to Police Ombudsman investigations, to legacy inquests or legacy investigations by the police.  Hopefully, as we move towards the new institutions, which will deal in a more holistic way with the experiences of people.  We want to learn about how best to deliver these services, what is most effective, and what each victim needs going forward.<\/p><p> The commission also worked very closely with the pensioner need working group for the forum to look at implementing pensions for the severely injured.  As I said, that was referenced in the Stormont House agreement, but the legislation which is needed to put in place has not yet been developed or agreed.  It remains a devolved matter, which is being delayed through the absence of an Assembly.<\/p><p> We produced policy advice on this in 2014 and were very strongly of the view that this is an important legacy issue which needs to be addressed.  The committee heard from the Wave organisation about the 500 most severely injured people who are getting older, living on benefits and experiencing the impact of welfare reform.  They need to be looked after now not later.<\/p><p> In terms of improving health and well-being services, we work very closely with the victims and survivors service and the executive office.  There is a budget of &pound;13 million a year from the executive office, which is dispersed between different victim support NGOs and some individual needs payments.<\/p><p> Through PEACE IV, there is the addition of individual needs support from caseworkers for up to 18,000 individuals who are registered with the VSS and funding groups.  Those case workers are in place and early indications are that the process is working well.  The monitoring and evaluation data from this will come to the commission as part of our research project into the impact of that PEACE funding.<\/p><p> The regional trauma network is referenced in the Stormont House Agreement as a mental health trauma service.  In September 2015, the then Health Minister announced, in line with that commitment, a comprehensive regional mental health trauma network for Northern Ireland and the Border region to ensure that victims and survivors have timely access to high-quality trauma services by trauma informed therapists.  We should be expert at doing this, but at the moment it is patchy and not everybody who needs those services gets them.  PEACE IV funding is playing a critical role in supporting the development of the regional trauma network through the provision of caseworkers and growing capacity of the third sector to play a role as a fundamental building block of a service which is then supplemented with a networking rearrangement with the health service.<\/p><p> In conclusion, from my opening points it can be seen that we are clearly moving into a period of significant reflection and change in the months ahead for victims and survivors.  I recognise that some of these developments will potentially have a profound impact on many victims and survivors and their families.  While much work and investment has been made over the past ten years in improving services, the time has come to address the underlying legacy of our past. <\/p><p> The culmination of previous proposals to deal with the past now provide us with a roadmap to press ahead, and consultation is the first step in this roadmap.  Some 20 years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, these measures are our best chance of dealing with unfinished business and delivering the best outcome for victims and survivors.  It will not be perfect, easy or comfortable for anybody, but we have tried not doing it for 20 years and that has not worked.  It is time we tried to engage with this difficult stuff and do it in the best way we possibly can in a victim-centred way.<\/p><p> I hope that through the work of my office, the forum and collaboration with a range of stakeholders that we can collectively improve the well-being of victims and survivors and build a better and more reconciled society for them and their families and everyone in Northern Ireland.  This is not just for victims and survivors; it is something we have to do at a civic level for everybody.

I note they have always been willing to travel anywhere to discuss the work they are doing.  It is really good work.  At the end of the day, they are trying to get to the truth.  How much does truth matter?  Some people want absolute truth and want to know every single detail of what went on, while others want a general sketch or to forget something ever happened.<\/p> <p>  I was a member of the security forces.  I referred to the security forces collusion during the worst period of what went on in Northern Ireland being airbrushed out of history to all intents and purposes.  People regularly contact me and say there can be no reconciliation or putting things behind us unless not only those who saw themselves as being on the loyalist or republican side during the struggle in the North are dealt with but also the security forces who have walked away scot free.  <\/p> <p>  People say to me that the Good Friday Agreement released prisoners, but they served time for the crimes they committed.  Very few members of the security forces have served time for anything and they have not been called to account for their actions.  They should be, but how far that goes I am not sure.  I do not know whether they should be charged with crimes or brought to some sort of truth commission in which they can deal with some of the things they carried out.  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' views on that.  It is a gaping hole in the reconciliation process.<\/p> <p>  There is now a whole generation of young adults who knew nothing of what went on in Northern Ireland other than what history tells them.  In this country, we try to a large degree not to discuss our history.  I recently saw a television documentary about something which went on in Northern Ireland.  Somebody quite close to me asked whether it had to be shown and if it was not bringing everything back up again.  To a certain degree, we want to forget what happened.  There is an attitude that it should be left to certain people who can deal with it in a quiet room somewhere rather than having it brought to our attention. <\/p> <p>  I am concerned there are two types of victims in Northern Ireland.  There are those who suffered trauma and those who were radicalised during the time involved, some of whom are having difficulty coming to terms with some of the acts they carried out.  Some need to talk about them and others need to try to find reconciliation for what they did or were involved in or find peace in themselves.  <\/p> <p>  I am concerned about those who are regarded as prisoners.  When the Good Friday Agreement was signed and we opened the gates of prisons and allowed people from both sides of the community to come back out into society we still branded them as prisoners.  They are still treated as prisoners.  Some of the stories we have heard about the loading of car insurance, the inability to travel and disaffection with the system are concerning.  <\/p> <p>  Some people are doing fine under the Good Friday Agreement but nobody has thought about a certain cohort.  In a peculiar way, they are now in a position whereby they are almost unintentionally radicalising an entirely new generation in some parts of Northern Ireland because of their disaffection and fact that they have been treated badly, in their view.  Perhaps they have. <\/p> <p>  One can stand in one part of Belfast and see an investment worth &euro;1 billion less than half a mile away, but very little sign of the same investment in the community in which one is standing.<\/p><p> One can do the same thing in Dublin and funnily enough there are the same kind of societal problems.  There is a growth of violence in north Dublin and I think there will also be a growth of violence in north Belfast in time.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on that.  <\/p><p> Brexit will bring a whole host of new problems for 1.8 million potential Irish citizens who are separated from their country by geography.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018020800002#G00300","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518099000,"counter":843,"content":"<p>I was delighted to hear such an excellent, comprehensive presentation.<\/p> <p>  All of us are around long enough to have seen PEACE I, PEACE II, PEACE III and the witnesses referred to PEACE IV and its importance in trying to bring communities together, both north and south of the Border.  In the context of Brexit it is a major concern that those moneys must be guaranteed beyond 2020.  That needs to be highlighted here today because someone needs to step up and ensure that the excellent programmes being delivered by the commission and the community programmes to which Senator Craughwell referred, which may not have got down to where they needed, are able to continue.  I am very conscious of that.  Will the witnesses comment on that progress?  The Special EU Programmes Body presented to us some time ago seemed unable to get any sense of funding beyond 2020.<\/p> <p>  I was interested in the mental health trauma network.  We were given an estimate that approximately 90 people from the south were affected by outcomes of the Troubles, they might have been families of people in security forces, people who were murdered or otherwise.  They were put through the ordinary HSE system.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, was before the committee and gave a commitment that services similar to those available in the North for those who have undergone trauma would be made available here.  Is that happening?<\/p> <p>  I was not surprised to read the figure of 150 people having been murdered on both sides since the Good Friday Agreement, and many thousands have been maimed.  What is the degree to which they can avail of the process, and where does one decide that everyone has been given an opportunity to create peace?  How does one deal with that in terms of dealing with the victims, the average of eight a year since the Good Friday Agreement was signed?<\/p> <p>  I do not know the figures, but I have dealt with a considerable number of people outside the country, and others who are living in the South who are also victims who have not been able to return to the North.  Equally, there are others who have had to leave the country for various issues.  How do they feed into the trauma experiences?  They are missing their native areas.  Are the witnesses in contact with them or how are we reaching them?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018020800002#H00200","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518099000,"counter":844,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Thompson for her comprehensive and thought-provoking testimony, as would be expected.  I welcome her comments around the statute of limitations.  Recently, myself and some colleagues met with the proposers of that in Westminster.  We were alarmed by the extent to which they seemed in a bubble and not to be aware of the process of reconciliation and recovery that is going on in this part of the world so I welcome her comments.<\/p> <p>  Ms Thompson referred to the unfinished business of peace.  I want to ask around what I feel is the unforgotten part, namely gender.  There should be a gender lens to all of this, and to transitional justice in particular.  There has been a complete failure on the British Government's part and perhaps lip service from the Irish Government to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution, UNSCR 1325.  That relates to a gender perspective for transitional justice which puts women at the centre.  We know that in post-conflict societies violence against women is often far higher than in any other societies.  It is a fact in the North that we have nearly 100 instances of violence against women daily.  We know that it is a real issue but the British Government refuses to include the North in its action plan around UNSCR 1325.  My analysis of the South is that it only pays lip service to it.  To what extent has the commissioner's office engaged with London or Dublin on this issue, and especially around the need for a gender perspective?  It is so important.<\/p> <p>  The justice vacuum was something Ms Thompson touched upon.  She mentioned the importance of many institutions which are not in place including the Historical Investigations Unit, HIU, the Historical Enquiries Team, HET and the Institute for Conflict Research, ICR.  We now have a moratorium on all police ombudsman reports while we await the outcome of the retired police officers judicial review against the Loughinisland findings and there is the issue of inquests.  Victims and survivors are now having to take to the streets in civic peaceful protest.  There is a march planned for the end of this month and we expect to see thousands on the streets on this.  It is hugely frustrating to a great number of people.  Can Ms Thompson comment on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018020800002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Hazzard"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518099000,"counter":845,"content":"<p>I will talk about some of the issues which Senator Craughwell raised on truth and justice and young people.  I will ask my colleague Mr. John Beggs to speak about the peace programme and the mental health trauma network and support for young people who are victims of paramilitary violence.  I will try to say something about gender and justice impacts.<\/p> <p> Starting with gender, I agree that it is an area which is insufficiently explored and understood although it has been explored and we are very aware of the good research has been done.  What is significant here historically is that the majority of people who were killed or injured during the Troubles were men.  The majority, but by no means all, who were imprisoned were also men.  There was a focus on men as those people who experienced violence.  In association with each one of those incidents, there were women who brought up families at home in both parts of the community and dealt with a traumatic process of reintegration after separation.  <\/p> <p>  We have one of the highest levels of domestic violence in the UK, and it is something I am very well aware of from my previous work.  Last time I looked, looking at assaults and crimes of violence, it was the largest single factor.  That includes assault, common assault and things such as criminal damage, where it has happened in the course of a domestic violence incident.  We know it is at extremely high levels.  At an anecdotal level, we know there is a connection between experience of trauma and domestic violence.  I agree with Mr. Hazzard that it is insufficiently understood and researched.  I know that in putting together the three research programmes I spoke about, it has been highlighted to us that we absolutely need to look at gender as a factor, both in impact on young people and in mental health trauma and engaging in the past.  <\/p> <p>  Women's lives are shaped and changed through the Troubles just as men's have been.  More of those involved, imprisoned and hurt were men, so that it is true that the focus has tended to be towards the men.  I acknowledge the point and completely agree with Mr. Hazzard on its importance.  We have some sense of it at an anecdotal and intuitive level, we have written it into the specification for our research and it something on which we are focusing.  <\/p> <p>  I referred briefly to the impact on justice.  We went through a process which is one of the most successful processes of police reform at the time.  There was 50:50 recruitment, the special legislation to do that and a special recruitment process to do this and achieve in the region of 30% from the Catholic community, and around 30% female, which put it ahead of the rest of the UK.<\/p><p>That was a very significant achievement.  The courts changed the way they did business and the way they engaged with the public.  Judicial appointments were done differently and remain different.  The prosecution service changed the way it was organised and changed the way it delivered prosecutions.  Police stopped prosecuting cases in court.  There was fundamental change across the board with the primary objective of creating a justice system was trusted, acknowledged and owned by all parts of the community.  I would not want to completely say that has been dismantled in this case, but people&rsquo;s trust in the system is being dismantled.  Whether I am sitting in Kingsmill, west Belfast or somewhere in between, it is really hard to find victims and survivors who feel we have a justice system with the capacity or the will to do anything for them.  That distrust is as corrosive as we knew it was before we went through justice reform.<\/p><p> It is not just me saying this.  The Chief Constable has stated repeatedly that he cannot do his job today and deal with the past.  He has said that failing to deal with the past is getting in the way of him doing his job today.  It is fundamentally and clearly true.  We have heard the police ombudsman.  That critically important office was set up to create transparency and community trust and broad oversight to the process of policing.  Yet, the police ombudsman says he cannot do his job because he is not funded properly.  He is also tied up in a courts process which, equally, undermines his ability to do his job.  It is a worrying development.  We have a Chief Justice who has done a very credible job of taking on a problem not of his making in the coroners&rsquo; courts and put together some practical and costed proposals for dealing with a backlog no one thinks is acceptable, namely people waiting 40 years for an inquest.  However, there is a lack of funding to tackle that.  For everyone across the community in Northern Ireland, this unresolved matter is corrosive for our reformed justice system in the North, of which we were, rightly, proud.<\/p><p> Issues of truth, such as how much, who wants it and what it is, are incredibly difficult philosophical questions which we will never perfectly answer.  However, we have an absolute obligation, as a place that is and wishes to be a democracy with a decent justice system, to do the best we can.  We must also respect the fact that people have different wishes.  As far as one can, one must, therefore, offer them choices and options.  At its most fundamental and with regard to historical investigations, it would not be realistic of me to offer people a prospect of lots of successful prosecutions in respect of matters which happened 40 years ago.  One has to prove things beyond a reasonable doubt and that is often not possible.  However, to say to someone that they should, therefore, forget about it is not the right approach.  I hear from all parts of the community that someone in a position of government authority could have prevented the harm that befell a family but it did not happen for reasons not related to that family's best interests.  One cannot tell people to forget those things.  As such, one needs a process of investigation even if the outcome is information for families and those who need to know rather than prosecutions.  I suspect that for the most part, albeit as a justice process and an independent investigatory process, historical investigations will mostly deliver that.  It will not tell people everything they want to hear.<\/p><p> It is necessary to provide support for people to engage in the process in an informed way, including mental health and personal support, because this is very difficult even for those who desperately want it.  It is usually harder than anticipated.  However, that does not mean one takes the option away.  One gives people the option and the support so that those who want them can have those reports, even if they do not see a prosecution.  I know people who have had HET reports which, with all their flaws.  They have told me that while, for example, a son has read it, the person has not.  Nevertheless, they acknowledge that they have it and they can choose to read it at some time.  Sometimes, that is what people want.  Is that truth going to be the whole truth?  No.  However, one has an obligation to do what is doable and to not sweep things under the carpet.  Similarly, it is the case for information retrieval.  People have some options.  If there is a prosecution, it is a process that is out of the hands of the person who has been wronged.  For the most part, this will be about information and reports which a person can choose to have or not.  That gives people choices and options, as do information retrieval and the oral history archive.  That is the fundamental answer to the Deputy's question.  Different people want different things and that is why one provides options and the support to allow them to make those choices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018020800002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Judith Thompson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518099000,"counter":847,"content":"<p>I will address some of the other questions.  I welcome the comments on the need for continued peace funding beyond 2021.  Currently, we have a commitment through the SEUPB and the victims and survivors service for funding up to 2021.  Indeed, we attended a launch event yesterday for &euro;17.6 million in funding for victims, survivors and funded groups to do sterling work around advocacy and health and well-being support.  There is a programme of work to do.  We have no commitment beyond 2021 and no one else does either.  Certainly, we will advocate strongly, demonstrate the positive outcomes the current Peace IV programme will deliver and lobby hard to have that commitment extended beyond 2021.  As Ms Thompson outlined in her presentation, the legacy institutions and bodies which are not yet established are not likely to be established for at least two more years.  They are likely to run for at least five years from then.  As such, this work will go on well into the next decade.  It will be at least ten years.  There is a need for continued peace funding alongside that to make it happen and to support victims and survivors.  It is critical.  We welcome that comment, therefore.<\/p> <p>  On the regional trauma network, there are plans in place, as Ms Thompson outlined, to establish a mental health trauma service in the North working with health and care trusts.  It is still at an early stage of development but there was some funding through the Northern Ireland Executive before its collapse to get it set up.  There is further work to do on the cross-Border, North-South dimension.  While good work is being done at community and voluntary level with groups which are funded to do cross-Border work, work is outstanding at statutory level to set up those partnerships, North and South.  We sit on a partnership board which is overseeing the regional trauma network and we will continue to lobby hard for that cross-Border engagement.<\/p> <p>  The 150 deaths which have occurred since 1998 were raised.  We do not have a cut-off point of 1998 in the Commission.  Our legislation runs beyond that and we see many people who have been injured post-1998 and who need support and we treat them as victims and survivors.  We also work with the Commissioner for Children and Young People to provide support and develop services for younger people in particular.

While they were presented very well and in very good detail, the lack of progress is very disappointing.  In his concluding comments just now, Mr. Beggs said it would be another two years before certain bodies are established.  By definition, everyone is getting older.  The survivors and the families of those victims who lost their lives include a cohort of persons with a higher age profile.  It is most regrettable for victims, including those who still carry injuries, and families who lost loved ones that progress has not been made to date.  Naturally, as people get older their health deteriorates, which compounds the problem.<\/p><p>It is very regrettable we do not have an assembly and Executive in Northern Ireland.  Ms Thompson mentioned some of the work could be undertaken at present, but I would not have much confidence in the public service driving this type of work.  It is work that needs political leadership from both communities.  I am very much of the opinion that the maximum possible level of truth is needed regarding what went on, and the skullduggery, murder and mayhem carried out by state forces or paramilitaries.  The truth should come out.  We will never have a society at the right level of peace we need, and that we all hope for in the future, if we do not try to optimise the amount of truth we can get from people.<\/p><p> As people get older their memories fade.  At our last meeting, the commissioners for the location of victims' remains came before the committee.  They quite rightly pointed out that somebody might have what seems like a scintilla of information but which might be important, and memories fade.  I am dispirited with the lack of political momentum at Westminster and on this island on addressing these issues.  We think back to the work of Denis Bradley and Archbishop Eames some years ago.  Some aspects of it were heavily criticised, but it set out a certain format for work to be done.  That was a good eight or nine years ago.  If some work or progress had been achieved on many of the measures outlined in that programme, perhaps we would be much further down the road and in better position than we are today.<\/p><p> As a representative of Cavan and Monaghan, I am very familiar with cross-Border programmes.  It is absolutely essential that these programmes are continued.  President Juncker made some comments recently that he would be supportive of PEACE funding post-2020.  In fairness to the Chairman and members of the committee, we have engaged with Ministers from the Government and from the Northern Ireland Executive when it was in existence on the need to ensure this funding is continued to try to assist many of the communities most affected, and still are affected, by the difficulties of the era.  I wish the witnesses well with their work.  I sincerely hope we will be in a position to hear a more positive outlook.

It was crystallised further in the Haass O'Sullivan report, and what was agreed in Stormont House on these institutions, which are now in draft legislation are the accumulation of much work for a long time.  I would not say it is all water under the bridge.  I would say it has been a direction of travel.  We do have a roadmap.  In a sense, our politicians, our Government and our civic society are at a point where they just have to jump, and if we do not do it we will reap the consequences in terms of a failure in justice and in civil society.  Having said this, I am frustrated but I am not dispirited.  The people I talk to are frustrated and hurt, but they are not packing up their bags and going away, and I do not think these issues will.

This is something I deal with as my background is welfare rights.  It is having a huge effect on the population in general, but it will have a huge impact on victims and survivors where there is trauma, specific disabilities and mental health issues.  It is not about reform but cuts, with regard to the disability living allowance, DLA, and the personal independence payment, PIP, and what has been going on.  When I was in Westminster on Tuesday I met somebody who is a policy adviser to the disability groups there.  The impact it is having there is magnified in the North, in particular with regard to victims and survivors.  The system is basically ignoring some people who are severely disabled and it is important this issue is raised.  It is something that needs to be constantly raised.  We are still monitoring the impact on many people of the changeover from DLA to PIP.  Historically we in the North have had higher rates of disability anyhow, but the conflict has certainly brought about specific cases that otherwise would not have happened.

Legacy is a complex aspect of all post-conflict countries.  When we consider Rwanda, South Africa and the former Yugoslavia, I get the sense that some other countries have been more progressive than we have here.  As people wait longer and longer they go in to a different frame of mind.  The longer it goes on I believe it becomes more angry and more punitive.  They are almost looking for heads on a plate because they have been left so long.  If we could get to the basic conversation; do we draw a line under it and say there will be no prosecutions in the interest of getting to the truth and the information that would satisfy so many people?<\/p> <p>  From other legacy issue situations, such as the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the hooded men and so on, we know how the British Government has been less than forthcoming.  We have raised the issue with our own Ministers here and they say they raise it all the time but there seems to be little or no progress.  I get the impression, certainly, that we are moving backwards with the British Government in that regard.  Initially it was about the children of survivors but now we are talking about the grandchildren of survivors.  It is so unfair and it fuels disaffection and disengagement in some communities.

Last week, for example, in the Seanad I raised the issue of the Crowley report into the murder of Aidan McAnespie.  This report was carried out by the then Deputy Garda Commissioner Eugene Crowley.  The Irish Government is refusing to release the report, even up to this point, despite calls from former presidents of the GAA and from Aidan McAnespie's family.<\/p> <p>  On the broader issues, Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Brendan Smith have referred to the devolved remit.  While we all want to see a successful conclusion and outcome to the current talks, the key mechanisms around Stormont House and Fresh Start are there.  The legislative responsibility, however, for those issues rests in the first instance with the Government.  Even in the absence of an agreement around the current talks, the Government is able to legislate for, and enable, those mechanisms that everyone has broadly agreed are the best way forward at this stage.  It is useful to reflect on that.<\/p> <p>  I apologise in advance if this next question was already asked or referred to while I was out of the room.  The recent Haggarty case throws up some particularly worrying issues.  It is a concern given the alleged offences - not alleged now I suppose - of Gary Haggarty and the handling of him as a special branch agent.  There is a culpability and responsibility in respect of the consequences for those handlers outside of the political sphere.  This further reinforces the complex and comprehensive nature of legacy, truth recovery and justice for people within the judicial and legal world.  When someone who is clearly identified as a serial killer and an agent of crown forces is given such a lenient verdict in that regard, and when the people who handled him and were aware of all that go scot free, what sort of message does this send to other victims?  When we talk of trans-generational issues of concern, I imagine there is also the issue of re-traumatising victims, not just of Haggarty but also victims elsewhere who are viewing that case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018020800002#L00300","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518099000,"counter":863,"content":"<p>I will ask John Beggs to answer the questions around welfare reform because he has led the commission's work on that.

For the last five years since we heard that welfare reform is coming, the commission and some of our forum members have lobbied very hard, initially with Lord Freud, to try to reduce the impact on victims and survivors.  We are aware that over the past year or so and the next year or so, 125,000 reassessments of the move from disability living allowance, DLA to the personal independence payment, PIP, have taken place and will take place.  We are aware that one third of the population are victims and survivors so a high proportion of people who are victims and survivors who are going through those reassessments with physical injuries, mental health injuries and problems.  The commission is trying to minimise the impact on those people.  We welcome the Evason report, which put in place some mitigation measures to acknowledge the impact of the legacy and to protect victim and survivors.  We are now starting to hear evidence on the ground of individual case studies where victims and survivors are not content with the process or the outcome of the DLA to PIP reassessments.  Currently there is a call for evidence from the Department for Communities to make evidence to that and to lobby on behalf of victims and survivors.  The commission is currently doing this and we are working with a lot of groups that are funded especially to work with victims and survivors to reduce that welfare impact.  We are gathering the evidence at the moment and we hope to submit that in the next couple of months.  It is, however, a big issue of critical importance for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018020800002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Beggs"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518099000,"counter":865,"content":"<p>I will pick up on some of Senator Feighan's issues.  I spoke about different victims' voices being used to add legitimacy to divergent political views.  This ends up in a situation where it appears that the victims cannot agree and where the issue becomes a political battle on territory that is people's lives and experiences.  Often those people have said to me that \"Look, nobody spoke to me before I was used as an example of what this or that person did.\"  I believe, from my experience, that if one puts people together who have suffered harm, they will broadly agree with one another and will understand one another's experience.  For example, regardless of who they may want to see held accountable, whoever it is, it is a fair transparent and properly resourced justice system or legacy institutions that will deliver that for them.  If a person has suffered trauma, he or she wants a decent trauma network.  If a person has suffered harm and wants truth then he or she wants truth.  It does not matter who harmed the person, but it is those other things that he or she will want to have.  It is not victims and survivors who cannot agree; it is in fact a problem for victims and survivors that they become the battleground over which different political narratives are fought.  It is to the detriment of their best interests because too often, the political narratives get locked and the actual individuals who are waiting for legislation, pensions and services are still waiting.<\/p><p>It is important to stop using victims to illustrate or add weight to differing political perspectives and accept that, broadly, whether it is legislation, policy or services, what people who have been harmed want to see in place is an agreed core.  Of course, there are things on which people do not agree.  We are all different.  However, there is an agreed core and a range of options that could meet most people's needs.  What are we doing about it?  First, the forum in itself embodies that in the fact that we have brought 23 people together from completely diverse backgrounds with completely diverse experiences.  They have demonstrated the ability to engage in a respectful conversation about what they agree and disagree on and to adopt a shared position on dealing with the past.  That is a model of leadership, which is what we need to see on a broader civic level.<\/p><p> There are also some very harmful consequences of the political polarisation of the issue.  I am not pointing in any one direction &ndash; it happens across the board.  What happens is that one finds a victim constituency, which may not see itself as a constituency but may be seen that way by those outside it, being held to represent a particular political view.  Those of another view do not then respect the harm and experience of those people.  If I am not making sense there, I mean that when victims find themselves turned into an emblem or symbol for a particular political belief, they often find that people of different political beliefs are disrespectful of their experience or sometimes blame them.  That has happened to victims and survivors wherever they come from.  They would understand from each other's point of view that it is never okay to do that.  Queen's University has been doing a piece of a work for a year to which we have been connected.  It looks at what it calls \"voice, agency and blame\".  In many senses, it is unpicking some of those difficult issues.  One part of that project will involve coming up with guidelines for media and others in the public realm as to how to use and not use victims and victims' issues in the process of putting across a point of view or holding a debate.  We believe that is an incredibly important project.  The forum has been involved in it and I am encouraging other victims, individuals and groups who have been particularly upset by things that have happened over recent months to get engaged with it also.  We hope the guidelines can be something more than simple guidelines but may, in fact, be a charter we would ask people to sign up to.  It is very important to establish that victims and survivors have a lot of common ground.  That common ground is important stuff for everyone to engage with to move forward as a society.  It is not all right to derive legitimacy or impact in media or politics by using the experiences of people who will be adversely affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018020800002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Judith Thompson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518099000,"counter":867,"content":"<p>I will be brief as I have to go to another meeting.  The 150 paramilitary deaths since the Good Friday Agreement are obviously of concern.  Have these deaths occurred because a lot of the infrastructure remains in place and is being allowed to remain in place for the sake of, one cannot say \"peace\", but perhaps stability?  How much funding is required?  One can set up all the infrastructure one wants, historical investigations and information retrieval units, oral history archives, and implementation processes, but if these are starved of funding, as has happened, it is all for nothing.  It is merely press releases and agreements without implementation or the capacity to implement.  Where is the initiative on communities in transition at and is it working?  We are going to Glencree on Tuesday.  The attempt to replicate what happened in South Africa has eventually run into the sand.  Should that have stayed the course, should it be revived or is it too late?<\/p> <p>  It is 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement and we are the Good Friday implementation committee.  One of the issues I keep bringing up is that we still do not know what is left to be implemented notwithstanding our designation as the implementation committee.  What the forum is putting together is the ongoing building of the Good Friday Agreement.   It cannot stay as it was 20 years ago and it has changed over time.  Ultimately, how much money is needed &ndash; I know it is a lot - to support the next generation of victims?  As Ms Thompson pointed out, there are people who are victims of the Troubles who were not born at the time.  There is a ripple effect to the next generation.  Children and grandchildren who were not alive during the Troubles are now their victims in essence.  Is the problem a lack of funding or of will?<\/p> <p>  The historical investigations unit is interesting because pretty much no side has an interest in the truth.  There are people in every organisation with things to hide and, ultimately, those organisations which are using victims for their own ends do not want the truth to come out.  While they might want the truth to come out on one side, they do not want it to come out about what they were doing because everybody had informers inside.  If that truth comes out, how can it be managed, if at all?  The South African process is the interesting one.  Did it work?

We have held to a kind of legal framework.  There is an historical investigations unit.  It is not a truth process where someone comes in and says &ldquo;Here is the truth&rdquo;.  It is an investigation and it will be evidence based.  Broadly, that is what I hear people say.  They ask how they can know the truth of something where they ask someone for information.  They ask how would the person they asked even know, given the passage of time and people's memories.  A principle of justice and looking at the evidence and having due process is maintained while at the same time the outcome of the process, as I have said so often and as I keep saying, will not be a lot of prosecutions.  That is not going to be possible or likely.  It is a rather different process.<\/p> <p>  The other thing I note is that these things take a lot of time.  I was in Cambodia at Christmas.  Cambodia had its peace deal around the time we had ours.  It is a different society and it deals with things differently but it still has its international courts trying to deal with historic cases.  Those issues have not all gone away as one finds when one has quiet conversations with people.  I was in Bosnia last year.  One looks at the length of time the hurt and division exist.  It is dreadful to witness but in a way it tells us that we are not that unusual.  These things cast a very long shadow.  As to whether truth and reconciliation worked in South Africa, do we know yet?  It takes a while and nothing is ever perfect.  Why has it not worked in Northern Ireland?  It is because we have not done it yet.  We have done many things and many of those things have worked.  The place has changed amazingly, but we have not dealt with the past and we have not done the victims any service by failing to acknowledge some of what happened to them.  There is a toxic impact from sweeping things under the carpet and we are seeing that for individuals, for families, at a social level and for our justice system.<\/p> <p>  I was asked what it would cost.  There are two answers to that.  We do not know exactly what it would cost but if one asks the Department of Justice in the North, one finds it has done a lot of the sums.  We know &euro;150 million was promised from Westminster and we know it is not enough.  A larger sum has been mentioned.  The work is being done on that.  The other question, however, is what it costs not to do it.  A number of years ago, the criminal justice inspectorate in Northern Ireland prepared a report which is now out of date.  I am sure the figures involved have greatly increased, but at that stage, we were spending approximately &euro;30 million a year to do things that were not working.  To that one must add the current cost of judicial reviews, backlogged cases, inquests and inquiries which are, let us face it, simply existing processes into which people are trying to shoehorn themselves in the absence of access to a proper process.  If one adds up the cost of doing nothing, or doing things that do not work, over decades and sets that against the cost of the proposed institutions, the question is how one can justify not doing it, not only in financial terms but in terms of the impact on us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018020800002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Judith Thompson"},{"type":"speech","time":1518099000,"counter":871,"content":"<p>In her opening statement Ms Thompson quoted from the Good Friday Agreement: \"The achievement of a peaceful and just society would be a true memorial to the victims of violence.\"  I thank the witnesses for their invitation to meet the Victims and Survivors Forum, which the committee will certainly consider.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I call Mr. O'Gorman to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#B00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":880,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee to discuss the reclassification of AHBs or housing associations.  I am joined by Mr. Kieron Brennan, chief executive officer of Co-operative Housing Ireland, and Mr. John Hannigan, chief executive officer of Circle Voluntary Housing Association.<\/p> <p>  Housing associations include social housing providers and housing co-operatives.  We are independent, not-for-profit charities that primarily provide high quality affordable social rented housing for people on local authority housing waiting lists who cannot afford to pay market rents in the private rented sector, or purchase their own homes.  Local authorities are of the largest providers of social housing with a current housing stock of approximately 140,000 dwellings, but AHBs play an increasingly important role with a current total of approximately 30,000 dwellings.  AHBs did not run their development capacity down in the period following the financial crash.  This means that they are able to make a contribution to social housing output that is disproportionate to their size.  The current Government target for social housing output is 50,000 additional homes by 2021.  It is envisaged that AHBs will deliver one third of that figure, which will represent a major contribution to social housing output at a time it is universally accepted that we are experiencing an unprecedented shortage.<\/p> <p>  The AHB sector is very diverse.  Almost 232 bodies are registered with the regulator and they are divided into three tiers.  The 17 tier 3 AHBs, which are the largest, with between 300 and 6,000 tenancies each, account for almost three quarters of all AHB housing stock.  At the end of 2016, five of the larger bodies came together to form the Housing Alliance, which through collaborative working aims, among other things, to promote practical and innovative solutions for the enhanced development and management of social housing and affordable housing.  The five members are Cl&uacute;id Housing, Co-operative Housing Ireland, Circle Voluntary Housing Association, Oaklee Housing and Respond! Housing Association.  All members are primarily providers of general needs housing, that is, housing for people whose have a housing need but not a particular personal need such as older people or people with physical or intellectual disabilities.  Together Housing Alliance members own or lease a total of just under 16,000 dwellings, which represents more than 50% of all AHB tenancies.<\/p> <p>  In December 2017, following an investigation, the CSO announced that it would recommend to EUROSTAT that 14 of the larger AHBs should be reclassified from non-profit institutions serving households, NPISH, to the general government sector as defined in European System of Accounts, ESA, 2010.  Essentially, this means that the CSO is recommending that AHBs, which are currently off-balance sheet, will become on-balance sheet.  However, the letter from the CSO to EUROSTAT acknowledges the complexity of the case and seeks advice and guidance from it on this recommendation. The final decision on reclassification lies with EUROSTAT.  If AHBs are classified as on-balance sheet, AHB expenditure will contribute to general government debt.  Perhaps more important, because AHB expenditure will be classified as Government spending, it will compete with others for the expenditure available in fiscal space.  This could result in less money being available for AHBs to spend, with an obvious consequential reduction in social housing output by them, which, in turn, could threaten Government targets for social housing.  There will in all likelihood be other ramifications of this reclassification, which could impact negatively on the development activities of these bodies.<\/p> <p>  The Housing Alliance is heartened by statements by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, which emphasise the Government's continuing support for the AHB sector, notwithstanding the CSO's assessment.  At the same time, it is extremely important that if EUROSTAT decides that AHBs should be reclassified as on-balance sheet, it is in everyone&rsquo;s interest for steps to be taken to enable this decision to be reversed.  It is important to remember that the assessment of the classification of bodies under ESA 2010 is not a purely technical exercise but one that is judgmental in nature; indeed this is explicitly stated in the regulation.  In those circumstances, it is legitimate to examine critically the CSO's interpretation of the regulation.<\/p> <p>  The Housing Alliance has a number of concerns about the CSO analysis and we do not agree with the entirety of its assessment.  We have taken advice which suggests there are grounds for concluding that the CSO's analysis of the current situation is open to challenge and that, even in the present circumstances, AHBs should be classified as public non-financial corporations rather than the general Government sector.  Furthermore, we strongly believe that even if EUROSTAT confirms the CSO recommendation, it will be possible to reconfigure the AHB sector in such way that AHBs will be able to apply to EUROSTAT for a further reclassification back to the status of non-profit institutions serving households outside the government balance sheet.<\/p> <p>  The Housing Alliance, therefore, proposes the establishment of a working group that will focus on the reclassification issue.  The aim of the working group will be to examine the rationale for the reclassification decision and to determine what changes need to be made to put the AHB sector in a position where an application can be made for a further reclassification back to an off-balance sheet status.<\/p><p>In our view, the working group should include representatives from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Finance, the Housing Agency and representatives of larger AHBs.  We believe that the appointment of an independent chair for this working group would provide additional strength to its recommendations and would assist in a speedy conclusion.  We feel that it is important to establish such a working group as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p> It is worth noting that there is a recent precedent for this process.  In the UK, housing associations were reclassified to the general government sector in 2015.  Two years later, following structural changes made to the relationship between housing associations and Government, housing associations were reclassified again as private bodies.  Although the reasons for reclassification in England were different from the reasons given in Ireland, the UK experience demonstrates that a collaborative effort involving government, the housing association regulator and housing associations working together were able to make the changes required for reclassification to be successful.<\/p><p> The Housing Alliance believes very strongly indeed that AHBs have made a huge contribution to the development and management of high-quality social housing, and are on course to play a major role in the delivery of Government targets for social housing as set out in Rebuilding Ireland.  In the longer term, this capacity may be threatened by reclassification as on-balance sheet.  However we believe that it will be possible to put in place changes that will enable AHBs to apply with confidence to be reclassified as off-balance sheet.  It is in the common interest of Government, AHBs themselves, and people on local authority housing waiting lists that this should happen.<\/p><p> I am grateful for the opportunity to address the committee.  I and my colleagues will be pleased to answer any questions members may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian O'Gorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518082200,"counter":882,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Gorman.  I invite Dr. McManus to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#C00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":883,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members for inviting the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, to engage with the committee on what is probably the most significant issue affecting the sector in recent years.  I am CEO of the ICSH.  Accompanying me are Ms Karen Murphy, director of policy, and Mr. Gene Clayton, who is chair of the ICSH housing development and supply working group, chair of Housing Europe's internal market group and CEO of the Iveagh Trust.  We have included a number of papers on the issue which the ICSH prepared last year and since the recent CSO recommendation last December.<\/p> <p>  The ICSH is the national federation of housing associations, with over 250 members that collectively own and manage over 32,000 homes at affordable rents for families, older people, people with disabilities, the homeless and single people.  The ICSH is part of Housing Europe, the EU social housing federation, which has over 22 million homes in the social housing sector including those owned and managed by housing associations throughout Europe.  One common factor to all these jurisdictions is the presence of support from the state, direct or indirect, to house people in the social housing sector, including housing associations or approved housing bodies as they are known in Ireland.  With no state support, it is likely that many households in the social housing sector would not be housed.  We are not aware that EUROSTAT has directed other EU member states to examine classification of housing associations operating in the social housing sector.<\/p> <p>  Over the past 15 years, the approved housing body sector in Ireland has increased from just under 15,000 homes in management to over 32,000 homes in ownership and management.  Members of the ICSH range from the larger tier 3 bodies, which manage from over 300 to 5,000 homes located throughout the country with significant plans and programmes for delivery, to local and regional tier 1 and tier 2 approved housing bodies, which often provide housing and related support services to vulnerable groups in local communities, responding to specific local housing need and support services.   Therefore, there is a broad range of approved housing bodies that work in partnership with local authorities and the private sector in meeting housing need.<\/p> <p>  The boards of approved housing bodies decide on their plans in terms of delivery and output.  The highest output was previously achieved in 2009 when the sector provided 2,012 homes.  However, with the changing funding environment since then and the introduction of loan finance as a new delivery mechanism, approved housing bodies provided an estimated 2,000 plus homes in 2017 for people and families on the waiting list and in need of housing.  These homes were delivered by means of new construction, acquisition and some leasing.  It is likely that up to half of this delivery will have been in the form of new construction.  With additional vacancies that arise in the sector throughout the year, this will bring the total number of households that the sector accommodates into the region of 3,000 for 2017.<\/p> <p>  The Government's targets for delivery by AHBs indicate that up to one third of social rented homes are to be delivered by 2021 under Rebuilding Ireland.  A number of AHBs are also actively engaged to deliver affordable and cost rental housing.  Those approved housing bodies that have been using loan finance in recent years have significantly altered their organisational structure to reflect the need for finance and development expertise and have had to develop new relationships with the private sector.<\/p> <p>  The recommendation by the CSO to EUROSTAT to reclassify tier 3 bodies has caused initial concern within the sector in the context of a number of areas.  These include: the Government's commitment to support existing AHB projects in the pipeline and those under contract; meeting Government social housing targets; the implications and impact for reclassified AHBs on their ability to borrow and any new consent that may be required to borrow and function; and the proposed Bill on AHB regulation.<\/p> <p>  If EUROSTAT confirms reclassification of tier 3 bodies, as well as tier 1 and tier 2 bodies subsequently, it is important  that there be as much clarity as possible on the issues that influenced such bodies being reclassified.  Although the CSO pointed to three areas that influenced its recommendation to EUROSTAT, further clarity is still required from EUROSTAT on a number of issues.  Such clarity is essential to ensure that there is no moving of the goalposts over the coming years, with additional issues having to be addressed.  This has already been done by the CSO as recently as 2014, when it indicated that the balance of control rests with AHBs and debt financing transfers all risk to the AHB.<\/p> <p>  In the event of EUROSTAT confirming reclassification, we need a robust process that involves cross-departmental support and agreement, as well as input from the sector directly affected, to address policy and operational issues that may need amending.  The ICSH and its members have been meeting on a regular basis and would welcome the opportunity to input into this process and build on the engagement we have already had with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister.  However, there needs to be a common agreed position by all of Government on the overall strategic objective of reclassification.  The ICSH supports the position of seeking to return AHBs to an off-balance sheet status.  Such agreement across Government will then inform at an operational level what is required to effect changes.<\/p> <p>  Even focusing on the three areas the CSO identified, we believe that all these issues can be resolved.  That would allow to sector to further develop as a non-profit private institution and not as part of the local government sub-sector.  We are committed to working with all the key stakeholders to ensure there is no disruption to housing delivery, which would create uncertainty for AHBs, tenants and funders.  We hope all other stakeholders would have the same commitment.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chair and look forward to taking any questions that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal McManus"},{"type":"speech","time":1518082200,"counter":884,"content":"<p>I thank the two speakers for attending.  We have had the opportunity to read their presentations and papers.  I want to ask a number of questions to keep the focus here.  What percentage of housing associations' annual income comes from State agencies, either local or central government?  That is a really important thing for us to understand.  I would like to see some stats on it rather than just vague numbers.  Do the housing associations have other income coming in from the provision of related services, in terms of rent and other charges?  We need to break down their income.  It is an important aspect of how this is all going to be analysed.  What other forms of income are they getting outside of that?  If the witnesses cannot share that information with us today, perhaps they could provide it to the committee soon.<\/p> <p>  Will the reclassification of the AHBs have any impact on their staff's contractual arrangements?  Can the witnesses give us the specifics in that regard?  Mr. O'Gorman stated earlier that the Housing Alliance has a number of concerns about the CSO analysis and does not agree with the entirety of its assessment.<\/p><p>I share those concerns.  Mr. O'Gorman also stated: \"We have taken advice which suggests there are grounds for concluding that the CSO&rsquo;s analysis of the current situation is open to challenge and that even in the present circumstances, AHBs should be classified as public non-financial corporations rather than the general government sector.\"  That is a very profound statement.  I share the concerns of the witnesses in that regard.  Given the sensitivity of the surrounding matters, I do not know how much the witnesses can tell us about the advice and indication they are getting but the more the committee can understand about this, the better.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the enormous role played by the approved bodies in regard to housing and its significance in terms of Rebuilding Ireland.  There is no doubt that AHBs are expected to deliver on housing, be it social, affordable or the rental sector.  Approved housing bodies are key players and I would like to think that the committee will support them where possible.  However, because the issue involves from where they derive their income, it would be helpful if the witnesses could provide the committee with a very clear and detailed analysis of that income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#C00400","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":886,"content":"<p>As I stated, the decision of the CSO was based on three grounds: risk, financing and contractual arrangements with the Government.  There are significant grounds on which to challenge the CSO conclusions in terms of risk transfer and contractual arrangements.  Changes are needed to the financing aspect in order to be able to reclassify.  We need changes in historic debt.  We developed several schemes with 100% grant funding from the State, such as the capital loan and subsidy scheme, CLSS, and the capital assistance scheme, CAS, which is still in existence.  There are 100% grant-funded schemes on-balance sheet and a mechanism will have to be found to refinance them off-balance sheet.<\/p> <p>  We currently provide debt finance funding.  Most of our lending comes through the Housing and Finance Agency, which is part of government, with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, appointing members of its board and so on.  Most of the larger AHBs are currently actively working to source alternative sources of finance and are talking to banks, pension funds, credit unions and other funders in that regard.  I sympathise with the committee because this is a hugely technical issue, the full implications of which we are all grappling with because we are not absolutely sure what they will be.  We have commissioned additional consultants, economists and so on to consider the implications and ramifications of it and how we might get over them.  We will provide that information to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McManus also alluded to the possibility that a special case is being made of Ireland in this regard.  Some of the grounds relied upon by the CSO in its decision making, such as the tie-in with nominations, did not cause an issue in the case of the United Kingdom.  All our tenants are taken from local authority housing lists.  The local authority is the independent body that maintains the waiting list and there is that level of governance and oversight in order that we are not involved with the waiting lists.  We make the tenancies available and the local authority nominates tenants.  That is a good principle of good governance and oversight.  An almost identical process occurs in the United Kingdom but was never mentioned in terms of bringing them on-balance sheet.  There seems to be an inconsistency in how these judgments and decisions are made, which leads us to believe that there is much subjectivity about the reliance placed on different elements of it.<\/p> <p>  There is a challenge on the risk transfer and the contractual arrangements.  We accept that we will have to make changes in the financing regime and will be able to do so with the help of the Departments of Finance and Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We are confident that will be possible if the motivation to do so exists and, as Mr. McManus made clear, the Government clearly states it wants AHBs off balance sheet such that we are outside government but accountable to the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian O'Gorman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":887,"content":"<p>On the Senator's questions regarding income and staff contracts, the decision was in regard to 16 of the tier three large AHBs, the majority of which are general needs suppliers, as Mr O'Gorman stated.  Some other AHBs supply specialist services to people with disabilities and other groups and receive specialist funding from the Government under those schemes.  A different decision was made regarding two of those.  The main on-balance sheet decision or recommendation was in respect of AHBs supplying general needs rather than specialist services.  The two main sources of income of such AHBs are rental income from their tenants or, in our case, tenant members, and subvention via the local authorities for housing people who are on the waiting list.  We are concerned that Ireland is being singled out in so far as income derived from tenants or tenant members was accounted for as State income in this exercise.  It was calculated in that way and that is a major concern for us.<\/p> <p>  In terms of staff contracts, the CSO and others advise us that at this point the decision or recommendation that must be adjudicated upon by EUROSTAT relates only to the accounting for statistical purposes of the financial basis of AHBs, not to other contractual matters we have with third parties or to staff internally.  However, we remain open the possibility that this may change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieron Brennan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":888,"content":"<p>As regards Senator Boyhan's question on the staffing issue, there are a significant number of unknowns in respect of this issue, which is why we are asking for a cross-departmental team to be established as soon as possible to keep it on a priority footing and ensure an early timeframe for resolving the issues involving EUROSTAT possibly returning a decision confirming the CSO's recommendation and also in terms of returning the sector to its previous status of non-profit institutes serving households off balance sheet.  We must emphasise that in regard to those unknowns because we do not want any resultant uncertainty to have an impact on the delivery of housing and the decisions that are being taken at board level to ensure that we continue to ramp up delivery, as has been done in recent years.<\/p> <p>  As regards the question on the sources of income, we have over 250 members, all of whom are autonomous in terms of decision making.  Their sources of income vary but generally comprise rent from tenants, a significant amount of fundraising and income from local authorities through mechanisms such as the payment and availability agreement.  There are also specialist bodies which provide services to vulnerable tenants and receive State funds from organisations other than local authorities, such as the HSE.  In terms of the accounts of several bodies included in the CSO assessment, less than 50% of current funding in each of the bodies we looked at was State money.  Over 50% of current income came from rent in the bodies mainly providing housing whose accounts we examined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1518082200,"counter":889,"content":"<p>On a supplementary question, is Ms Murphy saying just 50% or------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#D00500","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":890,"content":"<p>Under 50% in terms of current income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1518082200,"counter":891,"content":"<p>It is just that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#D00700","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":892,"content":"<p>It varied.

I understand that EUROSTAT could make a decision by early March and the committee needs to share that concern.  People have different views of approved housing bodies.  That is fine, but up to 6,000 units will be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland by the sector in the next three years.  The redesignation, if it happens as we expect from EUROSTAT, has the potential to disrupt or undermine the delivery of a potentially significant number of those targets.  For those of us on this committee, it should be our most immediate concern.<\/p> <p>  I am also concerned because I know people only received all this information in December 2017.  The impression I am getting, and this is no criticism of the sector, is that the sector is trying to work out the implications separately from the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and Finance.  None of the three groups has all of the information themselves to answer those questions.  The proposal to have a group that sits down and gets into the technical detail, shares the information and works out the responses is not just sensible, but absolutely urgent.  I cannot stress that point enough.<\/p> <p>  I would like this joint committee to have some oversight role.  I know we do not have a statutory oversight role, but as this scenario progresses we should return to it.  We will have a problem if this results, for example, in the Government having to take very difficult decisions either to reduce targets because it does not have the fiscal space or to cut expenditure in order to maintain the targets to which it has already committed in some other area to fit within the fiscal space.  While we need to talk about the technicalities, they are the big ticket items.<\/p> <p>  What is the Irish Council for Social Housing's assessment of the impact of redesignation on the fiscal space to which Mr. Brian O'Gorman referred?  Does the ICSH have people working on the issue and can it provide information on this?  What is the level of engagement of the Irish Council for Social Housing with both the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Finance since the formal briefing with the CSO in December?  I note that the opening statement of the Department of Finance referred to not having sufficient information to deal with some of these issues, although the officials had asked other State agencies for it.  Has the Department of Finance asked either the Irish Council for Social Housing or the Housing Alliance for information on this and, if so, what information has it requested?<\/p> <p>  Let me sound a warning.  I have a gut instinct that we need to support the approved housing bodies getting back to off-balance sheet.  My only fear is that if one looks at what happened in the United Kingdom, and I know the political context and the nature of the sector is different, in order to get them back off-balance sheet, there was a fundamental change in the nature of some of those organisations.  To convince EUROSTAT that they had to get off-balance sheet, they had to become more like market operators, particularly in terms of the arms length management organisations.  That has created changes and I have a nervousness that I want to express at this point.  If the cost of redesignation and getting the AHBs off-balance sheet in any way undermines the not-for-profit voluntary sector status, and I know those present do not want to do that, it will be a problem.

We need to know what impact it will have on practical issues, for example, if there will be a new consent required to borrow money.

The people on the boards will want to know this in terms of their control.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point on the UK scenario, that was self-inflicted to some degree.  It was not driven by EUROSTAT, but by the Office for National Statistics.  In a sense, all of the arrangements they had with market rents and so forth were there long before the changes.  They were there for many years.  The UK situation did not change that much.  In a bilateral teleconference last week with the National Housing Federation in England, it said that nothing changed for those two years and, in fact, even borrowing did not change unless a body was going to raise &pound;3 billion or &pound;4 billion.  The situation in Britain was fundamentally different because it was not driven by EUROSTAT, but was an internal quasi-political issue which also encompassed the right to buy.  The parallel issue is the structure they got back.  For the past ten years, the associations in England have been going down the road of social rent, market rent and for sale.  It was before this decision.  Our sector is still primarily social housing and we try to get into cost rental and affordable rental.

Like others, I acknowledge and welcome the work the housing associations do and there is an undoubted role for them to play in the State's provision of housing.  Many would argue, myself included, that there has been an over-reliance on the AHB sector by the State in the provision of social housing.  I am also conscious of the restriction applying to AHBs whereby tenants do not have the opportunity to purchase their home at any time, which has to be addressed.  It is an aspiration that everybody should share.  Tenants should have the opportunity to turn their houses into homes and to be able to live out their lives in the communities where they were lucky enough to be afforded that opportunity.  This has resulted in an unfortunate unintended consequence.  There has been a diminution of experience and expertise in some local authorities in the provision of social housing.  The CSO judgment is a significant blow to Government policy given it has placed many of its eggs in the AHB basket.  The recommendation will reduce the Government allocation towards social housing delivery by perhaps up to 30%, at a time we are 30% behind the amount allocated by the State to social housing provision in 2008.  I challenge the Government to respond to that.<\/p> <p>  This issue also highlights the failure of the Government to be bold in seeking the funding necessary for the provision of social and affordable housing.  I have advocated on many occasions in this forum and many others for the need to put in place a funding vehicle model or construct that would circumvent EUROSTAT rules.  There are willing and able contributors to meet the 51% private funding requirement needed to do that.  Credit union representatives will appear before the committee later.  They have &euro;8 billion on deposit and the rules pertaining to how they can put that to work are stifling their ability to survive.  As they did in the past, they can assist communities and the State.  That funding should be put to work in the way they want and their communities want.  The return they get on that money does not allow them to become a viable option in the future.<\/p> <p>  I have no objection to challenging the recommendation.  I do not know if that will serve those who are in the midst of this crisis in the short term well.  Those on waiting lists cannot wait.  The CSO got it wrong previously in respect of water charges but I do not want to go over that ground.  Because of that, the AHBs and housing associations should be afforded the right to challenge the recommendation or to have those who have the power to do so to insist on that.  This should not be a waiting game.  Investors, other than those I have mentioned, including private pension funds and Irish-based funds that want to invest in our economy and our future, are willing to get involved and it will just take the will, urgency and cojones of Government to do the right thing and to overhaul the way everything is done to address this emergency the way it should be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#F00300","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":905,"content":"<p>I will respond to a few points.  With regard to the over-reliance on our sector, it should be borne in mind that social housing accounts for 10% of housing overall while AHB-owned or managed social housing accounts, in turn, for 10% of that.  Overall, it has to be acknowledged that we are a small player in the housing market.  We are not threatening any other part of the sector, unfortunately.  We need everybody firing on all cylinders to produce as many social houses as possible.  I include the private sector, the public sector and ourselves in that.  We all need to play our part.  The over-reliance has been, and continues to be, on the private sector.  We have relied too much on this sector to produce.  As Mr. McManus and Mr. O'Gorman said, the State has earmarked one third of its social housing provision for AHBs.  The largest portion of it will be constructed by the private sector via HAP and other interventions such as the recently launched enhanced leasing scheme.  While welcome, as we all want to increasing the overall stock of social housing, that is a concern.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct about the issue of tenant purchase.  It is not part of our make-up.  Co-operative Housing Ireland is a co-operative body, which is owned and controlled by its members.  They determine our policy.  However, our AHB brethren share the view that it is difficult for us to put social housing in place.  When we do - and it is with State support in many cases - we want to do that in perpetuity.  We want to create those units in order that they are continually available and can be rolled over again and again.  As Mr. Clayton said, his housing units have been rolled over for 128 years.  The committee should reflect on the social value of that.  We found when we entered this crisis in 2008 that, unfortunately, social housing stock had been reduced in the preceding years and we were caught short.  We should not want to do that again.<\/p> <p>  It is worth challenging this recommendation because the State needs complementary funding to be brought into the equation.  One of the vehicles through which that could be done is the AHB sector.  We are less attractive when we are on-balance sheet.  The rationale for using AHBs is undermined if we remain on-balance sheet.   Surely, we should try to bring as much resource into the equation as we can with the private sector doing its bit, external investment in AHBs and the State funding as much social housing as possible.  If we do not challenge and manage to reverse the recommendation, the overall resources available to deal with the social housing crisis will be reduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieron Brennan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":906,"content":"<p>The Deputy mentioned the over-dependency on the sector in recent years.  Over the past three or four years, the sector was responding to market failure.  Interventions included acquiring properties through NAMA, receivers and so forth.  AHBs used funding mechanisms such as the CALF and P&amp;A payments to provide housing, otherwise 4,000 to 5,000 people on the waiting lists would not have been housed.  That was more of a pragmatic solution.  There was a major market failure and there were opportunities for the sector to avail of.  We tried to cobble together different financial mechanisms with different institutions and they worked in some cases but it was tortuous to go through that.  It was not a clean ride.  People worked together, new funding arrangements were put in place and new experience was built up.  We responded to the market failure, which had gone on for a number of years, but we had to do that as a country.<\/p><p>Those will be under construction for a while and it will take a couple of years to put them in place.

As Mr. Brennan mentioned, in respect of the Government's numbers under Rebuilding Ireland, the bulk of supply will come through the private sector.  Local authorities are dominant in the social housing sector and two thirds will come from that side.  We hope that will speed up in terms of on-site building.  We are not trying to replace local authorities, but are playing our part in different ways.  That may result in seven different funding regimes.  Bringing in non-Government finance has been a major issue over the past couple of years.<\/p><p> We have had experience in the sector and quite a bit of money has come into it.  Last week, the Central Bank gave approval for credit unions to provide finance to the sector.  We have worked with credit unions for a number of years on the mechanisms around that.  We now have approval from the Central Bank to fund some AHBs, but there has been a reclassification.  It is ironic.  A lot of work has been done with the credit union sector to get finance into the sector and the Central Bank has given support, with limitations.  Credit union finance is almost seen as public money.<\/p><p> It is ironic that much work was done to bring credit unions into the sector, but there has now been a negative reclassification from the bodies who could use the funding in the first place.

This essentially boils down to the impact of EU fiscal rules on our housing crisis.  We sat here a year and a half ago when the first thing the new D&aacute;il did was to establish a housing and homelessness committee.  I was happy with many things in the report.  However, the fiscal rules are central to why we are not making progress on the housing crisis, something which was not adequately dealt with in the report<\/p> <p>  The 2012 Stability and Growth Pact means that Government debt cannot be more than 60% of GDP and our deficit cannot be more than 3%.  For that reason, our Government decided to make an important change in social policy, one which will be studied in the future by sociologists and academics.  It switched from councils building houses to approved housing bodies, so much so that the stock has tripled, as stated in the presentation, and it is envisaged in Rebuilding Ireland that housing bodies would provide up to one third of the public housing stock.  This matters because the Government has decided to switch in order to bypass the EU rules and to try to find an off-balance sheet mechanism.  The Government tried a conjuring trick and has been found out.  With all due respect, how can anybody claim that something is not on the balance sheet when it is almost exclusively financed by Government?  My concern is ensuring that the housing crisis is addressed.  <\/p> <p>  Another secondary consideration of the Government is that it is not particularly interested in having councils building houses to the same extent.  I have found that when one is a tenant of a housing body, one is not a tenant of the council and does not have the same representation and ability to have councillors batting on one's behalf.  I wonder what the point of having councillors is given the current situation in respect of Irish Water and housing.  I do not know what they will do apart from deal with lampposts.  This is a serious issue.  Tenants do not enjoy the same rights as those who have council members fighting for them. <\/p> <p>  Finance is now a major barrier to resolving the housing crisis.  The problem with housing bodies is the volume of houses they can build.  In days gone by, councils could build hundreds of thousands of houses quite quickly.  Housing bodies tend to build 20 or 60 houses at a time.  We need much more volume to resolve the housing emergency.<\/p> <p>  EUROSTAT may find that this is on balance sheet.  It raises the question of what the Government will do if that is the finding.  In recent times, the EU has been portrayed as a friend of Ireland given the Brexit situation.  However, it is preventing us from dealing with our housing situation.  We have money and do not have to borrow.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund could solve the housing crisis, but we are prevented from using the money.  It is quite shocking how little attention has been given to this by the media because it is one of the key issues.<\/p><p>One cannot resolve the housing emergency through using housing bodies because we need scale and speed, and I mean no offence to any of the people gathered here.  <\/p><p> Let us say EUROSTAT says we are on-balance sheet.  Will the Government and the Department of Finance seek a derogation from the EU rules?  Will they seek an emergency meeting with the EU to explain to it that we have a serious housing emergency and, therefore, must breach the rules?  If one had a Government that was willing to do so then it should go ahead and breach the rules because it is more important to build houses for the people who need them.  This is an important discussion.  The shift to try to move away from councils has now been exposed.  This aspect must be seriously considered if EUROSTAT says the illusive off-balance sheet model does not work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#G00500","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":913,"content":"<p>I will respond to the last point and one other one and my colleagues and others will respond to the rest of the questions.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the perception that there has been a move away from the local authority sector, the reality is we are still a very small player.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal McManus"},{"type":"speech","time":1518082200,"counter":914,"content":"<p>I mean it will be one-third of public housing.

The work evolved over the years where housing associations provided mixed housing for people with special needs, which the sector excelled in.  There was also family housing provided in mixed communities.  That has been another option and is not an either-or situation.<\/p> <p>  As I have said to Deputy Cowen, the sector has played its part.

Some of the things that we have talked about today just need to be agreed and worked forward.  The cross-departmental group is a key issue.  Having the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government involved in discussing a regulator for housing bodies, HBs, is really important.       <\/p> <p>  The Government must give a commitment to continue with the funding processes that they have in place until we know exactly where we stand and until we have something that definitively says what we are.

There must be continuation until we are clear about the implications and know what is required.

Having a Government commitment on a cross-party basis is critical for success.  Part of the reason the UK has been successful is due to securing cross-party agreement.  We need such agreement as a sector and from a housing perspective.  We need that agreement to ensure that the people who are on a social housing waiting list receives the houses.

In many cases, we work very well with local authorities.<\/p> <p>  On the point made about representations, Co-operative Housing Ireland receives representations and deals with them, as one would expect, very seriously and promptly.  As a co-operative body, we also have many of our member tenants on our governing structure.  In fact, the majority of our board is composed of tenant-members.  Therefore, the tenant-member viewpoint is heavily represented in our structure, as it should be.<\/p><p>Mr. Hannigan made a good point.  The reversal of the UK decision was wholly dependent on the co-operation of the state sector with various departments, the AHB sector and others, which all came together to overturn the decision, and we need a similar response.  The establishment of an interdepartmental group is urgently needed.<\/p><p> Land was mentioned and this is a critical issue.  AHBs are dependent on the State, local authorities and others for land and every piece of land is under development, of one kind or another.  Aside from this issue, by the end of this year the ability of AHBs to deliver will be affected by a lack of availability of land.  It is another example of dependence in the AHB sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieron Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":921,"content":"<p>A question was asked about scale and about the size of some schemes, with some coming in at between 20 and 30 units.

I am accompanied by my colleague, Gillian Roche.<\/p> <p>  On 20 December 2017, the CSO briefed the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Irish Council for Social Housing and 15 of the tier 3 approved housing bodies, AHBs, of the outcome of our review of the classification of these AHBs in the national accounts.  The CSO decision was that 14 of the 15 organisations should be reclassified in their entirety onto the State balance sheet and that the housing-related activity of the 15th should be classified in the Government sector.  Documentation setting out this decision was sent on 20 December 2017 to EUROSTAT, the final arbiter in respect of such classification decisions.  The documentation was subsequently published on the CSO website with redaction, where necessary, for statistical confidentiality.<\/p> <p>  The review was undertaken by the Government accounts division of the CSO.  Such classification reviews form a key part of the work of compiling Government finance statistics and the excessive deficit procedure notification for Ireland.  The legally-binding accounting rules, which must be used by all EU countries for producing these statistics, are set out in the European system of accounts 2010, ESA 2010.  The EUROSTAT Manual on Government Deficit and Debt, MGDD, provides further guidance on the implementation of ESA 2010 for Government finance statistics.  The classification review was undertaken following the ESA 2010 rules and the guidance of the MGDD.<\/p> <p>  Up to now, the AHBs have been classified in the national accounts as non-profit institutions serving households.  This means that they were considered both non-market and under private control.  It is the control issue which determines whether non-market bodies are classified in the non-profit sector or the Government sector.  Control of a non-profit institution is assessed using five criteria: the appointment of officers, provisions of an enabling instrument or statute, contractual agreements, degree of financing and risk exposure of Government.  ESA 2010 notes that in most cases a number of indicators will collectively indicate control and that a decision based on these indicators will necessarily be judgmental in nature.  An earlier review of the AHBs in 2014, which was the time of the changeover to ESA 2010, focused on their legal structure and internal governance and had concluded that they should remain classified as non-profit bodies, pending further developments in social housing initiatives.  This conclusion was communicated to EUROSTAT in 2014.<\/p> <p>  Following discussions on housing initiatives between the Irish authorities and EUROSTAT in late 2016, the latter requested the CSO to revisit the classification of the AHBs.  It advised that the role and impact of Government financing on the activity of AHBs should be given greater weight in the classification decision than had been the case at the time of the 2014 review.  The Departments of Finance and Housing, Planning and Local Government were advised of this request as was the Irish Council for Social Housing.<\/p> <p>  During the January 2017 excessive deficit procedure dialogue visit to Ireland, the classification of the AHBs was further discussed between EUROSTAT and the Irish authorities, namely, the CSO and the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform.  Arising from this visit, EUROSTAT made the review of the AHB classification a formal action point for the CSO.<\/p> <p>  The review was carried out using the normal procedures for such classification work, namely: developing a further understanding of the sector; gathering relevant documentation; and a structured analysis of the information compiled, leading to a conclusion regarding the relationship between AHBs and Government.  The information-gathering phase of the work included: a review of legislation, Government circulars, conditions of funding schemes, the governing documentation of the organisations concerned, research and policy analysis documents and general reports on the activity of the AHB sector; analysis of contractual arrangements, organisational structures and funding mechanisms; and consultation with key organisations including the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the interim regulator and the AHB sector.  Following this phase, a structured analysis of the information compiled against the control criteria of ESA 2010 was undertaken for each AHB.<\/p> <p>  The assessment process was not straightforward.  The AHB sector comprises a variety of organisation types and the funding schemes are complex in nature.  The AHBs have a substantial amount of autonomy in their governing structures, which are comprised of private individuals.  Also, they control their own membership and rules of association, therefore, an assessment of control via the appointment of officers or through enabling instruments shows no evidence of control by Government.  However, these considerations must be balanced against the AHBs&rsquo; high level of dependence on Government financing and the conditions attached to that financing.  Specifically, Government prescribes the form and governance required for voluntary housing bodies to hold AHB status and, therefore, to access funding.  The decision regarding whether to grant AHB status is dependent on a local authority assessment that a newly-created AHB would be meeting a need that is not already being addressed in their area.  When deciding on whether to support an AHB application for funding the local authority decision takes account of the overall delivery of housing services in the geographic area under its remit.  The local authority must be satisfied that the housing project will make a useful contribution to the relief of housing need in the relevant area.  The management of the assignment of AHB status and of the granting of funding demonstrates recognition by Government of its responsibility in this area, which is being met through the AHB sector.  Other considerations in the granting of AHB status include the number of AHBs already operating in a particular area and their capacity to provide other community-based services, such as meals on wheels, recreational and social services.  In addition, a review of relevant policy documentation in the area of social housing demonstrates Government&rsquo;s intention of a central role for the AHB sector in social housing policy and provision.  All of these issues are relevant to the statistical assessment of control under the criteria of financing, contractual agreements and risk exposure of Government.<\/p> <p>  Taking the matter of financing, up to 2016, the AHBs reviewed could be seen to be almost exclusively financed by Government.  At the end of 2015, less than 1% of their total capital funding came from non-Government sources.  For 2016, the corresponding proportion remained very low at approximately 1.5%.  The funding from Government was provided under three schemes: the capital loan and subsidy scheme, CLSS; the capital assistance scheme, CAS; and, more recently, the capital advance leasing facility, CALF.  Following an assessment of the conditions of these schemes, the CSO concluded that the schemes indicated control of the AHBs under the contractual agreement and risk exposure criteria, specifically control by local government.  Key considerations in this decision were the requirement for a minimum of 75% of tenants to be drawn from the housing list of the relevant local authority; the role of the local authority in rent setting; the specification of design and build criteria in the case of CAS and CLSS; and Government exposure to risk through the requirement for the local authority to be a party to lending agreements between the AHB and third-party lenders under the CALF scheme.<\/p><p> Overall, taking account of all these considerations, the CSO formed the view that the AHBs relationship with local government through the procedures and contracts for the granting of, first, AHB status and, subsequently, capital funding were such as to indicate control.  Therefore, on balance, the CSO assessed the AHBs to be under public rather than private control.  Being non-market in nature, this requires the AHBs to be classified in the Government sector.  This decision is with EUROSTAT - the final arbiter on such matters - and it has indicated its agreement with the CSO decision.  Formal confirmation is expected in the coming weeks.  It is our intention to reflect this decision in the forthcoming excessive deficit procedure notification to EUROSTAT at the end of March.  The CSO will continue to review the classification of the remaining AHBs during 2018.  Ms. Gillian Roche is in charge of Government finance statistics and is here to answer questions on the procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Morrin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518082200,"counter":931,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Morrin and call Mr. Smith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#L00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":932,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, I thank the Chairman and members for inviting us to attend in order to discuss the issue of reclassification by the CSO of AHBs from non-profit institutions serving households to being part of the local government sector for Government accounting purposes.<\/p> <p>  I am from the housing funding mechanisms unit in the Department which is the main unit interacting with the CSO on this matter.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Murray, who is head of the social housing leasing unit which, among other matters, oversees the Department&rsquo;s capital advance leasing facility and payment and availability funding framework available to AHBs for social housing.  We are part of two divisions within the Department that are responsible for developing policy and overseeing its implementation on housing, including social housing.<\/p> <p>  The situation regarding the demand for and provision of social housing is set out in the recently-published summary of social housing assessments.  The assessments show that progress is being made in tackling the existing housing shortage and meeting the social housing needs of eligible households on local authority waiting lists.  However, the Department also acknowledges the significant challenges we continue to face in meeting housing needs and providing social housing for those on housing waiting lists, as well as ensuring a wider housing supply across all tenures, particularly at affordable prices to purchase and rent.<\/p> <p>  The Government has responded to this challenge with the Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  The plan, which was revised by the Government last year, has set ambitious targets under five pillars, including the provision of 50,000 additional social housing units by the end of 2021, through building new homes, acquisitions, filling voids and leasing.  On foot of the additional &euro;500 million capital resources secured in budget 2018 and the mid-term review of the capital plan, the revised target figures are 40,000 new builds, acquisitions or voids and 10,000 under leasing arrangements.<\/p> <p>  Under the plan, the AHBs have an important role to play in providing homes for those in need of social housing, both through new social housing stock as well as through leasing arrangements.  The objective is for them to provide approximately one third of the new social housing homes under the action plan.  The AHBs have already played a significant role, as they have provided 3,490 out of the almost 12,800  new social housing homes provided under the plan in the past two years.  As the Minister announced at the recent housing summit, while we expect that a greater percentage of new house-building will be undertaken by local authorities in future, in accordance with targets set for each of them last month, the AHBs will continue to have an important partnership role with local authorities in the provision of social housing.<\/p> <p>  Following the CSO's review of the AHB sector in 2014, that office undertook a further review, at the request of EUROSTAT, in October 2016.  To assist this review, the Department was requested to submit information regarding the governance and funding of AHBs and the relationship between the sector and the Department and local authorities.  The Department and the interim AHB regulator, which is based in the Housing Agency, actively engaged with the CSO in this work to gather information to inform the review and address any queries comprehensively.  We provided detailed responses to these requests.  We also met the CSO on a number of occasions to clarify any issues arising from the information we submitted.<\/p> <p>  Mindful of the CSO's independence in making decisions on such matters, the Department strongly put forward the view that AHBs are independent private bodies and that the basis on which they operate has not substantially altered since the previous review in 2014.  While a particular emphasis was placed by the CSO and EUROSTAT on the levels of State funding being provided to AHBs, the Department emphasised that other factors also need to be considered in testing whether the Government exercises effective control over the operations of AHBs, namely: that AHBs decide their own strategic and management priorities; that the boards of the bodies make the decisions on entering contracts and taking out loans and bear the risk of developing new projects; that, by definition, to be approved as an AHB, a body must be a limited company or a society registered or a trust incorporated under the Charities Acts; AHBs register their tenancies with the Residential Tenancies Board in the same way as private for-profit landlords, which is unlike the situation applying to local authority tenancies; and AHBs are responsible for all matters of management and maintenance of their properties.  It does not fall to the State to address any action taken by the tenant for redress taken against an AHB.<\/p> <p>  The CSO has now made a decision and has submitted it to EUROSTAT for final determination.  Following an initial outline briefing of the CSO's decision and rationale before Christmas, the Department received the redacted version of the submission from the CSO to EUROSTAT on 15 January.  We have been examining this documentation in detail in order to precisely understand the basis on which the decision was made and assess the full implications of it.<\/p> <p>  As no doubt our colleagues from the Department of Finance will indicate to the committee, the initial assessment is that all expenditure by the 14 of the 16 tier 3 AHBs that have been reclassified will in future count as expenditure in the local government sector.  Any borrowing by the reclassified bodies will count as part of general Government debt.  In financial terms, an initial rough estimate is that in regard to the social housing building and acquisition programme it would add, on average, approximately &euro;250 million each year to general Government expenditure figure, to be counted in the local government area.  This would not, as far as we understand it, have any impact on the Exchequer figure but would be captured in the wider local government expenditure figure.  I stress that this is very much a provisional figure and we still have a good deal of work to do to fully calculate the financial estimates and impacts within the sector. <\/p> <p>  In view of the potential consequences of this decision and the prospect that borrowing and expenditure for the provision of social housing by AHBs could now count as being on the Government&rsquo;s balance sheet, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has signalled his intention to set up a cross-departmental, cross-agency working group to: assess fully the potential fiscal impact of reclassification in the context of the commitment to deliver 50,000 new social housing homes under the Rebuilding Ireland action plan; and report on the implications for Government expenditure and borrowing, with a view to identifying what measures can be taken in mitigation, given that the planned delivery of social housing will not change.  The group, which will be made up of officials from my Department and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, along with representatives from the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency, will report back to Government within a short timeframe.  It is important that the working group also engages with the AHB sector in the course of its deliberations to ensure that there is a full understanding of impacts while at the same time following through on projects committed to and being advanced in 2018 and beyond.  The Minister has communicated to both the local authorities and the AHB sector that this accounting issue will not affect his ambitious plans under Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I hope this provides a useful summary of the issue and both Ms Nina Murray and I are happy to provide any clarifications or answer any questions that members may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Smith"},{"type":"speech","time":1518082200,"counter":933,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Smith.

First, I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. McDonagh, who heads up the statistical unit in the Department.  I have circulated a short presentation and I want to highlight the Department's role in this area.  Essentially, it is twofold.  First, we are responsible for compiling general Government expenditure and revenue forecasts.  The CSO, represented by our colleagues on my left, compile the outturn.  We compile forecasts and they are required, under EU legislation, for the stability programme, which is published every April, for the summer economic statement, for the budget and for the so-called draft budgetary plan.  Our second role is to provide advice to other Departments on proposed policies and their statistical classification, and so forth.  The framework is the so-called European system of accounts 2010 which is the legal framework across the EU.<\/p><p>Regarding our interface with the CSO, we, in conjunction with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, provide data to the CSO for compiling the outturn and calculating the current year forecasts, which are included in the twice-yearly excessive deficit procedure, EDP, notification.  We do not have any direct interactions with EUROSTAT.  The CSO is the primary interface with EUROSTAT in this country.  I stress that the Department of Finance always respects the statistical independence of the CSO, and this is enshrined in law.  We use the register of public sector bodies within general Government, which is compiled, maintained and published by the CSO.<\/p><p> Moving on two slides, what does the reclassification mean?  It means, from a public finance perspective, our medium-term forecasts will have to include the expenditure by AHBs.  Obviously, this expenditure will worsen the general government balance.  Revenues to the AHBs from third parties will improve the general government balance.  Borrowing from private sources by AHBs will increase general government debt because it is within the general government boundary.  We are examining data to assess this impact and working with the Housing Agency, our colleagues on my right in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the CSO.  We also participate in some of the working groups Mr. Smith mentioned.<\/p><p> In the final two graphs I wanted to show the committee the position regarding the general government sector.  As the committee can see, it is quite complicated.  General government accounting is not for the faint-hearted, as members can imagine.  Before this decision, AHBs were classified outside the general government boundary.  Moving to the next slide, the committee can see they are now within the general government boundary.  This means that flows between the local authority and the AHBs must be consolidated.  Expenditure by AHBs, as I mentioned, is now classified as general government, GG, expenditure, and revenue from non-GG bodies is classified as general government revenue.  As I mentioned earlier, debt raised by non-GG bodies is counted towards general government debt.  By way of a quick overview on the public finance implications, I will leave it at that.  I hope Mr. McDonagh and I can answer members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518082200,"counter":936,"content":"<p>If we were confused beforehand, that graph has us even more confused now-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#M00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":937,"content":"<p>Indeed<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1518082200,"counter":938,"content":"<p>-----but I thank Mr. McCarthy for showing it to us anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#M00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518082200,"counter":939,"content":"<p>Deputy Maria Bailey resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1518082200,"counter":940,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for coming before the committee.  Before I ask a number of general questions, I want to ask Mr. Smith about two or three issues regarding his statement before the committee.  On page 3 of his statement, he states: \"the Department [has] received the redacted version of the submission from the CSO to Eurostat on 15th January\" and that the Department has \"[examined] this documentation in detail in order to precisely understand the basis on which the decision was made and assess the full implications of it.\"  At some point, again, given the sensitivities of this, would Mr. Smith be in a position to make his assessment available to the committee?  It is important.  I acknowledge there is a process, but he might just consider this and give us his view.  Further down the page, Mr. Smith tells us that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, \"has signalled [he uses the word \"signalled\" ] his intention to set up a cross-Departmental, cross-Agency working group\" to look at this issue.  Mr. Smith might just tell us when this will happen if he knows.  He has outlined the kind of people within the Department who may be involved in this.  I appeal to him, possibly through the Minister, to pass the message on, respectfully, that the AHB sector should be involved directly in this process.  It should not only be a consultee.  It is a critical part of the process.  Mr. Smith himself acknowledges the sector has a greater understanding.  We have heard from representatives of the sector this morning.  They have an amazing understanding because they work in this business all the time.  I therefore ask that the Minister, perhaps through a conversation with Mr. Smith, consider appointing a member of the AHB, nominating someone from that sector to sit on this cross-party group.  We also need a timeframe for this.  That is urgent.  It is interesting that one of the remits of this committee, as I understand it, is to assess fully the potential impact on the 50,000 new houses to be built under Rebuilding Ireland.  That is what Mr. Smith's opening statement tells us.  Page 4 tells us, \"Minister Murphy has communicated to both the local authorities and the AHB sector that this accounting issue will not affect his ambitious plans under Rebuilding Ireland.\"  On page 3 we are told there is an objective for the committee to examine its impact on the reclassification, and on page 4 we are assured by the Minister that it will not have an impact.  These are very different views.  I ask Mr. Smith to address this in his response.<\/p> <p>  I now move to my general questions for all the witnesses.  I will read them out in the order in which I have them written down.  First, can the witnesses explain why EUROSTAT chose Ireland over and above any other country?  We saw earlier in papers that were presented to us comparisons with other parts of Europe.  I ask the witnesses to talk to us about this.  Second, what effect does the Department believe the reclassification will have on the AHBs securing finance into the future?  Third, when did the Department first become aware of the possibility of the AHBs being brought on balance sheet, and what steps have been taken for this eventuality?  To wrap up, one of the most important matters is the local government auditing service.  The local government auditing service published a report, No. 29, on the oversight role of local authorities in the provision of social housing by approved housing bodies in December 2015.  The report made 13 recommendations regarding the AHB sector.  Can the Department or anyone else here provide an update on these 13 recommendations?  I know we are short for time but I ask the witnesses to give us a commitment to look at this and come back to the committee with some kind of written response.  I would be very interested in looking at the follow-up to these 13 recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#M00500","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1518082200,"counter":941,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Smith wish to answer a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#M00600","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":942,"content":"<p>Yes.

If we require further clarification on any issues as we work through this, we will go back to the CSO and ask it to clarify matters.  It is also important, in the context of the proposed working group, that we examine all these issues.  The point we are making is that it is important for us to understand how best we can advance the policy, the Government's action plan, and that we understand fully the implications of this decision, both its fiscal impact and the impact on Government expenditure and borrowing.  I am just reiterating what the Minister has clearly stated, that is, that it is his intention to ensure that the Government's action plan is fully implemented and that we achieve the 50,000 target by the end of 2021.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the make-up of the working group, it is important we have a small working group that can work through the technical issues on this.

It would seem that maybe the game is up on that now.<\/p><p>I wanted to raise a number of issues with the Department about the EU fiscal rules.  Some of these points came up in the special committee on housing and homelessness.  Has there been any movement on them in the 18 months since that committee sat?  <\/p><p>The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, told the housing committee that following the referendum in 2012, the European fiscal rules are constitutional.  He said: <\/p><blockquote>We do not have a shortage of money [for housing].  We have almost balanced the budget and can borrow money. [...]  We would get the money at less than 1% for ten years.  The key problem is not a shortage of money.  We can raise the money. [...]  The problem is that it goes on the balance sheet and then we break the fiscal rules and the expenditure ceilings.  <\/blockquote> <p>That is the Minister for Finance himself explaining how the EU fiscal rules are a problem for us resolving our housing crisis.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, wrote to the European Commission complaining that the EU rules to classify certain investments were posing a significant threat to the ability to fund major projects in housing, transport and water.  The Opposition spokesperson for housing also agreed they were a problem.<\/p><p>The report of the committee on housing and homelessness called on the Government to seek flexibility.  To me, that is very weak.  Has the Department of Finance or the leading civil servants in it made any efforts to talk to the Government and persuade it to seek a derogation from these EU fiscal rules to solve our housing emergency?  Have we held any meeting with the EU at any level to say that Ireland has a housing problem and we need to break these rules?<\/p><p>The labyrinthine diagram that the witness showed us is like the &quot;tangled web we weave,&quot; as the poem states.  Everything is being done to try to find this elusive off-balance sheet model and it would seem now that the ploy of using approved housing bodies rather than local authorities could be called out by EUROSTAT.  We will wait and see.  It is a delay and a barrier to resolving the housing crisis.  The Department's civil servants should be talking to the Government about it.  <\/p><p>If the approved housing bodies do not prove to be a mechanism for funding social housing, approximately what amount of money is left in the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund?  This is a fund from which we do not have to borrow and to which the taxpayers contributed over the years.  Most of it was used to bail out the banks and is gone.  There was up to &euro;7 billion when the last Government came into office but I think it might be down to about &euro;4 billion now.  Perhaps the Department officials could clarify that point.  Is that not the pot of gold we need to solve the housing crisis?  The barrier to it is the EU fiscal rules.  There should be much more attention focused on this.  The EU is now posing as our great friend in the negotiations over Brexit.  If it is our great friend, are we now seeking its permission to use money that we actually have?  That is what we should be using to build houses rather than trying to find other ploys through approved housing bodies that have not got the means or wherewithal to build on the scale and at the speed that we need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#N00600","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":956,"content":"<p>First, I do not agree with the view that the fiscal rules constrain any form of expenditure.

Has it done that in writing?  He also said the CSO expects EUROSTAT to confirm that publicly in the coming weeks.  Can he confirm that?  The approved housing bodies mentioned some inconsistencies between the CSO's recommendation and, for example, the similar recommendations in regard to the UK, particularly in terms of nominations off the housing list.  Will the CSO witnesses comment?<\/p> <p>  For me, the aspect of the CSO's recommendations which was the least clear, although I understand it because Ms Roche very helpfully explained it to me before Christmas, was in regard to recommendation E on the risk of exposure of Government.  Will the witnesses explain that in plainer English for the benefit of the committee so we fully understand it, and for the record?<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of points for Mr. Smith and Ms Murray.  As it will also be relevant to the questions I ask Mr. McCarthy, I am interested to know the estimated cost of the availability agreements last year or this year from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to the approved housing bodies sector, so that figure would be helpful.  After the Department received the news in December of the CSO's recommendations, has it corresponded directly with EUROSTAT or the CSO to question, challenge or argue against the recommendations?  Has its consideration up to this point really been what to do following the decision by EUROSTAT?<\/p> <p>  I will come back to Mr. McCarthy again when he begins to answer my questions.  When we invited him here today, there were two things we were hoping he could do, and neither of those was for him to explain to us what his role is, because we understood that before he came in to us today, although his explanation was very welcome.  The two things are as follows.  We are trying to get our heads around the impact of redesignation of the fiscal space for this year and next year.  I know Mr. McCarthy will not be able to give me fine-tuned calculations but we want a rough idea.  If we start with the figure Mr. Smith mentioned, somewhere in the region of &euro;250 million will be borrowed by approved housing bodies this year to meet the Rebuilding Ireland targets.  The bulk of that is from the Housing Finance Agency but some will be from private sources.  We know all of that is going to go on the debt end, and that is relatively uncontentious.  However, what we are trying to understand is what would be the impact of that &euro;250 million this year on the expenditure side of the fiscal space.  My understanding - correct me if I am wrong - is that this &euro;250 million, because it would be capital investment in the Government sector, for accounting purposes would be smoothed over the four years, so we are talking about &euro;62.5 million of fiscal space this year.  Hopefully, Ms Murray is going to give us the figure of what potentially could be netted out of that figure from the transfers from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government through the availability agreement to the approved housing bodies.<\/p> <p>  Am I right in thinking we are going to need somewhere below that &euro;62.5 million of fiscal space this year?  If that is the case, what are the options available to Government for dealing with that?  Mr. McCarthy said we cannot use the capital investment provisions of the rules.  Will he explain that?  He talked about a structural reform clause.  Will he explain whether that is something different?  If there is an amount of fiscal space needed this year, whether it is &euro;20 million, &euro;40 million or &euro;60 million, what tools are available to Government to meet that, first, on the rules side, or is it simply the case that if there is &euro;20 million, &euro;40 million or &euro;60 million needed this year, the Government just has to revisit the budget decisions of October and decide that if it is going to spend that, it cannot spend something else?  Notwithstanding the fact there is the increased fiscal space from 2019 in the order of &euro;3 billion plus, as mentioned by Mr. McCarthy, if the approved housing bodies sector has to borrow the &euro;250 million fresh each year to meet its targets, then there is an accumulative fiscal space requirement in regard to meeting the targets the Minister has said he definitely wants to meet.  This year it could be &euro;20 million, &euro;40 million or &euro;60 million but, next year, that doubles and it then trebles.  While it might not be a huge deal this year or even next year, it is significant.<\/p> <p>  If any of what I have said is incorrect, I am looking for Mr. McCarthy to clarify it because this committee needs to have a sense of what is the quantum of fiscal space required and what are the policy options the Government has at its disposal to try to tackle that, particularly this year and next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018020800002#O01100","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518082200,"counter":974,"content":"<p>I will take Deputy &Oacute; Broin's first question and Ms Roche will take the other two.

I will make the opening submission on behalf of the ICCL.  My colleague, Dr. O'Rouke, and I will answer any questions that members of the committee may have subsequently.<br\/><br\/>We thank the chairman and members of the committee for inviting us to make a presentation on what we believe is a very important matter of public interest.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties is concerned about the public services card system as it has been extended and we wish to put before members our concerns.  We sent a written submission to the committee secretariat.<br\/><br\/>We are approaching this issue primarily from the perspective of the right to privacy as is provided under the Irish Constitution, under the European Convention on Human Rights and under international law.  This right under international human rights laws is not absolute.  States may interfere with personal privacy in certain circumstances in the public interest, but certain standards have to be met.  First, any such interference by the State should be based in law, which should be clear and accessible.  Any interference should be necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, and it should be proportionate to the aim that is being pursued.  Both with regard to the legal basis for the public services card and whether it is necessary or proportionate, there are reasons to believe that it does not meet those tests.  We have identified a number of risks from the security perspective that are presented by the type and form the scheme has taken.<br\/><br\/>In our submission we provide some background information as to what is the public services card, PSC, system.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection provided an information guide in October last year which contains some very useful information about the details of the scheme, but I will not rehearse them.  It would, of course, have been much more desirable if this information had been put in the public domain before the introduction of the scheme or before the Government presented its eGovernment strategy.  It is notable that this information was only made public around the same time the Data Protection Commissioner announced an investigation into the legal basis of the scheme.<br\/><br\/>The scheme, we believe, is now compulsory in all key characteristics because it is deemed to be essential or necessary to access fundamental State services.  During the course of 2018, as it is extended as the only acceptable form of authentication of identity for a driver's licence and a passport in addition to existing provisions for social protection payments, we will see something that is mandatory and compulsory in all essential characteristics as is ordinarily understood by the people.  That presents a particularly intense interference with privacy rights.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that the public services card has been declared now as the only acceptable form of verification for the following services: child benefit, social welfare payments, school transport, treatment benefits, driver licence applications, age verification, school grant appeals, health and revenue portals, student grants from later this year, and we understand farm grants through the <i>agfood.ie<\/i>range of services.  We believe that by extending the range of public services for which this is the only acceptable form of identity, this is a fundamental change in the nature and quality of the scheme.  It is materially different from the scheme as introduced in 2005.  We believe that represents a significant public policy change and in line with the provisions of the Irish Constitution, significant changes in public policy should be provided for in primary legislation and should be debated by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That has not happened in this case.  That goes to the heart of what we mean by saying there is no legal basis for this scheme.<br\/><br\/>The Government's information guide cites a number of legal provisions, particularly relating to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  We have a number of qualified lawyers working in our organisation and we have struggled to identify a clear picture of where the social welfare Acts currently stand.  There is no available consolidated Act, which is probably a matter of greater public concern than just in relation to this specific issue, given the central importance of the social welfare code to a significant proportion of our population.<br\/><br\/>It is very difficult to get a clear and transparent picture of what the social welfare code currently provides in this regard.  I will give some examples.  There are three key provisions in the Social Welfare Act which the Government relies on in stating that it is a legal basis for the public services card.  Sections 241 and 242 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 has been amended 31 times in the intervening period as far as we can assess.  Section 247 of the Act has been amended 35 times and section 263 has been amended eight times.  It is almost impossible for a member of the public to be able to see clearly what the law states on this issue.  This is why, in October 2017, the Data Protection Commissioner announced a formal investigation into the lawfulness of the public services card and highlighted issues that are not yet resolved, including biometric data processing and governance and data issues associated with the interplay between the public services card, the public service identity set,<i>mygov.ie<\/i>, single customer views and infosys, which are all the different technical components of the system.<br\/><br\/>As we reach a key phase in the extension of the scheme, particularly with the extension to the driver licence system in March of this year, as scheduled by the Government, and the passport system in the fourth quarter of this year, also as provided under the eGovernment strategy, the fact that there is an investigation ongoing by the Data Protection Commissioner into the legal basis of the scheme surely gives rise for pause for review.  Pending the conclusion of that investigation, the findings of the commissioner and what advice, if any, the commissioner, has to offer to the Government on this issue, we do not believe it should continue to be extended while these concerns are outstanding.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the balance of whether it is necessary or proportionate as regards a restriction on privacy rights, a balancing assessment should take place which must consider whether there are less intrusive means by which the State could achieve the stated public policy aims, whether sufficient safeguards are in place to prevent abuse or risk of security breach or whether the State's actions are justified in light of the intensity of the interference with privacy.  We are not convinced that this scheme is necessary to achieve the stated aims, which are cost savings.  The Comptroller and Auditor General in his assessment of the scheme found there was no business case undertaken or presented before the scheme was initiated and he raised certain concerns about the overall cost of the project.  There are clearly open questions on savings at present.<br\/><br\/>With regard to security, the Government has repeatedly referred to the fact that this is a safe level two standard of identity authentication as opposed to the previous safe level one standard.  Our understanding is that the distinction between safe level one and level two is an internal government assessment.  It is not an independent, international standard of authentication, rather it is one that has been developed internally.  It refers, it would seem, to the inclusion of biometric facial scans in this particular scheme.  We are not convinced that this type of technology is a necessary form of security authentication for the range of services for which it is being currently used.  We see no difficulty with the existing passport or driver licence system in terms of proving their identity.<br\/><br\/>In terms of risks and potential abuse, it is now a norm in other European countries that where national identification systems of this type are introduced, a bespoke and specific oversight system is put in place to monitor it.  We obviously have a very sophisticated and well resourced Data Protection Commissioner office, which has competence in this area, but it would be the norm to have a specialist body in addition to that office and we think that is something that should be considered.<\/p><p> In terms of the types of risks we are seeing, we make reference in our submission, for example, to the case of India where an extensive biometric national identity card system, not entirely dissimilar from ours, was introduced.  Some of its characteristics were certainly different and the political context, as members of the committee will appreciate, is quite different.  However, despite a significant investment of resources in rolling out that system, security breaches by external agents, hackers and so on were found, the system was accessed and full administrative access is now being sold on the open market - we have been told and has been reported in the international press - at a cost of &euro;7 per person.  <\/p><p> We do not want to be alarmist about this but members will be aware that already within existing public sector databases in Ireland, there have been significant and worrying data breaches in recent years with regard to the PeoplePoint system and the EirGrid system.  Members will also be aware that in terms of human involvement in violations of privacy, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has had difficulties in the past, which have, in some cases, led to criminal prosecutions.  These risks are great but when we have an extensive system of this type, where we have sharing of data across a huge number of agencies, the nature of that risk is very much magnified.  Also, from an international perspective, complex extensive systems of this type are more of a target for hackers because of the potential access to information once somebody gets into the system.<\/p><p> We also believe an important political point is being made here.  As the scheme is currently extended, it disproportionately affects those members of our population who are dependent on social protection payments, pensions and so on.  Perhaps that will change as it extends to drivers' licences and passports over the next year but at present, vulnerable sections of the population are particularly in line here if they raise questions about this system.  We know of instances where ordinary members of the public, who are dependent on social protection payments or pensions, have asked the Government to clarify what the legal basis for the system is before they were happy to progress and we know of cases where people have been cut off from pension payments by simply asking questions.  <\/p><p> We see our role here as simply asking questions and we believe the Government has not answered all of them yet.  There should have been an open democratic discussion about a public policy initiative of this significance to ordinary citizens in terms of privacy rights before it was initiated.  It is deeply regrettable that has not been how the Government has chosen to proceed on an initiative of this significance.  There is currently an inquiry by the Data Protection Commissioner into the fundamental questions about the legal basis for the scheme.  In such a context, we certainly urge the committee to call on the Government to at least suspend the extension of the scheme and await that review before it extends the scheme to drivers' licences, passports and the other services that are scheduled for 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018020800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518084000,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Herrick.

I will deliver a focused approach on a few points because they are the ones we see coming up over and over again.  There is not a legal basis for this project, as it has been implemented, and I would like to explain why I say that.  In September 2013 the Cabinet met and issued a formal Government decision, which is a form of an official document, and, among other matters, it ordered that a research and consultation exercise was to be undertaken by the Department of Social Protection on the suitability of the current legal basis for the personal public service number, PPSN, and the making of recommendations.  There was to be a review on the legal basis of the personal public service number and all the legislation around that.  I have confirmed with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection that, as of October 2017, that had never been started and not a single record had ever been created.  That was a missed opportunity.  In the time between those two decisions, that is, between 2013 and the present, we have seen an extensive ramping up of a project rooted in the PPSN legislation but which has gone well beyond it and without that review, I am afraid that the Government has fallen into error.  The consequence of this was that in October 2016 when the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, issued a judgment on the interpretation of the limits of state rights in aggregating and sharing data between state agencies and public agencies, that is the Bara case, the court gave quite a pithy summing up, unusually so in such judgements.  The judgment states that &quot;with regard to processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, [the European law] must be interpreted as precluding national measures, [that is legislation and other internal protocols] such as those at issue in the main proceedings, which allow a public administrative body of a Member State to transfer personal data to another public administrative body and their subsequent processing, without the data subjects having been informed of that transfer or processing&quot;.<br\/><br\/>In order to inform a data subject of the purposes of processing, there must be a purpose defined.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out, there is no set purpose defined for this project.  There has never been a single business case set out for it.  The difficulty there is that if one collects data without a set purpose, there can never be informed consent or consent at all received from a member of the public, nor can the public ever have been informed in advance of the data sharing happening.  The result is that, as it has been structured, this plan has resulted in a system which cannot be in compliance with the Bara decision.  The national laws which are cited, and I will go on to discuss those, all live under the shadow of that superior law from European level, which is incorporated into our Constitution.  That means that no matter what legislative provision is passed in respect of data sharing -- let us be clear, the State has attempted to pass all sorts of legislation on the data sharing front -  if there is not prior information given to members of the public as to what the purpose of it being processed was, and what it will be used for in the future, it cannot meet the requirement of the CJEU.<br\/><br\/>The Data Protection Commissioner recognised almost immediately that this was a very significant challenge to the way the State had approached databases and data sharing.  She issued a detailed briefing note in respect of this case alone, an unusual enough event from the Data Protection Commissioner's office.  She said:<\/p><blockquote>The consequences of this judgment are significant and potentially very far reaching.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner recommends that all public sector bodies complete a full review of their obligations and arrangements on the basis of the findings [of this report].<\/blockquote> <p>Unfortunately, as we have seen, this was also something the State intended to do off its own bat in 2013 but, in so far as we know, nothing has ever been done about that.  Nonetheless, the urge to carry on collecting and sharing sensitive personal data may have proved stronger than the wish to inquire into how this data collecting and processing project could be compliant with European law but it will hold consequences in the near future.<br\/><br\/>The period for the coming into force in May 2018 of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, is currently ticking down.  We are only a few weeks away from it now.  That will allow for states, just as private institutions, to be liable for non-financial loss breaches of data protection rights.  There is a risk that the personal public services card data, that is, the single customer view database, is not complaint.  I have set out why I believe it is not and cannot be complaint under the current system and we are told it currently contains approximately 3 million individuals' details.  If it is the case that it is not compliant, that would indicate that each one of those 3 million people have a claim on the State.  In fact, there is a requirement, under European law, that in any instance where there is a breach of human rights and charter rights, that breach must be met with a remedy and the remedy is now being set out in the GDPR.  It is a remedy in terms of financial compensation.  That is available through the courts.  Any figure that would be picked as to what a court might consider to be appropriate for that kind of breach is a very large number when multiplied by 3 million.<\/p><p>I consider the collection and sharing of this database without a proper legal basis to be one of the major financial risks the State has voluntarily taken on in recent years.  I am attempting, as I was in other committees, including the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, to sound the alarm in respect of this issue.  This is not something the State needed to do or that is financially beneficial to the State, even without the question of compensation.  At the last count, the cost of this project had exceeded &euro;60 million.  The State had estimated it had made something in the region of &euro;1.7 million to &euro;2 million in savings.  These cards will have to be reissued at regular intervals.  That means there is an ongoing cost to this in a one-off project.  On a cost basis alone, therefore, this is a project which is not saving the State money.  It is costing the State money but also has left it with uncrystallised potential liability running into unknowable many zeros in terms of the moneys that may be due to the State's citizens.<\/p><p> I want to deal with some of the questions.  Mention was made of a lady whose pension was cut off.  She has joined us in the Public Gallery today; I met her briefly earlier.  Her experience is instructive because it is an experience where an individual has been affected very badly by the application of systems which do not appear to wish to answer a simple question: how is this lawful?  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection cited as the legal basis for the stopping of that lady's pension section 247C of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, as amended.  The relevant section 247C(3) specifies the manner in which the Minister may be satisfied as to a person's identity.  It is important to point out that there have been statements to the effect that, henceforth, only the public services card will be an acceptable method of proving identity but section 247C(3) foresees that there will be alternative methods and it allows that the Minister has discretion to use those alternative methods solely for proving identity.  In addition to using those alternative methods, the Minister has the discretion to apply other methods she deems appropriate.  A blanket policy, therefore, that no other method will be permitted is fettering the Minister's discretion.  These are grounds for an appeal to the courts if anybody wished to take one and more importantly, it is a demonstration that this is not a good public policy position for the State to take.<\/p><p> The Department is relying upon a section which is designed to prove a person's identity to the Minister.  That is a laudable and necessary part of any social welfare system.  After all, State money is being handed out to individuals.  There must be a method of making sure that the people who should get the money are getting it.  That is not the argument.  The problem is that this is the sole lawful purpose for which this information can be collected.  That purpose is set out also in section 347C, and when the Department cites the section it oddly leaves out this portion of it, namely, that the purpose is \"to satisfy the Minister as to his or identity\".  Once that purpose has been met, there is no lawful basis for further processing of those data.  What is happening, however, is that in order that people be required to have a public services card, if they are to satisfy the Minister, the information is then being passed into the single customer view database where it is then shared with approximately 120 to 150 public agencies and bodies as necessary.  That is processing over and above that which is allowed for under the national legislation, quite apart from the limitations the EU law has brought in, which I addressed earlier.<\/p><p> This is not a one-off.  The State, and by the State I am not referring to any particular Government as these matters have been passed under the aegis of a number of different Governments but rather the administrative State, has a particular background in attempting to limit the effects of data protections for citizens and legislating away its own duties.  For example, section 8 of the Health Identifiers Act 2014 attempts to interfere with the Data Protection Commissioner's independence by requiring her, if she undertakes an investigation into any form of breach or complaint in respect of the independent health identifiers database, to simply make a report to the Minister.  I am aware the commissioner has already expressed her concern about that fettering of her independence, and that independence is written into European law as a requirement in any legislation at a national level which clashes with that.  It is non-effective and should not be given effect by any part of the State.<\/p><p> Those are the individual legal bases that are cited but in terms of what has happened, what we have seen is a national identity card and national identity index, as it was described by Deputy Burton when she was Minister for Social Protection.  She recognised that establishing a national index and producing a national identity card is a wider issue which is not part of the remit of the standard authentication framework environment, SAFE.  That is the in-house developed, departmental internal standard, which is the basis on which these requirements are being placed upon individuals.  She said it will require due consideration by appropriate agencies before any policy decisions could be formulated and would require the development and implementation of legislation to support any such policy.  I agree with that.  If one wishes to bring in a national identity card - a position I would argue against although I could lose the argument - it should be brought in openly with public debate and by way of grounding legislation where everybody knows what is happening and is given an opportunity to weigh in.<\/p><p> There are political and legal issues about national identity cards.  That was seen in the United Kingdom where an attempt was made to bring in a national ID card system under the Government of Tony Blair and, subsequently, under Gordon Brown's Government.  That was eventually scrapped when the legislation could not get the support it needed through the Houses of Parliament.  The subsequent database, which ran to many millions of people, was erased because it did not have any basis.  I do not want to see Ireland reaching the position the UK reached where it wasted billions of pounds on building a database that was eventually scrapped because the legislation could not be got through the Parliament.  I do not believe that was the right thing to do but they did the right thing in facing up to the necessity to have that public debate before it brought in the law and to bring it in by way of primary legislation.<\/p><p> I have made written notes on the discussion in respect of the legal situation regarding the single customer view database.  It is rather detailed and for the purposes of the submissions today I would like to deal with one side issue, which I have marked as a side issue because I do not believe it is central to the discussion but is indicative of the Department's approach to these queries.  Are the single customer view and the public services card database a biometric database?  I have said what is the helpfully short and easy definition of biometric data.  It is taken from Article 4.14 of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, which states that biometric data means \"personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person\".  It gives two examples of biometric data, namely, facial images or dactyloscopic data, which are fingerprint-related data.<\/p><p> The Department is currently holding to the position that its database, which contains very high resolution and biometric level facial imagery of everybody who has been carded, does not include any biometric data.  That is at odds with the European law's definition of biometric data and it means that the Department is arguing for its own new definition of biometric data, which is that data such as facial images, fingerprints and perhaps even iris scans, which are referred to in the SAFE 3 standard, may be stored but none of those count as biometric data.  It is only when that data are run through a piece of software and some biometric matching is done with them that they become biometric data.  That would make a nonsense of the GDPR's protections relating to data collected from individuals because no one collects their output of a software scan.  What is collected from them are the actual data relating to their physiognomy.<\/p><p> When presented with two readings of legislation, one of which would be irrational and the other rational, generally speaking, lawyers prefer to believe that the rational one is the one that should be relied upon.  The rational one is that biometric data is exactly what Article 4.14 says it is, and it includes facial images.<\/p><p> While it is a side issue, the reason I bring it up is that it shows the disconnect between people who are trying to advance what is quite a fact-based and heavily-researched position in terms of what is legal argument, in effect, to demonstrate that what the Department is saying is inaccurate, and the Department's quite superficial response in respect of those very seriously held concerns.  The Department would not answer questions from the lady who is present today and whose pension was cut off.  The question she was asked was, \"Can you show me the legal basis for requiring me to get this card?\"  If it showed her the legal basis for requiring her to get that card, she would have got the card.  The problem was it never answered that question.<\/p><p> I have had this experience on behalf of a separate client, where I wrote seeking exactly the same position because my client received a letter from the Department of Social Protection saying it was now a legal requirement to get one of these cards and to attend to be carded if she wished to continue to get her child benefit.  She contacted me and said she was not having any luck in receiving an explanation as to what was the legal basis that required that attendance.  I then wrote to the Department.  It ignored my letters for slightly under one year, during which I got no response whatsoever.  Eventually, I phoned the Department and said I had not been given any response.  I was told I would receive a response shortly and when I did receive it, I was told, \"We will not be answering your question and we are forwarding this matter to the Chief State Solicitor to answer\".  When I received a response from the Chief State Solicitor, I was told: \"We will not be answering your question because the matter is moot because your client did not lose her child benefit, and, therefore, there is no legal issue.\"<\/p><p> From the point of view of citizens, what has happened here is that the State has written out to them and told them there is a law that makes them do a thing.  That is a very significant issue as the thing it is asking them to do is quite intrusive in terms of their human rights.  They are told to come to a place, be registered by the State, have a photograph taken and have that loaded into a State database.  It is not unreasonable to ask, \"What is that law?\"  It is very telling that when that question is asked, the response is not to answer the question but to ramp up in respect of threats and then, when threats do not work, to simply move on to the next person who may not have the benefit of a lawyer asking the question for them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018020800002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McGarr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518084000,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>What was the timeline of that case?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018020800002#K00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518084000,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>She received a letter in, I believe, June 2016.

If it were the case that what Ireland had done was somehow very different from what Romania had done, then the finding of the European Court of Justice would have referred to this, given it is meant to be applicable to all nations in the EU, not merely in respect of one case, but in terms of setting principles beyond the particular facts of a case.  When the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, was asked questions about this in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Catherine Murphy, he presented the position that Ireland was different from Romania because our position was based on legislation and the Romanian transfer was not based on legislation.  I thought that was a very surprising position for him to take given the judgment sets out what the Romanian legislation is.  The judgment has a heading entitled \"The Legislation\" which sets out that legislation.  There was controlling legislation, just as there is here.  There was also an inter-agency protocol, as there is here between the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and we mirror that relationship very closely in the way that we handle that data sharing between Romania and here.<\/p> <p>  Even though the assertion was made in the D&aacute;il that we were different because we had legislation and Romania did not, the judgment itself refers to the Romanian legislation, so there was no difference on that basis.  Therefore, to meet that point, it is concerning that I find there are these positions that have been taken, not by Deputy Carey but by the State agencies, which appear to be based on either misreadings or misunderstandings as to the meaning of the legislation but also in respect of the actual facts in the judgment.  As I said, the Romanian Government had a piece of legislation and we know this because the judgment goes into describing the terms of it, it quotes from it and it then sets out why that legislation was not sufficient, given there was also a protocol between the two agencies which dealt with the detail of what would be transferred, and so on.  What we have is a piece of legislation and a separate protocol - a memorandum of understanding - which sets out exactly the same thing.  In European law terms it is a data processing agreement.  Therefore, we very much mirror the Romanian experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018020800002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McGarr"},{"type":"speech","time":1518084000,"counter":1056,"content":"<p>I have listened to Mr. McGarr but I take issue with that and do not think he has a foundation for it.

There is a question of full information and consent, which seems to be very crucial, and the extent and clarity of the information around the intended use of their information for those who have been issued with a public service card or have been told that they need one.  It is very clear that we are not talking about a moment of identification rather a person's information being given into a single customer view database.  This relates to the transfer of information to a database.  Are the purposes for the collection of this data provided clearly, adequately and in full?  The general data protection regulation, GDPR, is very clear, and describes freely given, informed and full consent so that a person is able to agree to all of the potential uses of his or her data.  Can the witnesses provide clarity on the issue of defined purpose?  <\/p> <p>  I note that within the Government's response document, which was reissued to us in advance of this meeting, it is mentioned that where a specified body has a transaction with a person, the Minister may share the person's public services identity with the specified body to the extent necessary.  That transaction provides authentication by the specified body of the person's public services identity.  Does the Minister really have the right to determine and respond to requests that may come in from a specified body subsequent to a person having given their data to the Minister?  It seems to me that such an after-the-fact use of data is proposed here. <\/p> <p>  The question of proportionate and necessary use of data needs to be clarified as well.  It seems to be crucial within general data protection and indeed European law.  There is a real concern about proportionality of response.  We will make a person's access to their pension, child benefit, and information on SUSI grants - which I believe will open up a whole can of worms as it involves looking at a person's entire educational prospects - conditional upon them agreeing to undergo a process which does not have an agreed legal basis in terms that are recognised by the Data Protection Commissioner, and where there clearly other ways in which the identification of the person could be conducted.  It was made very clear that SAFE 2 is the system the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has chosen to put in place and is not an international set standard.  Could a Department or Minister be satisfied as to a person's identity on an individual occasion without the need for that information having to be transferred into a single customer view database?   <\/p> <p>  It seems to me that there are two issues here which require individual and separate consent.  There is the consent in terms of agreeing to undergo an identification process and there is also the question of what happens to one's data subsequently.  I would appreciate clarity on those issues.  It seems that there could be another appropriate mechanism which would potentially be more proportionate, particularly when the stakes are so high for individuals.  I want to commend the woman who took her case in respect of her pension.  We should not be relying on individuals to try to fix the law in this State.  We should be making sure that we as legislators are getting it right and that we have oversight of what is coming through.  We should not be looking at this on a case by case basis.  It is very notable that the State has backed down in every individual case of challenge.  There is a case here, and there is huge liability.  It is very unfortunate, given that we have often heard our overstretched court system bemoan the fact that we open ourselves up to having to drive through the court system for every individual person's rights to be vindicated.  <\/p> <p>  I note the Comptroller and Auditor General's involvement, and believe that it deals very explicitly with the question of the cost to the State.  That issue will be of serious concern to all of us in terms of the uses of public money. <\/p> <p>  Mr. Herrick from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, spoke about the international context.  I would appreciate if he could expand on that.  I understand that India followed the same model; it was voluntary initially, then mandatory and compulsory.  There are breaches there, but of course we have already heard of breaches within the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I believe the value of a recent breach was not &euro;7 per person but &euro;23 per person.  That is of serious concern.  There were also breaches in Sweden, and I know there are very serious concerns in China in terms of how information is being used and how data is gathered.  That is a worst case scenario.  <\/p> <p>  The ICCL has been working on other issues in this area for decades.  How rare is the kind of investigation that the Data Protection Commissioner is carrying out now?  I understand that this section ten investigation is unusual.  Is it not the case that the previous Data Protection Commissioner also raised concerns?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018020800002#L00100","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1518084000,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins covered many topics in her contribution.  Public services cards were originally brought in in the context of old age pensioners and their access to transport.  That was leading to problems.  The idea was they would not have to carry something in their pocket but would instead have a card.  The scope of these cards has broadened without serious discussion and debate in this building.  The primary legislation that needs to be in place has not been passed yet.  That is very serious, and I am very concerned about it.  I do not have a public services card and I will not get one until I am confident that it is safe, secure and has all the legislative backup it needs.  The data on the cards can be breached so easily, as we have seen in India.  I am not sure how much protection and primary legislation there was in India when the cards were brought in.  Was it brought in in the same way we are bringing it in here?<\/p> <p>  The private sector is also involved.  The drivers licence sector is now run by a private company, and they can use a person's information and pass it on.  That is very serious, and unless one is very on the ball from the point of view of awareness of what he is she is signing, it is very dangerous.  This committee should perhaps look for a debate on this issue in the D&aacute;il in the near future.  If we decide that there are still things that have to be done before the public services card can be rolled out fully we should slow the pace down on its implementation.  I would be interested in having that debate because it is a very serious issue.  The British Labour Party brought in a similar card under Tony Blair and then tried to extend its remit.  I am not necessarily opposed to an ID card, but not if it is brought in under the radar.

We have always envisioned the public services card being used for interactions with public bodies, but the time will come when access to this information will creep.  I do not have very clear cases in mind, but an example might involve a cardholder who is entitled to free travel which is provided by a private operator or as part of a benefit, a cardholder might receive units of energy, such as gas, from a private operator.  While these would be attempts to provide a benefit, the concern is that the card is involved and there is creep in access, and the centrally held information has the potential to spread much further than was ever envisaged.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views.  We have constantly kept the debate on the subject of the card's use by public bodies.

To be clear, it is not just a preference that the law should be accessible.  There is a legal obligation on the State to ensure that laws which restrict individual privacy rights are accessible.  We refer in our submission to the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence in the cases of Sunday Times <i>v<\/i>UK (No 1), and S and Marper <i>v<\/i>UK.In both of those cases, respectively concerning defamation law and surveillance law, the Court outlined a principle that if a law speaks directly to the question of individual privacy rights, there is an obligation on states to make that law accessible.  As such, there is a legal principle at stake.<br\/><br\/>On the specific question that Deputy Collins and the Chairman have raised about potential private sector involvement, there is a relevant international example in Sweden.  The Swedish driver's licence database system involved provision of services by a private sector body.  It became apparent that the database was being accessed by a private sector body in another jurisdiction, in that case in the United States.  We have real-life situations of this happening.  The Irish public services card system involves private sector service providers based in this jurisdiction.  As we understand it, they are involved in the provision and manufacture of the card itself.  There is certainly potential for private sector involvement either in the provision of State services or as part of the card system in various IT infrastructures.<br\/><br\/>In response to Senator Higgins's questions about international example, the Swedish case is pertinent to her query.  We also have heard about an example from Scotland, where a bus pass system crosses the divide between the public and private sectors.  A bus pass is relatively innocuous on its face.  However, where information can be accessed about someone's travel habits, the case has been made that personal privacy is affected. <br\/><br\/>The UK and Australia are two examples of countries where schemes of this type were attempted, but there was public outcry against them.  That is part of the tradition of common law jurisdictions, which have always had an opposition and antipathy towards compelling citizens to provide papers or information about themselves on the street.  That is not what is at stake here at present, but it does underline where we are coming from as a point of principle.  I understand Deputy Carey's point about the benefits of more convenient access to services, but this is something which we would say is beyond that.  If an individual is accessing services in two or three Government Departments, and there is a form of identification which could simplify that, there might be a case for co-operation between the HSE and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We are now talking about a much wider range of Government services, and we do not see a case where identity cannot be proven using a passport, which is provided through a secure, publicly run system.  If someone has reservations or is opposed to the public services card, and we have outlined the kind of reservations that a person might reasonably have, why can they not use a passport?  That case has not been made to us.  The onus is on the State to demonstrate that, and we do not think that it has done so.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018020800002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518084000,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>I would like to comment on the legal basis for this and my personal experience of trying to figure out what the law was on behalf of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL.

There was a question about whether, in time, the private sector would have access to, and sight of, these cards.  The old social welfare cards, with the Department's logo on them, were brought in by the then Minister, Seamus Brennan.  There was hot debate on the use of the cards as ID cards and he stressed that they would not be so used.  He created a series of protections to give reassurance to the D&aacute;il and to the public that the purpose of the card was not to be an ID card.  He made it an offence for a card to be produced to somebody unless that person was a public body as scheduled in the Act.  This prevented people from being pressurised into producing them, mar dhea, voluntarily and it prevented the cards being used in the wider world outside that of the scheduled public bodies.  It was a strong measure that gave reassurance that the cards would not turn into ID cards.  Section 5 of the Social Welfare and Civil Partnership Bill 2017, which is before this House, proposes withdrawing that protection.  It will no longer be an offence and people may ask a person to produce his or her card in the private sector without any consequences.  The explanation for this is that people may wish to use it as an ID card.<\/p> <p>  It seems to be a case of cognitive dissonance for the Government to hold the position that this is not an ID card database while bringing in legislative provisions which specifically remove the protections which prevent it from being an ID card.  The private sector has access to these cards in the shape of private sector data processors working for public sector data controllers and garda&iacute; will be able to ask people if they want to show them their card.  It may be voluntary and for an individual to decide but there is nothing preventing a garda from asking a person for it, as there has been up until now.  The question of whether a garda could ask to see a person's card was presented as the defining characteristic of whether something was an ID card.  Section 5 of the Social Welfare and Civil Partnership Bill 2017 raises the question of whether the protections which were baked into the original scheme are being removed, carefully and bit by bit.<\/p> <p>  We have not seen legislation that addresses why one would do this, and why we might want an ID card that could be used by the private sector.  In the course of my FOI explorations in the Department, I came across an internal document describing the \"safe\" system.  Its architecture provided for passing data through to the private sector, which is not provided for in any legislation.  If section 5 proceeds as the Government has proposed it, and without any changes, it is not a question of whether this will be used by the private sector but when, with the answer being \"shortly\".  I was asked whether this would be a good or bad thing.  I believe it is a further step to deepen the integration of what was a card for dealing with the Department into a national ID card system.  If one puts a frog in a pot of water and gradually turns up the heat the frog does not notice that it is being boiled.<\/p> <p>  Two lessons appear to have been learned by the Irish State from the UK's experience.  First, the UK stated that it was bringing in a national entitlements card which allowed people to access public services and this was a successful way to bring it in without calling it an ID card, something which seems to have been taken on board here.  Second, we learned that legislation can fail and a project can end and perhaps that is why we have not seen any legislation being brought forward on this.  The problem in bringing forward legislation and having a public debate on an issue is that one never knows what way the debate will end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018020800002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McGarr"},{"type":"speech","time":1518084000,"counter":1068,"content":"<p>I was struck by what Mr. Herrick said about travel in Scotland.  The current legislation refers to identification solely in respect of a transaction but when there is such a wide range of points of information identifying a person, it may lead to other forms of information, and a set of information which can be built up around a person.  There may be concerns in respect of that issue.  The point about passports was well made and given that an Irish passport is one of the most valued and respected internationally, it is dangerous to contemplate one not being acceptable as a form of identification, which could happen in the private sector.<\/p><p>Concerns around the safe system architecture are very clear.  It is necessary to ask if something can be said to be voluntary when one's means of livelihood, one's income, the benefits one needs for a child or the opportunity to go to college is at stake.  We are effectively looking at a mandatory system.  Biometrics were touched on and Elizabeth Farries, who has done excellent work in this area within the ICCL, had an interesting article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>yesterday.  She referred to the specific concern around biometric information.  If a number or an address is hacked or accessed, it can be changed, but once one's personal biometric information is accessed, there are privacy concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018020800002#N00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518084000,"counter":1069,"content":"<p>The question about passports is central.  The Minister and the Department are asserting that there is something special about the safe level two identification and authentication and that it is materially preferable to the existing safe level one system, which includes passports.  They need to demonstrate how it is more secure than the passport system but I do not believe they have done so.<\/p><p>Our passport system has very high integrity, as the Senator correctly said, and it is internationally regarded as of a high standard.  Of course, there are potential instances of breach or fraud from time to time, but one would have to be able to show that there is something special about this card system that will eliminate the types of risks we currently have with the passport system and that is not the case.  On the other hand, we are opening a new level of risks in terms of the possible consequences of breaches of the security of such a system.  The Indian example is a cautionary tale in this regard.  Simon McGarr mentioned the new scale and level of risks from a legal perspective, but we are talking primarily from an individual privacy perspective.  We do not believe the case has been made to make this necessary.  There is also particularly valuable biometric data from a criminal perspective in terms of being able to access that with regard to potential personation or fraud down the line.<\/p><p> Finally, on the theme of fraud, one of the public policy justifications put forward by the Department is the public policy objective of eliminating social welfare fraud.  We have had a consistent problem with overstatement of the problem of social welfare fraud in this country.  However, one thing we do know about social welfare fraud is that personation is a minority element in the overall number of fraud cases.  Generally, fraud in the social welfare context tends to be about the status, circumstances or activities of an individual, such as a person claiming to be disabled or the person not working when he or she is working or is able to work, rather than people impersonating other people.  Even if this was an effective mechanism to eliminate personation in the social welfare system, it is likely that it is a tiny proportion of what is already quite a small overall financial fraud on the State.  It is certainly something that cannot justify the expenditure or the extension of interference in privacy of the scale we are seeing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018020800002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Herrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518084000,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>Would the question of proportionality apply in that case?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018020800002#O00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518084000,"counter":1072,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

The commissioner passed a series of questions to the Department.  Her office was looking for clarification about things which had previously been asserted by the Department in respect of legality and so forth.  She came back with 57 extremely detailed questions as to exactly what was meant by various items.  The answers to those questions were produced and published publicly as the guide to the legal provisions associated with the public services card.  The Department provided the commissioner with the answers.  I read them at the same time the commissioner was reading them.  I do not know what the commissioner thought of them except that, having read them, she commenced her investigation.  That was the context.  I know what I thought.  Having read them I did not think the Department had answered the questions she had put to it and such answers as the Department had given would not give anybody who knew about the live issues in terms of data protection any comfort that the matter was being run in accordance with EU law and data protection law.<\/p> <p>  The commissioner's investigation is ongoing and there are very significant constraints as to what she may do.  She must be independent in the performance of her duties so there are significant constraints in how she could comment on it.  I recognise those constraints.

The Department said that this was its best foot forward and in response to that the commissioner opened the investigation.  As Mr. Herrick pointed out, to my knowledge the commissioner has never used her section 10 power, which is the power to commence an inquiry without a requirement for a complaint but on foot of the commissioner's belief that an inquiry is necessary in respect of a State agency's or body's project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018020800002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McGarr"},{"type":"speech","time":1518084000,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>We cannot anticipate what that inquiry will do but in terms of our-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018020800002#O00900","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518084000,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>It would not be helpful to speculate on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018020800002#O01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McGarr"},{"type":"speech","time":1518084000,"counter":1080,"content":"<p>In terms of our inquiry, what does the witness believe should be the actions of the State at present for the persons who are currently at a potential loss of grants, pensions and so forth rather than each of them going individually to Mr. McGarr or other legal representation?

One could easily argue that the passport process meets the SAFE 2 requirements as well.  What it does not do is end up with a database entry.  It appears that, although the SAFE 2 requirements are presented as merely being a desire to ensure that people are who they say they are, there is an unspoken expectation that, at the end of that process, the providers will have a great deal of data that can be placed in a database, which does not happen with a visit to a Garda station to confirm one's identity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018020800002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McGarr"},{"type":"speech","time":1518084000,"counter":1088,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGarr.
