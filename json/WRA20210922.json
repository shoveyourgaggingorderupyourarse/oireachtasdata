Lead actors report progress on the actions to the Interdepartmental Group (IDG) on remote work which is coordinated by my Department. The IDG has so far met three times this year, most recently on September 7th. At these meetings it has been established that good progress is underway in achieving the actions by their deadlines. The IDG will meet again in November to further drive the implementation of the Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of remote working infrastructure to all parts of the country is an important pillar of the Strategy. My Department is currently developing new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024 in which there will be a focus on promoting remote working opportunities and investing in infrastructures across the nine regions. My Department also recently announced &euro;10 million in funding for a new Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme. This scheme is administered by Enterprise Ireland and includes a &euro;500,000 Feasibility Study to assist enterprise development projects, including the development of remote working and enterprise infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  On May 31st, the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Western Development Commission launched Ireland&rsquo;s first National Hub Network, ConnectedHubs.ie. This was followed on July 22nd with the announcement of &euro;8.8 million in funding for 117 projects across Ireland as part of the Connected Hubs call. This investment will contribute to the ongoing development of the National Hub Network, which already includes 134 hubs and will grow on a phased basis to over 400 hubs throughout the country. The ConnectedHubs.ie platform is being widely marketed. This investment will bring significant employment opportunities to our regions and rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  Agencies under the auspices of my Department are also playing an active role in implementing the National Remote Work Strategy. In April, the Workplace Relations Commission published the Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect which will help employees to strike a better work-life balance and to switch off from work outside of normal working hours. This reflects the Government&rsquo;s wider commitment to create more flexible and family-friendly working arrangements which will benefit both employees and employers. The Health and Safety Authority has been providing ongoing guidance to employers and employees to ensure that remote working arrangements are implemented in a safe and sustainable way both during and beyond the pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is engaging with its client base to share knowledge on the implementation of remote and hybrid working arrangements.  These working models being promoted with international investors as part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s balanced regional development agenda. A particular emphasis is being placed on the potential of remote work to attract and retain talent. IDA Ireland supported the ConnectedHubs.ie launch through its communication channels and social media, and the ConnectedHubs map has been incorporated into IDA&rsquo;s property marketing content. A number of recent regional jobs announcements have referenced roles being open on a remote working basis. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has developed a Future of Work website featuring a range of resources to assist companies in transitioning to the remote, hybrid and flexible working cultures of the post-Covid environment. EI has been promoting this material to its client companies and beyond, and a new employer guide was launched at a webinar on June 22nd which was attended by over 200 people. EI is also supporting The National Association of Community Enterprise Centres to promote greater use of their associate hubs to assist with the training of hub managers and teams. EI is additionally a member of the Grow Remote Advisory Panel and represents the needs of Irish indigenous industry in the move to hybrid ways of working. <\/p>  <p>  On June 28th, my Department launched the &lsquo;Making Remote Work&rsquo; campaign across broadcast, print and social media to promote the Guidance for Working Remotely webpage. This webpage acts as a central access point for employers and employees and brings together the existing State guidance, legislation and advice on remote work into one place. The webpage includes an Employer Checklist to provide employers with a quick way to successfully navigate the adoption of remote working arrangements. The &lsquo;Making Remote Work&rsquo; campaign is continuing, and the Government is encouraging workers and employers to discuss the kinds of remote working arrangements that may be suitable for their organisations.<\/p>  <p>  As part of creating an environment conducive to remote work, my Department will soon legislate for the right for employees to request remote work. The report of the submissions received during the public consultation on the proposed measure was published on August 20th, and a working group has been established to draft the General Scheme of the Bill which will be presented to Government as soon as possible. <\/p>  <p>  A vital part of ensuring the success of remote working arrangements now and in the future is ensuring that organisations and workers are equipped with the appropriate tools for communication and collaboration.

In the first six months of 2021, the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was approximately &euro;17,100.  <\/p>  <p>  There are currently just over 7,000 homeowners on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. Data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicates that for homes completed in the first half of 2021, the longest time waiting for a survey from application date was approximately 23 months countrywide and the average time from application to completion was approximately 26 months countrywide. The SEAI has advised me that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather.  The average wait times have increased significantly in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity in place between January and mid-April when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  Wait times have also been negatively impacted by challenges associated with availability and longer lead times for materials. <\/p>  <p>  Funding for SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased significantly to over &euro;109 million in 2021, with &euro;100 million allocated to the Warmer Homes Scheme. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty.  The funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government. I have also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. In addition, delivery capacity in the supply chain has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020.  Every effort is being made to maximise output now that construction activity in the residential sector has recommenced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200066#WRA03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200066#WRA04000"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[45404\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200066#WRA04100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the reason a property (details supplied) cannot avail of high-speed broadband; when this area is due to be surveyed; the way his Department plans to address this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":43,"content":"<p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.

Specifically, Revenue has considered Ireland&rsquo;s DTA with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which has been cited in that regard.<\/p><p>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the absence of a generally-applicable corporate tax in the UAE, the UAE DTA contains provisions designed to prevent companies from qualifying as residents of the UAE for the purposes of the DTA. While Revenue will remain vigilant for indications of avoidance, they consider that DTA has been designed to prevent such possible use and that the risk of implementation of arrangements, similar to those addressed in the Competent Authority Agreement with Malta, is low in relation to the UAE DTA and other DTAs designed for restricted application.<\/p><p>For my part, I have repeatedly demonstrated that I am committed to taking action to ensure the Irish tax code is in line with new and emerging international tax standards as agreed globally.The January 2021 Update to Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap highlights the actions that have already been taken and will continue to be taken in this process of corporation tax reform.<\/p><p>In this vein, it is important to remember that in recent Finance Acts, the Oireachtas has; <\/p><p>- substantially progressed transposition of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives through the introduction of Controlled Foreign Company rules, and anti-hybrid rules; <\/p><p>- introduced defensive measures against listed jurisdictions through enhanced Controlled Foreign Company Rules; <\/p><p>- updated transfer pricing rules; <\/p><p>- introduced legislation for OECD BEPS measures on mandatory disclosure rules; and <\/p><p>- substantially widened the scope of the Exit Tax regime &mdash; with the result that, on the migration of a company from Ireland to another country of residence, the increase in the value of assets to the date of the company&rsquo;s departure will be chargeable to Irish tax.<\/p><p>It should also be recognised that Ireland has a longstanding General Anti-Avoidance Rule, which goes beyond the standard required in the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives.<\/p><p>Further, in the upcoming Finance Bill, it is intended that we will complete the transposition of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives, with the introduction of interest limitation rules and anti-reverse hybrid rules. It is intended that these rules will take effect from 1 January 2022.<\/p><p>This reform is not complete: As set out in the update to the Corporation Tax Roadmap, over the coming years there are commitments to introduce a series of measures to further reform our corporate tax code, including through the introduction of measures to apply to outbound payments, further action against listed jurisdictions, as well as publishing a tax treaty policy statement with a particular focus on developing countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200067#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200067#WRB02000"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[45282\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200067#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated revenue generated in each of the years 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 that were the capital allowances claimed against intangible assets onshored between 2015 and 11 October 2017 capped at the current rate of 80%; and the estimated quantum of capital allowances remaining to be claimed against those assets.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>The 80% cap on capital allowances for intangible assets was re-introduced in Finance Act 2017 and it applies to all intangible assets on-shored from 11 October 2017.

Its people and systems have adapted well to the remote environment during which the vast majority of staff worked from home in line with public health guidelines. As public health guidelines change, more staff will begin returning to the office on a phased and limited basis. The Bank&rsquo;s staff are well-equipped to work remotely, with the vast majority using videoconferencing, collaboration software and other services remotely, as such the Bank has no requirement to increase the participation in these services at this time. Some staff, due to the nature of their work, will need to be onsite e.g. security and catering. It is envisaged that the majority of staff will work in a hybrid model in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Credit Review Office has two members of staff, both of whom have been working remotely since March 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) has, since March 2020, taken measures to facilitate remote working in order to comply with public health measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the FSPO has ensured the continuity of its operations by facilitating remote working for the majority of its staff, with only a small number of roles requiring office attendance for essential business needs to ensure it continues to fulfil its statutory role and meet the needs of its customers. All FSPO staff, including new employees, have access to the necessary IT equipment, cloud services for remote videoconferencing and the capacity to work remotely. For this reason, it is not envisaged that any further procurement is required by the FSPO in order to support the implementation of the national remote work strategy Making Remote Work. All decisions in relation to future working arrangements for the FSPO will be taken in the context of public health guidance, guidance from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, business needs and staff welfare.<\/p>  <p>  All staff of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council have been working remotely since March 2020 and have the capacity and necessary resources, including cloud services, to work remotely and it is planned to continue to maintain this. The Council has a remote working policy in place with a hybrid-model applying on a physical return to the office. A Procurement Policy is in place which aims to ensure that the Fiscal Council, relative to the nature and volume of procurement undertaken, complies with its legal obligations, and procures openly, objectively, and transparently to get the best value for money in line with the Guidelines of the Office of Government Procurement.<\/p>  <p>  Employees of the Office of the Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General are currently working in line with Government COVID-19 guidance, which provides for home working to continue where possible. A central policy framework for Blended Working in the Civil Service will be finalised in conjunction with employee representatives over the coming months &mdash; the move to blended working supports commitments in the national remote working strategy. Due to the nature of the work of the Office, a degree of remote working was already facilitated prior to the current pandemic, a teleworking policy was in place and staff had the necessary equipment to work outside of the Office, at home or in client premises. All staff of the Office have access to teleconferencing facilities and access to other platforms is arranged as required on a case by case basis. A model for the future of work in the Office, developed with extensive staff consultation, has recently been approved by the Audit Board. The model will facilitate a hybrid working arrangement enabling staff to divide their time between remote and in-office work while ensuring that the business objectives are achieved. The model will form the basis of a blended working policy for the Office to be developed once the central policy framework has been agreed.<\/p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) introduced remote working for employees in July 2019 by way of the NTMA Remote Working Guide. Since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, and in accordance with Government advice, NTMA employees have predominantly, approximately 95% of staff, worked from home. It is the NTMA&rsquo;s expectation that a hybrid working model will be available to all employees and the NTMA Remote Working Guide will be updated to reflect this. The NTMA has the IT infrastructure in place to facilitate staff working remotely. This infrastructure has been procured in line with the NTMA Procurement Policy. <\/p>  <p>  The NTMA assigns staff to Home Building Finance Ireland, the National Asset Management Agency and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners is actively developing its blended working policy in response to the Making Remote Work strategy. Revenue already has the technology in place to support remote working for all staff, noting that some staff such as Customs Officers cannot work remotely. Revenue currently supports approximately 4,500 remote workers on a daily basis. Video conferencing facilities are available to all staff including all remote workers and this service operates in the cloud. This technology was procured pre-Covid-19 via a tender for Revenue&rsquo;s Office productivity suite.<\/p>  <p>  The Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) has drafted a remote working policy for its staff members and is currently awaiting final guidelines and direction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before implementation takes place. To date, no staff member has requested remote working on a permanent or hybrid-basis but the Commission conducted an internal anonymous survey in May 2021 which indicated a level of interest in some form of hybrid working. From 20 September 2021, in accordance with Government recommendations, staff physically returned to the office on a staggered basis. To maintain social distancing, the overall daily number of staff attending the office is limited and this will be an excellent pilot for hybrid working post pandemic. The ICT services of the Commission are provided by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer which already supports remote videoconferencing and the capacity to work remotely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200067#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":99,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200067#WRB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":100,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[45440\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200067#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, employment wage subsidy scheme and Covid restrictions scheme compliances programmes respectively; the percentage of employers availing of each scheme who have been contacted by the Revenue Commissioners regarding repayments; the total amount of repayments due from employers under each scheme; the total amount collected to date in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":101,"content":"<p>The temporary wage subsidy scheme (TWSS) closed at the end of August 2020, and I am advised that Revenue has been carrying out a programme of compliance checks on all employers who participated in the TWSS scheme to confirm eligibility and that the supports were properly paid out to qualifying employees.

This differs to the standard treatment of capital allowances which are claimed at a rate of 12.5% annually over eight years. <\/p>  <p>  To qualify for the scheme, equipment must fall within one of the 10 classes of technology specified in Schedule 4A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. In order for equipment in these classes of technology to qualify for the scheme it must also meet detailed energy efficiency criteria as set in statutory instrument by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications with the approval of, and after consultation with, the Minister for Finance. A statutory instrument is also required to update such criteria. The SEAI maintains the listing of eligible products on its Triple E Register, and plays a key role in the process for setting the eligibility criteria by undertaken periodic technical reviews of the technology groups. <\/p>  <p>  Last year my officials, in conjunction with officials in the Department for the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC), the SEAI and the Revenue Commissioners, completed a Tax Expenditure Review of the scheme in accordance with the Department of Finance guidelines for evaluating tax expenditures.

Finance Act 2020 extended the end date of the scheme from 31 December 2020 to 31 December 2023. The review also recommended the classes of technology included in Schedule 4A and the existing energy efficiency qualifying criteria be reviewed with a view to updating the criteria to reflect technological advances in energy efficiency.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the SEAI that it is possible that the types of machinery referred to by the Deputy may qualify for the scheme under the technology group &lsquo;Electrical Vehicles and Associated Charging Equipment&rsquo;, which is included in the Class of Technology &lsquo;Electric and Alternative Fuel Vehicles&rsquo; in Schedule 4A. Whether or not a specific item of machinery qualifies for the scheme depends on whether it meets the qualifying criteria set for that technology group. If a taxpayer wishes to confirm whether an item of equipment qualifies for the scheme they may consult the SEAI at the following email address: TripleE@seai.ie or (01) 808 2100.

From the outset, I must state that it is not appropriate for the Minister for Finance to comment on the tax affairs of individual businesses.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue uses a range of resources to identify instances of tax avoidance, which would include tax avoidance arising from the arrangements described in the Agreement between the Competent Authorities of Ireland and Malta.<\/p><p>Those arrangements involved an exploitation of a mismatch of Irish and Maltese rules in relation to company residence and domicile, which could have led to income falling out of charge in Ireland and in Malta, resulting in double <i>non-taxation<\/i>of the income concerned. I cannot comment on the arrangements of any specific taxpayer. However, arrangements as described in the Christian Aid report are not arrangements that involve a mismatch of residence and domicile rules that would lead to double non-taxation, through amounts falling out of charge in both Ireland in Malta.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Ireland-Malta Competent Authority Agreement was to deter the arrangements described in the Agreement. The Christian Aid report appears to confirm that the Agreement was effective in achieving that purpose&mdash; and I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have not identified information that would suggest otherwise. As regards those arrangements or any other aggressive tax planning, I have repeatedly stated that I will not hesitate to propose legislation to address tax avoidance, where it may not be possible to address arrangements within the existing code. The Revenue Commissioners liaise with my Department on that basis, in relation to potential loopholes they identify.<\/p><p>The Revenue Commissioners cannot comment directly or indirectly on the arrangements of a specific taxpayer. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners &ndash; as a general statement and without their reference to, or implication in respect of, any specific case &ndash; that they do not provide confirmations or opinions to taxpayers on matters in respect of which they suspect there may be a tax avoidance purpose.<\/p><p>Revenue is strongly committed to identifying and challenging tax avoidance, including schemes that would seek to rely on Ireland&rsquo;s Double Taxation Agreements. Revenue has reviewed Ireland&rsquo;s Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) network in relation to the possibility of arrangements, similar to those addressed by the Ireland-Malta Competent Authority Agreement, being implemented using a different DTA. Specifically, Revenue has considered Ireland&rsquo;s DTA with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which has been cited in that regard.<\/p><p>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the absence of a generally-applicable corporate tax in the UAE, the UAE DTA contains provisions designed to prevent companies from qualifying as residents of the UAE for the purposes of the DTA. While Revenue will remain vigilant for indications of avoidance, they consider that DTA has been designed to prevent such possible use and that the risk of implementation of arrangements, similar to those addressed in the Competent Authority Agreement with Malta, is low in relation to the UAE DTA and other DTAs designed for restricted application.<\/p><p>For my part, I have repeatedly demonstrated that I am committed to taking action to ensure the Irish tax code is in line with new and emerging international tax standards as agreed globally.The January 2021 Update to Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap highlights the actions that have already been taken and will continue to be taken in this process of corporation tax reform.<\/p><p>In this vein, it is important to remember that in recent Finance Acts, the Oireachtas has; <\/p><p>- substantially progressed transposition of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives through the introduction of Controlled Foreign Company rules, and anti-hybrid rules;<\/p><p>- introduced defensive measures against listed jurisdictions through enhanced Controlled Foreign Company Rules; <\/p><p>- updated transfer pricing rules; <\/p><p>- introduced legislation for OECD BEPS measures on mandatory disclosure rules; and <\/p><p>- substantially widened the scope of the Exit Tax regime &mdash; with the result that, on the migration of a company from Ireland to another country of residence, the increase in the value of assets to the date of the company&rsquo;s departure will be chargeable to Irish tax.<\/p><p>It should also be recognised that Ireland has a longstanding General Anti-Avoidance Rule, which goes beyond the standard required in the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives.<\/p><p>Further, in the upcoming Finance Bill, it is intended that we will complete the transposition of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives, with the introduction of interest limitation rules and anti-reverse hybrid rules. It is intended that these rules will take effect from 1 January 2022.<\/p><p>This reform is not complete: As set out in the update to the Corporation Tax Roadmap, over the coming years there are commitments to introduce a series of measures to further reform our corporate tax code, including through the introduction of measures to apply to outbound payments, further action against listed jurisdictions, as well as publishing a tax treaty policy statement with a particular focus on developing countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200068#WRC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":122,"content":"<p>Question No. 40 answered with Question No. 39.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":123,"content":"<p>Question No. 41 answered with Question No. 39.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":124,"content":"<p>Question No. 42 answered with Question No. 39.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":125,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200068#WRC01600"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[45740\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200068#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of properties in which the PPSN of the tenant has been allocated to the property for the purposes of local property tax by county in 2019, 2020 and to date in 2021, in tabular form.","asker":"1495","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":127,"content":"<p>Section 11 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) sets out the rules used to determine the &lsquo;liable person&rsquo; of a residential property for LPT purposes.

However, the legislation also provides that a tenant is liable for LPT on a residential property where the lease is for a period of 20 years or more. Local Authorities or Approved Housing Bodies are liable for LPT in cases where a tenant is renting a residential property from them. <\/p>  <p>  When LPT was introduced in 2013 Revenue produced the first residential property register of all properties within the State. As the data to compile the Register was gathered from various sources, a relatively small number of tenants were incorrectly linked as &lsquo;liable persons&rsquo; to the properties they were renting. In such circumstances, the tenants were requested to contact Revenue to confirm they were not the &lsquo;liable person&rsquo; and to provide details of the landlord.

This initial Framework sets out an overarching vision of &ldquo;enabling all our people to live fulfilled lives now and into the future&rdquo;.  The Interdepartmental Report notes that by providing an overarching structure the Well-being Framework will contribute to the development of a shared understanding of what makes for a better life and enhance strategic alignment in the identification of policy priorities, opportunities, and challenges as well as coordination and co-operation between departments and agencies. <\/p><p>The initial Framework has an outcomes-based approach that is focused on understanding people&rsquo;s experiences across person, place and society.  From my Department&rsquo;s perspective, this approach builds on the performance budgeting initiative.  It does so by placing an explicit focus on policy goals and evidence of progress toward achieving stated policy outcomes.  This is part of a wider set of reforms that have increased the focus on the impact of public services on people&rsquo;s lives such as equality budgeting. In the aggregate, these reforms seek to provide a well-rounded, holistic view of how Ireland is progressing, highlighting where progress is unequal and shaping policies that deliver better results for people.<\/p><p>The <i>First Report on a Well-being Framework for Ireland<\/i>set out a commitment for a second phase of consultation on the Framework.  The ongoing development of the Framework will be informed by engaging with a broad range of stakeholders.  I understand that the Department of the Taoiseach is preparing an approach for such a consultation.<\/p><p>The <i>First Report on a Well-being Framework for Ireland<\/i>set out an initial dashboard of indicators for the Well-being Framework.  This dashboard complements the conceptual framework and measures life and progress in Ireland using a cohesive set of indicators.  The creation of such a dashboard is in keeping with the practice of the OECD and other countries that have sought to develop a well-being perspective.  The First Report also set out that, from Autumn 2021, the CSO will host an interactive version of the dashboard that will update automatically as data corresponding to individual indicators becomes available.  In addition, the First Report also stated that the CSO is intending to publish a &lsquo;how we are doing?&rsquo; section annually which will provide accessible infographics and trends.<\/p><p>In this context, it is important to note my Department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement with the Oireachtas in the development of the performance budgeting framework, including Equality Budgeting and the Public Service Performance Report.  <\/p><p>While high-level well-being frameworks are important in terms of developing a shared understanding of what makes for better lives and influencing public debate on strategic priorities, such frameworks do not in-and-of-themselves fulfil the ambition of improving policy and decision-making.  My Department recognises the importance of going beyond presenting high-level indicators by developing a knowledge base around well-being as a policy objective and integrating well-being metrics into the various stages of the policy making process.  In the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, my Department set out its perspective on how the Well-being Framework can be utilised to locate well-being within existing expenditure policy in order to inform efforts to improve the impact of public policy on people's lives and to build knowledge of well-being as a policy objective, in order to better understand policy challenges and inform the design and implementation of more effective public policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200068#WRC03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Development Plan","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200069#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[45522\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200069#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the date of the final publication of the revised National Development Plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":151,"content":"<p>The revised NDP is currently being finalised and it will set out annual expenditure ceilings for the initial 5 years for each Departmental Vote Group, including capital ceilings for 2022.

However, a civil remedy is available through the Courts concerning branches or roots of neighbouring trees encroaching on a person&rsquo;s property.<\/p>  <p>  The possibility of providing a broader civil law remedy for parties affected by high trees and hedges on adjoining properties was raised previously with the Minister for Justice. In this regard, advice was sought on the possibility of legislative provision being made, whereby a person substantially deprived of the enjoyment of their property, such as the deprivation of light caused by high trees on a neighbouring property, could apply to the Courts for an order, and that the Courts could make an order as they see fit, for example, to cut the trees back to an appropriate height. Safety considerations relating to overhanging trees could also potentially be addressed in any such provisions. <\/p>  <p>  In response, the Minister for Justice suggested that disputes of this nature between neighbours could perhaps be more appropriately dealt with through mediation, which is being increasingly used internationally as a tool for the resolution of civil disputes, rather than through the Courts.  Legislation subsequently introduced by the Minister for Justice has been enacted as the Mediation Act 2017 (the Act).<\/p>  <p>  The Act, which came into operation on 1 January 2018, contains provisions to underpin a comprehensive statutory framework to promote the resolution of disputes through mediation as an alternative to court proceedings which should ideally be only used as a last resort.

At both primary and post-primary levels considerable scope for building the capacity of students in the area of digital literacy is provided for through the emphasis on dispositions, competencies and skills as foundational elements of the curriculum.  Specifically, in the newly introduced Framework for Junior Cycle digital literacy skills are promoted through the eight Key Skills (all skills have an ICT\/digital component) and through the Statements of Learning. <\/p>  <p>  Currently at post-primary level, there are several programmes and courses in ICT and Digital Literacy already in place, particularly the Junior Cycle Short Course in Digital Literacy and the IT courses in the Leaving Certificate Applied programme. To a lesser extent, the recently-introduced Leaving Certificate subject in Computer Science also looks at aspects of digital literacy. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, areas such as Wellbeing and its constituent programmes in Social, Personal and Health Education, Relationships and Sexuality Education and Civic, Social and Political Education also underpin skills of digital literacy in engaging with the subject material in these courses.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in the ongoing reviews of the Primary Curriculum and of the Senior Cycle the skills of, or skills closely related to, digital literacy, have featured strongly in all discussions on future provision.  <\/p>  <p>  The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 also promotes the development of digital literacy in our young people and the importance of respectful online communications. The development of a new Digital Strategy for Schools is now well underway and will be informed by the learnings from the current strategy and the experience of teachers, schools leaders, students and parents regarding the embedding of digital technologies across the curriculum as well as the impact of remote learning during school closures.  The new strategy will also take into consideration government objectives and priorities, national and international experience and will look to address and incorporate new and emerging issues and trends in digital technology and online safety.  To ensure a comprehensive review of the existing strategy and to take account of new and emerging themes from the point of view of all relevant stakeholders, a wide ranging consultation framework has been developed.  The overall consultation process is an integral part of the development of the new strategy and key to ensuring its successful implementation.  Publication is planned for later this year. <\/p>  <p>  In addition development has commenced on a new Literacy, Numeracy and Digital Literacy strategy for early years, primary and post primary schools, a successor to The National Strategy: Literacy &amp;amp; Numeracy for Learning and life 2011-2020 and Interim Review 2017, The strategy will be developed against robust research to include consideration of national and international practice, stakeholder consultations to include school leaders, teachers and learners and public engagement.

While some schemes were able to maintain services while complying with public health restrictions, this was not always the case.  In both scenarios, CE and T&uacute;s participants, whose contracts were due to end during periods of public health restrictions, had their contracts extended on a number of occasions, most recently up to end October 2021.<\/p>  <p>  With the successful roll-out of the vaccine programme and in line with Government&rsquo;s plans for the full re-opening of the economy, under 'Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting&rsquo; my priority and the priority of the Department is to have all CE and T&uacute;s schemes back providing normal services and supports to unemployed participants while delivering vital services to local communities.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this return to normal operations, a phased and planned schedule of exits for CE and T&uacute;s participants, some of whose contracts have been extended for up to one year, will commence in November 2021.  I can reassure the Deputy that the exits will be carried out in a phased basis between November and May 2022. This means that many participants&rsquo; contacts will be extended beyond the end of October. <\/p>  <p>  These final contract extensions will provide CE and T&uacute;s participants with an opportunity to benefit from further work experience on CE and T&uacute;s and also for CE participants to complete any outstanding training.  The coordinated and phased exit approach will also support the recruitment of new CE and T&uacute;s participants while ensuring the ongoing delivery of important local community services.   <\/p>  <p>  I note the concern raised in relation to employment opportunities and recruitment of participants. However, it should be noted that one of the measures included in the Pathways to Work Strategy announced by Government in July, 2021 was an increase in the capacity of the Public Employment Service in Intreo Offices and contracted services to further support jobseekers through the provision of job search advice and assistance. This increased capacity will support persons who finish on CE and T&uacute;s, over the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  These additional resources will be central to meeting the increased demand for employment services, given the impact of the pandemic on employment including new candidate referrals to fill CE and T&uacute;s vacancies. I anticipate that with the full re-opening of the economy we will be able to restore scheme participant levels, in addition to new places being assigned to a number of CE and T&uacute;s schemes,  delivering on a key commitment under Pathways to Work.<\/p>  <p>  CE sponsoring authorities and T&uacute;s implementing bodies are encouraged by my Department to continue to promote the benefits of CE and T&uacute;s in their local communities.  Jobseekers interested in participating on CE or T&uacute;s can also contact a case officer in their local Intreo Centre who will refer those eligible onto local CE or T&uacute;s programmes.  <\/p>  <p>  CE sponsoring authorities also advertise their vacancies on www.jobsireland.ie, the Department&rsquo;s online job advertising and recruitment service for jobseekers and employers.<\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcome for participants, CE and T&uacute;s will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, including those whose employment has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 emergency. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200073#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flexible Work Practices","counter":348,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200073#WRH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":349,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[45375\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200073#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the steps taken by her Department to support the implementation of the national remote work strategy Making Remote Work; the approximate number or percentage of staff within her Department who have access to cloud services for remote videoconferencing and the capacity to work remotely; her plans to increase this percentage; the framework under which procurement for this is managed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":350,"content":"<p>Civil Service departments and offices have been working in line with Government Covid-19 guidance, which provided for home working to continue where possible.

JobPath service providers are paid based on performance and, except for the initial registration fee, payments are made only when a client has achieved sustained employment that is verified by the Department and therefore, due to the payment model, there are no unspent funds. The initial set-up costs and the day to day running costs are borne by the service providers.<\/p><p>The final overall cost of JobPath will be determined by the number of people who engage with the service and the number who secure sustainable jobs. The roll out of JobPath began in 2015 and the yearly expenditure 2016 - 2020 is as set out in the table below. It should be noted that this is gross expenditure and does not consider the savings made in welfare payments for those who secured sustained employment.<\/p><p>Between July 2015 and the end of July 2021 some 312,966 jobseekers had commenced their engagement period with the JobPath service and in the same period, 70,740 jobseekers had commenced employment during their engagement period with JobPath. <\/p><p><b>See Table 2 for annual breakdown.<\/b><\/p><p>The OECD worked with my Department to measure the effectiveness of JobPath and the econometric review of JobPath, published by my Department in 2019, noted that in 2018 the weekly employment earnings of people who secured employment with the JobPath service are 17% higher than the weekly employment earnings of people who secured employment without the support of JobPath. Taken with the 26% improvement in employment outcomes in the same period, it means the overall positive employment\/earnings impact is 37% in 2018 for those who are supported by the JobPath service.  These findings indicate that jobseekers who engage with JobPath are more likely to get a positive employment outcome than those jobseekers who aren't supported by the service.<\/p><p>Additionally, the Comptroller and Auditor General produced a detailed report examining how the service was governed and found that the JobPath service was delivering in accordance with all aspects of the contract with my Department.  <\/p><p>All jobseekers on the Live Register must be capable of; available for and actively seeking full time employment, they are also required to engage with the Department&rsquo;s employment services. The Social Welfare (Consolidated) Act 2005, as amended, specifies that participation is mandatory. Therefore, jobseekers in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment are required to engage with the Department&rsquo;s employment services whether the service is provided internally by an Intreo case officer or, externally by any of the Department&rsquo;s contracted service providers.<\/p><p>All jobseekers over one year on the Live Register are eligible for selection to one of the contracted public employment services, including the JobPath employment service.  Selection for referral to the JobPath employment service is by means of random selection. Protocols for referral to JobPath currently preclude the selection of anyone who has already completed 2 x 52 weeks on the JobPath programme or any jobseeker who completed the programme within the previous 4 months. A person who has completed a year with the JobPath service; continues to meet the criteria for long term unemployment and if they are not engaged in other employment supports and services becomes eligible for selection for a second period of engagement with the JobPath service after 4 months.<\/p><p>JobPath providers have their own discretionary funds available to pay for training or other interventions; the decision to approve a request for funding is at the discretion of the JobPath provider.  They will consider the duration, cost and relevance to the customer&rsquo;s job goal preferences. The prevalence of employment opportunities in the sector will also be considered along with the likelihood that the customer secures full-time employment upon completion of the course.<\/p><p>Several courses are provided in-house while others are provided by specialist training providers including the Education and Training Boards (ETBs).

Participation limits on these schemes are necessary to allow for the maximum utilisation of places amongst qualifying persons. It is important to note that participation is intended to be for a temporary fixed term and the positions offered are not full-time sustainable jobs. Instead, the placements are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the open labour market. <\/p>  <p>  In general, placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years are for one year.  Those participants who are working towards a Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) major award can seek to extend their participation on CE by up to two years to enable them to reach the required standard of qualification.  Participants aged 55 years or older can remain on CE for three years and do not have to work towards a QQI major award. In both instances, a maximum of three consecutive year&rsquo;s participation is permissible.  A person may re-qualify for CE after a 12 month break once they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  An overall lifetime limit of six years applies to all CE participants (seven years for those on a disability payment).  <\/p>  <p>  As  the person concerned has now been on CE for in excess of  3 consecutive years, ( their time having been extended due to the Covid 19  Pandemic ) their placement will now finish on 5th November 2021.

The schemes objectives are to promote (i) a reduction in child poverty, (ii) positive child development outcomes, (iii) labour market activation and (iv) improved quality.  <\/p>  <p>  The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of those families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children. <\/p>  <p>  By making this fundamental shift away from the legacy schemes where subsidies are grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families, the NCS aims to improve children&rsquo;s outcomes, improve labour market participation and reduce child poverty. It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof and assist people in exiting the poverty trap.<\/p>  <p>  Within this framework, an income-related subsidy is payable for children up to 15 years of age. The subsidy level is determined by the family&rsquo;s income and the child's age. The number of hours subsidised is determined by the parent's employment or education arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is also built to ensure that families are supported to access a minimum level of early learning and childcare provision to support positive child outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the evidence also shows that these benefits are, in most cases, realised with part-time participation. On this basis, 20 hours are available all year round for children who have not started school, and in non-term time for school age children, regardless of whether the parents or guardians are in work or study. <\/p>  <p>  During term time, the child's development needs are generally met through school participation.<\/p>  <p>  Households on incomes of less than &euro;26,000 NET can access full subsidies of up to &euro;225 per child, per week, covering up to 45 hours week. To access 45 hours rather than 20 hours, the parent must be in some type of employment or be engaged in training. <\/p>  <p>  The definition of work or study is broad, covering all forms of work or study arrangements: full-time, part-time, week-on\/week-off and zero hour contracts.  Moreover, the minimum hours required to engage in work or study to qualify for up to 45 hours per week is very low &ndash; at just two hours per week. In this way, the NCS encourages parents to exit poverty and deliver better outcomes for their children.<\/p>  <p>  Underpinned by this approach is strong evidence that shows how growing up in poverty negatively impacts on child outcomes.  Taking up work or engaging in training, even a very low number of hours, is key to enabling families to break that cycle and that is what the NCS is designed in part to support. <\/p>  <p>  It also reflects the need to ensure that our systems recognise the critical role of family in children&rsquo;s lives. Particularly where those families are available to care for their children.<\/p>  <p>  For children living in exceptional circumstances of disadvantage or need, the NCS sponsorship arrangement is designed so that they can access free early learning and care or school age childcare for longer or full time hours where required.<\/p>  <p>  The DCEDIY is committed to keeping the scheme under review and to assess whether it is meeting its objectives. I have contracted Frontier Economics to undertake a review of the National Childcare Scheme in line with Section 26 of the Childcare Support Act. <\/p>  <p>  Variations on the concept of a work\/study test is widely used around the wold and I have also requested that Frontier review the usage and evidence of efficacy of this approach in other countries.<\/p>  <p>  This work is due to be finalised in the final quarter of this year and will inform in an evidence based manner the future development of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200074#WRJ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Protection","counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200074#WRJ02400"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[45467\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200074#WRJ02500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of persons that were deemed adults by the International Protection Office and placed into direct provision following the assessments; and the number that were deemed minors and placed in the care of Tusla.","asker":"1564","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":403,"content":"<p>The Department of Justice has the remit for immigration and international protection processes and it makes the final decision as to whether someone will be considered as a minor during their application for international protection.

The schemes objectives are to promote (i) a reduction in child poverty, (ii) positive child development outcomes, (iii) labour market activation and (iv) improved quality.  <\/p>  <p>  The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of those families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children. <\/p>  <p>  By making this fundamental shift away from the legacy schemes where subsidies are grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families, the NCS aims to improve children&rsquo;s outcomes, improve labour market participation and reduce child poverty. It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof and assist people in exiting the poverty trap.<\/p>  <p>  Within this framework, an income-related subsidy is payable for children up to 15 years of age. The subsidy level is determined by the family&rsquo;s income and the child's age. The number of hours subsidised is determined by the parent's employment or education arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is also built to ensure that families are supported to access a minimum level of early learning and childcare provision to support positive child outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  During term time, the child's development needs are generally met through school participation.<\/p>  <p>  Households on incomes of less than &euro;26,000 NET can access full subsidies of up to &euro;225 per child, per week, covering up to 45 hours week. To access 45 hours rather than 20 hours, the parent must be in some type of employment or be engaged in training. <\/p>  <p>  The definition of work or study is broad, covering all forms of work or study arrangements: full-time, part-time, week-on\/week-off and zero hour contracts.  Moreover, the minimum hours required to engage in work or study to qualify for up to 45 hours per week is very low &ndash; at just two hours per week. In this way, the NCS encourages parents to exit poverty and deliver better outcomes for their children.<\/p>  <p>  Underpinned by this approach is strong evidence that shows how growing up in poverty negatively impacts on child outcomes.  Taking up work or engaging in training, even a very low number of hours, is key to enabling families to break that cycle and that is what the NCS is designed in part to support. <\/p>  <p>  It also reflects the need to ensure that our systems recognise the critical role of family in children&rsquo;s lives. Particularly where those families are available to care for their children.<\/p>  <p>  Alleviation of poverty was at the heart of the development of the scheme. Much of the research concentrated on the direct impact it would have on low income households.<\/p>  <p>  The 2016 policy paper which formed the basis for the National Childcare undertook an extensive analysis of the how the scheme would impact this in poverty and in low income households. It  highlighted the dangers of poverty traps in childcare schemes, particularly where there is a risk of steep rises in childcare costs where a parent returns to work. Such traps undermine the incentive to take-up or increase employment.  Therefore the NCS was designed to counteract this disincentive effect, through a smooth taper rate across the income assessed subsidies, and also through a transition from unemployment to work\/study which increases the number of hours available.<\/p>  <p>  The policy was informed by national and international evidence and advocacy on measures to prevent poverty (including inter-generational poverty). The policy sought to strike the right balance between enabling early learning and care services or indeed school age childcare services, to meet the needs of children in terms of their positive development and tackling a significant contributor to poverty and poorer outcomes for children of non-work households.<\/p>  <p>  There is strong evidence that growing up in poverty has negative impacts on child outcomes. For example, according to the ESRI study Understanding Childhood Deprivation in Ireland (Watson et al., 2012), the longer-term impacts of poverty among children include lower levels of educational achievement, emotional and behavioural problems, and poorer health outcomes.<\/p>  <p>   The research evidence suggests that parental employment is a key factor in protecting children from poverty and deprivation. The ESRI \/ Watson study concluded that parental unemployment is a significant risk factor in determining deprivation rates among children, with particularly high deprivation rates where a parent has never worked, or in lone parent households, or where the mother has no educational qualifications.<\/p>  <p>  Childcare costs in Ireland (prior to the NCS) have been found to be a significant factor in contributing to low levels of participation in employment, education and training for mothers, particularly for lone parents. The NCS makes childcare much more affordable, and in some instances free to parents.<\/p>  <p>   Research by Melhuish et al. (2015) and Sylva et al (2004), in the NCS policy paper indicates that positive children&rsquo;s outcomes are for the most part met through part-time participation. This research has been used internationally in the design of various interventions. (DCEDIY is extremely grateful to have one of those authors, Prof Melhuish from Oxford University, on the Funding Model Expert Group.)<\/p>  <p>   Melhuish and Sylva's research points to the fact that young children do not need to be in early learning and care for full time hours to meet their child development needs. As such, many schemes around the world are based on 15 to 20 hours per week. In Ireland's case, the State is now providing two years of free pre-school to all children before they start school for 15 hours per week. The NCS  provides 20 hours of subsidised early learning and care per week where a parent is available at home, for children aged from six months, or 20 hours of school age childcare in non- term\/ non ECCE time.<\/p>  <p>  The OECD&rsquo;s study Faces of Joblessness in Ireland, which included an ex ante analysis of the impact of the National Childcare Scheme, stressed the impact of work incentives on joblessness. It reported positively on the likely impact of the NCS.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst recognising these general principles, for children living in exceptional circumstances of disadvantage or need, the NCS sponsorship arrangement is designed so that they can access free early learning and care or school age childcare for longer or full time hours where required.<\/p>  <p>  The DCEDIY is committed to keeping the scheme under review and to assess whether it is meeting its objectives. I have contracted Frontier Economics to undertake a review of the National Childcare Scheme in line with Section 26 of the Childcare Support Act. <\/p>  <p>  Variations on the concept of a work\/study test is widely used around the wold and I have also requested that Frontier review the usage and evidence of efficacy of this approach in other countries.<\/p>  <p>  This work is due to be finalised in the final quarter of this year and will inform in an evidence based manner the future development of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200075#WRK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":436,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200075#WRK02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Education","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200075#WRK02000"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[45287\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200075#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps he will take to ensure that in-person lectures at a university (details supplied) recommence in alignment with other third-level institutions.","asker":"1553","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[45288\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200075#WRK02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will engage with the provost of a university (details supplied) to ensure that in-person lectures at the college recommence in a similar way to other third-level institutions.","asker":"1553","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":438,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[45466\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200075#WRK02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he has engaged with representatives from a university (details supplied) on its decision to delay the return of in-person learning; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":439,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147, 148 and 153 together.<\/p>  <p>  Following Government approval, I published A Safe Return: Plan for a safe return to on-site Further and Higher Education and Research in 2021\/22 on 15th June.

The principal amendment introduced under the Act extended the three-year cap on contributions to farms and businesses owned by scheme participants, on the condition that these continue to be managed by a family successor for a certain period. The goal of this amendment is to assist in protecting the viability and sustainability of family farms and family run businesses. The timeline set out in the legislation ensures that the Act will be operational by the 20 October 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The 2021 full year cost of this measure is estimated at &euro;10.30m, reducing to &euro;10.20m per annum in 2022 and 2023, with an additional per annum cost of &euro;3.75m (&euro;13.95m) being realised in 2024.<\/p>  <p>  Under the NHSS Act 2009, a participant in the Fair Deal scheme contributes to costs at 7.5% against the value of their principal residence for their first three years in care; after this, the contributions from the residence is capped. However, if they then sold the residence, the resulting cash asset would be assessable indefinitely. The NHSS Amendment Act 2021 changed this, so that the three-year cap is also applied to the cash proceeds of sale of a principal residence, as long as the residence is sold after an individual enters long-term care. This amendment ensures that the value of the PPR continues to be protected for families, whether the home is sold before or after the resident leaves care. It also removes a disincentive against the sale of vacant properties, in the context of the government&rsquo;s Housing for All strategy. <\/p>  <p>  The costs of this amendment were estimated at a total of &euro;6.5m annually.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200080#WRP02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":666,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200080#WRP02500"},{"type":"question","counter":667,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[45530\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200080#WRP02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons on the waiting list for gynaecology appointments; the waiting times for urgent and routine referrals in 2019, 2020 and to date in 2021, tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":668,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[45535\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200080#WRP02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the waiting times for gynaecological appointments in Letterkenny University Hospital for routine and urgent referrals in 2019, 2020 and to date in 2021, in tabular form.","asker":"1462","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":669,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[45536\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021092200080#WRP02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the waiting times for inpatient and outpatient gynaecological appointments at each hospital across the seven hospital groups in tabular form; if this information will be provided specifically regarding those waiting for three, six, nine, 12 or more than 12 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":670,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 225, 230 and 231 together.<\/p><p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last eighteen months as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently as a result of the ransomware attack. While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.<\/p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p><p>An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists. <\/p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working on a Multiannual Waiting List Plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.<\/p><p>My Department continues to work with the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme to improve access and ensure a more sustainable gynaecology service. The Programme has developed an Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care which centres on the establishment of one-stop &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; ambulatory gynaecology clinics.  The roll out of the Model of Care commenced in 2020, and funding has been provided under Budget 2021 to establish and\/or expand services across additional clinics in 2021, including a clinic at Letterkenny University Hospital (LUH).<\/p><p>The HSE has advised that the new ambulatory gynaecology clinic at LUH is operational. Building on progress made since 2020 and, subject to resource availability, it is envisaged that up to a total of 20 ambulatory gynaecology clinics will be rolled out across the country, on a phased basis, in the coming years.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy concerning gynaecology waiting lists is outlined in the attached documents.<\/p><p>Gynaecology Outpatient Waiting List By
