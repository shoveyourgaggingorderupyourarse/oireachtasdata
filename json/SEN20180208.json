The issue arises regularly in our constituency offices.<\/p> <p>I assure the Senator that the prompt processing of applications remains a priority for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Each scheme area is continually monitored and reviewed to ensure customers are responded to as quickly as possible, and their applications are processed as expeditiously as possible.<\/p> <p>Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision-making process.  Delays can also arise where information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.  This means that processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  For example, in December 2017, it took on average one week to award a jobseeker's benefit payment, which is based on social insurance contributions, but two weeks to award a jobseeker's allowance payment, which is means-tested.  In the same month, it took on average ten weeks to award an application for carer's benefit, which is based on a medical assessment as to care requirements, an assessment of the level of care being provided and social insurance contributions, whereas it took an average 17 weeks to award an application for carer's allowance, which has similar medical and care provision conditionality but which is means-tested.<\/p> <p>As part of the Department's programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure processing capability is maximised.  For example, staff have been reassigned within the carer's allowance area to work on claims processing, and it is expected that this will improve the processing times for this scheme over the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>The staffing needs for all areas within the Department are continually reviewed, taking account of workloads, management priorities and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department.<\/p> <p>As with all Departments and agencies, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is required to operate within a staff ceiling figure and a commensurate administrative staffing budget, which for this Department has involved reductions in staff numbers.  Reducing waiting times is a key priority.

The tests are conducted every summer without ever being subject to a comprehensive environmental impact assessment. <br\/><br\/>In July 2017 when the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, granted consent to drill in the Porcupine Bank area, I spoke to the Seanad about how fossil fuel exploration was deadly for Ireland&rsquo;s sealife and how drilling and seismic airgun testing led to deafness and disorientation among dolphins, whales and porpoises for up to 100 miles.  A deaf whale is a dead whale.  In fact, over Christmas I helped with the removal of a dead bottlenose dolphin which had been stranded on Tramore beach.  We sent the remains to University College Cork for an autopsy to discover why it had died.  The number of strandings recorded has increased by 30% since 2016 alone.  I have spoken about how in June 1991 the Government made Ireland a whale and dolphin sanctuary.  I inform the House that new research from the ObSERVE programme, commissioned in 2015 by the petroleum affairs division of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, shows that, as amazing as our seas were to warrant protected status, we have actually overlooked just how incredible they are. <br\/><br\/>A few days after making my speech and mere weeks after consent to drill in the area was given, Ireland&rsquo;s deepest cold water coral reefs were found in the Porcupine Bank.  Also in late 2017, UCC, from research commissioned by the Department&rsquo;s ObSERVE programme, released information which showed that every summer 250,000 bottlenose dolphins came to Irish waters; that last year Ireland had the highest numbers of blue and fin whale sightings ever recorded; and that there were 50% more whales and dolphins in our waters than we had ever thought possible.  The blue whale is the largest mammal on the planet, while the fin whale is second largest and they are both to be found in Irish waters.<br\/><br\/>To give an example of this incredible ocean wealth, let me focus on the Porcupine Bank area off the south west coast of County Kerry, near the Cathaoirleach's homeland.  The Porcupine Bank is home to some of the deepest and most unique cold water coral reefs ever found.  Along the cliff face in 2015 the <i>Celtic Explorer<\/i>found near vertical habitats full of species of coral, sponges, crab and fish.  Last year the <i>Granuaile<\/i>found reefs at depths of 1,600 m in areas of the Porcupine Bank and continental shelf which had already been licensed for oil and gas exploration.  Coral reefs are the building blocks of a healthy and flourishing marine ecosystem.  They provide food and shelter and are breeding grounds and refuges for fish.  They balance the ecosystem at a time of increased ocean acidification due to climate change.  They are also essential in providing support for krill and plankton &ndash; the basis of the marine ecosystem.  However, since 2013 the level of oil and gas exploration in the Porcupine Bank has intensified to the point where it is now the primary focus of fossil fuel exploration in Ireland.  The surprise is that the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in the first place risks seismic exploration or drilling in the Porcupine Bank area when it is the home of healthy mackerel spawning grounds and, formerly, large migrating tuna populations.  Ireland&rsquo;s biggest fishing quota and thus our biggest industry under the Common Fisheries Policy is for mackerel.  As I have stated before, seismic testing kills 100% of krill, or zooplankton, larvae and 64% of adult krill for a distance of up to 0.7 miles.  Fishermen are reporting a dramatic fall in the tuna and whale populations in the Porcupine Bank area and that certain species no longer live there.  This is most likely due to the kill-off of krill larvae as a result of the five years of oil and gas exploration and seismic testing.<br\/><br\/>I ask the Government to carry out as soon as possible an environmental impact assessment of the area of the Porcupine Bank where it is conducting research to ensure we will have the evidence to prove to the Minister of State and the Government that we must keep oil in the ground.  We have to support the Bill before the House today.  I ask the Minister of State for his answer to that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#A00900","speaker":"1385","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this very topical issue.  The Government is fully committed to tackling climate change and protecting the oceans, but it has no plans to ban oil and gas prospecting offshore.  Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon energy future will involve progressively moving to lower emission fuels, for example, moving initially from peat and coal to natural gas and, ultimately, towards an even greater reliance on renewable energy.  In that regard, the Government has introduced a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and deliver energy efficiency.  However, oil and natural gas will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in the transition period.<\/p><p>The Corrib gas field demonstrates the impact indigenous supplies can have on Ireland&rsquo;s import dependency.  It went from importing 89% of its overall energy needs in 2015 to 70% in 2016.  However, production from the Corrib gas field will peak and decline from 2019 onwards.  Thereafter we will become increasingly dependent on imports of gas and be dependent on imports for 100% of our oil.<\/p><p>I note that the Minister of State with responsibility for natural resources has invited the joint committee to hold a broad policy debate on national energy policy to consider issues of competitiveness, sustainability, security of energy supply and Ireland&rsquo;s offshore exploration policy.  Such a debate would inform future legislation in this area.<\/p><p>The Government was not in a position to support the Solidarity Bill debated in the D&aacute;il yesterday evening.  If passed ,it would not reduce Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions or change or reduce our use of fossil fuels.  It would, however, lock Ireland into permanent dependency on imports to meet our future fossil fuel needs after the decline in supplies from the Corrib gas field.<\/p><p>There are several elements to regulating the industry's exploration activities offshore.  In 2015 the Irish offshore strategic environmental study, IOSEA5, process was completed with the adoption of a plan underpinning IOSEA5 and publication of the IOSEA5 statement.  The objectives of IOSEA5 were to inform the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment of specific environmental considerations in its future petroleum activities in licensing rounds in the Atlantic margin basins, as well as informing the award of licences in the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea and providing exploration companies working offshore with an operational baseline against which they could conduct their work and ensure the protection of the marine environment.<\/p><p>Applicants to the Department are required to submit an environmental impact risk assessment and a Natura impact screening appropriate assessment statement in support of their application to commence surveying or exploration drilling activities.  A review is undertaken for the Department by an independent consultancy appointed for its expertise in ecological and conservation marine biology.  The review of the application considers,<i>inter alia<\/i>, the effects of seismic sources on adult fish, as well as eggs and larvae, based on the information provided in the application and additional scientific sources.  There are also other steps, including consultation with fishing representative bodies, a requirement to have marine mammal observers on board vessels and engagement with fishery liaison officers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#B00200","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I know that the Senator is very passionate about this issue, but we are well over time.

I can see Turlough Hill from my kitchen window.  The water is pumped up at night with energy generated from off-peak wind.  It is the most clean and effective of all types of renewable energy but that would not be allowed to be developed nowadays.  In the late 1960s it was considered a miracle.  Environmentalists would not let us do it anymore.

The work sought to ensure there would be benefit to the State from profits accruing.  I accept that we have moved on and we continue to make progress.

I acknowledge the presence of the senior Minister this morning.  It is a great honour to have him here.  I compliment him on the good work he has done, in particular the work he is doing with the national planning framework in recent weeks and months.<\/p> <p>I tabled this Commencement debate on the Flemish decree made in 2013.  It is a European Court of Justice ruling that has been rolling on and has been debated in many quarters ever since.  Employment is a big issue in rural areas but housing is even more significant.  This decree has brought uncertainty to one-off rural housing and who can apply for it.  The issue has been debated in many local authorities, communities and households because of the fear that it could go one of two ways.  It could open up such housing to everyone, which could have a major impact on the environment, or it might restrict it too much.  I believe there is a middle ground that must be explored.  The Flemish decree affects the \"locals only\" designation, which is a significant issue for rural areas.  If we do not have a thriving one-off housing market that allows people who were born and bred in a locality to live there then communities will become eroded.  We must ensure that communities are fostered.  In order for that to happen we need to make provision for the development of one-off housing so that people who are from a community can live there.<\/p> <p>The decline of rural areas is a significant issue.  The sustainability of rural areas and such housing are crucial issues for society.  Clarity is required.  Before the national planning framework, NPF, is announced the Government must make its views clear on housing policy for one-off housing and whether only people actively involved in farming will be granted planning permission or if permission for such housing will be based on social and economic grounds.  The latter is the key to ensuring rural communities survive.  If social and economic grounds are not accepted then, unfortunately, the knock-on effect will mean the decline we have seen in the past two or three decades will continue.  I urge the Minister to provide clarity on this important issue in order that we can move on together.  Clarity on one-off rural housing is necessary for councils and people in rural communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#C00600","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Lombard for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position regarding the impact of the Flemish decree case on one-off housing in rural areas, and to provide an update on the revision of the 2005 planning guidelines on sustainable rural housing issued under section 28 of the Planning Act and also to clarify some misconceptions regarding rural policies on the issue contained in the national planning framework.<\/p> <p>Under the 2005 guidelines planning authorities are required to frame the planning policies in their development plans in a balanced and measured way that ensures the housing needs of rural communities are met, while avoiding excessive urban-generated housing and haphazard development, particularly in those areas near cities and towns that are under pressure from urban generated development.<\/p> <p>The guidelines also aim to ensure that sites being developed for rural housing are suitable with regard to vehicular access, wastewater disposal and also from landscape and design perspectives.  The guidelines suggest a number of criteria to be taken into account in local authority development plans for the purpose of assessing whether planning applications for rural housing are intended to meet a rural-generated housing need.  That need will only increase as the population grows in the future.  Those criteria primarily relate to familial or occupational ties of planning applicants to the rural area in question.  The European Commission issued an infringement notice against Ireland in relation to the rural housing guidelines in 2007, which was subsequently deferred pending the outcome of the European Court of Justice, ECJ, Flemish decree case against Belgium.  The decree linked the transfer of property in certain Flemish communes to the condition that there should exist a sufficient connection between the prospective property buyer and the relevant commune.  This connection had the practical effect of precluding non-locals from purchasing property in the Flemish communes in question.<\/p> <p>In 2013, the ECJ ruled that the Flemish decree constituted an unjustified restriction on fundamental freedoms under the EU Treaty, in particular that it breached Article 43 of the treaty on the freedom of movement of citizens.  Further to the ECJ judgment, the European Commission re-engaged with my Department on the 2005 guidelines.  Arising from that and further subsequent engagement between my Department and the European Commission, a working group - comprising senior representatives from my Department and planning authorities - was established last May to review and, where necessary, recommend changes to the 2005 guidelines, to ensure that rural housing policies and objectives contained in county development plans comply with the relevant provisions of the EU Treaty without undermining rural communities.  The working group concluded its deliberations in September 2017 and my Department is now consulting with the European Commission on the matter, with a view to issuing revised guidelines to planning authorities, as soon as possible after the finalised national planning framework is adopted and published.  Planning authorities, and where appropriate, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, will be required to apply the revised guidelines in relation to the assessment and determination of planning applications and appeals in respect of rural housing proposals.  Pending the issuing of the proposed new revised guidelines, planning authorities were advised by way of circular letter issued by my Department in May 2017 that the existing 2005 guidelines remain in place, and that they should not amend the rural housing local needs policies in their development plans until the revised guidelines have issued.<\/p> <p>In relation to broader rural policies, the Senator is no doubt aware that the national planning framework is currently being finalised by the Government - he has championed a number of policies in it - and while its remit goes much further than rural settlement, today's debate gives me a good opportunity to quell any misplaced fears that may have been generated that the framework will present some sort of clampdown on rural housing.  That is far from the truth.  It is in fact unhelpful and detracts from wider and more strategic messages in the NPF around linking our planning vision with our capital investments and new tools to deliver sustainable development, both urban and rural.  I wish to make it clear that the NPF fully supports the concept of living in the countryside.  Nothing in it suggests any sort of a policy shift from what local authorities are supposed to be doing at the moment in terms of implementing the rural housing guidelines, which is broadly to apply a general siting and design-based policy across the country for the purposes of determining rural housing planning applications and in some limited areas around the main cities and towns that are under genuine pressure from significant unco-ordinated and ribbon type development, to ensure that in such areas, housing need should be determined by social, economic or occupational linkages to the rural area in question.<\/p> <p>Moreover, while the framework endorses a more rigorous approach to assessment of housing needs in general, the reference to a housing demand need assessment, HDNA, is very simply a local authority-led comprehensive assessment of the housing needs of its area, in other words assessing the housing expected to be built within the area, including in rural areas.  In a nutshell, what the NPF is really calling for is a properly planned approach to identifying, meeting and managing the real housing needs arising in rural areas.  There is nothing to fear in it.  Like Senator Lombard, I believe in balance when it comes to planning throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#C00700","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>If I ever go back to college I will do a thesis on rural planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#C00800","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I was thinking as much.

The British do not want to be in the customs union; they want to have their cake and eat it.  It now appears that the Irish Government will have to fight again.<\/p> <p>The legislation that is supposed to come from Europe to put into legal effect the agreement signed up to by the UK in December which will clarify what is meant by having by no divergence is supremely critical to the Border.  I have explained, as many others have, that many Westminster MPs and Members of the House Lords have come over here and asked us for our ideas; they simply do not have any because they do not know where they want to get to in this Brexit journey.  Without knowing where they want to get to, they will find it very difficult to get there.<\/p> <p>Whatever agreement and legal text on what happens with the Border comes out of Europe in March is absolutely critical because that is the framework for the remainder of the negotiations between the EU and the UK.  The British were asleep at the wheel because they thought there would be a fudge allowing them to rumble on and solve it later.  However, there are Border issues on how trade will be conducted and what will be in or out of any agreement between the North and the South.  The DUP's insistence that there be no divergence between Northern Ireland and Britain would mean that there would be no divergence between Ireland and the UK which means in essence there would be no divergence between the UK and the EU.  At that point one has to ask what the purpose of Brexit is if it is for no divergence on all the issues and the UK has to sign up for all the issues and the customs union.<\/p> <p>Time and again it startles me when I meet Members of Parliament from Westminster who do not even know the basics.

I am not sure whether a specific response was given, which can happen, and I apologise if I am mistaken.  I refer to the emerging issue of the troubling over-prescribing of addictive and habit forming drugs.  Those of us who have been to the United States have often noted and a been a little disturbed by the predatory way drugs are advertised on television.  When we learned about the opioid crisis in America I must confess - perhaps due to an unconscious or accidental prejudice - that, frankly, I associated it with people who lived in trailer parks or were not discerning.  Recently, I had a conversation with a friend of mine who is both fortunate and successful in life and who comes from a very successful family.  He described how his mother had slipped into an addiction to prescription drugs and really struggled for a long time to be free of the problem, but even then I thought it was probably something that would not happen in more regulated and perhaps sensible European societies, yet, almost unknown to us, we have seen prescription drugs, by which I mean habit forming drugs, such as sleeping pills, pain relief tablets and anti-depressants being massively over-prescribed.  Senator Colm Burke focused mainly on the financial dimension, but there is the much more significant human dimension of people becoming addicted.  People are unaware of the trap because these are legal drugs.  We are talking about people who seek medicines to treat their conditions.  In 2016 President Trump described the American opioid crisis as a national emergency.  Where are we at in Ireland?  The number of prescriptions for one drug, Oxycodone, increased by 159% in the ten years from 2006 to 2016.  It is the very drug that is behind the opioid crisis in America.  It is a crisis that some say is killing up to 180 Americans a day, or perhaps a minimum of 100.  We need to examine closely the over-prescription of drugs in this country.  Dr. Emmet Curran, president of the National Association of General Practitioners, has said there is definitely over-prescribing.  As we have all seen what has happened in America, we cannot be complacent.  There is a money dimension.  Dr. Shari McDaid from the organisation Mental Health Reform has claimed there is a lack of talk therapy at all levels of the mental health service.  Loneliness in our society is another dimension about which we need to talk as part of our discussion on the issue.  I would be grateful, when it is convenient for him to do so, if we could hear from the Minister for Health what is being done to identify the extent of the problem and the way it is going to develop, what has happened and what will happen into the future and how we are going to tackle what is an emerging problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#H01500","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>On Tuesday the Leader easily accepted that implementation of the UN convention had to be led from the top.  To that end, the Taoiseach has a critical role to play.  Yesterday the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport heard from two people, one of whom was Ms Alannah Murray.  She said:<\/p><blockquote>My documentary on disability with the screen media industry toured the festival circuit and finished its festival run with an award win.  Another one of my films recently premiered in Portugal and was also award nominated.  I am a TEDx speaker.  I am also fluent in Irish.  I am about to graduate with a BA in film and production and have my eyes set on a Master&rsquo;s degree.  Like others like me, I am the future of our country.<\/blockquote> <p>Mr. Padraic Moran also spoke at the meeting.  He works for Sky Ireland as a service specialist.  He also works for East Coast FM as a production assistant, sports reporter and broadcast co-ordinator.  He spoke about his successful international career as a paralympian.<\/p><p>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, also attended the meeting.  He said transport boards must specifically include those with &quot;raw personal experience of disability.&quot;  He also said he would ensure the transport boards under his jurisdiction would include somebody with that experience and that they would be present and bang directly on the table, not others, if one likes, as proxies.  The committee is chaired by Deputy Fergus O'Dowd who took over from Deputy Brendan Griffin.  I acknowledge and thank my fellow Senators, Frank Feighan, John O'Mahony and P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, who strongly participated in the discussion yesterday.  There was also a strong turnout of Members of the Lower House for the debate.  <\/p><p>The Minister learned about what routinely happened to people with disabilities in using pubic transport.  He also got it that he was the boss of the public transport service in Ireland and that he needed to act.  Yesterday he set out a list of actions.  He  is one of 15 Ministers.  We are about to ratify the UN convention and the first part, the slow half, of the work is over.  At this stage it is all about implementation.  I say again that Ireland can get ahead and close out the game to finish the job of providing for emancipation, but we need leadership and direction from the top.  Every Minister must set out his or her action plan after he or she has listened to people with disabilities, in the process showing respect for their experiences which will still be difficult for many years to come.

It is something we seriously need to look at.  I ask that the Leader brings this to the attention of the Minister of Health, Deputy Harris, so that this fee is not a burden on a young person trying to return home, and so that the Department of Health covers whatever registration fees are required.

Procedures for hernias, gall bladders, plastic surgery, cataracts and so forth can all be done in day hospitals.  There are examples of many of these procedures being done in model three hospitals, such as Nenagh, St. John's Hospital in Limerick, Louth County Hospital and many others.

In May of last year the Supreme Court ruled that a blanket prohibition on asylum seekers working in Ireland was unconstitutional.

However, there are questions around the efficiency and effectiveness of the scheme.  For instance, let us consider the cost of a hip operation in the public unit at Letterkenny General Hospital.  The cost to the taxpayer is approximately &euro;5,500.  However, if someone goes across the Border to obtain the same procedure in a private hospital in the North, the cost is between &euro;9,000 and &euro;15,000.

In many cases, the work of Irish Water is seconded out to staff in the local authority.  The lines of responsibility are not clear.  Let me give some examples.  There was an issue with a water main and Irish Water dug up the road.  Having dealt with the issue, it did not reinstate the road.  A complaint was made to the council, but the local authority believes it is the responsibility of Irish Water to reinstate the road.  This is becoming a problem.  I suggest that we invite the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to the House to discuss these issues in depth.  The protocols are weak and if we do not deal with that now, it could prove to be a major problem in the future.  I certainly support Senator Lombard's call.

It is important that we have ongoing dialogue between Members of the Oireachtas and members of the UK Parliament, be it the House of Lords or the Commons, to explain and to influence the situation.  It is equally as important, and I am not sounding a partisan note, that we have devolved government in Stormont, with the politicians representing the communities from which they come, rather than having direct rule from the Government in the UK.

We have not demurred from any of the positions yet.<\/p><p>I have already responded to the issue of overprescribing when I addressed the comments of Senator Burke.  Senator Mullen is correct in saying that overprescribing has increased disproportionately in a decade.  I agree that overprescribing has a human consequence that does not get noticed until death, dependency or the need to access treatment or services to deal with it.  We need to highlight the issue of dependency to create awareness of how it has grown.<\/p><p>Prescribing is an issue for doctors and medics.  An independent case was taken by an individual doctor.  I agree with Senator Mullen and also with the report in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>that Senator Colm Burke referenced<i>. <\/i>The issue was raised at the Committee on Health yesterday.  I would be happy to arrange to have a debate on it in this House.  We are sleepwalking into a problem and we must take a proactive role in reducing dependency on prescription drugs and overprescribing.  Prescribing is a matter for individual doctors.  We need to have a conversation on the issue and I am happy to arrange it.<\/p><p>Senator Dolan raised the issue of public transport for people with disabilities.  As I said yesterday, it will require a whole-of-government approach and leadership from the top.  It is also important to recognise and to give credit to the public transport bodies.  There have been improvements and progress has been made around accessibility, but we have more road to travel.  The point was made yesterday at the joint committee that it is not just about the buses, Luas or DART service but also about the bus stop, ramp, lighting, and accessibility to the railway or DART station or to the bus stop.  The testimonies given at yesterday's committee meeting were powerful.  They showed that we need to treat people with respect and with dignity and we have to continue to do that.  It is unacceptable that people would have such a dreadful experience, as outlined to the committee.  I know from my work in Cork with the disability groups that it is a frustrating and terrible experience.  We should consider how, as Members of the Oireachtas, we can engage with each other on how we can make the issues highlighted by Senator Dolan more visible.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would be quite happy to work with the Senator in that regard and to have that debate in the House.

Equally, a developer, and I am not referring specifically to this case, is entitled to his or her good name and to have any facts and information put out about him or her to be accurate.

Democracy is about freedom of expression and the ability to come to the House and make contributions.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway spoke about the important issue of takeaway coffee cups and Senator Reilly referred to the Young Fine Gael campaign on non-compostable coffee cups.  This is an issue we should all be involved in.  We were educated on the plastic bag levy and on other things such as seat belts.  It is a gradual progression.  I know Senator Devine mentioned bringing one's own cup.  That is something we should look at.  We should think about how we can change.  The reusable cups are probably a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and I am happy to defer to it on that matter.<\/p> <p>On Senator Gallagher's contribution, we are bringing people home and recruiting them to work in our health care system.  The Senator is right that we must do more to retain people but also to attract people back.  We need to incentivise that and ensure that our best and brightest health care professionals return to our country.  That is a debate which we need to have and I would be happy to facilitate it.<\/p> <p>Senators Byrne and Kieran O'Donnell referred to the bus crash in Limerick yesterday.  I join both of them in paying tribute to the first responders, garda&iacute;, ambulance personnel, fire brigade personnel, county council staff, and health and hospital staff who worked so hard yesterday.  We should be thankful that there was no loss of life.  As Senator O'Donnell said, the bus was back today and there were people on it.  That is a wonderful thing to say but there is a need to have a review of our school bus transport system.  Some of it is franchised out to private operators.  There is a need to uphold standards and ensure that they are not minimal but exceptional, because we are talking about young children.<\/p> <p>I welcome the new jobs for Limerick the company 4site announced yesterday which Senator Byrne spoke about.  It is good to see more jobs in Limerick.  I am sure all Members of the House will agree that it is wonderful to see unemployment falling and more people back at work.<\/p> <p>Senator Devine raised the issue of home care packages and home help hours, on which I fundamentally agree with her.  There is a need to do more and provide more.  The Government is committed to it.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, secured &euro;25 million in funding for social care as part of the health budget this year.  This includes funding for home care supports, new home care packages, and a move away from acute hospitals into transition care beds, which is important.  We must work on that.  The HSE is developing a policy in respect of home care packages.  I fundamentally agree with the Senator.  We need to invest more of our health budget in health care packages to keep people at home, keep them out of our hospitals and, as the Deputy rightly said, avoid people being lonely and suffering from isolation.  It is a fundamental task which we all must aspire to deal with.  I make no apology for agreeing with the Senator on that issue and working with her on it.  It is an important issue.  I wish that the HSE and some in the Department of Health would recognise the importance of home care packages and the benefits they bring to people in our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#N00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#N00400","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Members of our families, our friends and our neighbours benefit from these packages.

It cannot be that.  It is about caring for the people who need that help.  That is being lost in some cases.  I am not saying that it is lost on Senator Devine.  I fundamentally agree with her on that particular point.  I am not familiar with the area she referred to.  If she wants to give me the information, I will forward it to the Minister.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is well aware of it, but I would be happy to take it up with her or with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on the Senator's behalf.<\/p> <p>Senator Reilly referred to the issue of the national development plan and day hospitals.  This goes back to my comment to Senator Devine.  It is about taking people out of our acute hospitals, building transitional care beds and creating day hospitals in which people can have procedures carried out and which will have step-down facilities.  That is fundamental to what we are trying to do as a Government in respect of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  It is about making services easier for people to access.  Senator Mark Daly referred to the emergency departments.  If we referred fewer people to emergency departments and had more primary care centres, it would also reduce the burden on the emergency departments.  It is part of an ongoing process that we must work through to eliminate overcrowding and to ensure that we have day care beds.<\/p> <p>Senator Wilson raised the issue of Ireland, Taiwan and the One China policy.  I agree with him.  There is a fundamental need to review how we deal with many different nations and governments.  The Taiwanese yearn to do more trade with us and to engage more with us from cultural, economic and social points of view.  We have seen successful Irish companies in Taipei and in many parts of Taiwan bringing in and creating jobs.  I understand the size of China and its importance but the One China policy could be looked at in the context of developing further economic and industrial links with Taiwan.  We have a very good representative of Taiwan in H.E. Simon S.K. Tu.  He works hard in reaching out through the chambers of commerce and in visiting different parts of the countries.  This is about having a two-way street.  I would be happy to have a debate in the House on that relationship.  This is an issue which, as Senator Wilson rightly illustrated, can bring benefit to our country.<\/p> <p>I also agree with Senator Wilson in respect of the cross-Border initiative and on the need for people to be able to access the finance at the outset.  I know they can get 90% of it back afterwards, but it is an important initiative and it has seen success.  People can be referred to the North of our country by their GP in respect of eyes and cataracts.  We need to see that initiative developed and I would be happy to invite the Minister in for a debate in that regard.<\/p> <p>Senator Butler raised the issue of the Church of Scientology and Ballivor.  I know that Senator Butler has been very involved in this issue with Councillor Noel French.  The issue is that Meath County Council has granted an exemption to the trust which Senator Butler mentioned.  It is important that we have a debate about the role of the Church of Scientology and the cult-like way in which it operates.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan raised the very important issue of direct provision and asylum seekers being able to work in our country.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, have been in the House and referred to the issue.  The Government is committed to the EU reception conditions directive and to people being able to work.  It is important to recognise that there is now an obligation on Government to transpose that Supreme Court decision into action.  I hope that will happen soon.  It needs to happen.  I accept that.<\/p> <p>Senator Mulherin raised the important issue of section 39 organisations.  I agree with her.  There is an anomaly.  The Cathaoirleach and I are familiar with Marymount Hospice in Cork where the workers fall under section 39 and are being paid less than their HSE equivalents.  There was a pay cut in some of the section 39 organisations which has not been restored.  There is need to see the service level agreement the HSE has with these section 39 organisations changed because if people are not paid properly, the agreement must be changed.  That service level agreement is about offering a suite of services which might include respite care, assessment for autism, and speech and language therapy among other things.  The review exercise which the Minister has initiated is fundamental to the issue which Senator Mulherin has raised.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I hope that, as a consequence of the review, staff in section 39 organisations such as those working in Marymount University Hospital and Hospice in Cork will have their pay restored.  The State should increase the block grants it provides to section 39 organisations to facilitate pay increases for workers. <br\/><br\/>To respond to Senator &Oacute; Domhnall, the Minister for Health has been in the House multiple times.  I like the Senator's suggestion of having a rolling debate.  We are having a series of debates on health.  The Minister appeared before the House last week to discuss emergency departments and will come to the House again to discuss other issues.  This process should continue as the topic raised by the Senator is an important one.<br\/><br\/>I disagree with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's analysis of health expenditure.  Ireland is among the top five countries in the world for spending <i>per capita<\/i>on health.  The health budget is higher than it has ever been.  The issue is not what we spend but how we spend it and ensuring there is accountability in the system.  The system must be reformed to deliver value for money, while also recognising that the patient is at the centre of what we do in the health system.  We can have an ongoing debate on health. <br\/><br\/>Senators Lombard and Kieran O'Donnell raised the issue of Irish Water.  Last week, I stated that Irish Water should resume its clinic for Members of the Oireachtas.  As the Senators correctly pointed out, Members are experiencing difficulties obtaining answers on specific issues that arise in communities.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell also noted that Irish Water is also outsourcing work.  The important issue is to ensure Irish Water resumes its clinics for Members of the Oireachtas because these give us, as public representatives, access to members of staff who can follow up on the issues we raise and revert to us with responses.  I have asked Irish Water to do this.  I will also ask the Minister to come to the House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#N00500","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518085800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518085800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 12.42 p.m. and resumed at 12.48 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Data Protection Bill 2018: Order for Second Stage","time":1518085800,"counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#O00400"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518085800,"counter":148,"content":"<p><\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I move: \"That Second Stage be taken now.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#O00600","speaker":"1423"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518085800,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Data Protection Bill 2018: Second Stage","time":1518085800,"counter":151,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#O00800"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518085800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to launch the Data Protection Bill 2018 in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

In a nutshell, this legislation will introduce stronger rules on data protection.  People will have more control over their personal data and businesses will benefit from a level playing field.  Members of this House will no doubt be aware of the general data protection regulation, generally referred to as the GDPR, of which there has been a great deal of debate both in Ireland and across the European Union.  The GDPR regulates the processing by an individual, a company or an organisation of personal data relating to individuals in the EU.  It does not apply to data processed by an individual for purely personal reasons or for activities carried out in a person&rsquo;s home provided there is no connection to a professional or commercial activity.  <br\/><br\/>The GDPR is a significant regulation and this Bill will give further effect to the GDPR as well as transposing the accompanying law enforcement directive into national law.  Furthermore, it will establish the data protection commission to replace the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  The GDPR enters into effect on 25 May next and the directive must be transposed into national law by early May.  Accordingly, I am hopeful that with the support of both Houses, this Bill will be signed into law and enter into force next May alongside the GDPR. I believe that the GDPR and this legislation will serve to make our data protection laws fit for purpose in the digital age.  <br\/><br\/>I am conscious that many people may be inclined to switch off at the mention of data protection because they see it as a technical issue, an issue that does not concern them directly.  That would be a mistake for the simple reason that the updated data protection rules entering into force in May next will affect all of us in one way or another.  It will affect each of us as individuals because it will increase our control over the manner in which, and the purposes for which, our own personal data is used.  It will affect businesses, be they large, medium or small, because it will require them to review and update the manner in which they collect, use or store the personal data of their customers, clients or any other individual whose personal data they retain.  The same applies to Government Departments and public bodies.  <br\/><br\/>The simple fact is that data protection law has not kept pace with the many technological advances and new business models such as cloud computing that have emerged in recent years.  Our current data protection law, which is based on the EU's 1995 data protection directive, predates mass Internet usage, hand-held devices, apps, games, social networking and data analytics, all of which involve the collection and processing of our personal data, often for purposes that are opaque and largely unknown to us.  The basic data protection principles set out in the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 will remain largely unchanged following the entry into force of the GDPR in May next.  However, the GDPR's provisions will strengthen our control over our own personal data and the purposes for which it may be used.  <br\/><br\/>Increased transparency is essential to increased control.  In future, all information must be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible format using clear and plain language.  It will no longer be acceptable to direct users to terms and conditions written in legal jargon.  The obligations placed on companies and public sector bodies that collect, use and store personal data are set to increase but will do so in a measured and proportionate manner.  The compliance burden will increase for some but that will be proportionate to risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals arising from any accidental or unlawful loss or disclosure of, or access to, their personal data.  By proportionate, I mean that for SMEs where data processing is not a core part of the business and where the company's activity does not create risks for individuals, some obligations of the GDPR will not apply, for example, the appointment of a data protection officer, DPO.  The new obligations will inevitably pose a greater challenge for bodies, be they in the public or private sectors, that specialise in data processing and for those handling, for example, customers' financial data or patients' sensitive health data.  <br\/><br\/>While large companies have been gearing up for the entry into force of the GDPR for some time, it is likely that the SME sector and micro-enterprises will continue to require assistance and support during the coming period of adjustment.  Awareness-raising activities have been under way for the last year and a half involving conferences, seminars and workshops and those activities will continue.The Minister of State, Deputy Breen, who has special responsibility in this policy area, has been very active in promoting awareness of the changes to come and I know he has an ambitious schedule planned for the coming months.  Practical guidance is also vital and I strongly recommend the Data Protection Commissioner's web page <i>www.gdprandyou.ie<\/i>.  It contains a wealth of useful information and practical guidance for both business and individuals.  <br\/><br\/>High data protection standards are in everyone's interests, including the interests of business.  The harmonised rules set out in the GDPR and the Data Protection Bill will ensure that the same data protection safeguards will operate across the EU.  This will provide a level playing field for businesses, especially those involved in the cross-border provision of goods and services.  In this context, it is worth remembering that exports are a critical aspect of our strong economy.  Enhanced data protection standards will also be beneficial to the increasing numbers who avail of the Government's online services.  <br\/><br\/>To make the enhanced protections meaningful, public and private enforcement of data protection law is set to increase.  The data protection commission will in future have stronger supervisory and enforcement powers as well as a broader range of sanctions at its disposal, including the possibility of administrative fines.  The scope for compensation claims arising from infringements of data protection rules will also increase resulting in higher levels of private enforcement activity.  <br\/><br\/>This Government is committed to achieving the full potential of the digital economy and its capacity to promote innovation, create jobs and boost economic activity in the State.  We already host many of the world's leading digital companies and they provide their services well beyond our shores.  That number will increase in the future.  The GDPR, together with the provisions of this legislation, will ensure that data processing involved in the provision of these services will meet the highest data protection standards and the establishment of the data protection commission will ensure effective supervision and enforcement of these high standards.  <br\/><br\/>Following protracted negotiations, the GDPR was agreed in early 2016 and will, as I mentioned, enter into force across the EU on 25 May 2018.  An accompanying directive, which establishes data protection standards for the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences and the execution of criminal penalties, requires to be transposed into national law by 6 May 2018.  <br\/><br\/>Both the GDPR and the directive have a legal basis in Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and provide for significant reforms to current data protection rules based on the EU's 1995 data protection directive.  Both instruments generally provide for higher standards of data protection for individuals and impose increased obligations on bodies in the public and private sectors that process personal data.  They also increase the range of possible sanctions for infringements of these standards and obligations.  <br\/><br\/>The GDPR seeks to provide for a uniform interpretation and application of data protection standards across the EU thereby providing a level playing field for all those doing business in the EU digital market.  The European data protection board, a new entity that will replace the current advisory committee and that will be made up of representatives of the data protection authorities of all member states, will play an important role in this respect.  <br\/><br\/>At the heart of both the GDPR and the directive is a risk-based approach to data protection.  This means that each individual controller and processor is required to put appropriate technical and organisational measures in place in order to ensure and, importantly, to be able to demonstrate that its processing of personal data complies with the new data protection standards.  I would remind Senators that the terms &quot;controller&quot; and &quot;processor&quot; apply to us too.  Those of us involved in the handling of constituents' queries, requests and representations are data controllers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Any operator of an off-site storage facility for files containing personal data is a processor.  This is an issue for the Oireachtas in a most direct way.<\/p><p>For the purposes of assessing the nature, level and likelihood of risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals, controllers and processors must have regard to the nature, scope, context and purposes of their data processing activities.  In certain cases, this will in future require the carrying out of a data protection impact assessment in order to take steps to mitigate such risks.  Where mitigation measures are not feasible, prior consultation with the data protection commission will be mandatory.<\/p><p>The GDPR and the directive place greatly increased emphasis on the transparency of processing, the responsibility of the controller and processor for compliance with data protection standards, and the need for appropriate security standards in order to protect against data breaches, such as unauthorised or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction and damage.  The GDPR and the directive impose an obligation on all public authorities and bodies, as well as some private sector bodies, to designate a data protection officer with responsibility to oversee data processing operations and to report data breaches to the relevant data protection authority.  The GDPR also limits the grounds for lawful processing of personal data by public authorities and bodies.  For example, depending on the circumstances, an individual's consent to the processing of his or her personal data may not provide a reliable basis for such processing by a public authority.  The so-called legitimate interest ground in Article 6.1(f) of the GDPR will no longer be available to public authorities when acting in their public capacity.<\/p><p>The GDPR and the directive provide for increased supervision and enforcement of data protection standards by the data protection authorities of member states, including the future data protection commission.  The GDPR provides for the possible imposition of substantial administrative fines of up to &euro;10 million, &euro;20 million or 2% or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year.  I will return to the fines issue shortly.<\/p><p>The liability of controllers and processors will be broadened to include non-material damage such as distress.  In future, an individual who has suffered material or non-material damage because of a breach of his or her data protection rights under the GDPR or this legislation will have the right to seek compensation in the courts.<\/p><p>I will turn to the purpose and structure of the Bill.  The key purposes of the Bill are as follows: to give further effect to the GDPR in the areas in which member state flexibility is permitted; to transpose the directive into national law; to establish the data protection commission as the State's data protection authority with the means to supervise and enforce the protection standards enshrined in the GDPR and directive in an efficient and effective manner; and to enact consequential amendments to various Acts that contain references to the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.<\/p><p>The Bill, which is lengthy and complex in nature, comprises the following parts.  Part 1, comprising sections 1 to 8, inclusive, contains a number of standard provisions, for example, citation, commencement and definitions.  Section 7 makes provision for repeals while section 8 defines the residual scope of the 1988 Act.<\/p><p>Part 2, comprising sections 9 to 27, inclusive, establishes the data protection commission to replace the Data Protection Commissioner as the State's data protection authority.  Its primary task will be to act as the supervisory authority for the purposes of the GDPR and the directive.  Establishment of the commission, comprising at least one and not more than three commissioners, is a future-proofing provision to allow, should the need arise, for the appointment of additional commissioners in response to an increased commission workload.<\/p><p>Part 3, comprising sections 28 to 55, inclusive, gives further effect to the GDPR in a number of areas, mainly affecting the public sector, in which the regulation gives member states a margin of flexibility.  In certain cases, this involves the creation of a regulation-making power that will permit the making of more detailed regulations in due course.<\/p><p>Part 4, comprising sections 56 to 62, inclusive, contains a number of provisions that are consequential on replacement of the Data Protection Commissioner with the data protection commission.  The intention is to provide for a smooth and frictionless transition from current arrangements to the new structure.<\/p><p>Part 5, comprising sections 63 to 99, inclusive, transposes the law enforcement directive's provisions into national law.  Part 6, comprising sections 100 to 151, inclusive, contains provisions dealing with enforcement of the obligations and rights set out in the GDPR and directive by the data protection commission.  The intention is to ensure effective supervision and enforcement mechanisms, together with the necessary procedural and due process safeguards.  Part 7, comprising sections 152 to 157, inclusive, contains a number of miscellaneous provisions mainly concerning the application of data protection rules to the courts and a number of related legal matters.  Part 8, comprising sections 158 to 162, inclusive, contains consequential amendments to a number of Acts.<\/p><p>As regards substance, the explanatory and financial memorandum that accompanies the Bill contains much detail.  I do not intend, therefore, to delve into all of the Bill's provisions.  However, I wish to take the opportunity to highlight a number of issues and, in particular, to refer to Part 5, which transposes the law enforcement directive into national law.<\/p><p>Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill contain provisions concerning the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.  While Article 2.2(a) of the GDPR provides that its provisions do not apply to the processing of personal data in the course of an activity falling outside the scope of EU law, there has been considerable uncertainty about the scope of that exclusion in light of evolving Court of Justice case law.  A detailed analysis of relevant Court of Justice case law by the Office of the Attorney General has concluded that this exclusion is essentially limited in practice to data processing in the context of national security, defence and the international relations of the State.<\/p><p>While national security and defence lie outside the scope of EU law, the Council of Europe's 1981 data protection convention - Convention 108 - contains provisions that apply to data processing for these purposes.  The process of updating and modernising this convention is under way in Strasbourg, but that process has not concluded.  Pending the updating of Convention 108, section 8 proposes to confine the scope of the Data Protection Act 1988 to data processing in the context of national security, defence and the international relations of the State.  On completion of that process, it will be possible to update the content of this legislation by means of an amending Act and to repeal the 1988 Act.  All key data protection standards will then be found in a single consolidated Act.<\/p><p>The GDPR contains a \"consistency mechanism\", or so-called one-stop-shop, which is intended to streamline the handling of data protection infringements and complaints across the EU.  For this purpose, it employs the concept of a lead supervisory authority, that is, the data protection authority of the member state in which a controller's \"main\" or only EU establishment is located.  It means that complaints will be investigated by the data protection authority of that member state irrespective of the member state of origin of the complaint.  That data protection authority may request assistance from other authorities for investigation purposes, but the initial decision as to whether an infringement has occurred or is occurring will be the responsibility of the lead authority.<\/p><p>Before arriving at any final decision in cross-border cases, the lead authority must submit a draft decision to the other data protection authorities that have an interest in the case for their views and must have regard to any objection received from them.  If there are remaining objections to a revised draft decision, it may trigger a referral of the case to the European Data Protection Board, EDPB, which comprises representatives of all supervisory authorities, for a binding decision.  The EDPB will make a binding decision by majority vote, which may or may not coincide with the revised draft decision of the lead supervisory authority.<\/p><p>This mechanism has a special significance for Ireland, since many multinational companies that provide digital services across the EU and beyond have their headquarters here.  This means that the data protection commission and its handling of cross-border complaints will be the focus of particular and sustained attention across the EU.<\/p><p>This is the backdrop to the proposals in Part 2 of the Bill to establish a data protection commission with at least one but not more than three commissioners.  While there are no specific plans at present to increase the number of commissioners, significant levels of additional financial and staffing resources have been allocated to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in recent years in order to prepare for the expected workload increases following the entry into force of the GDPR and this legislation.  Staff resources have trebled from 30 in 2013 to more than 90 currently.  Additional funding of &euro;4 million in 2018 will bring the overall budget to approximately &euro;11.7 million, which will facilitate the recruitment of additional staff, bringing the total to in or around 140.<\/p><p>In order to underline and further enhance the independence of the commission as required by the GDPR and Court of Justice case law, the commissioner will be the Accounting Officer of a separate financial Vote.  This is covered in sections 25 and 156, respectively.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Commencement of these provisions will take place when the necessary procedures for a separate Vote are in place.<br\/><br\/>Article 8 of the GDPR specifies a &quot;digital age of consent&quot; of 16 years but allows member states to lower it, but not below 13 years.<br\/><br\/>This means that where information society services are offered directly to children, the processing of a child's personal data will be lawful only if, and to the extent that, consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.  In such cases, the service provider must make reasonable efforts to verify that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.<br\/><br\/>In late 2016, my Department launched a consultation process and invited submissions from interested parties on the digital age of consent to apply in this jurisdiction under Article 8.  The Government Data Forum, which brings together legal and data protection experts and business representatives from SMEs and multinationals, in addition to sociologists, psychologists and education specialists, also carried out a consultation process.  A majority of respondents, including the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, the Internet Safety Advisory Committee and the Children's Rights Alliance, recommended setting the digital age of consent at 13 years.<br\/><br\/>When appearing before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality for the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill last July, the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, also recommended setting the digital age of consent at 13 years.  This recommendation was adopted by the committee in its report, published last November.  <br\/><br\/>The Government considers that a digital age of consent of 13 years represents an appropriate balancing of children's rights, namely, a child's right to participation in the online environment and a child's right to safety and protection, rights that are enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Provision is made for that in section 29.<br\/><br\/>As regards preventive or counselling services provided for children, subsection (2) clarifies that such services are excluded from the scope of Article 8.  The legal advice available to the Department points to the risks of attempting any definition of such services.  Any inadvertent exclusions could risk the termination of preventive or counselling services already being provided for the benefit of children under 13 years.<br\/><br\/>I fully support the recommendation of the joint Oireachtas committee for consultation with children in regard to data protection measures.  Article 57 of the GDPR requires data protection authorities, such as the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, to promote public awareness and understanding of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in regard to data processing, and it states activities addressed specifically to children must receive specific attention.  Adequate consultation with children in regard to the content of such activities will be necessary and appropriate.<br\/><br\/>I also support the committee's recommendation that education programmes be implemented to assist children in exercising their data protection and digital rights.  In this context, I want to draw attention to the webwise initiative <i>webwise.ie<\/i>, operated by the Professional Development Service for Teachers, which promotes online awareness and safety objectives.  My Department provides funding to <i>webwise.ie<\/i>and I am working with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, on the broader issue of child safety online.<br\/><br\/>Article 23 of the GDPR makes provision for possible restrictions on the exercise of data subject rights in order to safeguard the important objective of general public interest, some of which restrictions are set out in paragraph 1.  It specifies that such restrictions must comply with three conditions: they must be in a legislative measure; they must respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals; and they may not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society.<br\/><br\/>The need to apply restrictions on the exercise of data subject rights might arise, for example, where a regulatory body, such as the Legal Services Regulatory Authority or the Medical Council, is examining a complaint regarding fitness to practice or an allegation of improper conduct.  It could also arise where the Health and Safety Authority is investigating a workplace accident.  The objective in such cases is not to set aside permanently the data protection rights of individuals concerned but, rather, to protect the investigation or examination from access requests or requests for rectification or erasure of personal data so that the investigation or examination can be brought to a conclusion and appropriate action can be taken.<br\/><br\/>Section 54 of the Bill provides for appropriate restrictions in order to safeguard a range of important objectives of general public interest, such as avoiding obstructions to any official or legal inquiry, investigation or process.  Such public-interest objectives also include Cabinet confidentiality, judicial independence, parliamentary privilege and legal privilege.  Any such restrictions must be set out in law or in regulations under subsections (6), (7) and (8), and the regulations must comply with subsection (10), which requires one to respect the essence of the right to data protection, and restrict the exercise of data subject rights only in so far as is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society.  Similar safeguards apply in the case of restrictions on data subject rights under Part 5.  These are provided for in section 89. <br\/><br\/>Article 57 of the GDPR confers a broad range of corrective powers and sanctions on the data protection authorities, including the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  These range from issuing warnings or reprimands to ordering public or private bodies to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights and to bring their data-processing operations into line with data protection law.  The commission will also have the power to impose a temporary or permanent ban on non-compliant processing operations.  Data transfers to third countries may be suspended if data protection standards applicable there are considered inadequate by the European Union.  All of these corrective actions, including prohibition orders, apply equally to the public and private sectors.<br\/><br\/>Article 83 of the GDPR provides for the imposition of administrative fines for infringements, including data breaches.  It states each member state may lay down the rules on whether, and the extent to which, administrative fines may be imposed on public sector bodies.  While the possibility of imposing such fines on Departments, public authorities and public bodies could have a deterrent effect, it would also reduce the funds available to such bodies for the provision of important services to the public.  Any deficit arising from the payment of fines would be likely to lead to demands for replacement funding by means of a supplementary budget.  This could result in a wasteful, circular flow of funding.  On the other hand, the Government recognises that non-application of administrative fines could create competition distortions in those areas in which public and private bodies operate in the same market, for example, public and private hospitals, and public and private transport providers.<br\/><br\/>To ensure fair and equitable trading conditions, section 136 of the Bill provides that administrative fines may be imposed on public bodies when they act as &quot;undertakings&quot;, that is, when they are providing goods or services for gain in competition with private bodies.  This will ensure fair competition between the public and private sectors in the provision of goods and services.  <br\/><br\/>Part 5 of the Bill, containing sections 63 to 99, inclusive, transposes the law-enforcement directive into national law.  Chapter 1 contains relevant definitions &mdash; section 63 &mdash; and outlines the scope of this Part &mdash; section 64.  It applies to data processing carried out by public authorities and bodies for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, including the safeguarding against, and the prevention of, threats to public security or the execution of criminal penalties.  While it will apply in the main to bodies operating within the criminal justice system, its provisions will also apply to administrative bodies such as the Health and Safety Authority and others authorities, such as fire authorities, when they are engaged in the investigation and prosecution of offences.<br\/><br\/>Chapter 2 contains provisions outlining the general principles of data protection.  I refer to section 65.  The principles are broadly similar to those in the GDPR.  Also outlined are the following: the need for adequate security measures in section 66; conditions applicable to the processing of special categories of personal data in section 67; and standards applicable to data quality in section 68.<br\/><br\/>Chapter 3 outlines the obligations on controllers and processors when acting within the scope of Part 5.  These are broadly similar to obligations set out in Part 4 of the GDPR, including: the need for appropriate security standards; reporting of data breaches to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner; the need for contracts with processors; the carrying out of data protection impact assessments; and, in certain cases, mandatory consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  Section 76 imposes a specific requirement on controllers and processors to create and maintain data logs, which must record consultation and disclosures of data in automated processing systems.  All public authorities and bodies must designate a data protection officer.<br\/><br\/>Chapter 4 specifies the data protection rights of individuals.  These include rights in regard to automated decision-making, section 84; the right to information, section 85; the right of access, section 86; and the right to erasure and rectification of personal data, section 87.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Section 89 outlines the grounds on which the exercise of data subject rights under this Part may be restricted in whole or in part.

I wish to thank the joint committee for its work and recommendations, many of which have been taken on board in the Bill before us today.  I have already referred to a number of areas where it has not been possible to adopt the committee's recommendations.  I also take this opportunity to thank the many other stakeholders for their inputs into the preparation of this legislation.<\/p><p>As I mentioned at the outset, this is a lengthy Bill and it also complex legislation.  That should not obscure its central purpose, which is to promote and facilitate the exercise of our rights as individuals to protection of our personal data and to increase our control over it and the uses to which it may be put.  Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights provides simply that \"[e]veryone has the right to protection of personal data concerning him or her\".  The GDPR and this Bill seek to make that a reality.  I, therefore, commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#O01000","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>That was a <i>tour de force<\/i>.

Second Stage is being taken this week and despite the requests of a number of leaders of groups in the House, Committee Stage is being taken next week.  While a briefing on it may be taking place on Monday, given the length, significance and detail in this Bill, that is not a sufficient or appropriate length of time to ensure proper oversight of it by us as Senators and for us to have a proper opportunity to work together and with the Minister and his Department around a constructive amendment process.  Nonetheless, we will be tabling a number of amendments.  It is a pity we will not have a better process in that regard.<\/p> <p>The GDPR, as the Minister outlined, is both best practice and its adoption is a legal obligation on the part of the State.  It is deeply concerning that the legislation that has been brought before this House does not fully reflect either best practice nor legal obligations.  It is concerning that it has not incorporated, as the Minister acknowledged, many of the substantial important recommendations made by the committee during the pre-legislative stage.<\/p> <p>The Bill crucially seeks to make exemptions for the State in respect of fines.  In this the State is contravening good practice and the strong recommendation of both experts and the EU regulation.  I note with concern that where there is a question of commercial concern, the undertaking question is dealt with, but is that to be of less concern, of less merit in terms of fines than the rights of individuals and their rights to their privacy?  It is notable that we address the concerns of business in this regard but we do not address the concerns of individuals and their right to see a full and appropriate response to situations where their data are mishandled or breached.  We do not have the important deterrent that needs to be there, bearing in mind that any moneys collected in fines are returned to the Exchequer and, therefore, they are not a loss to the State.  It is unfortunate we are not placing that important imperative in terms of an individual's privacy on our public bodies.<\/p> <p>Individuals will still have the right to seek material and non-material damages through the courts, and I am sure many of them will.  If we have situations, for example, where 1,000 or 2,000 individuals suffer a breach in terms of their data, 1,000 or 2,000 cases may go through the courts.  Aside from the pressures that may place on our courts system, there is also a very real concern.  It is not appropriate that we, as a State, should consistently rely on individuals who may simply wish to identify a poor practice and have it dealt with but who would have only the courts as their key source of recourse in that regard.  We are relying on individuals yet again to correct mistakes that we should be identifying at the legislative point.<\/p> <p>However, a more serious concern is the exemptions which the State seems to make in terms of data processing.  It is not only bad practice but is regarded by many legal experts as potentially illegal and leaves us open to potential EU court cases and penalisation.  This will not be allowed to pass.  This was made to the clear to the Department of Justice and Equality, and it was outlined during the pre-legislative scrutiny stage, but the Department has chosen to ignore this guidance and plough ahead with what is flawed in that regard.<\/p> <p>In 2015, in the Bara case, the European Court of Justice found the Romanian Government to be in breach of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the data protection directive.  The fact that the Romanian state was compliant with its own Romanian legislation did not exempt it from facing sanction by the European Court of Justice.  That is why the legislation we pass on data protection needs to be fully compliant with European law.  There is not a middle ground where we can produce law which gives us, individuals or states, other options.  That is also a very important issue here.  The Minister mentioned the question of proportionate in the context of the GDPR, and it is a key point.  There is no clear test of what is proportionate within the legislation.  We need to have clear guidance as to what is a proportionate use of an individual's data in any situation.<\/p> <p>Another important recommendation from the committee was that the GDPR and the data protection legislation should be the comprehensive means of dealing with this area.  It would mean repealing a number of earlier Acts.  As the Minister pointed out, the GDPR requires clear and accessible information in terms of legislation.  We discussed at the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection earlier the fact that the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, which has been amended numerous times, does not meet the test of clarity in terms of an individual's privacy.  That is also an issue that will arise.<\/p> <p>Data protection is a hugely important and crucial area for the State to address.  We debated at the joint committee earlier the issue of the public services card, the single customer view database and the issues of data protection in that respect.  There are increasingly more examples of how individuals' and collective data uses can lead to great damage.  We have seen significant breaches in that regard.  For example, there was a situation in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection recently where people's individual data were being sold for &euro;27.  Of course, that was a criminal act and has been appropriately treated.  The joint committee heard about the case of an individual who had her pension withheld because she required and insisted on having the legal basis for her being obliged to get a public services card.  That case was taken forward but the State then withdrew from it because it realised it could not adequately prove that legal basis.  That is a serious concern and it is still not appropriate that individuals have to challenge and bring forward such cases.  Let us try to address that issue at the outset.<\/p> <p>Given the spirit underpinning the GDPR, when the Data Protection Commissioner, whose responsibility will intensify - that responsibility is deeply important and, as the Minister said, crucial to Ireland's compliance with the GDPR - indicated concern and initiated a section 10 investigation into the public services card, it was extremely concerning that the State ploughed ahead with making it obligatory in many areas, including potentially for people to access college, by denying them Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants.  Those are very serious issues and contravene the spirit underpinning the GDPR.<\/p> <p>I reiterate those points to stress we must take this issue very seriously.  We will be putting forward amendments on Committee Stage.  I regret we have not been given the time required for dealing with this legislation but I am sure we will have Committee Stage sittings to deal with it further.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for his input.  I also thank all the Members for obliging me by allowing me to contribute at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#S00500","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  I will start with the concluding paragraph of his report to us.  He knows better than anyone else that this is very complex legislation, but, at the end of the day, it is both important and necessary.  As he says, it is lengthy and complex.  I acknowledge the Oireachtas Library and Research Service which has provided a very comprehensive digest on the Bill.  I acknowledge its amazing support of the work we do in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  <\/p> <p>The Minister touched on a number of issues and spoke about acknowledging the work done in the pre-legislative scrutiny process and adopting many recommendations arising from it.  From the digest we know that 12 of the 18 recommendations made were not included in the Bill.  It is very important work, if the Minister has not seen it.  I do not propose to read all 18 recommendations, although I see the Minister has the digest; I never doubted that he was one of the wiser men.  That assists me because I can refer to the relevant pages of the digest.  A red light was given to 12 of the 18 recommendations made.  I do not propose to read all of them, but I want to draw the Minister's attention to two.<\/p> <p>Recommendation No. 14, on page 16, deals with administrative fines.  It states: \"The Committee recommends that fines be administered to public bodies in breach of the new data protection legislation, where appropriate, to encourage compliance with data protection provisions in the new legislation\".  The second recommendation to which I wish to refer is No. 15 which is critical and deals with the right to receive compensation.  I am not in the business of slapping people on the wrist - I do not think the Minister is either - and saying they have been bad and should not do something again, but there have to be sanctions.  If this is to be meaningful, they have to apply across the board.  I know the differences between the various authorities, on which I will touch, but recommendation No. 15 is: \"The Committee recommends that an explicit right to compensation be outlined in the new legislation for breaches of data protection provisions.  A consultation with the DPC, Office of the Attorney General, the European Commission could assist in the drafting of such a provision\".<\/p> <p>They are two reasonable and effective ways to deal with issues.  I am aware of the subtle difference in the public authorities as defined in the legislation, which definition includes Ministers, Departments, regional assemblies, local authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and persons holding office established by statute.  Are we saying those holding very sensitive information will not be subject to monetary sanctions?  Will there be no compensation if there are breaches?  If that is what the Bill states, it has huge shortcomings which I want to confirm.  As the Minister knows, I am a member of the Independent group in the Seanad.  We will bring forward a series of amendments based on this.  The legislation, not me or the Minister, defines public bodies as State-owned companies formed under the Companies Act 2014 or its predecessors.  There is a difference between public authorities and public bodies.  I flag this as a concern because many public bodies hold extremely sensitive information and if they go wrong, how will we sanction them?  That is a really important issue.<\/p> <p>On the processing of special categories of personal data, what I call sensitive personal data, although the word \"sensitive\" is not used, there is always the issue of consent, which is very important.  Chapter 2 in Part 3 of the Bill, sections 39 to 49, inclusive, provides details of the rules for the processing of special categories of personal data, defined under section 2.  As previously noted, these categories include data which identify a person's racial origin, political or religious views, genetic data and sexual orientation or activities.  We need to look at that issue and be careful  It highlights the sensitivity of certain data which are being kept.<\/p> <p>The Bill goes on to talk about exemptions.  Data collected by political parties, office holders, candidates or bodies in the course of elections are exempt.  The Minister will be familiar with what is called a marked register which  politicians can seek.  What can we glean from a marked register?  There are many assumptions, but we can tell if there is only one person registered in a home.  Therefore, it does not take much to say Mary Bloggs is female if she is the only person in a home.  The cumulative effect of bringing all of these data and political affiliations together is highly sensitive and they could be abused.  I would like to think that, when bringing forward legislation, we would bring forward legislation on how we conduct ourselves as politicians.  At some point in the future I want to home in on the data held by politicians for electoral registers.  Can a person opt in or opt out?  There are certain areas and categories out of which a person can opt out and certain ones out of which he or she cannot do so.  That goes from the top of this House to the bottom and relates to how we deal with our own data in the Oireachtas.  We need to get it right and be clear.  We need to reassure people outside on how we are handling those data in a responsible fashion.  I am not saying we are not but that we need to focus on it.  If we are bringing forward legislation, we need to bring it forward for everybody and be fully compliant with it.<\/p> <p>I have covered the issue of public bodies and local authorities.  I am not happy with that provision which we could strengthen.  I will not go on at length because I am conscious and have already told the Minister that we will bring forward amendments, but I want to work with him, which is very important.  It is a matter of getting it right and having good legislation.  The Taoiseach said last week that he wanted Senators to be actively involved in polishing and being active in dealing with amending legislation.  He saw it as a critical role in our work here and I agree with him.  I thank the Minister's Department for agreeing to have its representatives come to Leinster House next Monday for a briefing on aspects of the Bill.  That is helpful because it will help Members to understand it.  It is complex legislation which I want to support in principle.<\/p> <p>The Minister makes the valid point that Article 8 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights provides simply for everyone having the right to protection of personal data.  I agree and hope he will consider accepting some amendments.  This legislation is necessary, but it has to be equal across all sectors of society.  I will wrap up by saying we must have sanctions for everyone involved.  There must be no exemptions in the imposition of fines and sanctions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#T00100","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I think we all agree that the legislation is very complex.

Many data belonging to people are held electronically compared to what the position was 30 or 40 years ago when there was an entirely different scenario and set of circumstances when it was effectively a paper trail.  Now many things are computerised.  Computer systems can cross-reference data at a tap of a button.  Information can now be procured extremely quickly.  This legislation is being brought forward for a good reason.  It is being brought forward in order that we can comply with our obligations as a member of the European Union and to citizens.  Data collection and assembly are now big business and many people are employed in the area, in which  many companies make money both in the collection and dissemination of data.  Therefore, the legislation is long overdue.<\/p> <p>I am concerned about how the legislation will affect not just political parties since many involved in political parties are volunteers but also sports organisations, community groups and individuals who donate millions of hours a week on a voluntary basis and who include children, youth, sportspeople and others.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have some limited knowledge of what the GAA has been endeavouring to do to comply with future legislation in this area.  It seems to be on the money.  I had a discussion with Se&aacute;n Kelly, MEP, on this issue.  He has recommended that other political and community groups look at what the GAA is doing in this area and the safeguards and protections it is putting in place.  I have no doubt it is still learning but it seems to be well ahead of many other organisations.  There is not an evening when community groups throughout the country are not being briefed or doing training on data protection.  A month or six weeks ago there was a big conference in Croke Park at which a lot of community groups and volunteers became aware of data protection.  <\/p><p>I look forward to Committee Stage.  Our role in the House is to strengthen legislation to ensure there is a fair and equitable distribution of requirements and obligations.  I heard what the Minister said about fines, enforcement and sanctions.  There is merit in it and I look forward to hearing the arguments on Committee Stage.  There is a lot in this Bill to get one's head around in terms of the various aspects and requirements.  The opt-outs are there for particular reasons and the Minister has shed some light on it in his contribution.  We have a lot of work to do on the Bill.  I suspect Committee Stage will last many hours but ultimately we have an obligation to pass the Bill.  It is necessary because there have been too many breaches of people's data rights.  Too many of our citizens have been exposed as a result of breaches of data.  We owe it to our citizens in this world of ICT to protect them and ensure the correct protocols, procedures and protections are in place.  <\/p><p>I thank the Minister for an enlightening and detailed contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#T00600","speaker":"1416","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and assure him we will try to work constructively and positively with him and his officials on what is at its heart very important legislation.  We will table a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  The Minister will expect me to reiterate comments made by colleagues on the speed with which the legislation has come to Second Stage.  There has only been a week between its publication and this Stage of the Bill.  It is not the optimal way of dealing with legislation and important and substantial issues.  That has been said so I will not over-egg the pudding but it is an issue that merits being mentioned.<\/p><p>I support Senator Conway in his request in regard to the briefing on Monday.  If there is an opportunity, the Minister might explore the possibility of it happening on a sitting day.  <\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose the passage of the Bill to Committee Stage.  We acknowledge there is a need to complete this work by 25 May but we have some serious reservations regarding significant sections of the Bill.  We are not alone in that.  If they are not addressed we may not support the passage of the Bill into law.  In particular we are concerned about the far-reaching exemptions in section 54.  In that section, the Minister has allowed himself a ministerial power which we do not believe would pass the proportionality test set out in the landmark case on delegated powers in Cityview Press <i>v<\/i>. An Chomhairle Oili&uacute;na.<\/p><p>The Bill partially emanates from the general data protection regulation, GDPR, which is a regulation through which the European Parliament, the Council of Europe and the European Commission attempt to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals in the European Union.  The general data protection regulation is essentially a minimum standard expected of each member state on the threshold and rights afforded to citizens of member states and the data protection of individuals within those states.  Much of it has direct effect.  Some elements require legislation as there is a margin of appreciation in how jurisdictions apply them.  The age of digital consent, which can be 18, is 13 in this legislation, which we welcome, as all young people's advocacy groups do.  <\/p><p>Some of the Bill relates not to the regulation but to a related directive.  Ireland has not been in compliance with EU data retention law since the Tele2-Watson case, which is significant.  We have been in breach of EU law since late 2016.  I am not entirely sure - the Minister might refer to it - whether this legislation rectifies that.  We have observed one of the pitfalls in the protection of data protection officers from the interference of a data controller who aims to suppress a release of information on the basis that despite its release being in the public interest, it is not in the interest of a data controller for a variety of reasons that anyone can imagine.  The lack of protections or avenues for addressing these concerns for such an officer is an oversight and a flaw in the Bill and the general data protection regulation.  As recently as yesterday my party met with officials from the Minister's office and although they pointed to general law having already covered the potential for this, it would be beneficial for specific protections to be explicitly stated in this context.  Committee Stage is the optimal time to deal with them.  <\/p><p>The manner of the drafting is not ideal or clear.  After the Bill has been passed, there will be a need to consult three Acts, the general data protection regulation and any other relevant European instruments in order to be aware of the legal position.  It would have been better, clearer and more comprehensible for the provisions of the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003, which are still required, to have been put into this Bill and for those Acts to have been repealed in their entirety.  There is potential for confusion and possible litigation.<\/p><p>Another gap is that the Bill does not include the requirement under Article 81 of the directive that not-for-profit groups can bring actions on behalf of data subjects.  The general data protection regulation also envisaged a form of multi-party action akin to a class action but there is nothing on it in this Bill.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Multi-Party Actions Bill, which would cover it in a wider sense, goes to pre-legislative scrutiny in two weeks.  I hope the Minister will get a money message so it can proceed to enactment as soon as possible.  It will be relevant not only from a data protection point of view but also in a number of areas including the tracker mortgages injustices.  Significantly, it has disregarded the recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on section 136(3), under which the Government is still trying to exempt public bodies from fines for breaching data protection rights of citizens.  <\/p><p>I will not indulge in repetition.  This is vast and very important legislation.  We approach it with a positive and co-operative frame of mind and I hope we have responsible and co-operative engagement on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#U00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I appreciate the comprehensive nature of the Minister's speech.

While most people will have questions about setting the age of consent at 13 years, from listening to media reports and the Minister's comments on the offices and bona fides of those who arrived at this age threshold, I believe it is difficult to argue with their rationale.  We will also focus on this area.<\/p><p>On the political aspects of the issue, if we were honest about the way we use data, we could have a highly illuminating conversation.  Reference was made to the marked register, which is data that all politicians who have their heads screwed on use to their benefit.  The register shows who has voted and in which election or referendum they voted.  When we visit a house we then know that X, Y or Z person registered at the address voted in the previous election or referendum.  The data and knowledge available to people in authority and those with influence must be regulated.  We need to be comfortable with this and people need to know that this information is readily available.  However, we are in the middle of a digital age which will only gather pace.  It will be a serious challenge for parliamentarians and legislators to keep up with it.<\/p><p>The Labour Party will do its best to be of assistance with the legislation.  I genuinely appreciate the efforts the Minister and his officials are making.  In the years ahead, it will be necessary to amend the legislation many times to make it more relevant.  &Eacute;amon De Valera once spoke of being terrified by the advent of television.  I am genuinely terrified by technology, even though I use it every day and it offers the potential to make much money.  However, children can also be damaged, hurt, humiliated and worse because of the age in which we live.  I know the Minister appreciates that.  With the support of Senators from across the House, we will get the best possible legislation for the citizens of this country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#U00300","speaker":"1410","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their contributions and I am grateful for the broad support the Bill has received in the Seanad.  I acknowledge that there are issues to which we will have to return on Committee Stage.  I note, in particular, the comments of Senator Higgins and hope, in the spirit of being constructive, to return, at an appropriate time, to any issues Senators agree could constitute an improvement to the Bill.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the contribution of Senator Boyhan who referred to the briefing note available to parliamentarians through the Oireachtas Library and Research Service in the form of a digest.  I acknowledge the importance of the service to parliamentarians, in particular in respect to this legislation, much of which is technical in nature.  I was struck by the interest shown by an Independent Senator in the matter of the marked register.  It underscores that Senator Boyhan could be described as giving due notice to the electorate of D&uacute;n Laoghaire or elsewhere. <\/p> <p>Senator Conway referred to the briefing arranged for early next week.  Monday, as a non-sitting day, was considered an appropriate time.  Realising that it will not be possible to accommodate everybody on this issue, I hope the availability of my officials to deal with the technical aspects of the Bill will accommodate interested parties in any event and include as many of them as possible.  I believe we can do that. <\/p> <p>A number of Senators referred to certain exemptions under the Bill and the issue of class actions.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile referred specifically to the issue of data retention, which is not covered by the legislation, nor was the Bill designed to cover the issue.  There is, however, a specific data retention Bill which is, I understand, subject to pre-legislative scrutiny.  The concerns the Senator raises may be more appropriately directed to that Bill.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan referred to the recommendations of the joint committee, in particular, to those that have not been followed to the letter, rather than those that have been followed to the letter.  The actions under data protection set out in sections 112 and 113 respond to recommendation 14 on the matter of the right to compensation to which the Senator referred. <\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in indicated that, owing to ongoing advances in technology and cyberspace, it will be necessary to keep the legislation under review.  In this instance, it is important that Ireland, as an active and constructive member of the European Union, complies with its obligations and that we ensure we have legislation enacted and in force within the specified timeframe.  I have no doubt this is an area to which we will return in the context of ensuring we strike a balance between citizens' entitlement to the preservation of privacy and personal data and overall freedom of information and expression.<\/p> <p>I hope we will resume our deliberations on the Bill in the coming weeks, the object of the exercise being that we introduce stronger rules and regulation on the protection of data to ensure we and our citizens are in a position to exercise more control over our personal data and businesses can operate on the basis of a level and even playing field.  I am in the hands of the Business Committee as to when such future deliberations will take place.  However, I stress the urgency of this issue and, having regard to the technical provisions and nature of much of the Bill, my officials and I will be keen to assist Senators in their deliberations at every remove.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#V00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518085800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":174,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#W00150","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#W00175","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518085800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 13 February 2018.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#W00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1518085800,"counter":178,"content":"<p>At 2.30 p.m. next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020800002#W00400","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518085800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 2 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 13 February 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
